"Overwhelming work load, 100 plus pages of reading plus videos plus vocal each week, his rants go off topic and have little to do with what is on the test. He is insensitive to the beliefs of others, rips bibles during lecture, and talks a lot about his personal life. The tests are over 100 points and graded harshly. DO NOT TAKE HIM. It's not worth.",0
"Tends to stray from the actual class material on a regular basis. Doesn't really focus on what we actually need to learn from the test. VERY IMPORTANT: She gives MANY surprise quizzes, NO warning, so read every little handout before class or she'll get you. Probably the biggest issue is grading and test preparation. She's unclear with expectations.",0
He is a great professor! He really enjoys teaching and is very clear about what you need to study. His tests are tough. Homework and other activities keep your grade up. Highly recommend taking him for Spanish!,1
"Great professor that offers clear guidance, good feedback, and more concerned with the content of a paper or essay.  Would not hesitate to take another class with this professor!",1
"95% of the information required to write the papers he requires must be found out of your own, unguided research. He spends long periods of classes on a single myth, or plays a long video that is sparse with pertinent information. What your grade comes down to is how infallible (by his standards) is your fatiguing amount of independent research.",0
"Professor Harvey is pretty easy-going, but be prepared to read every day. The classes are not boring since they mostly focus on in depth discussions on the readings. There are two major papers which are basically literary analyses. There are quizzes every class over the assigned readings.",1
Very slow lectures that give you no idea how you're doing in the class until it's too late to change your grade.,0
Honestly a great guy. He genuinely wants you to do good. Sometimes it feels like she cares more than the students. He gives curves and his lectures aren't boring. He's funny and makes sure you really understand. Great person. I would definitely take him again.,1
"Very good during lecture, but not a very nice person. Gives a reasonable amount of homework and but is not very nice or approachable to students in his department... including his own grad students. Picks out kids during lecture and hassles them for the entire semester. I never had a problem with him personally, but I really didn?t like how he trea",1
"Only take him Only if you absolutely DO NOT HAVE any other choice, if you do have  choices , please take somebody else. Stay away from this guy, he doesn't help at all.",0
"Dr. Summers knows his history, but I found his lectures to be very confusing. His lectures tell history like it is a story, which I really hated. Also, we were assigned four books to read which was very extra and attendance was mandatory. If you do everything to get you the participation points, you will easily get an A.",0
"she is terrible! she doesn't explain anything, shes not helpful at all and shes not very nice either. instead of explaining the homework and answering questions, she just reassigns the homework and ignores questions. she is terrible, get out of this class if you can!!",0
Professor Odle is one of the sweetest professors you'll ever have. I don't know how she is when teaching in person but she made class optional as an online instructor and encouraged group work for her weekly chapter quizzes. The class contains interesting material and she answers emails quickly when you need any help. Very sweet and caring teacher.,1
She goes above and beyond for students to get their work done and pass the class. She's extremely passionate. Try not to miss a class because you do A LOT every day. She lets you make up absences. The bag you bring is quite heavy though so just be ready to carry it around with you.,1
"When I checked this website before I took the class and saw these low reviews, I thought to myself ""He can't be THIS bad, people are just overreacting"". I know now that I couldn't have been more wrong. A great guy, but an extremely insufficient teacher. Grades things completely last-minute and has little to no transparency for his students.",0
"Dr.G was a great guy, but his style of teaching just did not work for me at all. Took lots of notes on the board, so if you skip you wont get them. Rarely gives homework and sometimes puts things on the tests we never even talked about. He is eager to help if you email him, though.",1
"He is an okay professor. He is very quiet. Good thing is he gives homework but not as a grade but instead as bonus and its based off effort. The class was hard to me , but then again I hate math. Lastly if you do all the homework you can raise you're grade by 2 letter grades. I should of had a D., but because I did all the homework I got a B.",0
Very fun prof. Only weekly quizzes that are easy and based on slides. Group project is included. He's very hilarious and a fun class. Definitely would recommend,1
"Well, if you're worried about passing or failing english 4 with him, don't worry. If you do the work you'll pass, but if you want good feedback or expect to actually learn something in class, you won't. He likes to talk more about his life and rant about politics. His main lesson is that liberals are always right and conservatives are all idiots.",0
"Bruce is obviously intelligent, well thought out, and knows what he wants you to get out of his classes. Having Bruce as a professor will give you a huge advantage in all of your classes. Very personable, friendly, and likable. Great guy to know.",1
"If you are passionate about econ, don't take this guy, he drains all the ""fun"" out of th subject. There are no positives about this guy besides the clicker points. Go to class, get every clicker point. I missed one class with three clicker points and that is what prevented me from getting a higher letter grade, three points, and he didn't raise it.",0
"Listen, I'm not one to dislike many professors, but I honestly really dislike her. If you can avoid Yana Sandlers, please do at any and every cost. Not only did her lectures not make sense, if you asked her a question, she just reworded your question into an ""answer"". She does not know what she's doing.",0
he is very tough grader and not to be taken chances with him . i guess he should be out put some work in assignment .12 pages question paper. dnt goo for it. he will runie your life,0
"Professor Simons class really made for a fun semester. I took this class to fill an ""upper level econ"" requirement and it was surprisingly interesting. The material can be confusing to game theory new comers, but Prof Simons does his best to make sure everyone gets it. Tests can be a tiny bit tricky so pay attention to wording and use study guides!",1
Dalmia is pretty great. Her tests and assignments are graded tough however if you go to class and take part in the discussion she will round your grade at the end of the semester. She likes to give you an overall grade that reflects the effort you put into the course and not just the overall result your exams gave you which is awesome.,1
"Kramer is a nice guy and a great prof. He doesn't post his powerpoints so you'll have to take notes, but that will help in the long run. Gives 5 exams spread out over 15 or so chapters, the final is cumulative but very general. You'll learn a lot of practical info from this course that'll far exceed the classroom. Everyone should take this class!",1
"This guy is unclear, rude and incredibly boring! Every once in a while he says things that'll make the whole class laugh cuz of how ridiculous they sound; prepare to get nothing from class and simply learn all of the material on your own! For the exams it's always good to base all of your studying on the homeworks!",0
"If you have any interest in studying Political Science, stay away from this professor as she does not teach it. Lois' teaching style is to espouse her own views and belittle yours. Grades are given willy-nilly with contradictory feedback which all but guarantee a stifled learning experience. Steer very clear of this one, fellow students.",0
"Grade teacher but
 He ALWAYS makes mistakes in his slides. Everyday, there is like 5-6 mistakes.",1
"YOU DONT LEARN!!! RUUUUUNNNNNNN, RUDE GUY, DONT ASK QUESTIONS, YOU WIL LOOK STUPID. DO YOURSELF A FAV...",0
Very disorganized professor. Made a lot of errors in the tests and her slideshow presentations. Unclear grading and did not teach the material for the class very well. Relied on the textbook heavily which was very poorly written. Take this class if you wish to self learn and watch YouTube videos to learn the material. Sometimes gave out pop quizzes,0
"Professor Connolly is a great professor. The topics taught for the Disney class is enjoyable&interesting so it made it easier to pay attention to the material. Take notes in the class and watch the videos and movies required if you wanna pass. She drops the lowest test grade. Overall very easy class, especially if you love Disney.",1
"Mr.Pryor is definitely one of my favs on campus! He's super chill & easy to talk to. And, if you need any help he's always there for you. Keep up with the reading bc there are quizzes but, super easy. Essays aren't that hard as long as you follow the instructions; plus he proof reads it for you a couple times before you actually turn it in.",1
as long as you pay attention and go to office hours you'll do fine,1
"Brilliant professor, encouraging adviser.  Lectures are clear and insightful.  Be careful to keep up with the classwork though.  His papers and exams are tough.",1
His lectures were dry and tough to understand.  He wasn't helpful outside of class either.  The tests were pretty easy though.,0
"Not only does Adrianne lead a miserable life, but she will make yours miserable too.  She is extremely stubborn and won't own up to her mistakes.  Her opinions are all that matter to her, which proves that she isn't a deep thinker.  Avoid taking classes from her!",0
"A really hard guy, but clear and helpful. The best I had during all my years at university here in England and France",1
"Professor Anderson loves to talk. She will want you to participate. She does talk about current events often and she shows movies a lot. She does not really assign work, but you do have to turn in analysis's of the movies. Read the book, you'll wish you had later on.",1
"We never got half of our homeworks back, and never revieved the grades for our midterm. He knows his stuff, but is too subjective for a physics teacher.  There were only 10 in the class, and I don't think he kept a gradebook. Outside of class he is very nice and helpful. The book for the class was no where near sufficient.",1
Doesn't really teach most of the material in the course and basically hands you answers and lets you figure it out on your own. His lectures are usually only a half hour and then he would often disappear from the class. Mostly a self-teaching class.,1
The most interesting class I attended throughout the entire program.,1
"worst professor i have ever had. absolutely no help in office hours, hard grader, extremely particular, and harshly criticizes everything you write without any encouragement. tears students down, interrupts them, and judges them for wrong answers. ",0
I wish he could give more examples in his lectures! Tries really hard though to assist people in tutorials.,0
"I've taken 2 classes with Professor Wheeler and I absolutely love her and her teaching style. This isn't another boring history with memorization, it will make you think critically about history. The TA's are also very helpful in and out of class. Attendance is mandatory though.",1
Horrible prof. 40% of mark was based on discussion posts that were clearly not read and lost marks due to length of responses regardless of the content. Impossible to get in contact with (I've been waiting on an email response for 3 weeks). Doesn't seem the slightest bit qualified and actually says a fair bit of factually inaccurate statements.,0
"Favorite professor of the semester. The guy is like a walking textbook, knows Russian history like the back of his hand. Taking notes is a must to do well. Fair grader. Worth getting up to take this class.",1
Don't expect to do good if this is not your major. You definetly need a piano the exams are extremely hard and the assignments are too advanced for mus 101.  All homework is not explained in class and you have to research in class. Most homeworks are very irrelevant to the coarse and what she teaches. ,0
He's just awful. Try anything you can to not have this guy.,0
"I am so lucky to have her class last semester. I really enjoyed her class and learned a lot despite a difficult course. She has a lot of teaching experience, and she explain difficult concept easily. She is very knowledgeable and nice professor. Highly recommend her as your professor.",1
"The reviews are accurate. His rating would be lower than a 3 but if you scroll down you'll see he must've encouraged his students a few years ago to leave positive ratings on the 1st day of class. Unorganized, unreasonable, doesn't care that students are busy with other class or their personal lives. If he's the only option wait until next semester",0
"He never responds to emails, and is very rude when you email and ask a question. He thinks his class is the only class ur taking and is the most important class. He should be fired in my opinion especially during covid he is not helping people. He expects too much out of a UCC course. DO NOT TAKE HIM. I did everyhting that was required but got a c",0
"I would never come on this site, but this guy is horrible. Literally the worst at teaching out of any teacher I have had in any class. Gives hard tests, you can't hear him speak. Gives an extra credit assignment that does so little for your grade you might as well not do it. DONT TAKE HIS CLASS!!!!",0
Dr. Heilman is very knowledgeable in the subject and wants you to succeed. If you can not write fast I wouldnt recommend because she talks for the entirety of the course and does not post notes/slides. Office hours are very useful and gives great feedback if you go talk to her but not much written on the papers itself.,1
"Dale is an awesome person and a wonderful interpreter. He knows his stuff, but his classes are terribly structured. He spends most of class completely off topic. Also, when finals week came around he had only gotten around to grading one of the assignments from the entire semester. Very frustrating to have him in charge of your grades.",0
"Nice but directions are INCREDIBLY unclear, I was stressed out every single class from all of the little assignments that pop up out of no where, he has one major assignment due at the end of the semester on a program thats only available in that classroom but never gives you time to work on it & takes forever to grade, just avoid his class.",0
"I really liked this creative writing class, Prof Wyngarden gave great feedback on everyones work and the material was actually useful. At the end of the class i actually wanted to keep my textbook. One thing: she doesnt fool around about the attendance policy... if you show up late too many times or dont show up there are consequences.",1
"boring class, but exams are easy. You only need to memorize his powerpoint.",1
Tough grader when it comes to papers and exams. Not as strict as the other reviews say(maybe cause I have/had him as an adjunct prof). Has chapter outlines that are easy to follow and everything covered will be on the quizzes(15 questions). Gives quizzes back for exam reviews. Response questions on exams are from writing assignment prompts.,0
"If you're ok with paying $600 to read research papers, this class is for you. Weekly quizzes and assignments based on a paper. Midterm and final are also on a paper. Expectations are very unclear and lectures are fast, disorganized and very little useful information is ever provided. Worst class I've attended in three years at UBCO.",0
She is actually kind of mean and impatient with students which is weird because she teaches about relationships. The difficulty level of the course is what would be expected from a university class as long as you work hard and attend.,0
I will make this simple: Dr. Sytsma does not like questions. Period. He will become confrontational with students who have questions. his lectures are not tested on therefore are of little academic consequence. I would have enjoyed this course if it were online only as I learned mostly from the book. Avoid him. It's time for retirement.,0
"Absolutely horrible professor.  This guy has absolutely no clue how to teach.  He even gave us the wrong book to read.  He talks all the time about his own life.  He also grades things crazily.  One time, he'll grade you one way, and another time, another way.  No way to predict it.  Stay away!!!",0
Morgenson is a gem and if you have the opportunityoption to have him as a professor I would 100% take it! He truly inspired me when it came to psychology and his lectures are very personal and interesting. Morgenson really cares about his students and he goes out of his way to make sure they do well! I would take his class again in a heartbeat! ,1
"Had her summer 2010 UE program, pretty weird but awesome prof.",1
"good prof. teaches well and knows his stuff. the midterms and finals may be considered hard but only because the work isnt done for it. do your work and you will do really well, the material isnt hard at all , only a continuation of high school chem",1
"Didnt seem like he cared about his students at all. Tough tests. Lecture meant nothing, pay attention to the lab assignments. Not a particularly nice guy.",0
"I sincerely took several  aspects of this class for granted, especially the production aspect. I was one of the students who felt we were doing too much in the class. Now as a teacher, I realize  every aspect of the class was relevant. Well, the professor was kind enough to award me an A- despite my failure to submit assignments timely.",1
Good teacher. Presents concepts in different ways to help different types of learners.,1
Terrible professor. Does not explain things well and he is very unorganized. This class was  a nightmare. If you wanna pass crib your whole way through it!!!!!,0
"I've tried not to form an opinion of her so quickly, but I do not like this professor.  Her lectures seem tedious; she doesn't have to throw around big words-- we all know that she has a PhD.  She comes across as self-important and condescending.  So far, I have come out of every ENGL 2200 class meeting with a headache or a stomachache.",0
Assignments/Labs/Midterms are EXACTLY the same as past years.,0
"Best teacher i've ever had at anything - amazing class, simply amazing",1
"She rushes through everything speaks really fast. If someone asks a question in class she acts like they're delaying the class. The class is actually like a review so be sure to read ahead of class just like other acct courses. If you aren't familiar with the chapter or phase out for a minute in class, you wont understand anything. Lots of bonuses!",0
"Shes the worst prof I have ever had at bsu. She doesnt care youre a college student, she doesnt care if you have to wait until pay day to buy her mandatory expensive textbook ( which she only wants you to buy bc her weak writing is included. Certainly she did not publish anything decent) shes no willing to help. She always thinks shes right",0
"Though her class is lecture heavy, she is very good at teaching. She draws out a bunch of diagrams to help you understand. The only reason why people don't pass this course is they don't memorize/study/put in the effort. I took this in the summer for 5 weeks. ASK HER FOR HELP!!! She's really nice. Thank you Dr. Yamazaki!! I learned so much!!",1
"Attendance doesn't matter. There is a quiz every week. But he words the question on test and quizes different. Homework was collected. Pay good attention in class, this isn't an easy ""A"" class but it's doable.",1
The worst teacher I have ever had at UVA. He is slow and boring. Most students took a nap in his class. He hates being challenged and he wont like you after that. Very eregant man. I had to teach everything I know about that class. I got a B but I strongly believe I would of got an A if I was a girl. My girlfriend got an A!!!!!! I thought her every,0
"Professor Abassi is one of the best professor that BMCC has. I never had a professor thats cares so much about their students futures than professor Abassi. No textbooks require, whatever she writes in the board thats what is going to be in the test. Take her you are not going to regret it.",1
"This class met once a week.  There was a lot of material to cover in that time period.  While there was a lot of lecture, questions were always accepted, both before class and by email.  Office hours were also useful for getting clarification.  He let us use class time to organize study groups as well.  ",1
"Honestly, the worst professor I've had in all of my years of school. I took his online class and whenever I emailed him to ask questions or double-check something, he would give a rude response. This is my favorite class, just wish I had a better teacher. His online class is too unorganized.",0
"Class is 2 exams, 1 assignment, ATI test, a group EBP paper& group presentation. No pop quizzes. First half of class is just lectures and not bad. Group ppt not bad, EBP graded very harshly. Email her often and ask questions+follow sample! Dr. Newton is a great lecturer, however as others have stated, follow directions on exactly what she wants.",0
"rude, would not reply back to your emails, not approachable, and makes everything harder for no reason. avoid at all costs",0
"The exams in this class are beyond impossible. Even if you read and take notes, the length, detail and layered opened ended exam questions are impossible. She never updates grades and class averages on exams are failing even after the curve. The most pointless and relentless class ever. She speaks down to you and assigns tons of busy work.",0
Life changing professor!,1
You'll have to buy extra materials and sometimes he grades hard on homework. But he'll tell you what's on the tests and help if you ask.,1
"Good prof! Very organized and very dedicated. She writes down rigorous proofs on board that are very helpful. Exams are not hard if you attend all lectures, take notes and write the assignments on your own.",1
"Mr. Lobdell is the best professor I've had! Great sense of humor, keeps class entertained and focus (we all want to hear what he has to say!), and very informative. I have learned and laughed a lot in this class. It's a shame he's retiring soon! I'm glad I got to take his class before he leaves. Overall great class and great teacher!",1
Unorganized and off topic often. Really easy class to pass. DO NOT BUY THE BOOK. A bit confusing. Watch movies discuss them. She stops the movies too much. Write 2 papers. Midterm and Final are multiple choice and essay form Over all worthless class but easy A. She is usually late. She talks to much about how she went to USC. Recommend. Good luck.,0
Dr. Howard is extremely hard to follow during his notetaking as it is almost like he enjoys hearing himself ramble about whatever he can philosophize about.  Tests are essay questions and extremely difficult and there is an enormous amount of reading assigned.  You cannot get an A in this class and most A students will probably get a C. Avoid him!!,0
"Easy A. go to class, do and turn in your work on time and you will pass this with an A. ",1
"She's a harsh grader and will fail you if you skip too often. I don't feel as though she taught us much about writing or becoming a better writer. She is very liberal and most of her assignments and lectures revolve around society and feminism. Overall, try to find another professor with more experience because her class was very disappointing.",0
"Mckean is a good teacher, he does try to help his students out. hes pretty crtical on assignments but he wants his students to succeed.",1
This course ought to be the worst online course ever I don't even know where to start banerjee doesnt provide clear expectations whatsover and is not the best lecturer she is definitely kind and all but the teaching is seriously a different story and gave me such a bad experience that ill probably fail the course,0
"If you want a teacher who knows the material like the back of his hand Kaminski is the right prof. That being said his classes can be difficult, he focuses on developing a good fundamental understanding of the material and then goes over how to apply it to various situations as opposed to memorizing different formulas and identities. ",1
"He is such a sweet guy, he really cares about his students and wants you to do well. He is really funny but he moves very fast in his lectures so it can be hard to keep up. I have had him for MEDT 360 and MEDT 404 and they were both very difficult. Do the objectives  for each exam, they take forever but all of his exam questions are from there.",1
"Great guy, but not so great teacher. Imagine going into class and listening to a lecture over something that has absolutely nothing to do with anything mentioned and then asked if you had your bearings before the lecturer decides to press on. Bottom line, I would have taken another professor had I known what I was signing up for. Still a great guy.",0
"I really love this guy. He knows his subject matter very well and is clearly passionate about it and make the class fun. His exams are indeed all short answers but really, if you study, you'll be fine. The additional papers were usually not very long, but yeah, we get tested on them. I have no problem recommending this prof to anyone.",1
"You know how every time that you sit through a boring class you hope that maybe the next one will be better? In this case, it won't. This is the worst professor at Holy Cross. He asks questions, and then answers them himself. The entire class consist of him talking, and enforcing his biased and very close-minded opinion on you. AVOID HIS CLASSES!",0
"The tests are really easy, but you have to go to class to do well. He says a lot in class that is not in the book, but are on the tests. You don't need to buy the textbook. The final project is graded very hard, so spend a lot of time on it and make sure you use a unique product. The grading on the final project brought me from an A to a B.",1
"He's a very nice teacher but he needs to change his teaching style. Using slides and sharing handouts on learn can be very helpful, but he seems to compare himself with his teachers from the old days and thinks he's doing a good job! ",0
"His lecture is really boring. You don't need to listen any lectures. Just read your his notes, which is really similar as textbook. Just read notes and hand in assignment. And his exams are fair",1
"JOHN BOYD IS A GREAT TEACHER!!! HAS A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR....HE'S A LITTLE BIT UNORGANIZED WHEN IT COMES TO TEST, BUT HE WILL GIVE FREE POINTS...I'D ADVISE YOU TO TAKE HIS CLASS. HE'S VERY EXPERIENCED AND KNOWS A GREAT DEAL OF WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.   PS. DON'T WALK OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF CLASS OR HE WILL HAVE A POP QUIZ...",1
"I am currently taking his course right now. Discussion boards are 2x/week, midterm, final and a paper. I did have to email him once about the weekly assignments which entails you reading the chap. and coming up with 3 questions and then answering the questions. The questions however cannot be surface questions. Overall I won't take him again!!",1
"Rod is an excellent professor, but this course has too much content in it which made it a challenge. The assignments are long, need to start early however, they are relatively easy considering he posts most of the content in his slides. The exams are tough and very lengthy. Overall he is very knowledgeable and willing to help. Would take again!",1
"This class is extremely difficult unless you enter the class with a prior knowledge of scripting. Hoagland is not very helpful and will tell you to look at your book for help. Explains the material as if you know everything already, do not expect an easy A. As a matter of fact, don't expect an easy B. I understood more by going to a tutor.",0
Meeting with him is pointless because you go into the office and he disagrees with everything you say. He must always be right. His classes are hard to follow because he explains the material 3 or 4 different ways. He'll give a 30 page reading then pick some obscure fact out of it to have a quiz on. Quite rude to students as well.,0
"Marge is the best teacher I've had at WSU. Friendly, funny and helpful you just need to ask for help!! Tests get harder as they go on thru the semester. Make friends to help with the online HW! Great teacher for a boring class",1
"The worst professor ever! Beyond unclear and choose favorites . she keeps you the full double period. When you ask her for help, you a have to harass her for it. Homework readings every week and well as a group project and big final assignment. DO NOT TAKE HER! She also has an attitude.",0
"Oh Sheryl, where do I begin? If you've had her, you're ready for what this class entails. However, if you haven't, get ready to be open to criticism. Papers turned into her will come back with tons of ink marks and suggestions. However, her suggestions often reflect old AP style teachings. She changes her mind and criteria a lot as well so listen.",0
"Professor Lamers is a great English professor, and one that I would highly recommend to anyone that TAKES THEIR EDUCATION SERIOUSLY. He is very knowledgeable in his field and takes it seriously, as he should. Make sure you do your work and take an interest (this isn't high school anymore, kids) or you won't pass, surprise! One of my favorite prof.",1
Literally worst experience of my life. Shouldve listened to people when they told me not to take him. I learned absolutely nothing in orgo,0
"Incredibly boring teacher, made especially worse with nearly 200 students in this Biostats class. Assignments are easy, but exams are pretty tough. I'm not learning much in class...I learn most of it from the homeworks.",0
"The reacting to the past class was interesting, but a lot more work than anticipated. You have to do a lot of reading to really understand your character.",1
"FYI:Same as Larry Light. I took the online history class, he was very bad at emailing back. I emailed him four times during the class and he didn't respond to any of them. A lot of reading, tests were in the form of an essay which he did not grade until after we had completed the next test, also did not give much feedback about past tests.",0
"Honestly, I really did not like this class. It was an unnecessary amount of homework. Proof assignments were tough and took a lot of time to complete. This class felt like a session A but for the entire semester. I took this the same semester as MAT300 and I actually preferred MAT300. The only good thing is that the exams were pretty easy.",1
"I did not enjoy this professor at all. He was funny at points but he consistently wasted at least 15 minutes talking at the beginning of class when he could be a better teacher. He was constantly distracted during class, telling stories and I think the class couldve gone a lot better if he focused more on the material then being the funny guy.",0
"This course itself is HARD, lots of cases, discussions, capsim, reports... but Cossa is great. My group members and I got fairly good grades on participation. She is very patient and nice to students.",1
"A real pain. This class was pretty horrible. Boring lectures, hard material, an annoying amount of homework. If it wasn't for the in class tutor I would have failed this course. She does give a very generous curve which is nice, but the class itself was maybe on of the worst classes I have taken.",1
Very awesome prof. Makes going to class totally enjoyable,1
"He is always available for ""help"", but he will never answer any question. He always responds with a question. There were times when I just stopped asking because it was so unhelpful. Half the questions on the test are from things he did not teach in the lectures, but expects you to know as if you were a molecular biologist.",0
I thought her lecturing was ok and clicker questions were the easiest of all the profs. Her midterm was tricky and difficult as she put one 8 point question on a diagram that she only showed for 2 seconds in lecture. Study everything! even if you think its not important!,0
"no need for textbook, but the atlas is needed. Rees has a thick accent, hard to understand at times. Quizzes are IMPOSSIBLE and the tests are borderline ridiculous. He doesn't write anything on the slide so you have to pay close attention. He's a good guy but his class is way hard for a 100 level course. NOT a GPA booster..",1
Great Professor!,1
"I am a straight A student, this class requires time to study and do homework, which there is a lot of but easy grading!She doesn't go over what to study so you have to study everything her notes are not complete.tests are pretty hard because you don't know what's on them. she is very boring but an extremely nice person. There is one presentation.",1
Norma is a great professor! She understands her students and takes the time to get to know you. The work is very easy and spaced out. She definately tells you what you need to know to be a teacher!,1
"Class was pretty easy; exam questions were right out of the book. Bi-weekly reading responses were very open ended and were basically completion grades. The only tough part was putting in the time to do mandatory research, which you're a test subject for a grad student's psych experiment. The experiments were fairly interesting though!",1
You NEED to take this professor if you have minimal interest in Statistics and/or are taking it only to fill a requirement. He made it extremely easy by only covering the basic topics in the book. Really nice guy as well. Did not mind going to class at all.,1
"Her class, the subject itself was very interesting and fun. But she is biased. She only like certain people and dislike others.",1
"I had this teacher for both Bio 140 and Bio 324. She's not very good at teaching anything as she just reads off of power points every class. She seldom gives any kind of practice before exams. Especially this last semester in quarantine she didn't do anything to help accommodate students, she gave even less instruction and basically went silent.",0
"Dr. Feikes is by far the best prof I've had yet! He really cares about what he teaches and you can tell the first time you meet him. He also has many themes when he teaches, which makes things a little more interesting. I'm glad that I have the opportunity to take another class with him! :)",1
Elizabeth meadows is the worst professor I have ever had at CMU. I had a 3.6 going into this semester and generally do really well in classes and I ended the semester with a 60%. I even went to her office hours and asked for her help and said based on my scores I wasn't trying hard enough.,0
Chuck will make you work for the grade. It is pretty clear cut-- if you want a good grade you will need to put in the work. This means revising your paper multiple times and having several peer reviewers. in the end you will become a better writer.,1
"Vraiment un bon prof, il est calme, posé et sait de quoi il parle. Il faut cependant participer en classe et rester à l'écoute quand il parle. Les examens sont faisable et représente bien la matière enseignée. Si vous l'avez, gardez-le mais allez en cours! la participation est importante",1
"This was the worst I have ever done/been graded in my life, and I do not think I am the only one to blame. First off, the only things that count towards your grade are the 2 exams and a couple impossibly hard quizzes, so if you do bad on those, you're screwed. Despite what Calvin says, you're gonna want to be a Christian to get an A in this course.",0
"Should have read these reviews before I signed up for this class.. spot on. Talks about himself and his business ventures every lecture instead of covering material, have to teach yourself. Extremely vague instructions & inconsistent due dates. Set up for failure with papers and quizzes due on the same day!",0
"SWEET person, bad professor. The readings were so boring and the assignments were so long. All 6 projects took a substantial amount of time and she talks and talks and talks and talks. You get bored. Really bored.",0
"Best professor of my academic career. He was very engaging, interesting and knowledgeable. With a wealth of practical and classroom experience it is hard to find a better communications professor anywhere in the world.",1
"I have always been at an advanced English/composition level and have always enjoyed it, but this class kinda made me hate English. Dude was a little condescending and scoffs at your opinion/response even though he asked for it. I disliked it enough to drop the course and take it with a different prof. Attendance is mandatory for sure. Not worth it",0
"Okay so mixed feelings, he is a great professor but he never returns any of your assignments ever. Yes he's easy, but i would rather work harder and actually receive my grades than not do any work. I really would not take this class again regardless of how easy it is. Be VERY VERY careful. Half the class failed last exam and there was no reason why",0
Bob is the best professor. I learned so much from him and he inspires me. A must take certainly.,1
We are only graded on tests and they aren't that hard but everyone still does bad. and he is not very sympathetic about grades. like at all. but he is nice,0
"By far the best teacher you could have, she is so nice and actually takes time to get to know her students and work with them. She is hilarious, I look froward to her class every single day. She helped me get over my fear of public speaking and would also keep me motivated the whole semester. I was really sad leaving her class",1
"Dont take any of Mercers classes!! His lectures are not helpful. The lectures are an equivalent of a table of contents, he doesnt explain anything. Youll be figuring everything out on your own. This is all on top of the fact that he is one of the most rude professors I have ever had. He could not care less about you or what might be going on.",0
"This was a class that I dreaded going to. I love poetry but this class was so boring. He is a hard grader and doesn't take the writing literally. If you do take his class keep in mind that he really likes metaphors.Also, he says class is mandatory but doesn't take attendance I would recommend going to class though.",1
He's a hard essay grader and he has kicked the entire class out of class because we didn't do the 100 pages of reading assigned for that day. Expects too much.,1
"very kind professor, and genuinely cares about his students. Reading the textbook is mandatory",1
"He is simply terrible.  If you are looking for an A, take him.  If you actually care about learning something, avoid him.  For auditing, just study for yourself.  He cannot teach a thing except for bigotry, sexism and good ol boy system.",0
"He seems like a good guy but he's a terrible professor. Hasn't updated his teaching style in probably 40 years, his tests were originally written by a type writer. He loses his train of thought really easily and rambles. You're better off going with another professor, get tutoring asap if you do have his as a prof.",0
"Absolutely the worst professor I have ever had, he relies entirely on the book he wrote. Teaches very little in class usually just touches on what you read the night before. There is a quiz about everyday and definitely an assignment each day as well",0
Tends to teach very difficult subjects. If you work hard in his class and ask for help you will learn and you will get a decent grade.,1
"She's a tough grader, but is only tough on the students to get the best out of them.",0
"Quite literally the hardest class I have EVER taken. On all his exams (normally 3 + final) low 40s are an A. Very disorganized and uploads problem sets maybe 72 hrs early if lucky. Took 2 months to get our 1st exam grades back. You'll think you understand it then get 70% of your exam wrong. Nice and passionate man, but he will rip you a new one.",0
Don't ever take this class!! rough and boring,0
"I'm taking Dr. C for GEG10 this semester. We've spent the entire semester , literally every lecture, doing math problems. This class is more like a climatology course than a physical geography course. Not only was I unprepared for such coursework, I also feel cheated because this isn't what I signed up for. At all. ",0
"Seemed like a cool guy which I think he can be, tough grader for being a non art major course. Grading criteria not clear and gives feedback at the last minute.",0
"AMAZING. Prof is extremely knowledgeable, patient, helpful, interesting, and has a great sense of humour. Take this class!",1
Great teacher when he shows up to class prepared. Love his class but feel like sometimes we don't really talk about anything. Not very clear with his expectations but sure knows his stuff.,1
"Anton is a nice guy and you can tell he loves teaching, but the class itself is very repetitive and it made me dread going to any lectures. Assignments are easy but you have to take a quiz before every single class period. I would still recommend, maybe his teaching style is different in real-life lectures vs Zoom lectures.",1
"I'm not really sure how some people can't get the concepts discussed in class. They kind of all fell together like a pattern, the different themes of the novels. Ex. The 1st unit books (3) seemed to be about fractured units of time in post-2001 fiction. Techniques of lit today. Aka ""recent trends"" ...anyway, Bruss isn't a bad guy. Hilarious.",1
"Tons of time-consuming reading and discussion boards in this class. Very easy grader tho, not much effort required. I got a perfect grade on all three papers (one of which I passed in a month late). As long as you somewhat keep up with the discussion boards and skim the readings, you'll be fine. Exams are only worth 5% each of the total grade.",1
Took this class over the summer. Hardest class I have ever taken and I hated this class. You have to do three post every wee and write a paper. Midterm and final paper that ended up being over ten pages long by the time  I was finished answering all the question that he asked. If you do one answer all the question that he ask he will make you down.,0
"Lutfi's lectures are unorganized, boring, and he tends to ramble on. Went to his office hours and he was kind of rude, but in lecture he seems nice. Didn't do well on the tests personally, but the tests were mainly just definitions, so if you study for them, you should do fine. Don't buy the book, totally unnecessary. ",0
"He will only be an easy/nice prof if you are in his special group of preferred students, otherwise he is an ass with too much ego and NO vocation whatsoever for teaching.Writing random, ill defined papers and buying a $90 reader we never discussed= no fun",0
One of the best professors there is at BMCC. She cares about her students and has s great teaching method. I'm excited to have her again as an professor next semester.,1
"Had him at Ryerson a few years ago but there is no profile for him there. Terrible professor. Pompous, arrogant, bad attitude towards students. Spends a lot of time name-dropping to inflate his already large ego.  Don't take his classes, they are awful.",0
"good teacher, fair grader",1
"Fantastic professor. She makes a boring subject like gen bio much more interesting. She has a very creative style of teaching like outside class activities. My only complaint is that we get a test about every two weeks. The flow of energy policy was most likely the reason for all the tests though. Overall, she is a wonderful teacher!",1
There are a bunch of reading and discussion board assignments but no exams.  Most of your grade comes from a group project at the end but it's very easy and straightforward.  He's a fun professor and a very chill guy.,1
"If there had been in-person sections for this it would have been better, but the only content for the class is readings. It's hard to learn from just readings and I wish he had made lecture videos to watch. The canvas page is not all that well organized either. But the class is easy in itself, I can just tell he isn't familiar with technology.",0
"She's really sassy sometimes, but not in a funny way. She seems to clearly have students that she prefers and kind of comes across as fake caring.",0
"I've taken two METEO classes at PSU. The other with a different prof I got an A in, and with this one I got a C. Prof Babb is as unhelpful as the convoluted material he presents, all of which does very little to prepare you for the assignments. If you need help, he just vaguely refers you back to the material. Not just difficult, but unfair.",0
"There is literally an assignment due every class day, from essays to paragraphs to literally anything you can think of. Honestly entirely too much work. If you have a class that needs extra attention DO NOT take this class.",0
I loved this class! It was really easy for me and Trina was extremely caring and genuinely wanted the students in her class to understand the material. She was born to teach!,1
I had him last summer and it killed. He never smiles and he never provided us with his email. I am assuming he just doesn't want to be bothered by students questions. The students should not be asking questions because he will make you feel dumb. ALso don't waste your money on buying the textbook because he never uses it,0
"Tom's education is unprovided in any other liberal arts institutions, no matter how many you have learned.",1
"He is a very good lecturer. He explains well in class and is humorous. His midterms were hard but reasonable. But, after the class got moved online due to COVID, his final was super unreasonable, it was the hardest exam ive ever taken in my life. It was SO TOUGH i still did not recover mentally from that exam.",1
"Best prof I ever had. I loved American History, but thought World History would be boring. Was I ever wrong. He taught history through literature and required us to read Oedipus Rex.  As a result, I fell in love w/ Greek lit as well.",1
Very unorganized. Opened quizzes and closed them before anyone in the class could take them. Told us to check the syllabus for questions we had but they were never in the syllabus in the first place. included assignments that were not in the syllabus. Didn't explain what he wants on assignments then doesn't answer emails in time to turn it in.,0
"If you care about cognitive psych, take this class with someone else. If you don't care about cognitive psych, find another class--don't suffer through this one. He tends to spend 5-10 on slides with less than 15 words on them. Know the studies, or better yet, just don't take this class with him.",0
worst teacher ever. went to see her for help in office and did not help what so ever. gave me the lowest grades on papers when i worked for hours on them. book readings mandatory. talks to much of herself and does not clarify well. do not recommend.,0
I did not like this professor at all. Only take this class if you are prepared to teach yourself from the textbook throughout the entire semester. His lectures are very boring and he reads straight off the powerpoint slides.,0
Nam is a HORRIBLE finance professor. His finance class is impossible if you aren't already a master at corporate valuation. Can't understand him over his thick accent. Looks at you like you are stupid. Never around for help. All he cares about is his Korean real estate company. Exams are BRUTAL. AVOID at all costs! He should NOT be teaching.,0
Shing is a very nice man but he is very hard to understand. No one in the class knew what to do but he made it near impossible to fail. Easy A. If you actually want to learn something this is not the right professor for you.,0
She doesn't care about this course.,0
Fantastic techer! Great easy to folow lectures. Do his maple maple examples and the projects are easy just like he says. Always willing to help if you try. Showed how nums relates to real world. Knows engineering and gives exampls! Exams are easy if you keep up!,1
"He explains everything very well and makes it easy to understand. However, the class is only out of 100 points total, so every little point counts which makes it kind of hard, especially since the AIs do all of the grading and are not likely to give back points that they've taken off.",1
I love this man! He is so encouraging and takes the time to help his students. He is a great listener and seems to know just how to make you smile again. I don't think I would have enjoyed Haverford as much as I do without him. He is an excellent person overall and he is pretty cool just relax and chill with for lunch!,1
Communicated at the beginning of the course that tests would contain 90% lecture material and 10% textbook. The tests were mostly application based and completely out of left field and she provided no information on how to do better. She was also extremely paranoid about cheating so she gave 55 minutes for a 75 question multiple choice test.,0
This guy likes to talk a lot about his personal life and likes to retell boring anecdotes repeatedly every single lecture. Apart from being a strict guy he is extremely rude. If you are trying to get your GED done do not take him unless your really into poetry. Also be prepared to waste money on useless books. This man also takes attendance serious,0
"I may have only known him for a short time, but I must say, Dr. Early is so kind, efficient, and helpful! He is the perfect teacher, in my opinion. He goes above and beyond to help his students and explains things really, really well. He's very patient and wants you to succeed. Very lovely professor. You are lucky to have him.",1
This guy is very rude. He doesnt care about his students. His ego is bigger than Texas. I passed the class with a 95% but was not fond of his teaching. On a good note I did learn a lot because we had to teach ourselves. He does not teach whatsoever.,0
"i took rome 250 class in my freshman year. He is a great lecturer, and he knows what he is talking about , italian history, art history, etc. I liked that he spoke lots of italian during lectures because it gave me a huge interest in italian too. the lecture makes me to concentrate, give me an extreme interest and excitement.",1
"His test questions are fair. If you study the lectures and the book you should do fine. The paper isn't graded super strictly, but talk to him about it.",1
Wrote his own txt book. I spent a lot of time with a tutor to pass this class. He speeds through lectures and doesn't clearly deliver the topics. He provides problems and answers online but there are errors in the questions and answers. I really did not enjoy him as an instructor. I wish I would have taken the class elsewhere.,0
"PROFESSOR NINA IS THE BEST WRITING TEACHER !! I love her so much! She is such a nice lady, caring and very sweet. This class is not hard, quite easy! She is very interresting, the class is very dynamique and she is the BEST. Her class is closed next semester for writting 2, otherwise I would have taken her again without any hesitation. TAKE HER!!",1
"Prof. LaSalle is so far my favorite professor at SJU. His lectures are interesting and he's willing to repeat anything if you need clarification. His tests are easy once you take good notes and follow his lectures! He's amazing, I highly recommend him!",1
Lisa assigns assignments with little to no direction. She requests that you go to peers for help instead of her. She grades tough- you get a C for doing exactly as she asks; you must go above and beyond to get any higher.,0
Shes the most rude professor Ive ever had. She makes it hard to approach her outside of class because she will be unnecessarily rude to you and make you feel stupid. I simply asked to look at the grade sheet in an email which she rudely responded that she didnt understand why I didnt already see it. Her voice is monotone and uninteresting.,0
Very helpful and knowledgeable. Willing to help outside of class,1
"Good guy, but I did not like his teaching style. Lectures the entire time and there were only 3 tests the whole semester. He also will call you out and tell you to get out of his class if you talk at all in class.",0
"I read all these comments and I still took her... THE WOMAN IS UNBEARABLE! so apparently she's been a horrible teacher since 2002, that's how far the comments date back too. I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN! Ok so being an English major revolves around individual interpretation and analysis, however there is only ONE and I repeat ONE correct answer in her class",0
"The professor is super disorganized. I feel like the material would have been easier, had another professor been teaching the class. Exams were confusing, same thing with homework.",0
This is not a bird course but prof Harris is looking to give out good grades. Put the work in and it will do well. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OFFICE HOURS. Not only is it great for your assignments but he genuinely cares about students and wants them to learn beyond the course and become better people. The course is also structured well - would recommend!,1
oozes sex appeal. only a lucky few understand him...,1
"Not a good teacher (trust me). Out of the 2 years I've been going to JJC, he was definitely the worst. I barely got out with a passing grade. Avoid if possible.",0
its a hard class but Professor Sanford makes it easy! his exams are lengthy questions but as long as you go to class and pay attention youll be fine,1
"Worst professor at pace university. My entire class of of graduating seniors was failing due to his snarky remarks of "" reviews do not reflect tests. "" Long story short, our class had our class had all of our grades adjusted to B's and C's by the department. DO not take this class.",0
"kind of an eccentric woman w/a passion for rewriting and rhetoric and many other things; I learned a great deal from her, even though the process was grueling at times.",1
"Assigned interesting readings but led very poor discussions. Anytime we got going, she took us off in a new direction using her buzz words she uses over and over. (Ex: hegemony, intersectionality, ideology). She also grades papers based on her politics and not on the quality of your writing or argument. The course is interesting, but she is poor.",0
"the course itself is fine, nothing too exciting and not difficult.Kerry, however, is so cold and unhelpful. Her anecdotal stories are not funny and are extremely off topic and whenever you ask her a question she makes you feel like its a dumb question and like it's a waste of her time to answer it. Why is she the dean?!",0
"Dr. Persinger is clever, and beneath his adversarial exterior is an educator who challenges students to become great. He is difficult to track down at times, but his time is well worth waiting for. I have now been a professor of Psychology for 5 years now, and I find that I have modeled much of my own pedagogical philosophy upon his wise tutelage.",1
"VERY hard to understand. His voice puts everyone right to sleep. The lab assignments are easy but I think that only like 2 people got above 80 percents on the exams. I think if it were any other teacher the exams would be easy but it is so hard to pay attention in class, if you even go in the first place (because he doesn't care about attendance.)",0
Dr. Gordon is one of the best history professors I have had. He has a good sense of humor and he makes the lectures fun and interesting. If you show up and take notes then the tests are easy. I would definitely recommend him if he teaches again!,1
"Professor Gibbons was very hard to reach beyond class; she seemed to always have an excuse. Readings were a bit dense and lengthy, but were always discussed in class. On paper assignments she was a tough grader. When I finally meet with her to discuss the papers, she tore them apart and offered no constructive criticism. Would not recommend.",0
"Really nice, but can be hard to follow.  He knows what he is talking about but occasionally goes off on tangents, teaching material not on test.  I did well in the class, but I had taken other classes that gave me some background on the topics presented in this class.",1
"she is willing to give extra review sections every week and explain everything all over again to students. she is a funny, energetic, and helpful. i like her!",1
"I have a double major in philosophy and comm, and a 3.9 gpa.  I am ready to blow the whistle on this guy. His information is so out of date, and his opinions not justified by the literature. Yet he talks as if he is the god of the philosophy and comm world. Retire, Ed.  Retire.",0
"Took this teacher for 101.  First off, if you have never taken spanish before do NOT take this teacher.  She expects everyone to know something about spanish.  Very fast paced and does not explain grammar points at all.  When asked outside of class for help says ""read the textbook"".  I wasnt paying for the textbook to teach me.  DO NOT TAKE!",0
"Dr. Moore is absolutely amazing. I took his American Literature Before 1900 class, and at first, I thought I was going to hate it. However, by the end of the semester it was my favorite class. Dr. Moore did an amazing job teaching the content and always allowed his students to contribute to the conversation.",1
Only offered one extra credit assignment out of the whole semester. She does not answer emails regarding questions or grading. When I asked questions in her class she made me feel stupid and when I asked for help she just told me to figure it out on my own. Honestly your pretty much on your own.,0
Do not listen to these awful comments! Professor Sgro is an incredible professor and has a deep passion for what she does! Do the work and show up and you'll be fine! She is one of my favorite professors at WCC. She has such a kind heart! Highly recommend her!!!,1
Doctor Gooch is a really nice guy. He does like pop quizzes & the exams are tough. If you are expecting an easy class this is not the guy for you. However if you actually want to learn something he is a great professor.,1
She provides not enough feedback on papers so it is hard to know where to improve to get it to where she likes it. Everything is in her perspective and if you offer a different view-point she shuts it down immediately so there is no chance of your opinion being taken into consideration.,1
"Professor Hart is a very nice and kind lady, however when it comes to taking a class with her, steer clear. She is very unorganized and you never have any idea really what to expect on anything. She spends many lectures going over the same material from months ago, but none of that stuff will be on the exams.",0
OK. I took this class because of the ratings of this professor.. BOY what a mistake! Weeks 2-10 you are required to write a 3 page essay EACH week plus discussions with 3 replies min 10 sentences... then you do a 7-8 page research paper at end. no tests..im not one to shy away from work but this is crazy!! dropping this class!!,0
Loads of fun - never really sticks to the subject - 90% of the class is social,0
"I had Reed for BISC205 and BISC276 over the winter. Great guy, quirky and passionate about science (and you will get a lot of random facts about bees.) 4 exams, lowest one is dropped. final is only 2 chapters, and there is a group presentation worth 15% of  final grade. Lectures can be a little boring and monotone, but still a great class.",1
"She grades everything extremely slow, I had to email her 16 times before she graded one of my assignments,(which took THREE MONTHS) she gave the majority of my class zeros on our final paper because they were ""plagiarized"" which none of them were. She knows what she's talking about and might be a good professor if she wasn't absolutely insane.",0
"Professor Howard-Snyder is very kind. Though the concepts of the class were difficult at times, asking clarifying questions helped a lot. I would recommend going to office hours from time to time. The lectures were a bit much and a lot to take in, but overall the class was fine.",1
"Worst teacher ever. Doesn't use canvas, assigns homework but doesn't count it for points or check it. The only grades you have in the class are the 2 midterms, the final, and the weekly 10 point worksheets that do nothing to help your grade if you do bad on the tests. Wouldn't recommend to anyone who is slightly bad at math- he can't explain it!",0
"""Ah, be careful!"" His accent had me terrified the first week. Very difficult to understand anything, in both directions.  He is Chinese(?) and spent many years working in Germany, so from time to time he'll abruptly shout mid sentence, which is hilarious.  He does get easier to understand. He is dope. Easy class, enthusiastic.",1
"An absolute DULLARD, 0 lecturing ability: why are you a Professor? You ruin an interesting topic. Unbelievable",0
If you work for it expect a A.. he is clear in what he needs and a amazing guy ,1
"Lectures are pointless since he spends the entire time deriving equations. I feel like I learned nothing from his class. I couldn't tell you the first thing about thermodynamics, because all we got were equations. I found that the midterms were a bit tricky, but the final was much easier.  Very understandable thought at times, boring.",1
"Professor Gamm is fantastic. Have had him for both 202 and 241, Urban Change. I've found him to be extremely interested in his students' thoughts and easy to engage with. 241 has a significant workload but I think it's fair because of how in-depth the course is. His lectures are always insightful, and it's clear he cares deeply about the subjects.",1
"Nice guy, he means well, but his class was really hard! Lectures can be confusing. Huge project that requires you to go off campus and takes a lot of time and effort. Unless you have a lot of free time, I wouldn't take him again.",0
"Lots of homework assigned- she only checks it if you're late/absent. Her tests are about 25-30 questions, but doesn't curve grades. Lectures are sometimes hard to follow. Don't miss class you'll miss so much, she covers a lot very quickly. She also only uses a chalkboard, so don't take her class if you have a problem with chalk noises.",0
"He gets distracted easily and switches topics from the course materials to topics ranging from his personal life experience to modern day events. he gives vague instructions and comes up with grades subjectively. you can do all the work, memorize his notes, and still get a B. Do not take his class if it is in the city. not worth the commute.",0
"Yes, he does go off topic a lot. I stopped going to the lectures because I found they were starting to be 80 minutes of him talking about his life experiences - among other things. Just read the slides he posts online and you'll do fine. Easy.",1
"He's a great teacher who cares about his student's success. His lectures are great and he knows how to deliver information so that you remember the material. There is no clearer grading like this class, you know what to do and when to do it. If you go to every lecture and do the HW the class is an easy A.",1
"Rants. Alot. Very funny guy, good lecturer and kept you entertained on otherwise very boring content. He writes all his notes by hand. Posts nothing on D2L. Assignments are easy, midterm was easy, final was extremely difficult and not like midterm at all. Go to class and you should be fine!",1
"Dr. Chesley is a fantastic professor - one of my favorite so far! I do not enjoy writing at all but somehow he made it enjoyable.  Dr. Chesley cares.  If you have any questions or concerns, he is more then willing to help you.  I would definitely take him again. As for his teaching style, he loves to compare writing to cats verse dogs.  Pretty fun!",1
"Dr. Ghosh is truly a great prof. She is caring, kind, & helpful. She is accessible by phone, email, Skype, & FaceTime. Her online course is very organized with clear instructions. You will have 1 on-campus exam, 12 quizzes, 4 reflections, 1 project, & extra credit. The book is required. Honestly, this class is an easy A.",1
Hard hard hard,0
"- Lectures consist of reading formulas straight out of text (zero teacher input). - This book is very old and quite advanced, and cannot legally be purchased in Canada. Tests are open-book. - Lectures ended about 23 of the way through term. - There is no evaluation on anything relevant to subject matter until end-of-term project and final exam.",0
"Not the best professor at all, but extremely easy. Talks a lot and babbles but as long as you show up youll pass. Easiest grader. 2 assignments all year. Group paper and Final individual paper. Easiest class ive ever taken. Just didnt learn much.",1
Mazie ensures people will learn from her class by creating special jobs and assignments that need to be presented in her class 3 times a semester. She makes sure we are always in group circles and have new and interesting materials to read. She is constantly evaluating her tactics fir teaching and cares about her students welfare.She is amazing :D,1
"Lecture class. I couldn't bare it and by the time the semester was over, I was ready to pull my hair out. One of those classes where you either have to study hours upon hours or walk into class not studying at all in order to ace the tests. Extra credit paper bumped me up an entire letter grade. Sweet guy as a whole, just an extremely boring class.",0
"He doesn't read the lab reports. As long as you hand something in, you'll get 100%. No attendance policy, and before each exam you get a takehome quiz which he gives you the answers to, and the exam has almost the exact same questions (and you can use a sheet of notes during exams). You won't learn anything in this joke of a class.",0
"Very interesting class to fulfill elective requirements. Textbook is used and must be read to get full participation points and for the exams. 2 quizzes, 2 exams, and a final. Lectures are worth attending and cover topics for the exams/quizzes. A good amount of reading outside of class, but not unmanageable. Professor is wonderful and helpful",1
"This prof is unclear, comes unprepared for lectures, his notes don't follow the textbook, he makes errors with solving the problems. I agree that he is a good specialist in his area, but he doesn't care for the students. For those who don't like his style of teaching, I advise to drop the course and ask for another prof in both ELEC251 and ELEC351.",0
"He goes really fast and comes off snobby. If you don't understand, he doesn't care and moves on. He definitely has his favorites and cares more about them.",0
"He takes an already bland course and makes it worse. He's constantly jumping from one idea to the next and never gets anywhere. The labs are terrible as they use material that we don't learn until a week later, and the midterms have material on them that is tougher than the assignments. His attempt at teaching EE1013 is just bad overall.",0
"This class is the worst class I have ever taken in my entire academic career. Even as a Biomedical Engineering senior, I got straight As in all my classes. He does not care about the students and has horrible teaching skills. If you can take a class at a community college, or take a class at Purdue or IU Bloomington please do so. Do not recommend.",0
Very generous curve. No oddball questions on tests and quizes. Spends all of class giving example problems. I would recommend this professor.,1
"Professor Grammy is a hard grader. The Midterm and Final are each worth 1/3 of total grade. Be prepared for fast PowerPoint slides and homework almost every week. However, he is very nice when it comes to his grading system and helping you understanding the material.",1
"just dont waste your time, the good reviews are outdated, its time for him to retire, he does not know how to teach an online class. The class feels like a punishment . never answers emails and has always seems like he doesn't know what's going on",0
Wonderful teacher. Knows what she is teaching. If you are ready to learn take this class you will never regret taken her classes.  students who do not like to study hate her class.,1
"He's a quirky prof. He goes over the material too quickly and sometimes his powerpoint slides don't have the answers for the examples (usually the concept questions) in the notes so be careful of that. You get used to the accent. He uses onomatopoeia a lot when he lectures, especially when he's trying to tell a joke/be funny.",1
"She's a nice lady and seems like she really knows the stuff she's teaching, but she's just not a good teacher. Se goes way too fast and barely explains enough. her slides are not that simple either and she just reads off them in class. But again, she seems nice",0
"Do not take him. He is outdated, class does not make sense, so much pointless reading required. Harsh grader, syllabus and online assignments do not match. I didn't do a second part of an assignment because of this. You need to double check all deadline in the syllabus and online.",0
"Interesting topics but not worth it honestly. She is very passionate but lectures the WHOLE time, readings everyday, and only 2-3 tests with a good amount of papers.",0
"Does not even teach her class. She has her GAs teach you how to use CATIA. She pirated a pdf of a textbook and makes you do assignments from that. Unorganized, cannot understand her at all. Assigns 7 assignments in a week for students to teach themselves. How are you getting paid 200k a year???! ""learning specialist"" what a load of crap.",0
"The beginning through 3/4 of the semester, I loved her class. I was an A student. I missed ONE peer review (yes, I emailed her and told her before hand), I was then told I couldn't turn in my final paper, my grade dropped to a C-. She had no remorse. Typical busy work. Decent feedback and able to revise and resubmit your paper for a new grade.",0
The best,1
"An Honours Thesis with Dr. Rich provided a challenging opportunity which was enriched through regular meetings with her lab composed of graduate students and post-docs. Dr. Rich is a very fair marker who clearly presents the grading rubric and expectations. If you are diligent and work hard, an A+ is easily obtainable.",1
"She was an okay prof, in terms of teaching I would never take her again. She reads of the powerpoint without properly explaining and a lot of times her review slides DO NOT MATCH HER EXAMS! she teaches something else and gives us review on something else. There are quizzes to boost your mark but doesn't really do anything.",0
"Sinniah is great! He is so funny and tries so hard to bring it down to the students' level. He always lets you know what's important for med school, too. Just make sure to go over his daily questions online and pay attention in class. Quiz questions come right from his internet site",1
"Very nice guy. All you have to do is: go to 2 performances, write 2 papers (super easy and no format necessary), 2 tests, show up and not play on your phone during class. ",1
"Super easy and funny classes! Online some online assignments so showing up is not necessary. Does test in videos she shows in class, but you can watch them since she gives you the links. Easy fine arts credit",1
"In class assignments require attendance, but lectures are basically summary of book. Solomonson makes the material interesting and makes great points. Study and you'll do fine on tests. TA communication seems to be lacking and they often are confused about the criteria of assignments.",1
"Very respected, helping , and caring about his students, one of the best prof in bmcc. his lectures are amazing and heavy at the same time. he would go over anything again if you didn't understand. Tests are heeaavy but he prepares you well for it and give a practice test. DEFINITELY RECOMMENED HIM",1
The midterms were too hard,0
"If you can't stand repetitiveness don't take this class. You do the same thing over, and over, and over again. He is a very tough grader and is not willing to help  you get your grade up. I took this course as a hybrid. You have to pay very close attention to his directions or else you will fail, including the stuff in small font.",1
"LOVE Ted. Yes, very difficult class, so do the Practice Sets to prep for midterms. Only two midterms and a final, the averages are standard (71%). Really cool guy, super helpful and friendly with questions, and will try to know you in OH. OH are valuable, helps lots for midterms. Reading the book is only necessary for parts you are confused on.",1
She can be quite rude when giving feedback which can be discouraging. I did not find that her criticism was constructive or helpful to my future assignments. She grades random homework one paragraph assignments as if i was writing a final essay or a doctorate dissertation. I would just recommend taking anthropology with ANY other professor.,0
"You spend almost all of your class time workshopping 2 assignments (all semester) and listening to him name drop...constantly. He's facebook friends with this famous author, had lunch with that one...I took a creative writing class from him and did 20 pages of vormal writing.  The only creative writing we did was a short story and two poems.",1
"you get 4 classes you can miss.  goes a little faster than a expected, but definitely an easy B if you pay attention whatsoever.  wouldnt call it an easy A however.  theres homework every night but she never really checks it.  speaking and writing assignments can help even out poor quiz grades you may get",1
Gives a lot of assignments and length class hours.,1
"An extremely rude lady, not very nice to students who have questions, and rarely any help. Treats students like a pain and a burden. Her grading is very harsh, expect to lose more points from formatting than actual problems in your code. She want's lots of printed code, expect to fork over $$ for printing. Would not recommend her to anyone. ",0
"Worst professor i ever had the displeasure of taking a course with.    If you want to hate your life this is the class for you.  She makes the course (the tests) as hard as she possibly can, do yourself a favor, take the class with the other bio 1201 professor.",0
"Dr. Garbary does not come off as welcoming, asking the students in class/labs questions, and making them feel  dumb for not knowing the answer. Although he does know his material extremely well, he does not make it easy to learn.",0
"She once told a student the title to his story was ""wrong."" Really? If your work doesn't have a feminist slant, she grades it more harshly. She gives loads of criticism, none of it constructive. I'm an even keel person, and I wanted to punch her in the face.",0
"This class is a lot of time-consuming work that is not necessarily helpful to your educational career.  She picks favorites and takes points off without explanation.  Not the most horrible professor ever, but take someone else if possible.",0
Professor Stevenson was an amazing lab professor. She answers any questions during lab and is available at her office hours with help studying for practicals. She is very sweet and funny and I'd recommend her for lab or lecture.,1
"I was really excited to take this class. Sadly, Dr. Craig's reliance on dull textbooks (a hundred pages of reading a week no less), ludicrous lectures and an unrealistic level of expectation on students ruined this class for me. This is one to avoid, it will not only bring down your GPA but give you a migraine in the process.",0
HORRIBLE! Do not take her class. Did everything she expected on papers and still get horrible grades. This class ruined my GPA. Tests are very difficult and when you meet with her for help she just basically tells you that she cant help you.,0
"Lots of lectures about his own interpretation of the material, (Which usually have little to do with the work you are required to do). lots of reading (like a book a week) followed by weekly essays. Easily the worse course I took.",0
"As someone who has previous knowledge on computer science and programming, and knowing someone who is a comp sci major at a tech school, she is not a good professor. She'll teach but she has no proper knowledge on correct programming skills. I get it, this university is not notorious for comp sci, but it's just bad here. Her directions are unclear",0
"took this class online for winter session. there are 3 exams, 2 ""projects"",and a final exam which is essay format. all of the blogs were very easy. the projects were fine but she grades them as if you are in an english class. she takes so many points off for grammar and ""not polished writing."" exams are fine but can be a little vague.",1
If you just do your job and stay awake you should get a good grade.  Rewards work but doesnt put up with people who obviously dont care.,1
"Professor Rokicky is a sweetheart! I took her online, and I had so many questions for her. She took the time to answer them. Her class is so nice because you complete assignments, a few forums, three exams, and weekly quizzes, which were always open note. I would definitely take her again. If you put in the effort, you'll do great!",1
Extremely lazy.  Worst teacher I have ever had.,0
"So shes super nice but very boring. Her tests are kind of difficult but she heavily curves in her class and wants u to do well. A lot of opportunities for extra credit. And for those of you who expect to cheat in her class good luck she assigns seats for the exams, sitting a seat apart. And someone stands there and watches everyone so no phones :(",0
"Professor Ruttledge believes that the Chemistry department has worked hard for students' success. While this might be true in many aspects, he storms toward the opposite direction. For example, he shows little sympathy and respect, such as humiliating a student who scored a ""true zero"" (actually attempting to take the test and scoring a zero).",0
Don't get me wrong -- this is not the easiest of classes but this guy makes it so much harder than it needs to be. Very intelligent guy... horrible professor. Quizzes have nothing to do with his lectures. Exams are worded to trick students. Would suggest to find a different professor.,0
Don't walk into this class thinking it's going to be a cakewalk. Botany is tough! So many new terms to learn. But Dr. Pam really cares about the subject. Her note and lab packet is an outline of everything you'll be tested on. Her in-class and online reviews help too. Do NOT skip. You'll miss too much and she only tests on what she lectured on.,1
Super chill and fun band director,1
"Do not take your Masterpieces of Literature gen ed with this professor! The class is so dull, boring, & repetitive. The class is all discussion based, however the professor does a poor job of starting or facilitating it. The books are not interesting to read and write about. The professor lacks personality that would make the class more enjoyable.",0
"Doug is the man. His lectures are weird and hilarious, just like him. He jumps on the table and screams and uses terrible sound effects on the computer throughout. Seriously. Take him.",1
"The semester, i feel, was not thoughtfully planned out...so much work crammed in at the end, pop-up assignments. Nice lady...wouldn't take her again if i had a choice.",0
VERY knowledgable about ECO 121 but probably shouldn't teach an intro class. Attendance was not mandatory but if you wanted to do well you had to go and pay attention. Exams were filled with trick or poorly worded questions and the class average was consistently low. The final grades were scaled about a half of a letter grade.,0
The best professor to teach Fluid mechanics! Take his class if you can,1
BORINGGGGGGGGG. Easy A.,1
Knowledgeable,1
"She was very understanding in her online class and she was open-minded to situations that prevented work from being submitted in time. I didn't see her face-to-face and I don't know how she is otherwise, but she was very understanding towards me. Thumbs up for if you're taking the class online.",1
Legendary.,1
"Felix will definitely make you work!  He's very big on the homework. the test/final questions came directly from the homework. He LOVES when students go to his office hours. From what i've seen from other ratings, he's great for discrete, not for calculus. He loves proofs, and is passionate about math. He expects the same dedication from students",1
"Tests are confusing and rely more on the books. So read. Her lectures are all common sense and not really any ""new"" information. You have to pick and choose what to note down because she writes down the main topic on the board and then just talks and talks and talks.",1
One of my favourite techers.Has taught me a lot about the art of acting.Would highly recommend taking his class.Also take his improv class its one of the best classes that you will ever take at a community college!,1
"I took Dr. Bowman for arts in contemporary society for the summer, online. Her class has a lot of work for being a 3 credit course but if you stay on top of it youll do fine. I was nervous from reading the reviews but I made an A. She expects you to write well so if writing is not your strong suit, I would not advise taking her.",1
"He was great. Super funny guy. I enjoyed taking the class, he likes to connect with the community and we did a fun service learning project. I thought the class was an easy A as long as you did what he asked. He is very approachable and if any thing is unclear just ask!",1
"This class was tough, but honestly my favorite this semester. She has high expectations, and really makes you work for your grade. That said, when you take her feedback into consideration, you will succeed. Go into her class with determination to do well, and you will. She's now one of my fave profs, even if she was a lil tough!! <3",1
"Great guy.  He makes you work, but you learn a lot.",1
Terrible class format and is surprisingly disrespectful when you approach him. Don't recommend his class at all. One of the worst professors I have ever had.,0
"I was really excited going into this class, but soon got really bored. She kind of bores me by spending way too much time going over the same obvious stuff we have already talked about online. She takes too much time talking about the same stuff that we mostly know already. I find it hard to stay awake.",1
"Very strict professor with grading. If you think you got a 100% on a project turned in, think again because that is near impossible with her style of grading. She does offer extra credit though, she is a very bad teacher and you will not get the concepts down unless you learn them on your own time. Awful instructor.",0
"An extremely difficult professor for my particular section. This class will not receive any free pts, and he sticks to his schedule. You must attend his classes, you must read the material, and most importantly take notes.  He welcomes opinions, and be sure you come to class with a discussion from the work which was assigned.",1
lectures are unorganized and boring. Feedback i recieved on my papers (which were the majority of the grading) were 1-2 bullet points that were not constructive at all. I wish i didn't take this course.,0
"Very evident his political views and grades papers accordingly. Not a fan of this guy. On the bright side, few assignments.",0
Mrs.B is very nice and helpful. She has faith in all of her students and she is pretty fair. Her class is tough with lots of homework but when your done with her class you will be an amazing writer. I recommend her to students that have never written a college level essay.,1
"Miss Bobby is a terrible teacher, and an extremely unfair marker. She actually failed me on an assignment for the purpose of keeping me from getting over confident. When I asked her to explain what I had done wrong, to learn from it, she said that my work was A material, but didn't want me to think that I couldn't improve, so she gave 20%.",0
If you do the work youll make a good grade. She reopened an assignment I missed due to an illness. She understands if youre up front with her about things. She is a tough grader though and will find little issues with your paper that you probably missed or didnt think mattered.,1
"If you want to read 30 pages a day for the rest of the quarter, take his class.",0
Great professor! Very knowledgeable about the subject and is very straightforward in lecture (almost always got out about 10 minutes early). Lot's of reading but he goes over the important passages in class. Good class for a literature credit or to learn interesting things about the ancient Greek world,1
"Regret missing one class because I was totally behind after. She is so organized, stays on schedule, syllabus helps, SO ORGANIZED, I cannot stress this enough. Nice, smart, challenges argumentative thinking. Like 2 homework mostly worked on 3 main debates/speeches. If you enjoy Coms you'll love it.",1
"I guess it's either a love or hate relationship.  I personally couldn't stand him. I found his lecturers to be unbelievably boring and uninspiring. He's arrogant and loves it when students stroke his ego. I went in there wanting to like the guy, but I just couldn't. But, give him a chance and see for yourself.",0
"Smart guy, great lectures and taught the materials from a very practical perspective (he mentions stuff like what traders would do), which is useful for FARM students. One drawback is his questions can be a bit confusing at times, and one mark on the tests is worth a lot so really hard to get a super high mark. .",1
Very good Prof... Easy to learn from...and gives very good notes also easy to study!,1
Shais my guy. Would not take again,1
"Overall he is a good Professor. He does care for you, he wants you to learn and pass. I've leaned this by being in his class, I can tell by his great personality. So do the work, participate in class, and you'll be just fine.",1
"Although she tries to make lectures fun and has passion for the material, she often reads the slides which makes the lecture fairly boring. She looks for very precise answers on tests and assignments. She's not very approachable and I got the sense that she plays favourites.",0
"So much homework, worth so little points. 20+ homework questions worth only 7 points. It's not worth my time, but I needed every point I could get, so I did it anyways. The class average was a 70%, which is really low imo, because that means that half of the class did not pass this class. He was very rude, and couldn't teach the class effectively.",0
"He is a very odd teacher and his lectures are very boring. The exams are pretty hard if you don't study and go over your notes. You get points off if you don't show up in class, so if you want some easy points, go to class.",0
His tests are very very hard. His lectures are extremely long and difficult to follow. He does not use powerpoint or anything for his lectures. It is also very difficult to keep a good grade in his class. Would not take him again.,0
"Dr. Carrion is amazing. He is so funny, passionate and knowledgeable about everything. It's really important to do the readings in order to do well on the exams, but I sort of did them and pulled off a B+. His class wasn't a joke but it was really interesting and enjoyable. I highly recommend him and this class!",1
"Dr. Mabis is a nice person. That being said, his class is a nightmare. It's so bad he gives entire letter grads curves for the class. He knows what he is talking about but not how to relay it to undergrad students. I made an A but only because I devoted a lot into the class on my own time. At least he isn't Dr. Shemroske, now that is a nightmare!!!",0
Dr. Campbell did a terrible job teaching his students that were remote only. There were never class meetings with students and the only time offered for help were inaccessible office hours instead of the time in our schedules for the lab. He was extremely nitpicky when grading and constantly found reasons to take off the most menial points possible,0
"Scarey, hard, and sometimes mean. Gives extra assignments in clinicals as if there is not enough work. Tough, be on top of everything. Picky when it comes to assignments.",1
The class is not really that useful. No one really learns anything directly from this class. I would not recommend unless you already have decent knowledge of everything in the book beforehand,0
"Lee is cool, however you are graded on few things. He gives handouts instead of using the text book, but all work on quizzes/test/in class HAS to be done on SPSS (no handheld calculators). He is monotoned and can be hard to follow but is accessible outside of class. There is not dated syllabuses so quizzes/tests come out of no where...",0
mmmmmmkaaaay,1
"You only see Sullivan on the first day of lab. My lab instructor was not very helpful at all. You have 3 question quizzes every lab, so if you miss one, you fail it with a 67. Use quizlet to study for the quiz because its pretty much all vocab. The labs were difficult and sometimes not very clear. You'll do fine if you do well on the quizzes.",0
"He is very clear about what he asks for on the exam, just follow his study guide and its an easy A. He has a sense of humor. Be ready for one or two group projects but he is not a tough grader, fair prof overall. Wished I could have taken more classes with him.",1
"Lectures can drag on occasionally however the content and its' historical context is very interesting. Very fair marking papers and presentations, seminar is very enjoyable.",1
"Exams/quizzes typically include things that weren't discussed in lectures, or are based on strict memorization. Group project is a joke and he grades based on quantity, not quality. Project barely goes with the class material. If you actually want to learn something, take another class or lecturer (e.g. 1520).",0
"The class I took was seminar-based, not lecture-heavy. I feel the lecturing Dr. Eller did was lacking in depth and quality of commentary. She gave out multiple long articles a week for us to read. Many of the articles had a social justice, leftist tint to them, and weren't concrete academic social science.",0
"Go to the Supplemental Instruction, it was vital. Sullivan teaches the concepts, but doesnt go into to detail on how to solve the problems, go to SI again.",0
"I enjoy online classes because they are independent by nature. I emailed her maybe twice over the course of the semester, both time I got curt and rude responses. Her grading system is illogical; gives vague comments with no constructive criticism. She gives the impression that she couldn't care less about being a teacher. Disappointment.",0
The hardest class you will ever take at UD. tells students to drop every class if they do not understand something. Low key a nice guy if you go to him personally,0
"So here's the thing. He's really nice and really passionate about what he teaches, but he is so boring! There's alot of reading (4 plays and 5 novels) and the quizzes aren't easy, even if you've read the book. The TA's grade everything and you really only learn during the discussion section; lecture is mostly just an overview of what you've read.",1
"It may have been a fluke semester, but this class was a mess. 4 exams that are all open book/note, but the answers to some of the questions were flat out wrong. Tried emailing my concerns with screenshots and didn't hear back till the end of the semester. Gave 10 points of extra credit, but that didn't cover the lost points. Should have had an A",0
"Pete was hilarious, until it came to the tests. Then he was pretty mean. They were RIDICULOUSLY HARD!!! And only half of the test material was covered in class.",1
"He is an awesome professor. He will push you to grow. He is engaging, witty, caring, brilliant, and an excellent orator. Just make sure you have all your reading done; if you fall behind, catching up can be brutal.",1
Bhandari is quite possibly the worst professor I have ever had over my 5 years of university across Europe and NYC. His worst offense is he is slow and inefficient in regards to time management. He is also painfully academic (he has never worked outside of academia) and therefore only rewards academic definitions and textbook thinking. AVOID !!!,0
Worst Prof ever. Class average for exam was 46.,0
Information overload is litteral here.,1
"Amazingly subjective grading, recognize that picking your battles in the beginning may very well save your grade in the end. I.E. don't argue about your first grade, argue about midterm and final. Start on projects immediately, they are very difficult for the time constrains provided.",0
"didnt teach the material well even tho he only taught 1/2 of what he was supposed to and blamed it on it being his 1st time teaching the course. Very whiny and unprofessional, half the time he complains about the TAs or department or the students.  His exams were horrible at testing course knowledge, half the questions are on things he hasnt taught",0
very vague and unorganized for a person who's job is univeristy research study. Cannot answer a question in less than 1000 words.,0
I am currently in this course and it is online with zooms. Grade comes from a few quizzes and three big tests. There is also a participation grade and you must both be present and contribute to class discussion to receive full points for the day. If you do not like speaking in class do not take this. A lot of work and hard concepts.,0
Dr. Knox is AMAZING! So fun to listen to and has great stories. The tests are difficult but can be taken online and he gives you two weeks to complete them. The attendance is mandatory which is what hurt my grade. The TA takes attendance even though its a class of 250... so stupid. I am taking Dr. Knox again next semester for Human Sexuality.,1
I would not recommend this teacher is his teaching strategy is extremely confusing. He was all over the place in the lectures and would always waste around 10 minutes  to set up the projector and struggle with the i-clicker set up as well. I read the book and it was much more clearer. Just get over 60% on exams and do all HW's and you should pass. ,0
Professor Pyburn is the number one professor I recommend. She is one of the only professors that encouraged me to assess information critically and think for myself. Shows students great respect. I got more out of her classes than any other class - she imparts students with a perspective that is valuable in all aspects of life.,1
Does not teach to the level of the test. Teaches students how to do a level 3 problem and tests are level 9 problems. Has vague review guides that are pretty pointless. Quizzes you on new material right after you learn it in class. Never lets class out early.,0
"Would never recommend, professor is really unclear in wording on quiz questions, impossible to get full points on anything. She does not seem to want her students to succeed. Unstructured class.",0
"An amazing professor.  He genuinely cares about what he teaches, and it shows.  His lectures are very organized and explained thoroughly (he doesn't just read).  Assignments and exams are fair.  If you have a good understanding of the material you should do well.",1
"Lectures are great, quizzes and homework are not difficult. I messed up my final so I expected to get a B+ (I got my homework and quizzes around 95%), but she messed up grading. She didn't have time to drop the lowest score of homework manually, which she promised in the syllabus; and she didn't make up for our loss but curved down (95+ A, 90+ B)!",0
Kamenel is a great professor. He basically just goes over power points so if you miss its okay. He uploaded the power point slides online so you can study. On each test you get to have a one paper cheat cheat so there pretty easy.,1
"great prof, makes you think. if you want an easy class don't take this, but if you really want to know finn then get ready to work. truly one of the best profs in the biz school.",1
"This is absolutely NOT a class that is meant to be online. The first two months of this class was studying on how to execute a good *informative* speech, and the kicker? The speech had to be given LIVE, as in, OVER THE COMPUTER, and we had to emphasize ""eye contact?"" What a joke. This class should've been cancelled indefinitely.",0
"Dr. Pittman is the best English professor I've had at Hagerstown Community College, she's passionate about teaching and passionate about English topics. She really cares about success of her students and respects and cares for you as an individual. I'd recommend anyone take her for ENG-101!",1
This is honestly the worst professor that I have taken at UNC Charlotte. Please do not take his class. The test in this class are ridiculous and amount of information that he gives you and the amount of time that you have to prepare for the test are unrealistic. If you have to have him as a professor be ready to take good notes and study A LOT!!!,0
"She's amazing and very interesting to listen to. She is very passionate about the work she assigns and picks books that almost anyone could enjoy. I really don't like reading too much, but she managed to make it interesting!",1
"Hardest class I've taken so far, but the professor is straight to the point. If you even LOOK lost she will do anything to help you understand the material. Her lectures are highly important in order for you to pass the course so DO NOT miss class. Everything she lectures is on the tests!",1
"She's a really sweet person but not very clear when teaching. I have nothing against her because she did try, but I think she needs to change the way she teaches. It is possible to pass but do not expect an easy A or B. Learn the material conceptually and READ THE BOOK. Attendance isnt mandatory but go to class, she goes over hw sometimes",0
"I wasnt a bio major and it was all coursework a biology graduate had difficulty helping me with. Lots of assignments and for an online class it took more time out of my day than an actual lecture would. Read all course work very carefully if you HAVE to take this class, otherwise dont take it.",0
"She likes her subject but can also get lost in her ramblings. Her lectures can be dull but she tries to explain things and wants students to do well. Overall, shes nice but definitely not exciting.",1
Honestly all the previous reviews summed up this class pretty well. I had a loose-leaf copy of the textbook and it helped when I was doing the study guides since the online version is difficult to navigate. I did the weekly Ted Talks in advance when I had higher priority things to do. Easy but somewhat interesting material.,1
"first 4000 eng (my major) yet it felt like I was taking history instead. Teaching style is almost non-existent, the notes were up online at the being of the semester even tho it was an online course. Her assignments have no outlines with far to much expected for undergraduates. DO NOT TAKE. If i wanted a history course I would have taken one",0
"Professor Segev is an awesome professor. He is extremely knowledgeable and made hard subject matter enjoyable. You will have to study in order to get a good grade, but if you put in the work and study what he recommends you to study, you will do well. The material is complex and tests are long but straight forward. I wish he taught more classes.",1
"Hilts is hands down, by far one of the BEST profs at macewan. He makes lectures very interesting. Always more than willing to help in office hours,underatanding and extremely  thankful that you go for absolutely  any clarification. Exams are all written, but he's super big on part marks, and exams are VERY similar to practice exams. Amazing prof.",1
"really easy to get along with, tests are super easy she gives study guides, she will clarify anything you want to know,watch movies alot, and she keeps the class intresting, and takes attendence sometimes",1
This is a class you should avoid if possible. 3 test make up 95% of the grade and they are very tough. You have to memorize the entire review guide which is almost 30 questions with multiple answers to each question. Lectures are very long and boring. Definitely the worst professor I have had at Western. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.,0
"I am currently in her online History 109 class and it is the worse thing I have ever done. She assigns a big paper near the end of the semester and gives the worst feedback for the parts adding up to the paper. She only tells you what is wrong, but not why it's wrong. I am currently clueless and have no idea what I am doing wrong. Worst class EVER.",0
"Although sometimes I wondered how the software we were using would actually relate to my life, I think Chen cares about his students and that the analytical skills gained from this course were beneficial.",1
"If you can pass his tests, then you can pass the final exam. Good luck on passing his tests without pretty good studying though. There may be questions on most of his tests that there isn't an equation for on the equation sheet so you have to memorize as many as possible.",0
"Professor Nia, was a great professor. We had a 3 major speeches, a couple impromptu speeches, and 2 quizzes. We also had a easy final and a project where you have to critique a speaker.",1
"Dr. Clark is the type of professor that you want for a class like this. Most of the material is relatively dry and uninteresting(unless this is your major) but Dr. Clark goes out of his way to keep lectures intriguing. Advice: The first exam is the easiest so DO NOT blow off the others, don't miss class unless you have too, take solid notes.",1
"This class is so so easy if you are a logical person (I am a mechanical engineering major and I never had to study for this class), but if you struggle with logic then this class will be a big effort, so many people dropped.. either you are really good or really bad at this class I guess",1
"He is a very intelligent teacher. If you do your homework, you will get a good grade. There are about 4 papers you have to write, but he is extremely helpful. He really cares about his students. He likes telling stories so class isn't always dull. I recommend him!",1
she was an amazing professor and was very funny and cute! lol she has such a fun personality therefore makes psych that is a pretty boring class so much fun! great prof to have to start your intro psych,1
"Professor Chisolm is a really nice professor however, her lectures are extremely long and she isn't clear about  her assignments and when they are due. She assigns a 10-15 page term paper and is very confusing about how it's supposed to be done. She also doesn't follow the syllabus and takes really long to reply to e-mails. ",0
"This prof does not lecture on drawing half as much as he lectures on his political viewpoint. The class is fairly easy as he doesn't like a grading system and usually gives high points regardless of the work, but other than the mandatory practice of holding a pencil and drawing still-lives it is overall unhelpful in improving drawing skill.",0
The course is pretty hard.  and the tests were pretty tough. quaicoe is alright.  i found him a little confusing though,1
"A remarkable lecturer and person, easy to approach, breaks out into song during lecture & class and makes things fun/interesting. Don't get me wrong you'll work hard, ie: loads of HW, labs & tests are hard. But worth it! especially if you are a bio major. After this class you'll have strong foundational knowledge in all things cell/molec Bio",1
"""its not rocket science folks"" you will hear that all semester if you can bring yourself to show up to his class. Slides are horrible and useless but the midterm and exam weren't that bad so its possible to get a good grade.",0
"Sharon London is a brilliant teacher - if you want to really learn about acting and experience it, you should take this class. While she will say that most people will not get an A, if you really do try your best, she'll recognize that and reward you for your efforts.",1
I have never had such an unclear professor. I never have any idea what I am supposed to do or what I am being evaluated on. This class could have been an easy A if I knew what was going on. She is also extremely hard to reach.,0
"Hands down the best teacher I have ever had, regardless of subject. Makes a subject which can be overwhelming at times very easy to learn. Takes all the time in the world to explain concepts. Fair grading and tests.",1
"She is the worst prof Ive ever had. Ive gone to her office hours for extra help sometimes & she gets flustered if I dont understand right away. I also get extra help from a PhD student in the subject & I still receive low grades despite his help. I dont receive ANY feedback on her assessments, just a mark w no explanation. By far the WORST prof",0
"A highly unconventional professor for the ENGL department @ McGill because the student is expected to take responsibility for their own learning.If you show her an interest in the material,she will show you great compassion and creative leeway in return.A generous, empathetic lady with a minefield of knowledge if you take the effort to know her",1
such a great guy and a great professor. i've learned so much and he's so interesting and fun.,1
"Possibly the worst Professor. Never had someone who was so useless in lecture bantering on about his golf game and having no ability to answer in class questions. Always contradicting himself by changing class structure and expectations, it is near impossible to do well as there is no set guidelines to do well. This prof will hurt your GPA.",0
Professor Flynn is by far the worst professor and person at SCAD. She was extremely rude when responding to emails. She didnt teach the class what so ever. She is a tough grader even. I have only had experience in one drawing class so if you arent a strong drawer you will fail the class.,0
"I got an A from this class from determination alone. He gives you extra credit on some tests (if you correct them) but other than that, nada. After the second day absent, you lose points. And he has this ridiculous grading system where he replaces the lowest test score (say an 80) with your final (say a 50), regardless of score. Hated it.",0
"This is extremely difficult class and Farris tries his best to explain the concepts the best he can. His lectures contain a lot of information but he always happy to answer questions. His tests are extremely difficult, our classed averaged about a 60% each test. I dont think its Farris fault, but just the nature of the class.",1
"Bring caffeine to class or you'll fall asleep pretty quick.  Dr. Self is ok, he'd probably be a cool guy out of this boring class.  You might spend every class wondering what is going on but it's do-able.",0
Daley is an overall great professor. Her notes for Math 117 were fill in the blank which i found super helpful with following along. I got really sick at the beginning of class and she was very helpful during office hours and let me make up the work when i could. Shes super caring and as long as you put forth the effort you will do well in class.,1
dont be fooled by Elementary Spanish this class is tough and if you are not comfortable with the language do take it. im fluent in Spanish and there were some questions that I struggled to answer. the professor seems nice but completely disappeared throughout the 10 week course. she DOES NOT RESPOND TO EMAIL. avoid at all cost. no support at all,0
"What a terrible experience! I'll admit that the class discussions were interesting. However, two 28 question multiple choice tests made up 2/3 of the grade. The term paper criteria was outlined in four sentences in the course syllabus, and he graded them very arbitrarily ( he didn't use a rubric, and didn't read the papers himself). Save yourself!",0
"He is a gteat professor. He help in gaining an in depth knowledge of the subject. He was always very helpful, encouraging and willing to give his time. He teach wth great ease and clarity.",1
"Nancy awesome- so goofy but so kind. She is a great professor and wants all of her students to succeed- she even calls herself your ""math mom"". I would defiently take her again. This class uses ALEKS. It is a lot of work but if you do the homework then the tests should be fairly easy.",1
Very solid teacher. Partovi is very knowledgable and he really tries to focus the class on the person who know the least which is a nice review. There were only three tests and a final paper though so you do need to do well on the assignments.,1
"Absolute Savage, knows more about bowling then Earl Anthony, wish he taught stats 300 too.",1
"If you want to talk about religion and politics, take his class. Tests are worth 100% of your grade and there are only four of them, including the final. Good Luck!",0
"If you are interested in German, take her class! She makes sure that you understand and won't move on until you do. I've already signed up for her class next semester because she is such a great instructor.",1
One of my favorite professors of my college career. He's incredibly intelligent and engaging. He'll definitely make you think. Take him if you can.,1
"Fantastic prof, really engaging and knows what hes talking about. Really interactive during lectures; always an opportunity to engage in discussion. Great visual aids, and Im sure you could skip lecture and do well, but his lectures are such a treat so go!",1
She might be the worst professor I've ever had.  She seems nice at first and acts like there will be an open line of communication but I sent her several urgent e-mails throughout the semester and she didn't answer one of them.  I also tried to go to her listed office hours since I couldn't get in touch with her via e-mail and she wasn't there!,0
"I had a very poor experience with Ms. Benton, for some she may be fun. To me she was very lazy, did not do anything to help the students because ""that would be too much work for her"". She doesn't actually give lectures you just kind of waste the class time with a variety of either small activities, hints to what we are supposed to know, or talking.",0
"Nice lady, but hard class. Do NOT buy the textbook just buy her lecture notes.",1
"Worst experience I've had for a math class. Expects you to know the material before its taught. Assumes you are a math prodigy, his methods of teaching were not helpful for me nor my friends who also took the class.",0
Boring guy but very nice. One of the hardest graders I have ever met. All assignments and tests are extremely difficult.,1
"You have to write, take, and then grade your own tests, FOR A GRADE(This will take you hours). Not to mention the numerous progress reports you have to send her just to tell her you completed another assignment. Do not take this class if it is given online. It will be the most stressful thing, especially when you have to write your own final",0
His topic classes are AWESOME. He legitimately cares about students and will help you if you ask for it. He is a hard marker but if you put in the work you will see the rewards. ,1
Awesome teacher...very easy and lets you either use a page of notes on the test or  gives them back to correct for half credit. Shes very helpful and entertaining. Shes also very smart and knows what she is talking about,1
"Great professor, have taken 2 other classes with him. No complaints.",1
"Charles is an amazing teacher! He is strict at times, but clear with his expectations. He is also changing his class format for next semester by doing group exams and also allows you a sheet of notes for every chapter test. He is strict at times but very approachable. His expectations are clear and makes the content easy to understand, easy A!",1
"One of THE best professors ever! His classes are basically 99% lecture but don't worry, you'll be interested 100% of the time. He knows his stuff, and lectures in a funny and engaging way that makes the time go by quickly. Very few assignments, pay attention and you'll pass.",1
"I like the course however not my favourite lecturer, struggled to stay on top of lectures I thought I would get used to her teaching style but didn't see much improvement. I had to resort to wizedemy to re-learn and catchup in the course.",1
"in class she seemed nice and caring but when I talked to her by myself several she was rude, distant and cold.",0
Fantastic Professor! Real-life examples (Would you rather have snickers or coke? Here's the graph!) and very helpful in and after class!,1
Worst professor I have ever taken. Spends the 2 hour lecture sitting down and mumbling into his hand. Very rude and told my class everyone was going to fail every day. STAY AWAY FROM THIS MAN.,0
"Lots of quizzes and homework, no final exam, just a big group project with 5-8 other people, she tries really hard to make it interesting but it just isn't and the concepts are just annoying to have to remember, we get a cheat sheet for exams and she grades attendance. Easy class but veryyyyy boring...",0
I enjoyed the class.  Dr. Everett truly has an interest in you doing well and is helpful even after the end of the class.,1
"Don't as for any help, vague and won't go out of his way to help you.",0
Great guy great class love him,1
"He's so silly that sometimes you're scared that he's serious (he's not). Despite that, he knows his stuff. I'm a brat, but he knows how to deal with all sorts. Great prof. Has interesting taste in music- that he WILL make you listen to. Bring headphones.",1
ATTEND. CLASS. You will not pass otherwise. I didn't and I barely scraped by. I regret not applying myself in his class because he is literally the best prof I've ever had. Amazing lectures and he is a master of thermo.,1
"This class was probably one of the hardest classes I've taken. It's a lot of work! Do not miss class because you will be very behind. Do as much extra credit as you possibly can, at the end of the semester it will pay off. Work on the sketchbook he assigns. Do not wait wait to the last minute on your final project!! Work on your book way in advance",1
He knows what he's doing! Amazing teacher. probably the best in the department.,1
"I thought that she was pretty easy, but gets her classes confused. She needs more organization and needs to post her grades sooner.",0
"One of the most loved RTA proffs. If you need help just ask, but definitely show up to class!! ",1
"I don't know what all the complaints are about, honestly. Yes, the papers were marked fairly harshly...but the midterm and final were straightforward and easy to study for (HE GAVE YOU THE ESSAY TOPICS BEFOREHAND!), and the course material was awesome. He is a hilarious, engaging lecturer, and I remember every single lecture.",1
"Great Prof!!! Very knowledgable and helpful!!  But make no mistake, this is oone very hard class- the exams especially are very very difficult!!",1
I loved Mr. Tamm's class.  He was a great teacher and a very smart person. He is young so it almost as though he is one of the guys. For the class we took 4 test and a 4 page essay due at the end of the term. I would highly recommend his class. In fact I'm currently looking for another class he teaches to take next semester.,1
"She is by far the worst teacher on campus. She doesnt teach at all... All we do in class is examples from the textbook but she doesnt explain how to exactly do them. When its time for homework, it is nothing like what we did in class! Soooo you cant do it. Better yet, she wont let us use formula sheets on tests when we use like 15 different formula",0
"Well, this is the hardest course I ever took. The materials are not easy to absorb and Prof. Ho is tough grader as well (6069D,7079C, no curve ). As long as you show him you understand the material, he will forgive you. He want the students to ask questions and he is willing to help. 2.42,Maxwell,wave(chapter 7) will be 40% of the total grade.",1
She is a great prof. However i think she hates men and families.,1
"She is an easy teacher, although she teaches well too.  If you get her, do the review problems.  The tests are remarkably similar to the review problems.",1
"This professor isn't particularly consistent, and at times allows his own personal feelings to get in the way of properly managing the class.  If you are considering taking one of his courses for the mere enjoyment of it, then you should be prepared put a lot of work in to satisfy him.  Don't take his courses unless you have to take them.",0
such a great prof,1
I would highly suggest her!! I've had her for 2 quarters and am hoping I will get to be in her class next quarter! She is so funny and wakes you up if you have her 8:30 class! Very sweet and truly wants you to succeed! If you follow instructions you should be good in her class! My favorite teacher so far!!!,1
"By far one of the worst math professors ever, this is my second math course at SJSU and he was one of the worst professors ever. He is not clear when explaining the lessons, all he does is read off the power point. If you don't know how to do proofs or haven't learned them since the prerequisites for this class is precalc do not take him.",0
"Worst class I've taken, prof was terrible, crazy, it was just a giant waste of time.  Sometimes she says things that are obviously incorrect, she doesn't even know her own subject well.  I would not recommend this class to anyone, although it is an easy A which is probably why she gets some positive ratings.",0
"He seems nice enough, but gives very boring lectures. The assignments were underspecified, easy to misinterpret and had contradictions. I like to finish assignments ASAP so I can move on, but was burned multiple times when he and the other prof decided to change or even further flesh out an assignment at the last minute. Absolutely infuriating.",0
"He is a writer thus he has a lot of knowledge but gives way too much homework. if you have a lab, dont take enc 1101 with him. i had his class for this fall and he gives 3 portfolio assignments per week which are not that easy.",1
The class is just to hard and many students complained about him. Grading is not fair and he requires too much. I received a zero for not taking a non required post test :(.,0
You will love Paula she makes class fun and intresting. She yends to be very forgiving with dead lines  for papers definatly recommend her for a teacher,1
This professor is very informed when it comes to first hand experience and is enthusiastic but I found her lectures dull and not very helpful. You have no idea what to study for the exams and its a lot of material. She is a very tough grader and seems to pick favorites. I don't feel as if I have learned much but gives lots of extra credit.,0
She is very hard teacher! I have her for my English class and she is not clear at all! I never know what she is asking for. this class is only for nerds!,0
"His lectures are pretty boring but he basically goes over the reading so pay attention. He does review study sessions before the midterm and final which are helpful. You do have to write a book review. Extra credit is available. The midterm and final were m/c and t/f and werent difficult. Going over notes help help and quizlet, just know stories.",1
Professor Leslie is extremely passionate about her topics.  A great teacher who gives great feedback and makes class interesting.,1
This guy is a living Encyclopedia Library,0
"Jeff is the man. Our class got moved online due to COVID-19 and he's been on top of things. His lecture style focuses on doing problems, which I love. If you need help, just ask him and he is more than willing to help you outside of class.",1
I love Peter! He's the best prof I've ever had and he's just starting out. So many other profs could take some pointers from him. His teaching is clear and his tests are straightforward. He's very easy to talk to and is always willing to help. He's funny and lighthearted and makes lectures enjoyable. I'd recommend Peter to anybody.,1
"Frau Busch is a great professor. Like all of the other comments, she is a helpful professor, cares about her students, makes the material easier to learn, and is very passionate about what she does. Her class is a lot of fun and a pleasure to go to. I look forward to going to German every week!",1
I love professor Wakem he is hilarious and make micro so fun! He is very devoted to what he teaches and loves to help so that you do well in the class do well on the work he assigns and exams won't be a big deal even if you don't do great on them. ,1
"Dr. Noble's classes are very challenging, but if you care to succeed in her class, you will grow so much! Expect to be held to a very high standard in terms of writing and reading comprehension. If you are struggling, have some humility and meet with her--she is quick to go out of her way to help!",1
"Burns is amazing. If all people learned math from burns from start to finish, we would all be math wizards. He'ld give you the shirt off his back to help you out. Great guy and great professor. I wish i could take more classes with him. Tests are easier than the homework. labs help with understanding and boost your grade. A great experience.",1
She is an OK professor. She is way too uptight about attendance. She does not allow one to leave early without it going on record because she is afraid one of the staff members will ask why the student is not in class. She makes the class seem really fun on the first day but then gets very dull once everyone is settled in. ,1
WOW SUPER GREAT TEACHER! Interested in the material that he is teaching and he knows how to transmit it to his students.  Classes are fun and rewarding.  BEST CLASS I HAVE EVER HAD!,1
"Ina Markham is the worst prof. I've ever had. If you read this review and still take this class, I don't feel bad for you. WARNING: change your prof. or be ready to study and still get bad grades. Her lectures/voice are intolerable. If the class doesn't ask questions she threatens cutting class that day. For your own good, DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS.",0
"By far the best professor at Porterville Campus. Loves to teach and is actually good at it! You do need to put in the work to get the grade, but he will help you out as much as possible along the way. Great professor! Makes math interesting. Wish more professors were like him.",1
This was an 8 week online course the teacher never e-mailed me back. After 8 weeks I was never given any feedback and nothing was graded. He has not posted my grade. He was not available by phone or in his office either. My classmates said they received no feedback or e-mails. To summarize I would not suggest taken an online course with Mr. Smith.,0
I cannot thank this lady enough for getting me through my first science class since high school!,1
"You need to study for his exams using both the textbook and lecture notes because they can be hard. In class, he is funny but you can't use a laptop and he has a habit of picking people out to answer questions. He also gives a lot of extra credit which is helpful",1
hates being corrected; she'll her justify her wrong-ness by being harsh and judgmental to you. know-it-all attitude compounded by a matter of fact way of saying it. long-winded replies to answers that literally only need a yes or no answer. hard marker. don't bother bringing your own ideas to class; act like a child in a new enviro. to get ahead,1
"Wendy MacCaul is without a doubt the worst prof I've had to date in my university career. She loves to shoot you down to your lowest, my personal favorite quote of hers was, ""You guys have been down hill since grade primary"".. refering to us not understanding a problem I hope they fire her!shovelass",0
Impossible to listen to.  Gives easy tests.,0
"This class is great for you if you want to not be taught anything, and fail the class.  he cannot hear you so yell all your questions as loud as possible. goes too fast and too slow at the same time???? just no",0
"M. Pelletier est un homme inspirant, le meilleur professeur de l'Université d'Ottawa! Il transmet sa passion pour le droit constitutionnel. Avec beaucoup d'expérience autant en tant qu'enseignant que comme professionnel accompli, ça se dégage dans ses cours magistraux. Très articulé, il  est clair et facile à suivre, on comprend absolument tout!",1
"Professor was very well knowledgeable in the material. Because of that, he has trouble explaining things in a way struggling students can understand. Also would always say he would release or grade stuff then never did on time. Ended up having students self grade themselves and do a big assignment randomly in the last 2 weeks of the semester.",0
"Professor Novak is a smart guy however is class is extremely boring and confusing and he assigns a reading every night. There are always pop quizzes, notes are allowed but they are hard. There is 3 papers and a group project, however he is a tough grader.",0
"Hastings is the man. Go to class and participate. Very helpful, wants you to do well. Assignments are straight-forward and majority of grade. Take your time on them and it's an easy A. He has a funny voice. The kind of guy you want to do well for. My advisor so I know him very well.",1
"As many have said, brilliant physicist, horrible teacher. First day he gave assessment exams because the uni told him his fail rate was too high. There are no 'pre-tests' anymore, no kind of study guide given, just told to do the homework again (loads of homework at that). Only three tests and a final, with no curve.",0
"Really Informative in lectures and easy to approach, but in the exam the question were things we had never been required to know...Over all a good prof just make sure you know exactly what he wants.",1
very enthusiastic and knows his stuff. makes class fun and assignments are pretty easy.  a lot to read but he goes over everything. good guy.,1
She is very smart in her own way but cannot express what she is trying to teach. She is probably one of the smartest people I have ever met but cannot teach what she knows. I relied on the book and other people in the class to get an A. She does post a lot of quizzes online that can really help your grade if you look for the right answer.,0
He stands over the projector and talks to the projector more than anything else.  The tests are tough.  He spent a lot of time going over stuff that was easy and basic.,0
"if you get an option of a thursday or tuesday lab take thursday because the tuesday lab can tell you everything on the lab exams, don't take the quizzes lightly, they add up and are a huge factor. Don't rely on her as a teacher, she simply goes off the ch in her class time. She does her best to be there but in the end its just a job. good outlines",0
"I had Dr. Dunn for lecture. He is a bit full of himself and thinks he's super funny, but you get used to it. He offers a ton of curves on his exams and quizzes (which are weekly). Exams are multiple choice and short answer, and 80% of the questions are from old quizzes and exams. Would definitely recommend and would take again.",1
"Not very coherent, and he tends to ramble on about his ancestry far too much. Does not really care about his students and replies to emails as infrequently as he can. The other professors are by far more interesting and willing to teach. Take him for this course if you enjoy being bored or dislike being intellectually stimulated.",0
"One of the best classes and teachers ever. Such an easy A as long as you show up to class. I literally never studied, and just made sure I paid attention. She really makes the class interesting too. I'm a neuro major and to be honest the people that say she's not a good prof. must be stupid because this class is great, and easy.",1
You can pass the class and not learn a thing. She (yeah it's a woman not a man) only teaches online classes and doesn't really seem to care very much. Probably the easiest class I've ever had. She's just lazy. Wish I had actually learned something since I paid for it. Oh well. Easy A at least.,0
"All I have to say is that Iverson was the best professor I have ever had, and he is an OChem prof. His TAs are also amazing, and he gives so many opportunities to talk to him and learn. Please take him",1
He was an awesome teacher!!! He gave very good examples...he reminded me of the professor from Saved By the Bell!  Take his class!,1
He is a great professor that cares about his students. He responds right away and is a quick grader. He is an all around great guy!,1
"Sweet, caring, knowledgeable professor. That being said, her grading was outrageous. Most of the course was spent meeting with your group and little time was spent learning material. There was one exam (most of the class did poorly) and a final paper. Little instruction was given for the paper, yet it was graded incredibly harshly.",1
"I took his class online, Im sure he is more used to teaching in person. However, Overall, he is rude, non responsive to email, his assignment descriptions are not very descriptive at all. The only professor in my two years at GRCC that I genuinely disliked as a teacher. Im sure hes a nice guy but he does not come off that way at all.",0
"It is hard to say who the prize goes to for most bad-tempered & useless 'instructor' in York's IT dept. Ironically he is also head of the IT dept at York. His courses are such a waste of time & money. An insanely harsh marker, expect to get around 50 - 70% at best, especially if he's feeling moody towards everyone in the class.",0
Pretty Decent Prof,0
I love this guy! Very helpful and intelligent.,1
"Prof keeps calling him self an a hole as if its a good thing, i wholeheartedly agree with him being an a hole.",0
"only had her for first year sem, great lady helped my alot with my classes",1
Do not take this professor; just don't do it.,0
"I'm not sure how I got an A in this class. The tests are a matching style and often there would be vocab/questions on them that I had never heard of. For this reason, I do not think the tests are easy. You need to know a lot of vocab. Plenty of awkward moments in class, and that made it sort of enjoyable.",1
"Fred tries to engage students, but ends up polarizing them instead. He makes attendance a mandatory chore then wastes your time talking about whatever he wants, then gets mad when you try to work on homework or look at your phone. Groups are a must if you want to do well on tests so get to know yours and makes sure to collect notes on homework.",0
"Professor Roth is an unnecessarily strict grader and grades everyone as though they are English majors. If your style of writing doesn't match hers, she will give you a hard time. She gives out many assignments throughout the semester and never puts the grade in blackboard for you to see what your overall grade in the class is.",0
"Schaumann is one of the best professors I have come across, he is clear, helpful, and very knowledgeable. He uses a lot of real world experience in his teaching which makes the class much more fulfilling! Do not be intimidated by him! This class is worth it.",1
Do not let anybody convince you this class is easy. only take if MANDATORY! First test I had a 16 pg study guide and 55 slide powerpoint of which she selected 50 MC questions for the test. horribly unhelpful and covers vast amounts of material in some classes. I believe we covered over 600 years of history in an hour and twenty minutes one class,0
"This is the WORST professor at SRU. I took him my freshman year, had A's in all of my classes and got a C in this one. mainly because all he does is complain that we do not take notes when we ask for help, but at least half of the lecture is him telling us how stupid we are and screaming. Quizzes have nothing to do with material. AVOID AT ALL COSTS",0
Heuchemer does a good job teaching an intro class.  He provides his own written textbook which was free of cost and written well enough that I had no issues with the course material.  His class is not the easiest class in the world but certainly not that difficult.,1
What the hell is SCHEME???? This is basically useless as is the prof.,0
"Unless your asian be prepared to learn this class on your own with just the couse notes and homework problems. Her accent is just too hard to understand, the majority of the time u'll be trying to figure out what she said instead of focusing on the material...p.s. avoid the Gong Show at all costs...",0
Amazing professor. She moves very fast but her energy and excitement for the material in contagious (and it is hard to get college student excited about balance sheets at 9 am). She is intimidating at first but I think my view was hindered because of having Professor Teitel the semester before. Best teacher I have had at Holy Cross.,1
"Dolgen was a low, low point in my Scraft experience. He had nothing substantial prepared for classes and seemed to care nothing about giving constructive feedback - he seemed almost to despise the students and his job. The unruly students ruled the class with pointless arguments. At the end, all I got out of it was a 4.0 slapped on my transcript.",0
"He is entertaining in class, but test are all math focused!  Very hard to get a read on how the tests will go.  Do not underestimate difficulty as it was very hard.",1
She is the professor that cares the least about her students at UW,0
"Seems like an easy class at first, however the amount of assigned reading is insane. Little gets done in class, and all the pressure is put on you to learn the material as well as do the outside readings on your own. Lectures connect little if at all to textbook/reading material and is super vague, which leaves you scrambling for the final.",0
"He is a good teacher, I liked him. Classes was just reviewing the textbook so reading was not required, but recommended. Assigns a few essays, only tests are midterm/final. Would recommend.",1
"Honestly one of the best teachers at FIU. I took him for both ENC1101 and ENC1102. There is a lot of homework, almost everyday, but its really easy. He just wants you to practice writing. You'll definitely notice an improvement in your writing skills after taking his class.",1
hot nerd surfer. good teacher. Cabrillo college has an AMAZING music department... and a sh*t load of badass equipment accessible to all types of music people.,1
Impossible to follow. You can never be sure exactly what it is she wants from you in class or on assignments. Didn't seem to have fundamental knowledge of what she was teaching. Couldn't give clear answers to questions.,0
I passed this class without learning anything. Prof does not respond to emails in under a week and takes weeks to a month to post grades. This coupled with errors and unclear information in chapter notes etc makes it seem like she doesn't know enough to teach or simply doesn't care about her online classes. I am disappointed that I paid for this.,1
"In lectures, Laura doesn't really teach you much. She doesn't care about the students, nor the thing she teaches. She spent a lot of time saying things that save her face and doesn't take responsibility (like post the final exam review guide four days before the exam). Just don't take her classes.",0
Work load was above and beyond. Instructions were very dry and wasn't explained clearly. Dr Maurer does engage with students during break time.,1
Prof. Testa is an exceptional Cinema Studies academic but he lacks the captivating quality of a good professor. He is approachable despite the appearance. Lectures were quite boring and hard to sit through. Movies were fun. I was surprised by the ease of the tests and final (97) which saved me as I bombed the assignments. Would recommend to others.,0
"If you like lectures take this class, if not don't. He only has four things that are graded, two papers and two exams. You get extra credit if you write an extra paper and show up to class every day. He does take attendance, but it is not marked against you.",0
"Really knowledgeable professor.  Happy to help if you ask him.  Quizzes are tough, but he weighs them.  Awesome professor.",1
"Worst professor ever!! His quizzes and marking scheme are poorly put together,,he concentrates on assignments that have little to do with his course,andhe fails to teach what will actually be on his tests. Worse than useless!",0
Best prof at the UofA,1
"Dr, Judge is a nice guy but is a terrible teacher. His lectures are pointless because he doesn't teach you anything and you have to teach yourself all the material. His test are also very difficult and he makes everything too complicated.  Again, he is a nice guy but it seems as though he does not care to help if your struggling.",0
"Nice lady, not a great teacher. Very hard grading on the only two test essays. Homework load was never a problem, but class discussions were typically very dull and lacked inspiration.",0
"One of the best math professors, Dr. Watson please go back to teaching MATH1505 we need you.",1
"Amazing Teacher. You will create things that you didn't realize you were capable of if you let yourself be pushed. Taking design from Dwayne Bohuslav is a must for a great portfolio. And yes, you must love architecture to love him so either suck it up or find a new major.",1
"She is the best ECE professor I've had so far. Very clear, knowledgable, and kind. Exams are fair and closely follow the study guide she provides. No question on exam that's not covered on lectures or homework. Strongly recommended...",1
"Mark Johnson is one of the worst professors I've ever had. He shows no interest in students. His lectures are dead boring, and he doesn't even seem to care about his own subject. I am passionate about art history, but he almost ruined it for me. I can't even imagine taking this class if I didn't already love the material. Take it from someone else!",0
Not great. not helpful on reviewing for tests. only gave one review for one test. the rest of the tests you were on your own to figure out what to study.,0
"Dr**** is an excellent professor, he is highly recommended for 322 and 244.",1
"HAHAHA! this is a great course! take it for the prof.  I think he deliveres great lectures.  Even though the midterm is worth a considerable amount of marks, still you should know the material.",1
"Expect weekly assignments, but do not expect any feedback.  In class, you can expect a model but not much else in terms of helpful instruction.  Criteria for getting an A are hazy, but involve somehow exceeding his expectations (which would be--by definition--meeting his expectations for an A).",0
"Amazing prof, very knowledgeable. Class is easy if you take notes and have good attendance. He goes over the material on the tests very well and I love how he relates his own life experiences to the course material. One of the only classes I look forward to coming to every time, and a class you'll never forget.",1
"He seems like a really nice, great person. Unfortunately he is a boring teacher and his assignments are drudgery that take forever to get through and end up being worth 5%. I learnt a bit about research methods but that class could have been replaced by a detailed handout of where to find ppls phone# and how to use lexisnexis.",0
"I'm taking Phil 7 - Intro to Critical Thinking, and this class is seriously the worst class ever. The material isn't too difficult, but the professor makes everything about this class bad. He wrote the textbook, and it's REALLY boring to read. you HAVE to go to class b/c he makes you hand in HW on Tues, short quiz on Thurs, and big quiz on Friday.",0
"Overall great prof! Clear explanations and writes out detailed notes instead of just rushing through powerpoint slides. Fair tests, kept on schedule and also funny and approachable. This was my last required chemistry course at UVic but I would happily take another one if Mars was the lecturer.",1
"Professor Gryz is very good. He doesn't screw around in lecture and he gets to the point. He constantly encourages students to ask questions and he spends a lot of time doing problems in class. This really goes a long way to help prepare for the tests, which are generally fair, but you still need to study for them.",1
"He is very nice and quite helpful. Though he will not accept any late/missed assignments. Overall, he is a really good teacher, he knows his course almost perfectly and does not let the course get boring. Also, its a very easy course as long as you're not a total slacker",1
"A great prof who will be able to answer your questions if you go to him after class. The class itself wasn't at all difficult, but he taught it in a very simple straight-forward way. GO TO THE REVIEW LECTURE!",1
He is the hardest teacher I've ever took.  He flunk the whole class and now retaking him.,0
"WORST PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER MET! Don't believe these other positive reviews. Cowan is rude and disrespectful. He is negative and vicious. He does not teach art, only makes fun. I tried hard in this class and my extra work was unnoticed. DO NOT TAKE CLASSES FROM COWAN. UVU would be better off without him!",0
Crystal clear lecturer who is especially helpful during office hours.,1
"Rating a prof in post-covid times is a lot different, and Sheppard is by far the worst adjusted to using Teams and online resources of any prof I've had. He refuses to record his lectures, he only sends assignments by email and refuses to learn D2L. I wouldn't recommend him as long as we continue virtual classes. He does seem knowledgeable though.",0
"Some people wouldnt really get this subject and the way he teaches. If you skip some lectures, there is almost no other way to prepare for tests. I personally recommend not to take DBA625 as your professional option. Dont risk it if you can.",1
If your not a good writer and you can't put in a ton of details or think outside the box when it comes to writing an essay avoid taking her class. What a B average in other English classes is a C in her English classes. Her choice in short stories are bland and hard to follow. Avoid her classes if your not an English major or a hardcore writer.,0
"Dr. Goldman is a great history teacher. She enjoys having passionate and important discussions about history. Her tests are not difficult, and you don't have to memorize any dates. As long as you follow directions and put in effort, you will get an A.",1
She is a great professor that gives you clues on how to remember the material. She gives extra credit which really helps boost your grade. She is more than willing to answer any questions. I got an A but I did have to study for it.,1
"Awesome! He gives you acronyms to help you remember challenging anatomical concepts. If you take him, you will pass, I sure did! I did not do as well as I had hoped, as anatomy is hard and his tests are very specific, but I walked out of his class knowing A LOT, and feeling that I learned more than any other anatomy professor could have taught me.",1
Professor Lutzer was a tough grader. His lectures were incredibly disorganized and the homework had absolutely nothing to do with the lectures themselves. The only positive aspect of his class was how he included solutions to some selected questions from the homework. If you really want to learn linear algebra take this class with someone else.,0
"Dr. Snow is so awesome!!! She is funny, caring and gives great lectures. She gives 'pop' quizzes after many of the reading assignments that are easy grades. Highly recommend taking her, I hope I can have her in the future again for my professor.",1
"Dr. McCoy is freaking clown shoes. Like Eli, she is the best mayne, she deed it. That means she's completely awful. She once did check-expects for 40 minutes until she realized she was doing it wrong and then proceeded to correct herself for another 10-15 minutes, and then for the remaining 20 taught the material she intended, poorly at that.",0
"I've taken this prof twice before and loved it, but his online class is horrible. He has assigned twice the workload of his in-person classes (10 books for this class), there is NO interaction with other students, and little from him. His long, typed lectures are hard to get through, and there are few grades given, BEWARE. Impossible workload.",0
Heard from a couple of classmates that she can be kinda rude. Tests are filled with trick questions but you often won't have enough time to catch them. It's only lectures and readings. Not the worst class but not engaging at all.,0
"Maureen has a specific set of hoops that she expects her students to jump through, do that carefully and you'll be fine. Follow the syllabus schedule carefully, read her handouts, speak up in class and don't take things personally. Maureen cares a lot and wants all of her students to do well, she is more than willing to meet outside of class time.",1
Best prof. i've had here. Credible and passionate about his subject.,1
Absolutely pathetic. The amount of homework is INSANE. Over 5 to 8 different homework assignments in JUST A WEEK. Doesn't know how to teach a thing. Just bs lectures. TA's don't do the grading on time and post insane amount of homework 3 - 4 days before class. I would give this guy a 0 rating but it's not possible.,0
Easy A. Enough said.,1
Dr. Schuster is a very professional & old school type of teacher. He also has a very fun and interactive personality. His teaching styles are very straight forward and he gets down to business when it's class time. Attendance is a must and he is very particular about it. Go into office and look over papers for his class though. Strong paper grader,1
"She doesn't teach us anything. Every weekly class session she talks about her personal life, berates us for not knowing the material she isn't teaching us, and then if we ask her to explain the topics we are supposed to be learning she says ""that isn't her teaching style"". I'm changing majors because of this professors incompetence. AVOID HER",0
She's hot!,1
"she is really a great teacher. she explains everything very well, The tests are kinda hard, but it you study you should do fine",1
"Sherry Ferguson is an amazing prof! She is so respectful and caring towards her students. Her lectures are easy to understand and interesting. Exam material is not too difficult, just make sure you make use of the textbook. Shes also always open to getting to know her students and making us as comfortable with the course as possible. Great TAS!",1
"her lectures are clear but her test are hard, spend lots of time looking over your notes not the book ",1
"Hard teacher. Sister took this class, she did something to make him mad at her, when I took this class, he took it out on me!",0
"The high scores from other reviewers are because this class is ridiculously easy, but what for Tim lacks in challenge he makes up for with insane long rambles. This Epics take at least 20min and they are as pointless as this class. You can go months without learning in class .This class rivals Nyquil for its power to put people to sleep",0
"She assigns a variety of homework from online problems. written homework, discussions, and practice modules. Though she will also help to solve issues you may have with them as long as you bring it up. She always took time for us to do problems to better learn the material. I do recommend her but she is not the easiest.",1
Awesome professor! Lectures were very interesting and she puts a ton of links to articles relating to the each weeks material on the online syllabus. Grade is based mostly on numerous short writing assignments (longest was 5 pages). Gave a take home final with just a couple essay questions.  Not too hard to get a A. Highly recommended professor.,1
"nicest lady around. she does pick favourites, but it isn't hard to be one. just raise your hand in class and give suggestions! thats the only criteria and she'll love you. shes very easy going, very approachable and she wants to help you. ive had her twice and they are always my least-stress class because she's so understanding!",1
"Might as well be a self study course.  Class ""notes"" come directly from the book ... VERBATIM!  And then he reads them as ""lectures"".  Read the book, skip class, make an occasional appearance to see if the test dates have changed and y",0
Anyone giving him a 5 doesnt know what they are saying. The guy sucks,0
As a counselor shes inspired me to change CCs and has shown me why ARC has a transfer rate of only 7% She is late to every meeting 20+ min It turns out Ive been taking classes that arent even transferrable She recommends you change majors because her gf is unhappy in the career youre after & she claims to have not gotten your emails Worst experien,0
She was my middle school teacher and was great having again :) weird i got remember by Ms. Stewart lol Yeah suggestions just pay attention and you will pass her class !,1
"He is not my kind of teacher.  Students goes to school for higher education, better knowledge but not for ""fun"".  Not well worth taking his course.",0
Worst professor I have taken in 3 years at this university. His operating systems class uses an in development language called Rust with a buggy compiler and no real world application. His assignments deal with web servers and shells and emphasize learning this language rather than operating systems.,0
Dr. Capozzi is definatly entertaining!  The class is hard but my advice is attend every class and museum visit and do the extra credit.  If you have any questions or concerns talk to him.  I had considered dropping the course due to low test scores and he adviced me to hang in there.  I ended up with a C.  He is very kind and understanding.,1
"She typically lets the class out a little early and gives a five min break in the middle of class which is great in a 3 hour night lecture. The whole class is lecture which stinks and she is strict against phones but it is a great class and she makes night classes bearable with her humor, I'd take again.",1
"Mr. Zant is a  nice teacher I'll say that much, but the way he teaches the material is boring. Most of the questions come from the textbooks and the way he words the questions make it difficult to understand. Exams were too long to finish in the amount of time given and tons of material to remember. Would recommend another professor.",0
"Dr. Pave is very structured and organized which I like. I took his class for a 5week summer course, so it was heavy. Initially it was overwhelming reading his syllabus. However, he does seem like he really cares about his students. He is active on Canvas, posting weekly. He is prompt to respond to emails. Do the work and you should pass.",1
"Before this class I could not tell you one thing about history and its wars but after I feel knowledgeable on the subject in the best way! She made learning fun and interesting, very helpful and understanding. One of the best teachers!",1
"calderon is a nice man, but his class was a mess. Unorganized, repetitive, the entire class consisted of him advocating for illegal latino immigrant rights and the rights of farm workers- which is fine, but not really relevant to the class.He wanted everybody to write about the topic and if you didn't he would argue with you and give you a low grad",0
"at first Donald Burke was doing an amazing job covering interesting topics however, Anderson does not provide no review. All his slide are pictures and videos. Does not cover the importance of the topic. Bad experience within second semester. 1865 World of Relgion. The course is interesting but bad prof  (Anderson)",0
Cool professor! Likes to make the class entertaining by getting students to participate practicing spanish even if they don't want to do so. Her reactions to spanish meanings are cool too. HW and quizzes come directly from the textbook and online assignments linked together. Her style flows very well with the material being taught.,1
"Phillips is a well enough writer/philosopher, but he is a terrible lecturer. He's often at a loss on what to think or say about the material, or hasn't read it in years in some cases. Tons of long silences and confused mumbles. He expects students to do all the teaching for him, so if you don't get a room full of talkative grads, you're screwed.",0
One of the best professors I've seen at Hopkins so far. Crystal clear in explaining the concepts and doing examples and extremely good handwriting. He loves orgo and will actually make you love it too. Exams are fair but you have to know how to apply the concepts. Curves generously. If you're in his class you're lucky.,1
"I've had a few classes with Dave, and he's the best.  His classes fly by because you're having so much fun listening to him tell stories and relate comm theories.  Be careful, though.  As fun as he is, his tests are pretty tough.  Dave expects a lot of his students, so be sure to take good notes, learn main points from the book, and STUDY.",1
professor ducasse is a very nice man but his class is absolutely dreadful. the material isnt made clear and he continuously drones on about things that arent relevant at all. no one in my class ever had any idea what was going on. the material isnt difficult but the way that he teaches it is absolutely awful.,0
"He is the worst professor I have ever studied. He is rude, not supportive. The outline is hard to explain, there is no textbook and he will not say this week for which study, which document. You can't ask questions if you don't understand. He makes u embarrassing if you can't follow what he is teaching ""I already explained it last week""???",0
very intresting and fun. Very helpful,1
"Great teacher! Explains everything with clarity, answers all the questions (even the weird ones) and is very patient and understanding. Uses the textbook very often. External materials aren't needed often, but can help. Take his class!",1
"One of the best professors I've had. She loves her job and you can tell, class is always interesting. She gives 3 test with 5 questions from the book rest from lecture, as well as bonus questions. I made an A and never read the book!",1
"Professor Hewitt is extremely fair. He gives two debates and a major debate at the end of the term. He communicates well and he is easy to listen to. This class requires a lot of preparation if you want to do well in the debates. We ended up not having pop quizzes and if you do well in the final debate, he will exempt you from the final exam! =)",1
"Intro to Public Health. Took it over the summer. VERY clear expectations. 10% atten, 10% quizzes, 10% hw, 20% each for MT and Final, 15% each for group proj and research paper. Grading is not bad, but no late work accepted. VERY easy to contact through email. VERY helpful in terms of instruction. Won't give free grades. Straight-forward attitude.",1
A very fair and approachable instructor.  She takes her job very seriously as well.  She is also very respectful of students.,1
"Bernstock was the worst lecturer I've ever had the displeasure of having. She was erratic, confusing, confusing, unprofessional, and boring. She managed to sour one of my absolute favorite topics of learning with her in-class outbursts. The class itself was not very enlightening and I would certainly recommend avoiding it. ",0
One of the best professors i've had at hofstra.. I hate sociology but he loved teaching so much that he cried during class when he had to cancel one of our classes and he really cared about the students. Made class easy and explained everythng multiple times before the test.,1
"Graded only on weekly group-written business case papers, and a few individual. The papers need to be re-written if they are not done correctly. Once you know what he is looking for you will be fine. His lectures prep you for each case- hinting at what is important. Learned SO MUCH from this brilliant man! Take him for this class!!!",1
Teachings are solely power point based and all polling questions like youre supposed to know the material already. I got a 100 in the lab and on all the homework and barely got a B because the test are all trick question based and have nothing to do with the actual material. I would avoid taking this professor at all cost.,0
"NEVER TAKE HIM AS A PROFESSOR. Worst professor i ever had. never marks our assignments, it took him over two MONTHS to mark our stuff. His favorite catch phrase when we ask for help is ""keep Taping at it guys"". Did not learn anything in the class. he is the worst professor to have. he is useless. we had to teach our selves.",0
"Burke is the best teacher I've ever had!  She inspired me to change my major to chemistry.  I've taken her for Organic Chemistry and Advanced Organic Chemistry.  Know the in class notes inside out, and you'll pass any test she gives you.",1
"She was wonderful, helpful and patient. Don't be afraid to ask her a question because she truly cares and will even stay after class to go through steps. Truly a sweet person.",1
"Mrs. Peters is a well organized teacher and is always prepared for class but her teaching methods are horrible. She teaches everything the long way. Alot of our class had issues with her method of teaching. Not very helpful when a question is asked, always gives general answers. Very sarcastic attitude. Not very helpful. Would not recommend her!",0
One of the best profs at Trent! He's super informative and knows his stuff.,1
I took this class online and i will say that he is very organized every thing was easy to find and very clear. i never had any issues with responses to questions. i was able to work ahead if i wanted. he does not take any late work though he states that his deadlines are clear. test and quizes you can do very well on just go over study guides.,1
"Good, interesting SWS class. If you need to take one, this is a solid choice. His grading system is clear cut, with a schedule given at the beginning of the semester for every assignment. Tests are easy if you pay attention to lectures and go over the power-points, though they are all writing. As long as you put in a little effort, you'll be fine.",1
"Great teacher. His main point to the class was for you to open your world to other people and ideas. He's a pretty liberal guy, so if you swing the other way, you might not enjoy the class so much. Picks readings from a wide variety of authors and poets. Class was very enjoyable for myself, I was actually sad to have to miss a few while sick.",1
"King is a sweet guy who knows a lot about history, however he is a horrible teacher! He gives you notes that have no information in them and makes you read an unrealistic amount from the textbook each week. He expects that everyone knows history just as well as him which is obviously not the case. If you take this class, avoid this teacher!",0
"Unfair marker and condescending. Avoid at all costs, this man is infamous around campus.",0
"Dr. Gaitros is a really good teacher. Sure, the class is lecture heavy, but what else would it be since it is all about computers? There is a lot of homework and it can be heavily piled up and due on one day if you do not take the time to complete before. Assignments are easy, just do them! Does not accept late work. Attendance is not mandatory!",1
Reading the comments here from students makes me remember my undergrad days when Shari Mann taught at Ryerson University and I had the displeasure of having her as my professor for multiple accounting courses. Nothing has changed more then a decade later. It is sad to see a person who hates her job continue to do it and ruin an important subject,0
"Ok.. in my experience, he's a very easy marker. I'll probably end up with a 90% in this 4th year mandatory English class. But he does not lecture, he kind of just wings it for the whole time. Plus an average of 7 weeks wait for assignments back. We never ONCE used the textbook readings he assigned, which were over 250 pages each (I didn't read any)",0
Super helpful with any and all questions. Will take time out of class to make sure everyone understands the material. Gives lots of review material and provides a lot of study information. Takes work and studying to get an A but great teacher!,1
"Great man overall, tough grader on papers and his lectures are important to listen to and participate in. His tests are from the readings and from class lectures but are all fair questions and he isn't trying to trick you. If you participate at least once in every class it will help you out in the long run because he cares about participation.",1
"Literally, unlike how everyone says their teacher is the best, this teacher's vibe is extraordinary. Very welcoming vibe and great environment of learning. She cares for everyone and I mean it!!! Highly recommend her out of any teacher so far that I've taken. Go for her :)",1
Its a crappy class totally not what I expected or wanted.  Nothing in class is organized he just kinda rambles.  Avoid it if you can.,0
Ishiguro is so awful! He finishes EVERY class at least 5 minutes late and makes everyone late for the classes they have afterwards. I wouldn't recommend his class to my worst enemy I really don't like him and he also isn't very good at explaining theories or ideas. DON'T DO IT!!!!,0
So I wouldn't trust any reviews because it seems like he changes his exam method & teaching method every semester. Online in the summer probably won't be bad because you can look up answers. Exams this semester were ridiculously specific and meant to trick you rather than test material. Final was cumulative and on paper. I learned nothing.,0
"Amazing teacher, he knows his stuff. Hes the type that wants you to succeed. He will tell you life stories that will help you in all aspects of life, not just your career. Definitely take him. Sit at the front and listen as he will give you golden nuggets.",1
"Allow me to say that he is one of the most amazing professors I have ever seen. Amazing lectures, easy quizzes, a lot of part marks, dedicated and the most understanding professor I have ever seen. Amazing person, I have nothing to complain about. There are no words to explain how awsome he is. He is one in a million.",1
"Professor Kenney is very knowledgeable. I feel that I learned a lot from his class. Topics are interesting. He appreciates participation which keeps class flowing. Do not be afraid to share your opinion, even if it is not popular. He can handle it and I appreciate him for that.",1
This class was my worst experience at TWU. The Prof lacks knowledge in the practicality of actual filmmaking.,0
She goes way too fast through the material,0
"He has really informative videos that are accessible anytime, and they are well organized. Definitely need to be actively paying attention as his class is on the difficult side, but I would say that's chemistry in general. I would recommend taking him, but be ready to put in the work.",1
"Zellers is a really cool guy and so passionate about history. This class was pretty boring but he gave no homework, just 2 papers and 2 exams. You must do well on these to do well in the class because there are no other grades. He gives an extra credit essay and extra credit for perfect attendance.",1
"For the first month the class held together, but by the midterm the majority of the class had dropped (myself included). It became evident about a week into the course that the professor didn't understand the topic she was trying to teach us. Add to that incomprehensible grading criteria. I have never dropped a class before, but I do not regret it.",0
eh,0
"Had to drop this class with this professor given how haphazard he was in his approach to teaching. Trying to help students learn accounting by referencing our ""gold chains"" as assets isn't going to help me get my degree and provide me with a solid GPA. How he manages to slip by and continue teaching I'll never understand.",0
"Class based entirely on the textbook. I usually try to avoid calling classes an ""easy A"" but the phrase would be pretty spot-on. Not interesting at all, but a good class to take if it is required for your program. Attendance not mandatory (at least in COVID-times). A bit arbitrary in terms of grading the midterms.",1
"He's a piece of work.  Class isn't so bad, but I probably learned more about the origins of Apple Computers and what to look for in buying a digital camera than Anayltical Chemistry.  Notes/overheads were horrid, but if you understood CHEM 120/123, you're fine for this course.",0
"Dr. Greenberg is honestly so boring. I don't really recall ever paying attention to his lectures. On the bright side, taking notes on his PowerPoint slides help tremendously. When you review them, you understand the material perfectly. During his exams, he lets you use a single side of paper for notes to assist you. This is extremely helpful.",0
"I highly recommend not taking any of his classes. Don't get me wrong, he is a great guy. The issues I had with him were his way of teaching which is super disorganized, the lack of assignments (2 or 3), and he never gave me any feedback on my assignments unless I emailed him and asked for them! I didn't get my final paper grade until after my final",0
"Miss one class? Hell assign a paper up to 10 pg long. Lectures are erratic, jumbled and heavily based on opinion as opposed to fact. Most classes dominated by student presentations, which he interrupts to state his opinions. Wasnt given a single grade all of first semester. To him, if you professionally disagree, youre rude and arguing",0
"Don't bother buying the text book, but you will need the code for online weekly quizzes. Show up to class and you will get the answers to extra credit questions. She is super nice and laid back. Can replace lowest test grade (including final) with attendance grade. ",1
Took Intro to Am Gov; for an intro class I learned a lot. Respectful of students opinions and encourages input. Very clear and good lectures.,1
"He is probably the best professor at GCC. He is incredibly kind, understanding, and genuinely cares about you - and how you do in his class!",1
"Great prof, if you do the textbook problems and whatever examples from tutorial, you should be fine.",1
"She is a very compassionate teacher.  Yes, the homework is a bit difficult, but if you read the text and go for help- you can get it done.  She is a more than a fair grader, I would take a class of hers again.",1
Fairly decent course. Except mary needs to learn to take into consideration that other peoples opinions may be different from her own and learn to accept that. Found her quite pushy and manipulated the influential people easily with her own biased way of thinking.,0
"took him for an online classes. Very easy and manageable for a fulltime student with work and other things. only had four quizzes and no exam each quiz was 50-75 questions, pretty long but very easy. would recommend taking him if you want a smooth professor.",1
"Dr. Yang is a great professor. She is very knowledgeable in sociology and passionate about both it and her students. She cares about student learning and is very committed to student success. I have taken multiple classes from her and enjoyed everyone. She is not a professor that will just pass you, you have to earn your grade, to me this is great.",1
"It's my second time to take his course, his exams are super hard and you have to practice and remember various question types then you can get good grade. Don't take his course, you'd better to try other profs'.",0
"greenberg is a very nice guy and always willing to help w/ questions. lectures arent very worthwhile but the material isnt that hard. hw is weekly and not very difficult. two midterms and a final, midterms very fair, nothing we hadnt seen before. offered study sessions before tests which were helpful. i recommend this class",1
He is very laid back and as long as you do the work he's cool. The requirements are simple just do the work and you will do well. Don't buy the book he doesn't really use it. You can totally get away with not having it especially if you are already a good writer.,0
"Overall, the grading is fair, BUT he gives out waaay too much work! If you decide to take this class because it's an ""easy A"" it's not if you are not willing to complete all of the assignment assigned. What he talks about in class has nothing to do with what's on the homework.",0
This teacher is a BORE. He rambles about pointless things that have no relation to the subject matter. He grades VERY hard on papers. The only good thin about this class is that he allows you to use your textbook during tests. It won't be easy though because he grades really hard on the essay portions. Only take him if you have ABSOLUTELY no option,0
"dr workman is a passionate professor who cares about your understanding and application of theory. when he is at his best, he will give you great feedback on your papers and presentations. listens to you outside of class. a very real dude. also funny",1
"Highly recommend this professor. He is very friendly and approachable. The course consisted of a midterm, final, attendance, and a term paper (he gives you full credit as long as you do it). He also assigns hw that he goes over in the next class. The exams are 50 MCQs, very straight forward, no surprises. Do the work and you will get an A. ",1
"Good teacher, very energetic, keeps the class interesting. definitely put as much input as you can, earns major points. kind of helpful as a teacher, would tell me what i did wrong but even after doing the same thing over and over, he was unclear on what he wanted changed. said my head was up my a**. very lenient with the course structure and tests",1
"Don't take her. Not a nice person at all, always seems to have a stick up her rear end. Tests are difficult and she is a tough grader.",0
"Nice prof. However, seems to be biased towards certain students. Overall okay",1
"Professor Bekes is a very laid back teacher and will usually let class out early.  He understands the material very well, but has a hard time teaching the material and explaining it.  If you take this course with Bekes I recommend getting help from the Drahmann center or make sure that you have some sort of previous knowledge of statistics.",0
"Dr. Hughes was very specific and was not understanding what so ever. Beware, if you are in the military...she is not a fan of military personnel and the duties that we all have. It was very frustrating and discerning.",0
"He is a very kind, very smart man. He does push the limit of realism though when it comes to how many pages a person can humanly read in 4 days. 300 of a difficult novel? no way.",1
Dr. D is a pretty nice guy.  He's a pretty easy grader.  His class and the material you cover is soooo boring.  I's crazy.  I do not believe this class should be mandatory for education majors.,1
"The most boring teacher EVERRRR.  He's a really nice guy, but everything he says is full of crap. He really does make up a lot of the info in class, and sticks to what he says claiming the textbook is wrong. Lectures are EXTREMELY boring, consisting of him writing on the board and not addressing the class whatsoever.",0
At first I though he was unreasonably hard.  He is a really good guy and will push you beyond your comfort zone.  As long as he sees that you go don't just do the minimum you will do very well in his classes.  Very strange sense of humor and funny laugh.  Ended up being one of my best experiences with a professor.,1
"I had an APA guidebook (2020 ed.) that I consulted religiously during assignments, and he still always found ""massive problems"" with my formating. Feedback was always given late. I don't like not being able to find redeeming qualities about professors, but Burck made it very hard for me to find something positive about him and the course.",0
"Professor demanded perfection from students while constantly being late on his promises to the class. He pushed deadline for the final assignment 3 times, totaling two weeks and and kept failing to provide the assignment specs. In the end, he didn't even provide what he had promised and basically said ""too bad."" There were also lectures missing.",0
COO-KOO! Nuf' said.,0
He is the most useless prof. for the chem lab at Kettering. Unwilling to help and does not care about any students what so ever. Do not take this professor is possible. Only reason I got a decent grade was because I knew the material before hand.,0
"WORST PROFESSOR AT MUN. Do not bother going to the class. Most disorganized and boring lecture ever. As long as you write in ""12 pt font"" you will get at least a B, you will get marks even if your answer is completely wrong! He does not emphasize any important points, and the questions he chooses for midterms are random. Don't bother caring.",0
"I took the full year shakespeare course and barely went to class. ended up with a 70. the lectures that i did go to were very entertaining. he's really funny and witty, he's definitely not a boring lecturer. however, the lectures were definitely too long. ",1
"Horrible prof, one of the worse prof I have ever met. If someone told you that prof cannot to anything they want to do because we as a student can stop him... (this guy can).. even the department cant stop his bad teaching. Solution to passing his course is to depend on MIT videos (amazing prof btw). He should just retire...",0
"Subdued and straightforward, but smart and very helpful. Dedicated to the students and extremely willing to help. His quiet nerdiness is endearing,he brings in desserts to demonstrate scientific concepts and he caters to student needs. Understands we are not geology majors and still tries to make things interesting. Great prof.",1
I kinda feel sorry for her because she just doesn't seem to know much or have any confidence.  I expect more for a university class.,0
"Terrible teacher, mean, angry, does not care about his students; I don't know why he ever became a teacher. Have to study a lot and use the textbook.  DONT take him you will regret it",0
"The course is not an easy bird course to take because the content is quite hard to understand if you have no previous science background such as physics and biology. He will post readings before lectures and slides after lectures, as well as review guidelines before exams. He is a nice person and he is alwasy willing to answer questions.",1
"Best professor to teach this course. Anyone who has her has a great chance of getting an A in her class due to the clarity of her teaching. Took this course with a different prof in the 1st sem and was almost failing; then switched my section to her class and got perfect on my final. Amazing, really want her to teach my other courses",1
"Professor West is passionate about what he teaches. He believes in helping everyone pass and is always willing to help outside of class. Attendance is crucial! He covers a lot in one class and if you miss a class you will fall behind. But even then, if you make the effort to seek his help, he's always there to offer it.",1
Professor Heyrman is an all-around perfect history professor. Her lectures are very easy to follow and her quizzes and exams do not contain any surprises. She is also very funny in class and interesting to be around. I would definitely consider taking another one of her classes.,1
"Price gives great lectures. Never coded before but caught on quickly thanks to his help. Exams, however, hurt me. Tests are HARD and are designed to trick you if possible. Price often seems rather condescending/arrogant, but that's his personality. The final is OPTIONAL. I skipped it and took a B. Solid course, hope you're up for the challenge.",1
"READ THE BOOK. Lectures are not specific enough to prep for the exam. Go through all of the problems at the end of the book to do well. Exams are super specific and the grading is awful. Don't beat yourself up if you get your first D on his exam bc 50% of your grade is the final. Avoid if possible, or be prepared to work hard with little guidance.",0
Said he would curve the final grades everyone had as the class average was around a 60 and he never did. The slides and readings only teach the basics and there are concepts on the test that arent taught (I did every reading and studied the slides).,0
"Professor Chuck Bunn is not caring at all. He gives great feedback on assignments which he grades very hard, but if a family situation happens, or you accidentally miss a assignment its a automatic absence. I wish I never took his class. Don't waste your time.",0
Wragg's the finest example I know of how NOT to teach a college class: concentrate on being everyone's buddy instead of actually doing your job and TEACHING the FRACKIN' material.,0
"Prof Leidig wants everyone to answer questions to earn a decent grade, but you better know what you're answering or else. There apparently is not a right/wrong answer. Great class that made me want to learn more about what I need to know in my job.",1
"this class was so boring, and her lectures didn't help any.  she's really smart but doesn't know how to keep people's attention.  2 papers, 1 test, and a group project so the work load wasn't too bad",1
"I used this website to choose lauren as my speech teacher because of her good rating. I shouldve read a little more carefully when doing so because her negative reviews and characteristics outweigh the positives. She neglects students, is unorganized, and you have to constantly repeat yourself with her.",0
"If your'e taking this class just to fulfill a history gen ed, don't bother. Prof. Holden is strict but rightfully so, I appreciated his passion for and great knowledge of Latin America. This class is difficult for a 100 level course and his lectures are boring and long but he says good stuff.",0
"three 3 page papers all semester, gives you a list of topics. never read a single story yet managed to get a B on all of them. he does call on random people to give opinions of the story though. attendance is 40% and the papers are 60%. class can get very boring. overall great guy.",1
"Professor Garren is knowledgable on the subject he is teaching, but the class overall is very hard. You cannot miss a single class or you will fall way behind, the homework is pretty challenging sometimes if you miss any key points in the lecture, and the tests are extremely hard. personally wouldn't retake this course with this teacher",0
Worst professor I have ever had by far. Stay away from this if you can. The only grade comes from 4 tests which are very hard to pass as an average student. I lowered my GPA so much.,0
"This class is graded on two group presentations, two 10 page papers, and weekly discussion posts. His lectures are not the most exciting as he is a bit of a rambler, but he is obviously passionate about his work. The textbooks are a must-have and help you with everything you're graded on.",1
"Does not make art history interesting in the slightest. For each the midterm and final, she requires that we know the name, artist, and date of somewhere around 500 paintings; such a waste of brain space.",0
"Mixed feelings. She has days where she's really helpful and then days where you're better off on your own. She's very nice, but tends to speak too quickly for comprehension. Work is easy and straightforward, moderate amount. As long as you finish two assignmnents and a quiz/ week, you're in good shape. Be prepared for major disorganization, though.",0
"Jack is an amazing professor, I very upset I will not have the chance to be his student again. I have never met anyone so devoted to helping his students succeed, and I doubt I ever will. He has definitely made me believe I can succeed in any course if I try hard enough. He gave our class soo many opportunities to help us learn and raise our marks",1
Dr. Mitterer is the nicest professor at Brock. He is pretty monotone but makes good jokes and is so friendly and makes you want to do well in his class.  It is stressful because everyone says the exam is so hard but it wasn't that bad and he gives a lot of hints! The one paper is really long and tedious and a huge pain but overall John is great!,1
"Lots and lots of reading. You have a quiz, DB with 1 response and a web assignment for each chapter and then a final quiz at the end. The assignments were not hard. Only downside is it takes forever for DB and Web assignments to be graded. Link to book is included so don't purchase one!",1
this professor is useless!!! don't ever take him. There is no way you can understand how he grates you. He will not discuss your grade with you!! AVOID HIM,0
"didn't go to a single lecture, didn't do a single lab more than an hour before it was due, and didn't learn a thing from the class... yet still got an A+!",1
"Worst teacher I've ever had. Expects us to know things never taught. Gives unreasonably hard labs, quizzes, tests and assignments. Gets pleasure off of the failure of her students. Class average is in the 50s and her response is telling us to drop the course and/or program. Has no right to be a teacher. I pray for her future students' survival.",0
"Prof Conner is an amazing teacher, I took her for College Algebra and i am very thankful for everything that i learnt from this class. Math itself is very confusing, but if you pay attention and do homework you will have a good grade. I would recommend her.",1
"He's a good professor who cares about his students. He only gives one assignment per week, which is a short set of MPC questions. His lectures can be hard to understand sometimes, but in response to that, I would suggest reading the chapters of the textbook before he teaches them during lectures.",1
"Definitely the worst class that I've taken at UC Berkeley. I was expecting to be challenged and supported by my professor. Instead we read books that he didn't understand and, therefore, couldn't teach. Moreover, He is not very helpful nor respectful of students. I don't think he has ever really considered viewpoints besides his own.",0
"She was not very helpful to someone who doesnt do well in math. Her grading was unnecessarily tough and she gave a lot of homework.  We only had 3 tests and one group project, though the project didn't even count as a test grade. I found some of her comments were rather rude and unjustified. Overall poor experience and would not suggest taking her.",0
"Awesome teacher!! I really wasn't looking forward to the class originally, but now i can't wait to go. I love it! Web-enhanced, but its worth it. I assure you that there is not a better teacher than Chuck. The class is easy (lots of videos and slides) but worth the while.He's very funny. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!",1
"I had no problems with her teaching,  I asked her for help outside of hours, was told she was too busy. Right after I went to the office of someone I know and while they looked at what is called Forum for faculty & staff, she had just posted and it had nothing to do with work at all. More important than helping a student I guess.",0
arfa cost seeta... it might help if i didn't need wang to english dictonary to understand.  this class needs subtitles.,0
"He doesn't teach you anything. You read from the book, then make 3 discussions about whatever he wants and do 3 projects, that I see as dumb, and that's it. He doesn't interact with his students whatsoever. No help. His tests are on that dumb video recording lock down site. So you best study--with which there is no study guide; all in all, goodluck",0
"Dr. Ramey is a solid professor. He knows what he's teaching, and he does it well. It's an easy class, and it's pretty interesting. There are some easy and short essays on the tests. Attendance is ""mandatory"" because we have in-class assignments almost every class that are weighted pretty heavily. Nothing flashy, but not bad at all.",1
"Great guy, really friendly, has a laidback personality and a sense of humour. Explained material well, and helped students who needed it. Tests are open book/note, so GO TO THE LECTURE! That way you can take good notes and do well on all of the exams.",1
"Surprisingly difficult, and Prof Khalsa isn't very understanding.  Pay attention to the syllabus - we weren't allowed to miss a SINGLE class, and that gets tough after a while.  I was so excited to take this, but have ended up hating it.  Unless you're REALLY serious, I'd stay away.",0
"His class is not for ""average"" CS students. To pass his class you either have to work hard or have access to hw/test ahead of time. Unless you understand every hw like the back of your head, you are likely to get a 0/50 on his tests. His hws are long, tricky and borderline un-doable without google. If you're forced to take him, Good Luck!",0
such a good teacher knows what he is talking about it and makes class fun to go to. class attendance is required though because you get randomly called on. all in all i would definitely take this teacher.,1
Take him! This class is fully asynchronous but he has taught it this way years before COVID so it is a very organized asynchronous class. STAT in general is very difficult but I think he is the best professor to take for it.,1
"It is so disappointing that EWU lets this teacher teach at all. I have taken this class at another school and understood it very well, now I am in it here with this teacher and it is impossible to understand or learn anything. He does not grade anything or give any feedback. He also wont work with you on ANYTHING. Avoid this teacher at all costs.",0
He's is a really nice guy but his class is way too hard. The quizzes are doable but his tests are impossible if you are not a naturally born history person. I was a 4.0 student in high school and ended up with a C in the class (my only C). Avoid his class if possible but if you must take his class DO ALL THE EXTRA CREDIT OPPORTUNITIES.,0
Algorithms=the Devil; Prof =wonderful=devil's advocate,1
"Do not take her! She is not accessible outside of class, makes you talk to the TAs instead of her. She is condescending and just tells you that you are incorrect. She does not tell you what is wrong about your answers and expects everything to be in extreme detail.",0
"Run for the hills, unless you like literary analysis. She can be flighty and scattered, not to mention did NOT cut students any slack, even with COVID-19. Some professors who teach gen-ed freshman courses think that their course needs to be super-hard and demanding. I disagree. You will learn much more and even have fun with another professor.",0
"This professor is very hard to understand, boring to listen to, and his grading is all over the place. He drops your lowest test grade, but the tests are very difficult. Once you realize the tests come from the review, he changes it so that the questions come from nowhere. Do not recommend.",0
"Dr. Bachman is AMAZING! very nice woman, always willing to help. extremely approachable! take this class with her!",1
"Take a tape recorder to class and record what he says.  Then memorize it, and write it out on the tests and exams.  Don't even bother trying to come to your own opinion since his is the only one that counts.  Even if the text and everyone else on earth disagrees, he's still ""right"". Avoid his class!",0
"The best professor I have ever had. She is hilarious, sweet, and an amazing teacher. I learned more in a semester with her than I did in 5 years of German in high school. Highly recommended.",1
Dr. Malecha is insanely smart and passionate about what he does. First day of class I was scared because of how he basically yells his lectures but by the second class I deeply admired his teaching style. The tests are not bad and you get the essay questions ahead of time. He expects his students to participate which is a good thing.,1
low stress classes in which he clearly displays his knowledge of the topic,1
"AWFUL. Took this online, his tests are 70% of the grade (4 tests in total), so don't even worry about doing all the homework and quizzes assigned if you do poorly on even one of the tests. You fail a single test, you might as well already withdraw. Amazing how you must teach yourself the subject (its online) and then the grading criteria is strict",0
"Dr. Jinn doesn't care about long-term learning, and spent more time making fun of the students than lecturing about the content. He asked the female students inappropriate questions involving their romantic lives, and refused to answer good questions, such as ""why is ____ the case?"" All in all, I would not take this professor again.",0
"After having several emotional breaks due to her, I changed majors.",0
"Dr. Witucki was an amazing professor. She really cares about the students being successful. There is no other professor that I believe could teach organic chem better than her and she is very very organized. Her exams are really difficult, but I found that finding classmates to study with was really helpful! Highly recommend!",1
"She's a great professor, can't recommend her enough. I found her to be somewhat tough with grades but she gives good feedback and her expectations are clear. For immersion students she speaks very clearly and her lectures are very fun and easy to follow.",1
"Love Dr. Carty! Very knowledgable and will help you with any problem, just make sure to actually do your work",1
"This class so far has been an absolute waste of my tuition dollars. I have never been one to complain about watching movies, but that is all you will do in this class. I would be okay with it if I were at least learning something, but it has been ridiculous. I have learned nothing from this class that I couldn't have learned independently.",0
"Nice guy, but take my advice and buy the book. His notes suck. Don't waste your time cheating off last year's quizzes either, he has caught on and changes them now.",0
Her lectures are a huge help (incredibily boring though) but could probably still get by for missing a couple. The texbook is also somewhat mandatory.,0
Her instructions are as clear as mud but the flip side is that she doesn't actually expect much from you in terms of getting work in on time.  She's also a really sweet person and very smart.,1
"The guy is awesome.  He is hilarious, caring, patient, and smarter than most of us realize.  I loved his class.",1
"Jim is a great professor. Attend all his lectures and get there early and sometimes stay late, sometimes hell give extra points if you stay after. Study the material from the study guides and the lecture notes and you'll do good on the test! He makes you work for your grade but its a great class and you'll find yourself fascinated by rocks after.",1
She inundates the class with lots of extraneous information. This makes it unclear what core material we should focus on for exams. The result of this teaching style is that I have memorized a great deal this semester and learned virtually nothing useful.,0
"Dr. DeYoung is very knowledgeable and skilled in his field, however, his ""field"" should not include teaching. He calls on students throughout each class and publicly belittles them for not knowing answers. Homework is extremely unclear and don't even think about asking any questions unless you wanna be made fun of. Avoid at all costs.",0
Man this class was bad. Seems like a great guy but as a prof he's terrible. Textbook is confusing as hell as are his lectures. Not necessarily because of the material but because of the way each (the text and lectures) have been laid out.,0
Professor P is so so so good. Finance was one of the classes I was most scared of taking in undergrad but he really does an amazing job of explaining concepts and breaking them down. Gives study guides similar to exams. Extra credit. One project. Also is just plain nice and positive and encouraging. Take him if you're lucky!,1
"Kello is a nice guy, but he is clearly way more focused on his research than on his teaching. He barely prepares his lectures and his assignments are thrown together last minute and are extremely vague, almost unintelligible. The class was obviously an afterthought for him, and he is not experienced enough to wing it.",0
"Professor Moton is probably the hardest professors I've had yet. He requires so much work and probably forgets that people have other classes, children and jobs. Although he does give good feedback, his grading is very harsh. I do not suggest taking his classes!",0
"Uses the textbook as a guide for the structure of the course. As long as the assignments and labs are done, exams are not too bad.",1
Profe is one of the best teachers that I've had a Creighton. I look forward to her classes every week. She loves what she does and expects a lot from her students. I came out of the class a WAYYYY better speaker. She is very funny and keeps the class interesting. As long as you have a solid understanding of the language you'll be good,1
"Taking a course from Dr. Eller is akin to having your brain cracked open everyday. She will break you down and build you up, she expects you to work on the courseload as hard as she has. Don't waste her time, or yours, if you aren't dedicated to learning the subject matter.",1
He's great.  Knows his stuff and knows how to teach it.  Interesting discussions.  And he's hilarious.  Learned and laughed a lot.  Can't complain about that!,1
As a person he's a nice guy but his teaching skills needs more work. He will literally take the whole class period on a 2 examples that have no corelation to what you're going to be tested on. There's a lot of homework/quizzes that are easy but they won't help you with the exams. Don't miss class cause after a certain amount he'll subtract points.,0
This has been THE single hardest class I have ever taken at Creighton. The classroom environment is intimidating and very demanding. This is a capstone course so you have to get a 'C' to graduate. He treats the class like a Stanford MBA course. I would avoid his class at any cost! Look for Laura Mizaur who also teaches it. Midterm average= 36%,0
"If you are a weak math student, do not take this course with Ostry. His lectures are boring and not interactive. He does not provide assignments to keep you on track throughout the semester, and the text is hard to understand without supplemental material. As many people before have said, take it with Amsel.",0
I thought we were suppose to be refining what's in our minds and not what's in her mind. He assignments felt like she was mining her students for info that would help her next book of criticism. She gives a lot of work and very little valid feedback. I'd look for a more generous teacher whose easier on your grades.,0
"Professor Gary is a solid professor. Sometimes I just wished that he would explain the topics in a bit more simple terms, but he is definitely approachable and willing to help you out if you are lost. He gave us about 2 quizzes a week which made up 25% of the final grade. Definitely not a bad choice for physics 111, I would recommend him.",1
"She is a nice woman, and her accent is not hard to understand. The class as a whole is fairly easy, just do the readings and come to class. However, class itself is super boring! She talks to you all hour, instead of having it be a discussion on what we read. Also, she can be unclear on what she wants you to learn exactly. ",0
"Provided online lectures during the pandemic, but they were extremely long and forced you to remember a lot. Only get one attempt for homework. Gives you a study guide, but pulls the ""not everything will be on the test"" card. Unrealistic student expectations and difficulty, especially for a low 300 level class.",0
"What a cutie!  So Nice!!  Ya he can be hard to understand at times, but just give the text book a quick read and you will get the gist.  Word of advice - look at old midterms!",1
"Hilder is lovely - she is very kind and cares about her students! She's a tough grader, though. Make sure you thoroughly edit your papers for her class. Her lectures always inspire me. Even when class is over I'm still thinking about the material we discussed. She encourages me to keep pursuing my dreams of English and creative writing.",1
"Allen is a cool guy, lectures really boring though he just talks the whole time hoping somebody will ask a question. Gives a few exams that are blue book style but pretty clear and fair. Assigns four books but I doubt anybody reads them he explains them in class. Decent class for a GenEd easy A.",1
"Great professor, easy A.",1
Hurd's lectures feel like he is just rambling on. I would try to listen closely and follow along but would quite often getting lost in what he was saying and miss things that were already said. He is funny at times. He only posts an outline of notes and uses them as the slides. Doesn't give a lot of material. Just read and study the textbook.,0
"Amy is amazing teacher, is fair with her grading. She asks for you to be present for the online discussions; however, if you are unable to attend she will post the discussion for you to listen and then make written description of what was talked about. I really enjoyed doing her class and I would take her again.",1
Do not take his class. He is one of the most unprofessioal professors I have ever met. Terrible at teaching and explaining. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS.,0
Just dont do it... you'll thank me later.,0
"Professor Datt has continuous technology issues, especially with online class. The microphone is difficult to hear and his slides are blurry. He also can be difficult to understand and is unapproachable. There are only 4 grades (tests) for the entire semester, and they are extremely specific and difficult. I am an all A student who barely passed.",0
Lectures very engaging with solid worked examples. Took time to answer questions in class and was very approachable and helpful during office hours,1
Doesn't know how to park at Tim Horton's TOTAL FAUX-PAS!!!,0
Prof. Burns is extremely nice. She responds to emails quickly and does everything she can to help you learn. The average score on exams can be low but that's because 121 is a hard class - the averages are low with every professor. It's possible (and probable) to get an A in her class if you do the weekly readings and homework. I strongly recommend!,1
"I don't recommend at all. U will not know about nothing, unless you struggle by your self.",0
"No attendance but sometimes he counted it as extra credits. Tests are from all the slides. The half final tests are mainly about human anatomy, pretty easy though, as long as you study it seriously. Can use your electronic devices in his class.",1
"Great guy.  Very funny, keeps class interesting with jokes.  Pretty easy tests, textbook was not required.  Likes to give lots of pop quizzes, but they are generally easy with usually one silly or very easy question.  Moves through notes kind of fast so hard to keep up at times.  Don't be a Yankees fan lol.",1
"Having Dr. Mori for 2 semesters, I can tell you that she is a very fun and exiting professor. While passionate for teaching and student's needs, she also has a knack for personalized attention. Just be forewarned. In 112, if you do not know how to do secondary dominants, then you will generally be screwed. Singing in class is also fun too.",1
Agree with the last post.  This guy doesn't teach.  I know others who have had him and he is teaching the same thing for all his classes.  He grades at mid term and I suspect that our last paper isn't even read but that is my take on it.  Wonder why he still is teaching?  Who can you take that up with?,0
Class lecture were great.  Test hard,1
"HIGHLY recommend him. I loved this class. Learned a ton, laughed a lot.",1
"I'm a grown ass man. I don't cry at all, and I haven't in years. Realizing I was done with Bill Leahy's class made me curl up into the fetal position and cry a river. 1010 one of if not the best teacher in the world.",1
"Absolutely awful. Can't understand his accent, doesn't understand you to help you. IMPOSSIBLE tests. Terrible with scheduling. Very hard grader.  Find a different professor... you can't be a good professor if you cannot communicate with your students.",0
"Does not care about students at all. I told her my bf was diagnosed with cancer and that I'd have to miss one class a week to go to his doctor's appointments. I asked to do more work to make up absences, she told me to drop because I'd never pass. Thanks for being so understanding in the worst time of my life Terri.",0
Not recommend at all. Both midterm and final are super hard,0
"It's a hard class in general. Of all the professors that teach it she is one of the better ones. She seems really strict at first, but only because she cares about students knowing the information and entering the world as prepared as possible and she loosens up as you get to know her. If you are actually looking to learn in college I recommend her",1
"Although the class was ""death and dying"" it was actually one of my favorite classes ever. He is a very kind, interesting professor and really loves what he teaches. I recommend this class to anyone!",1
worst professor at american university. 10 exams over the course of the semester. not helpful at all. avoid at all costs.,0
Best professor I've ever had.,1
"While the class was interesting, she doesn't respect students opinions unless they are her own. Grades harshly and doesn't give a lot of feedback or helpful criticism to improve. Grading toughness does not match the fact that it is a lower level English elective with majors of all kinds and skills.",0
Did not need any of the textbooks. Boring lectures. All assignments were group work that could be completed outside of class and rarely needed any of the information given during lectures to complete them. Was a boring and very pointless course. I really did not like his course. Because it was a required course for my program I had to take it.,0
"He was very forgiving when it came to missed classes so long as you participated when present. He is a fair grader. If you put in the work, you will get a decent grade.",1
"the worst class I've taken so far. the wording of his tests and quizzes are brutal. cant seem to tell what his intentions are. the class average is low overall, if he was going to do an online course with no open sources at least allow the students to go over his work. WEBCAM MICROPHONE TEXTBOOK is a must (online). very old fashioned",0
The absolute worst professor I've ever had at Ferris State. His grading is awful he does not help but he does bash every paper you turn in and will give you a 0 if it is not up to his satisfaction. I will NEVER recommend this professor to anyone.,0
"He's an EXTREMELY tough grader & goes on rants in lecture, yet tests on things that he never mentioned but were referenced in the textbook. The class averages were always F's & D's. He doesn't like confrontation, so don't bother talking to him during office hours or after class, because he gets VERY angry & rude about it. Seems nice at first though",0
Aviod her this class is not worth to study that crazy shes super hard if ur study freak then take her otherwise D is for sure,0
"if you dont understand the material when he teaches it to you, he cannot explain it in a way for you to understand. had to go to a different proffesor for help in his class. tests and quizes are not that difficult",0
"Dr. H is the best professor I've had so far at WKU! Her lectures are clear and contain everything you need to know for her tests, which ARE hard.  She has a great sense of humor and makes lectures interesting, and as long as you go to class [like you're supposed to] and actually enjoy learning with an open mind, the class will be very rewarding.",1
"HORRIBLE. Nice guy but can't teach so you have to do it yourself.  If you take him, expect your life to be taken over by physics.",0
"Prof. Kapoor whispers when he teaches, reads off of his lecture notes, evades answering questions or blames students for asking questions. Do not expect him to communicate with students.",0
He is very unclear in his expectations. The MFL homework and quizzes do not correlate at all with lectures. He doesn't teach excel which is needed for most homework. Would not recommend taking him.,0
"Lectures are long, does not explain material well. Does not give clear expectations. Answers emails fast. Book is useless, he provides a free pdf version.",0
She was a friendly lady but was super unclear about grading and speaking your mind about topics was not an option.,0
"Perkinsons is a wonderful person, but a very ""all over the place"" kind of teacher. I didn't learn anything in the class, and didn't use the textbook.  All the tests are take home (except final) and the class is extremely easy. She is not the best teacher, but she does really care about her students and explains things to the best of her ability.",0
"Personally incredibly intelligent, knows his field extraordinarily well, however not very good at communicating his knowledge of the field on to his students. Did have clean definitions of concepts for us, but expected students to understand. Quizzes every class on the ready, but before we had a chance to ask questions or discuss the information.",0
The best professor ever!!! Always there for students!! Straight to the point study hard and participate! All of the courses she teach are worth taking!!,1
"He is a knowledgeable professor who is clearly passionate about the content. However -in a seminar style class that is based on participation, he does not give students any chance to participate. -readings are too many, too long, and too unnecessary -terrible time management -terrible organization -do not expect a prompt response to enquiry",1
"I was in her very first section. She had never taught before. She is a good teacher compared to a lot of other professors, but she struggled to teach course material that wasn't hers. She has the ability to be a great professor, but as of when I took her, it was incredibly difficult because we were all confused.",1
"Online course, easy, but assignments were boring and ""worksheet-ish."" Almost no communication. Course VERY poorly designed: missing info and instructions, erroneus assignments/dates; she clearly had not gone through the material and had copy/pasted from a previous semester. Grading return time awful (over 6 weeks). Disaster of an online course.",0
"Professor Ignacio is an amazing teacher! However, his exams are difficult and he grades stringently on the paper. DO NOT take him thinking it will be an easy class; Ignacio makes it challenging yet rewarding. Put in the work and you will succeed :)",1
"She is very cute!  I think she is the only thing that keeps me interested in the class.  I love the way she talks and being ""flighty"" is something that she does so well...  Whenever I'm in her class, I, almost instantaneously become engulfed in whatever it is she says!  She is a hoot!",1
"Dr. Lockerd assigns a lot of reading and expects you to read it closely. He calls on people who don't participate. He has a good sense of humor, though his lectures can get a little boring. His tests have passage IDs, so know the reading inside out. He gives solid feedback on papers. Responsive to email. Effort is definitely required for his class.",1
Excellent professor and great mentor.,1
"Out of respect for his character and years of teaching, he is a good person overall, just not the professor to have during a pandemic. Even though he is knowledgeable in platforms like canvas, he failed to communicate with students on-time and lagged in all things. I wish we had met in different circumstances, it was pretty unfortunate.",0
She is a very sweet and caring person but very hard to follow in class and is not very helpful in lecture. She is also very strict with the phone usage.,0
"Do NOT take Domangue!!! The only reason I was able to pass was because I had taken stats in high school. You will have to teach yourself while still having to go to his very boring, useless, and mandatory lectures. Nice guy, but horrible at teaching!",0
"Spent an absurd amount of time on easy topics, then sped through the difficult stuff with terrible explanations. And the final exam was filled with ridiculously difficult questions, far beyond the examples we did. One of the worst professors I have had.",0
Very hard class. She goes way to fast and she makes the material harder than it should be. Her test are hard and very tricky. You better know everything in the book because she will pick the most random things to test you over. I never studied harder in my life for this class and all I got was a C. I would advise you not to take her.,0
Prof. Murata was not my favorite professor but she wasn't the worst. She does assign A LOT of work papers and assignment and does take a long time to grade your work. She seems like she's a hard grader but I can't really tell because I don't have grades for a lot of my work. I do like though that she always gives you feedback on your assingments,1
Mediocre. Course might have been great if it had been taught by someone elsje. Doesn't present many new ideas apart from those in the textbooks. Assigns pretty random essay topics. Kind of horrible personality.,0
I took Bill for History - American Civil War and I LOVE HIM. He is such an amazing teacher and i learned so much during his class and lectures. He is very accessible outside of class and cares very much about the students. 10/10 would recommend him,1
"Helpful, easy going professor.  Will give you a manageable workload and excellent notes.  Don't expect too much clarification outside of class though, it's in the notes.",1
"Seems to be compassionate about what he is teaching, however his learning style is not for everyone. I would not take him again because his learning style is very difficult for me to pay attention too and learn from. Answers questions willingly and wants you to learn. Hard grader, and confusing tests.",0
"Definitely one of the worst professors I've ever had. I had already taken (college) Calc 2 before going into his Calc 2 class, and had to fight to keep a B. Very inconsistent grading, picky about useless details, and NEVER ends on time. Seems to enjoy seeing his students fail, and makes no effort to make Calc understandable. Avoid Dean if you can!",0
"Always makes 'zzzzzz' noise while talking, and make me do the same",0
"I'm in the class right now and he is a great guy/professor. This is THE hardest class education majors have to endure but it keeps you on your toes. I will probably end up with a C which I am very upset about buton the brights ide, he is really funny. He has a dry sense of humor and I think he enjoys scaring his students.",1
"This class was extremely boring! Class was based only on 4 exams that are no longer online because apparently people were cheating before. There's no need to go to class if you don't want because you have to read nearly every detail in the textbook in order to do well on exams, so going to lecture really doesn't help.",0
"Carl Johnson is the MAN. Really funny guy and is super specific in his lectures, and the class is pretty easy to excel in if you just go to the lectures.",1
"Malecha is a wonderful, excited professor. I highly recommend taking a class with him. He is so excited about the topic, and is a fairly easy professor with two 1000/1250 word papers and two tests.  There is a lot of reading, but it is not all necessary, especially if you have others in your class that read.",1
"Can really tell he cares for his job. However, it's hard to hear him, his handwriting is really hard to read and he jumbles around too much when teaching content. Easy class to fall asleep in.",0
"Extra Credit is given for being in class every day, but he is a very tough grader.",1
In my opinion Jon is truly a great teacher and a good communicator.  My biggest criticism of Jon would be that he needs to keep his political view point to himself.  I don't believe it is right to use his position of authority to push his political point class after class.  ,1
"Hornik is old. But he knows a lot about what he teaches and is always an email away when you need to ask a question. This class was a 6-9pm so the lectures were extremely boring, but the class was not hard at all. Just pay attention to the notes and you'll get an A. All tests are open book, but somewhat difficult.",1
I did not like this professor at all. Her lectures were boring and I didn't learn anything. There were a lot of essays and we rarely used the book. She would say you had to read a chapter but it would be fine if you didn't. It's the end of semester and she hasn't put any essay grades in. This class was a waste of time and I wish I had dropped.,0
"Not the nicest man and easily characterized as childish. Lacks logical reasoning and ethical behavior as a professor. Needs to take it down a notch on the egotistical mannerisms. Has been at swc a long time, which should speak for his lack of ability to teach well anyway.",0
"She makes you think that your doing great but messes you up with a bad grade at the end of the semester. If you believe her when she gives you positive feedback you'll regret it later. Avoid, AVoid, AVOid, AVOId, AVOID!!",0
Decent. She does not explain the directions clearly. Talks a lot.,0
"It says it in her name! She RUSHES! She goes over material very fast and doesn't take the time to make sure everyone is following along. She lectures as if she is just solving a problem on her own and mumbles. After she completes example, she asks if everyone is okay but students are still trying to write all her work down. Very confusing and awful",0
"Ms. Battista is not a fair grader. The online quizzes constitute a large portion of your grade; however, they are on material that is not covered or provided. Essentially, you are walking into the dark with no preparation or access to information, while being graded. The only way to do well on these quizzes is through luck.",0
"Although I enjoyed the course & curriculum, Dr. Amstutz is not a kind or helpful professor. He had clear favorites in the class/dept (those who interned for CIA, etc.) and despite the fact that I was a high performer in his class, I did not feel respected or valued as a learner, & he was not personable or approachable when I visited office hours.",0
"She don't really teach, but reiterates the textbook back to us. If you don't read and outline, you're screwed. She's nice, but the exams we take cover stuff that we don't even learn about.",0
"What an awesome experience it was to take his class. He is super dynamic and very passionate about finance, which made it way more interesting than it would usually be. He emphasizes a lot on real-world applications and shares the practical aspect of finance with his students. Grading is clear and without ambiguity.",1
Worst Professor ever. ,0
Can't wait to have him for short story writing...he's very insightful,1
Lectures were a very good review of the text.  A very fair teacher if you just read and do your work.  Take this class if you want an Ant credit for sure.,1
"I heard good things before, but she was AWEFUL! Rushes thru lectures, not prepared& just tells you what 2 teach yourself. Gave wrong date for the final, some people had to take the final 2 days early, but she only gave the study guide 48 hrs before we took it. Tried 2 ask for help & she told me 2 wait for study guide. Easy B but not a good teacher",0
Knows many facts but has no real depth of musical understanding.  Tries to be one of the students instead of teacher and mentor. Unqualified to lead college level musicans.,0
He gives incredibly long lectures that are not engaging. NR001 was a joke. Not enjoyable at all. I would recommend that if you want to be in Rubenstein that you start freshman year as undeclared and then transfer into Rubenstein sophomore year. That way you only have to take one class as a transfer student as opposed to NR001 and NR002.,0
never learned anything tangible in his class.  might know his stuff but can't relay that to the students.,0
"Dr. Ralston is quite possibly one of the most hardworking people in the world. She always puts her students first and aims to help them as much as possible. Calc 2 is known as the hardest in the sequence, but she gave us all the material we needed to be successful. She TRULY loves calculus and wants her students to be engaged and interested.",1
Not recommended,0
"He does not honor his grading system. Or at least, his staff that does all of the grading for him doesn't. Two papers, that's your grade. Says multiple times that participation counts but it really doesn't. Good luck trying to make sense of anything that goes on in this class.",0
"TAKE THIS CLASS. I had the opportunity to take chem classes beyond the scope of AP Chem in high school, but Dr. Groh's class gave me a broader and more in depth understanding of chemistry than all of those classes combined. My only regret is that I won't be able to take another class with her after CHEM112H. Oh, and do your problem sets early!",1
I took Dr. Bitterwolf's (Doc) honors chem 111 class and I've never had a more inspiring professor. He had a unique spirit that was always willing to lend an ear and tell it to you straight if you needed it. Doc passed away this past Spring and I miss the casual chats in his office and the truly happy smile he had whenever someone asked a question.,1
One of the worst classes I have taken this semester. No passion for teaching at all.,0
"Easy class. Except for mid-term and final, tests are online and you're even forced to get an A by taking it as many times as necessary. Other tests are easy thanks to comprehensive study guide. Nelson is a really nice, funny and smart guy. Extra credit is offered through easy in-class quizzes to encourage attendance. Class itself can be boring.",1
"If there is a way you don't have to take this class, then DONT! Worst Professor I've had since coming to West Chester. Hard Exams and quizzes, and he will not work with you on your grades. Not to mention, half of his class is Liberal Propaganda filled with out-dated and small sample size graphs. Double warning if your a white male! He hates them.",0
Hard to understand. Goes through examples way too quick. A little condescending,0
"if you think differently than her you will be in for a terrible time. It is her way or the highway. Honestly thinks we dont have any other class than ethics. Also, I took the exam 40/60 option and I am good at writing exams...got C+ on the midterm which was one of the higher marks achieved. dont know why she makes it so difficult.",0
run away. ,0
Wonderful online instructor! Was available most anytime.,1
"Oscar is by far the best professor I have had so far at UNCC. I always look forward to his classes due to the fact that he can make everything incredibly interesting. He is hilarious and truly cares about his students. Be as detailed as you can on assignments and tests. He can be a tough grader,however, if you work for it you will be rewarded!",1
Stood up at the board and did a few examples while he talked to himself the entire class every class. impossible to understand even if he did speak clearly. very rude if you don't understand what he is doing and doesn't give partial credit. BUT if you fail everything and make an A on the final you get an A or B in the class. (thank god for chegg),0
"Anyone who says this guy is too hard just doesnt put in the work.  Yes you have to read, yes you have to go to class, and yes you have to study for exams, get over it this is college! great teacher, very passionate and if you listen in class and read, nothing on the tests is irrelivant.",1
Interesting gen ed requirement. Got to use programs and code to decide better ways to make Pitt more green. I wish Pitt would use some of our ideas.,1
You have to attendend class because her slide shows arent complete. Most of the things she will test you on will be discussions you will be having in class. I think that kind of sucks. You have to remember A LOT of definitions and texts. You will be tested on all of them,0
"Please! His adittude is not befitting of a professor, he may want to make you ""think"" but that becomes code for ""think my way"" while I enjoyed his style, at times I would be quite offended as he made other religios seem ""base"" to christianity. He is ok, and a level of tolerance is needed to participate in his class. SEE HIM BEFORE WRITING ANYTHING!",0
"A very rude, unkind, and unhelpful professor. Responses to questions through email and Piazza are frequently terse, sarcastic, and insulting. Assignments and exams are brutal. Perhaps his lectures make up for it, somehow. I wouldn't know. But I'll be very glad to never encounter him again.",0
"Willing to answer any question. It's too bad he's retiring, but he's going out with a chili pepper. Congrats, Mr. Kender.",1
Very good prof.  His lectures are clear and easy to follow and take notes.  He is very helpful and is very willing to meet outside of class hours.,1
"Dr. Rodrigues is caring and accessible outside of class. He also draws heavily on his immigrant experience making lectures interesting.  Group projects are a large part of the class including the final, and there are no individual grades on these projects. He tries to address tough social issues (racism) but clearly leans politically liberal.",0
"Professor Mullin is a really really TOUGH grader, she does not give curves nor accepting any request for boosting. The quiz is super hard and tricky where I think it's pointless to be that tricky. The Paper was graded really harshly because she said she care more about what we learn in the class instead of our grade. Do not recommend at all.",0
"He is a super nice guy, however the lectures can be dry and the panels can be confusing.",1
"If you are into the subject of archaeology, he is the perfect professor for you. If you aren't then you will be bored. He shows movies that are sometimes interesting and he assigns essays every week. Avoid him if you're not interesting in learning about different tribes.",1
"So this guy isn't a good teacher. He writes on the blackboard and rambles a decent bit. However, his grading criteria is really clear. My advice is to go on YouTube and look up the topics that will be on the test. I studied that way and got an easy B+. Overall, bad teacher but easy to get through.",0
Dustin is the best engineering professor I have ever had. His testing is consistent with everything he teaches in class. Most of my classes with him required no book. He genuinely cares about his students and is always ready to help when you don't understand. Take every class that you can from him!,1
"At first I was intimidated about this class but Professor Nearing was extremely helpful and patient. I did not expect an A as I thought I missed a few things on creating the website, but to my surprise I passed :). Her exam was straight off the study guide, which is a plus! I'd take another class with her again.",1
"If every student took ECON 101 with Prof G, the world would be a better place.",1
Not the best professor I've taken. Very unclear about material being tested on. Get ready to teach yourself. I have a minor in math and he is by far my least favorite professor. Only C I've received in college. A in all three calcs.,0
He is dry and the class is boring. He goes the whole time each time and says he will put his power points up online when he never does. He doesn't email back and the tests are essays. ,0
"Terrible horrible!! worst professor ever! she is rude and unresponsive to her students, very disappointing behavior 0/10",0
Stay Away.,0
"I have new appreciation for Bio. She's dedicated and enthusiastic. Follow her advice about academic skills and you'll do great,",1
Awesome teacher! I'm so happy I got to be in his class.,1
Tim is a great guy and loves what he does.  I had him for FYE and he has different dynamics from the other teachers.  He was never very clear on any assignment but loves what he does and always wants to keep on track in class.  Easy,1
"I have been at this school 3 years and i've never written one of these, however now is the time i feel i must.  She is horribly dry, her lectures are 100% useless when it comes to the test, the book is 800 pages of the same chapter, her tests are never the same format, and she her short answer and fill in the blank are impossible. DO NOT TAKE HER.",0
"Class is extremely boring and she just reads from the slides. Tests are unbelievably hard and everyone fails. No curve. She also will fail you for participation, even if you contribute. DO NOT TAKE",0
LOVE HIM!,1
Spencer has structured this class such that your grade depends on you knowledge of Accounting Vocabulary more than your actual knowledge of accounting.  So read the vocabulary sections and you should be ok...don't really expect to learn very much accounting though...,0
Easiest A ever. Took this class in 2008. Do not even bother to buy the book. Just show up and pay attention to each class before the midterm and final.,0
"It is a problem hearing him so sit in front of class. What he says is VERY IMP since he gives hints as to what is gonna come in the exam. For ECE 380, he had two sets of lecture notes whose examples you should really focus on. Do previous exams since he has a pattern to what he asks.",0
"Amazing guy, very funny and entertaining lectures, yet also very interesting.",1
"Dr. Mostrom is a really nice person to talk to and her tests are relatively easy, but she's a terrible teacher. She spends class time typing her notes into a powerpoint and she doesn't engage the class at all. Everything on her tests comes straight from her powerpoints. If you don't memorize for this class, then you're in for a bad time.",0
"Difficult grader, but very fair, and very helpful.  Definitely made me a better writer.  Best English teacher at WSU.",1
"READ EVERY WORD OF THE EMAILS HE SENDS YOU. All the important info is in emails - he will change due dates, required page lengths, & tell you what to know for exams in emails only & never mention it in class. Wish someone had told me to pay closer attention to the emails.",0
Les cours étaient trèes intéressants.,1
"From the get go, he expects his students work for the material. He is HONEST and up front about the fact that his teaching style is geared towards Active Learning, and that included in that's a lot of hard work. He TOLD US that active learning feels harder, but you learn more as students. I was shocked that my exam grades were as high as they were",1
"An absolutely incredible professor. He makes difficult concepts crystal clear, writes extremely fair tests, and inserts his incredible sense of humor into every lecture. There's no need to read the book, his lectures make a lot more sense and are incredibly well-organized and interesting.",1
"I cannot say enough about her.  She is wonderful, helpful and kind.  Already a wonderful professor and always looking to better develop her courses.  Take her courses!",1
She is so mean and never teach. And didn't be responsible for her students.,0
"Want a good mark in her exams overall 80%+. Do webwork's start early easy 26%. Midterms to finals exactly the same year by year from the ones she posts. Understand the concepts by doing her practice problems then near exam time just do her practice exams. Easy 90% there is no surprise, those who rate her low never studied hard enough!",1
Jenny is amazing! You need to go to lectures to ensure you actually know the material because she does not post any lecture slides or lecture content so you will not know the material unless you get the notes from friends in the class. The tests are fair and the assignments are interesting!,1
"great professor, makes astronomy fun to learn",1
"His tests are tough but he teaches the material well, im taking him again next semester for chm 116.",1
"Very biased, if you don't hold a Catholic opinion she won't listen! It's impossible to win.",0
"Worst professor I have ever encountered. Told our class several times that dinosaurs lived at the same time as Native Americans. Uses the class as an audience to vent his anger. When asked questions, he will respond with something vague and go off on random tangents. Final paper is 60% of mark, due on last day. Attendance is 10% so can't even skip.",0
"I took this class in the summer and two of the four tests were proctored.  The tests are the only grades, but classwork earns bonus points for those tests.  Read the textbook, take the practice tests, and you should have no problems with the tests.",1
"She takes forever to grade things. It took her a month to grade simple quizzes to test. She waits until the semester is up to grade. She does not give extra credit, and does not help you when you mess up. She does not care if you fail. I never had a teacher like her. She is a tough grader on her papers. Takes forever to get a reply back. ",0
This class was way to hard for a Gen Ed. I would not recommend taking it. I had to for my major and I might have to retake it.,0
Best Class ever.,1
"Definitely takes pride in teaching his students, but lectures consist of his personal stories and you cannot use the bathroom without being called out. I would stay away as he is very strict with his rules and there are only 3 tests. There are no other grades which makes it hard to do well if you are not a good test-taker.",0
He is so dull. His voice will put you to sleep. The whole class period is him just talking in front of the screen meanwhile the notes are on blackboard. He gives exam reviews that are 200 questions long but no answer guide so you have no idea if you're studying the right thing or not. Good Luck.,1
"if you actually pay attention to what he says, you will get so much out of his class. he always relates things to real life which makes it easier to understand- definitely take notes. not much work at all and he is very helpful. take him!!!",1
"She is in a tier of her own teaching wise, however she really brings the heat on Exam day. To pass this class you need to put in the time and have a separate notebook of all solved HW problems. I am not a good math student at all and she passed me. You need to put in 10+ hours a week to make it. Use her personal student tutor and the OASIS tutors.",1
Very good if you participate. Group project oriented but she makes sure everyone is participating all the way through. Has lots of real life experience!,1
"The workload for the term-long group project is extremely intense. It had vague requirements that were updated every few days, and well over half the class dropped the course. The exam is open book (but not easy), and you are tested on a lot of specific wording. He bell curves based on the highest grade. (For us, a 72%.)",0
The worst class I have taken so far in two years of chemical engineering. This professor makes no effort to make his class mildly tolerable and makes assessments impossible. He barely teaches the content students are tested on and leaves it out of notes as well. Happy this class is finally over!,0
"Awesome guy! Class is fun, exams aren't bad. This course really gives you a totally new perspective on race.",1
"Honestly, take any class that Dr. Bullock teaches. I've taken 3 classes with him and I wish I could take more. His classes are discussion-based, so it's always worth going to class. He's a super fair grader and gives you a TON of feedback on assignments so it's impossible not to do well. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",1
Karen is awesome. but don't expect it to be easy. its hard but in a fun-challenging sort of way. if you put in the effort she will notice and respect you for it. she is a fun teahcer whose fun to see every other day.,1
best teacher!! Get him for calc in 3d,1
"Plantinga is brilliant. He co-authored the book for the class, which has its ups and downs. For one, you can always look things up in the book if you missed what he said. Second, he definitely knows what he's talking about. However, he teaches almost directly from the book and his quizzes and tests are very specific.",1
I had Oksana for a community engagement class and she was OK. She didn't explain things very well and she never emailed us the readings by the time she said she would. There were no tests but there were a lot of outside of class things we had to do.,0
"Absolutely HATE this class. I am usually a straight A student but on the midterm made a 78. Everything is VERY vague from his power points, to his lectures, to the exams, and also the final project. His grading system is bogus. Based on his views only. I thought this LBST class would be my easiest class but I'm making the worst grade in it.",0
Avoid at all cost,0
Showed very little interest in going in depth on how to explain things.  Not a good experience.,0
Professor Marlowe is Amazing! Three tests and one 8-10 page research paper. She grades papers really easy but is strict on grading when it comes to her tests. Be sure to do the study guide and you can get the easy A. Professor Marlowe is the best professor in the history department. Take her !!,1
Please take her class. Attendance isn't required. She gave out multiple choice reviews that were EXACTLY like her tests. The lectures are painfully boring but it is hard to complain when the class is that easy. She is a very nice teacher and will eagerly help you with questions.,1
"very fun, very intriguing",1
"If you have an arts major he is a great teacher but he acts like everyone is extremely into art as much as he is. On the first day he says ""you'll probably be intimidated by me because I'm a musician."" All you do is take notes and have a test on what your hearing or seeing.",0
She is really helpful when you seek help.  Always smiling and puts in a great effort in helping students.  She is prepared to answer questions (unlike other profs...*cough* andre)... and will take the time to do so...   but it was still a hard final :(,1
"Weber was extremely intelligent. He knows a lot about geology and no doubt is qualified. But, he taught this introduction class like it was a level 400. Also, he is quite boring, so it's hard to pay attention. Overall, do not take this professor unless you really care about geology.",0
"For an OChem he does a good job preparing you for the material. The class is literally straight memorization, but he gives you everything you need to know, no searching around in the textbook. What's on the board or in the packets is everything you need to know. 81 and above is an A, and he gives you two practice tests per test.",1
"If you want to pass, avoid at all costs. Plays favorites big time, and will not help students he does not like for whatever reason.",0
"Don't even get me started on this dude. Went into the class with 6 years of studying French and after it, I dropped my french minor. Took him on Tues, and Thurs and don't expect anything less then 2-3 hours of homework per class period. Tests are ea breeze but good luck getting ANYTHING above a B on each homework. don't take. Seriously...",0
"Dr. Campbell was amazing. Very kind, and extremely knowledgeable. There is a lot of reading, but his lectures were discussion based and enjoyable. You will have to put in some effort, he isn't the kind to just give out A's. But he is so nice, and wonderful at answering questions, I didn't find the class too taxing. Would recommend!",1
"Copenhaver is a great teacher! He's extremely difficult though. I had to have a lot of 1 on 1 time with him so he could re explain the material to me. However, he totally respected me for doing this. So that's highly recommended. He also doesn't pick on you as much if you see him for help. See him before seeing a tutor so you know what he wants. ",1
"He moves very quickly through lectures.  Writes almost everything in abbreviations.  Nice guy.  Need textbook because you do homework out of it about once a week.  Quizzes are pretty hard, but he is reasonable at throwing out questions that a lot of people got wrong.",1
"He is awful. His notes are scratch notes, with countless mistakes in them (he says he will fix them but never does) - it is very difficult to understand. He makes his lectures near mandatory because he has a quiz every lecture that accounts for 40%. He tests us on things he can't solve in a reasonable time himself. He complicates the trivial.",0
"Every class you will have a two page homework assignment which isn't that bad really just tedious. Two exams and a final but he gives you the exams from the semester before and a lot of the information can be memorized. Show up, just sit there and you can get a decent grade with not too much effort.",1
"Great Prof! Lectures are not mandatory but you'll never want to miss them. Professor Deslauriers is clear, witty and interesting to listen to! Assignments are fairly graded, and she encourages students to come to her if help is needed, or you want a grade reevaluated. ",1
A legend.  The greatest educator the world will ever see.  He is the most passionate human I have met in my life.,1
"attend tutorials and do as many questions from practice exam and textbook as you can. forget the lecture if you want, he talks about other stuff and does useless experiments anyway, 33 MCQ midterm in 2 hours",0
"I really enjoyed Mr. Maguire's  lectures.  The only homework for the class is reading the textbook, which you don't really need if you take good notes. All the information for the tests is in his lectures. You may find this class difficult if you have trouble memorizing things. I just memorized my notes. Make sure you don't miss a lab.",1
"Incredibly knowledgeable in Behavioral Neuroscience. Interesting lectures, gives out quizzes but will warn you a week prior and are usually open note. Exam reviews match up with her lectures and she gives you possible essay questions that will appear on the exam. Go to class, take notes on what she says, & read the book and you'll pass.",1
Doesnt have a study guide so test are hard to study from.  Does make it easy to get a good grade.  Take his class if you plan on going.,0
"Walks around and disappears for periods during class. Need help? Try not to, she has a hard time focusing and giving advice on how to improve a project. Not much help when learning things on the wheel which happens at the end. Gives suggestions for how she would complete a project even if it isn't the best way.",0
"She provides powerpoints with every class that she also emails to you, and basically reads off of them for every class. If you don't want to, you don't even have to attend regular classes, as you can learn everything she teaches by reading the powerpoints at home.",1
She is way too hard and does not give you enough time to do work. Online class is a no go and I would never take it again,0
Sat in this class everyday wondering wtf was going on. Im just a brown boy trying to get an Edumacation. Least this professor could do was actually teach me. No offense but even the notes he posted online weren't clear enough to follow when I attempted to teach myself.,0
"Marcus was one of the best profs I've ever had.  The only reason he likes you best when you ""agree with him"" is because he knows what the author intended a good part of the time and because he is incredibly intelligent.  If you take control of your own education and ask him for help you will not be ridiculed.  I LOVED his class",1
she was just ok.. quizzes once a week every week.  they are hard.  dont take this professor if you have the choice.,0
"The MAN! Best Professor I've ever had, and sometimes, if your lucky,  your class ends with, and that is why the sky is blue. He cares about the students and he takes time to know them on a personal level. He is the highest quality human being and is so welcoming that coming for help isn't even in question. If you have the opportunity TAKE TIWARI.",1
"She is very rude and useless. If she does not like you, she will not help you much.  She expects you to read a whole book in just one week. She makes us read a book every week. She does not understand that her class is not the only class students are in. WE have homework for other classes as well. She is too uptight.",0
"This professor thinks that he knows everything but he just has little knowledge about the antenna. He is very proud and arrogant. He does not care about the students. If you go to his office and asks him a question instead of answering you, he starts to ask some questions and then he told you that to go out because in his opinion you are not eligi",0
"Awesome professor, 10/10 would recommend. 1st half of semester is mostly lecture, 2nd half is mostly group projects/studies. Grades based on several quizzes, a couple tests, and 3 papers. He makes the class really fun and enjoyable and is happy to talk with or help any students if they need it. One of the best professors at Palomar",1
"The teacher is fine, the class was fine for me. There are around 4-5 papers with enough time to turn them in. there is not much to learn mostly just understanding the readings and writing.",1
"She was the best japanese teacher i have had so far.She explains everything over and over again until everyone gets it. You have to study to pass the class, but she grades really fair. She made the class really interesting. Would highly recommend her.",1
Dynamics was rough for me. Dustin is the reason I survived. He is able to explain things in a way that make sense to almost anyone. His course layout is the same no matter what class you take. He tells you up front what it takes to pass the class and provides a straightforward way to do it.,1
"sometime even the professor himself doesn't understand what he is talking about. and there will be some contents in the exam which he doesn't cover in his class. If I can learn everything on my own with my textbook, why would I take this course??? ton of the assignments. I would say it's a good course but not a good professor.",0
By far the most boring and confusing class have ever taken. I've literally never been more confused in my entire life. Get ready to say stuff in class and have her laugh at you. Don't recommend!!!,0
"Salerno tries hard to be a nice guy, but he is really condescending and unclear. He told me one week I had no idea what I was talking about and the next, told me I totally understood the material. Lectures are long and he goes off on a lot of tangents. Do not take if you care about your grades...",0
"Yikes. 90% of what he says in lecture is completely irrelevant to what's going to be on the test. The one saving grace of this course is that the slides wind up being posted on canvas, so you can make something out of the material for yourself. The lectures are almost completely pointless. I'm surprised it gets a decent turnout each day.",0
"billy's a necessary evil because he's the only organic chem prof, he's an idiot, you can find his companion notes for the textbook online and he just reads them word for word, you'd be better off just reading the book and only showing u for tests, if you remember anything about gen chem 1, you're smarter than he is",0
"Her tests are WAY hard.  I have her for 132 and I believe it is her first year teaching this.  Very nice teacher but I feel unprepared for her tests.  Lots of notes are given, but tests are more application then anything.  BRING A RECORDER. Notes overlap alot, and she hardly brings discussions down to student level.  Very technical.",0
This professor is very focused and explains the subject in detail. I learned a lot from his class.,1
"If you are going to take BIO 140, find another professor. She may be very knowledgable about Biology, I don't know, but her lectures are pointless because she reads right off the powerpoint without going in depth and relies on PASS sessions for students to actually learn. Only useful thing in this class is the extra credit.",1
absoulte overload of work.,0
Best Professor ever take him you won't regret. He's the best professor at PACE and the funniest too. Take really good notes cause if you don't you won't do well he never makes you buy the book so don't even go there.,1
"This isn't a hard class as long as you attend and go to labs. He will never let you out early and he really loves what he teaches, but is a little odd. He expects everyone in the class to love the subject as much as him. Eye clicker is the way he tracks attendance, but attendance is required. He does let you make up missed labs. Just really boring.",1
"He doesn't do much to help the class engage in his material. I thought this class was going to be really exciting since it was about Gandhi and his legacy, but he relied soooo much on papers and documents that he basically just threw at us to read for ourselves with little explanation. There were hardly any assignments and no exams. Very hard class",0
"One of the worst teachers that I have had at GV. His lectures are extremely unorganized and he repeats himself a lot. He is very arrogant and disrespectful to students. He doesn't like questions and expects you to figure it out on your own. However, if you work hard you can get an A in the class. Do not take him for Lab! He is super hard grader.",0
Honestly one of the hardest professors I have taken at CSUB. His grading is the most confusing and his tests have nothing to do with the book. He literally comes up with his own questions and even if you have the book it doesnt help.I did not miss one day of class and I am a straight A student and received a C in his class. Do not recommend him!,0
"Your grade is 15 quizzes, and that's it. The textbook is filled with typos and a lack of explanation, which makes teaching yourself really difficult. He is impossible to reach and won't respond to any emails. He makes the work wayyyy more difficult and complex than it should be to learn how to do simple stats.",0
"Definitely would not recommend if chem is not your forte. He is not at all clear. He puts his slideshows up online, but they don't help at all for the tests because there's so much unnecessary information on them. He's a very sweet man, but would not recommend unless you have a lot of background on the subject.",0
"Her tone is always condescending. Especially since shes smiling 24/7, even when irritated. Her instructions can be extremely vague but then she's very specific about what she wants from you. If you miss class then that's at least 3 grades going in as a 0 cause she'll put the report that's due the next week in as a 0 as well",0
"basically if you want to waste an entire semester learning absolutely nothing, i suggest you take her. She was of no help, made absolutely no sense, and talks about her family way to much. I STRONGLY recommend you not take this teacher ever.",0
"I took this class and made an A.  However, it wasn't because of her.  I needed help constantly because I couldn't understand what she wanted on the assignments.  She never e-mailed back, and I mean NEVER!  I didn't even know what I was making in the class until the last TWO WEEKS!",0
"Jack Devine is one of those characters that will make you, intentionally I don't know, feel dumb. One time, I handed him a written paper when he wanted a typed paper; it was simple error in judgement and he called me out in front of the class just for that one mistake! Only take him as a last resort, for easy grades do not equal nice people.",0
"Monahan is the absolute best professor I've had at any level of my education. He not only cares about you as his student, but as a person as well. He made my two years at Suffolk worth while and is a role model to myself and many others. If you are a business major and never have the ""Monahan experience"" you are doing it all wrong!",1
"He knows is stuff and will explain again and again, he reviews all is questions (Exams, Tests, Labs). Very generous with grading.",1
Great professor. Loved her class. very clear and concise. explains things in great depth and easy assignments.,1
Such a good professor. She explained things very well in class and was always willing to explain more if people were confused. The homework is all out of the book and nothing online which is nice. Homework could take some time but she usually took some problems out of the assignments.,1
"Professor Teng is lovely and gracious!  As a Mount Holyoke student, I definitely found the trip worthwhile.",1
"Great professor, I highly recommend her. Organized, gives extra credit, and things are spaced out well. Don't procastinate and just make sure to follow deadlines.. Weekly quizzes and four discussion papers. I learned a lot about how to eat right. You do get what you put into it.",1
"Dr Metzger stands at the front of the room, doesn't address the class, and makes you purchase a $150 book for an access code that's unnecessary considering everything could be transferred to Canvas for free. Students answer 130 questions per class instead of the professor teaching anything. I DO NOT recommend Metzger as a professor at all.",0
"If you want to major in literature, this class is for you.",0
"Lectures became really dry and boring a few weeks in. He also is hard to hear sometimes because he doesnt like to use the mic in class. writing assignments can seem lengthy for those that dont like to write, ranging from 10-15 paragraphs",0
"Made a very boring dull subject slightly interesting.  At the worst, he was better than Dr. Kroll.",1
"I took both of my history classes with this professor. I liked him as a teacher so much the first time that I waited a semester to take the next class so I could have him as a professor again. He expects a lot out of you, but he is trully engaged in teaching, and lights up history with his lectures. I wish i could have him again! :)",1
"He is by far the worst professor I've had at JMU. He makes condescending jokes towards students who answer his questions wrong, rather than just helping them understand it more clearly. You're better off choosing ANY other professor in the economics deparment.",0
"Oh man...She is HORRIBLE. She is so rude. I once asked her about a paper I had written and she asked me if I took english 110 at Augie b/c if I did, she was worried. Also, She asked if I knew how to write a sentence!Do yourself a favor and do not take her. At first, I thought she was going to be very nice but that changed by the end of the class.",0
Rhodes makes the class come to life and does a fantastic job of getting people engaged in class. He truly makes law easy to understand and cares about his students. He also respects your pocket book by not making you buy a textbook and just sending you articles/cases to read. I would take him again in a heart beat if it fits into my schedule.,1
This class covers a lot of material but she does a good job to make it clear what is the most important and what is going to be on quizzes/midterm/final. She's nice and fairly funny-- a good morning person if you have to take her class early. She covers the readings in class very well so you almost don't even have to read the textbook.,1
I really enjoyed this class.Dr. Smith knew the material and made it very interesting for the few who showed up.He is very easy to talk to and more than willing to help you...if you are a student that goes to class. Hopefully I will have the chance to take more classes with him.,1
It is very difficult to learn anything from professor Fanning's lectures. He mostly just points out sections in the book to know and rambles on about things absolutely no one can follow. Talks way over student's heads; does not know how to explain things in simple terms. Take anyone but Fanning.,0
He teaches a class on how to teach and he totally sucks at teaching himself,0
"Prof. Flynn is a lovely person and a good professor but she assigns a TON of work. If you aren't willing to put in a lot time and effort, I would definitely not recommend this class.",1
He is so boring and will talk for the whole class time. Everyone falls asleep in his class.,0
"She states that most assignments are graded by completion, but even when following the criteria she refuses to hand out anything more than a B. This class also focuses heavily on writing with no tests, but weekly 2-3 pages of discussion questions and a final paper.",0
He is approachable.,0
"She uses a lot of group discussion, but if nobody talks, it will turn more lecture heavy. No exams, just projects that you turn in at the end of the semester. You can pick to do essays, videos, photos, or other things. If you turn them in early she lets you revise until you get an A. No reason not to get an A in her class.",1
can't understand a word he is saying which makes lecture pointless to attend. only tests make up your grade..,0
"WORST professor at UNCC. Can't speak English. Very rude and belitting. He always puts his students down & he always thinks he's right. Very incompetent when it comes to being at his office hours, answering calls during his supposed office hours & answering emails in a timely manner.",0
"Terrible professor!!! She took 3 weeks off to have a baby, then came back and taught! Her work load is way too much and she treats the students like they are 5 years old! I feel like I have wasted my time in that class. If you need to take it, get something to keep you sane. Otherwise, run away as fast as you can!",0
"If you're a proactive student who likes learning and being challenged to do so, you'll like Mike. If you can take criticism, you'll like Mike. If not, good luck. You have to be willing to take things into your own hands and be independent.",1
"Not the worst option, but definitely not a good option. Tests are hard and he uses the ACS final instead of writing his own. If youre stuck with him, know the reactions well and use the old exams to study.",0
"After every stupid quiz you take of hers, you hate her even more. I don't think she wants you to do well. She also talks too much. We have to go over an entire chapter by ourselves because we didn't get to it in class for a test. Avoid taking any of her classes",0
Nice guy - but he knows nothing asbout MIS - this is not a computer science class - it should be about business.,0
"Taking this as a gen ed, but I'm actually really interested. Peter is hilarious and his tests really aren't difficult if you study. GO TO LECTUREpay attention and you'll be fine. He gives great feedback as well; he emailed me congratulating me on an A for the first exam. A few pointless group activities, but they're easy points. Take this class!",1
"One the most helpful teachers I have ever had. Spent many hours after class in his office as I entered 2b when I probably shouldn't have but he is absolutely willing to help no matter what. You can just tell he cares about each individual student. Very funny as well, some people may not get his humor but I think he is hilarious!",1
Does not respect/disrespectful to  students and is always going way beyond the time of class. A,0
He is not clear about his material and makes the syllabus very tough to understand. You never know when your homework is due and he is not helpful at all. Not recommended.,0
simply great,1
Haldane is TERRIBLE. Do not take whatsoever. She rants about things having nothing to do with the class for the whole period. She makes you read long readings and then you never have a discussion on it but she expects you to be able to write about them in the midterm and final??? Was supposed to be an easy A but that didn't happen.,0
Dr. Sá over communicates and is very clear about his expectations so as long as you follow along itll be easy. Its definitely homework and lecture intensive but he makes it very interesting and understandable to learn. I definitely recommend taking a class with him if you can!,1
Not too confident with speaking in front of large classes which can make some of his lectures a little hard to follow.  Good nonetheless.,1
"Dr. Byrd is a terrible undergrad professor. He does not and will not report grades at all during the semester so don't bother asking. Questions & comments just throw him off, that's never a good thing. His tests are neither valid nor reliable as they test you mostly on language and he uses too many distractor options.",0
"Fast paced course. Lectures are long, dull, and unclear. If you have a question youll receive an extremely vague answer that doesnt relieve any confusion. Assigns a group project at the end of the semester with very unclear instructions and wont help with any confusion. He may be the only prof teaching the course so you may be stuck with him",0
"Tom Gordon is one of NMC's finest professors! He is genuinely concerned with the success of his students, and goes out of his way to be supportive and helpful. He has a thorough grasp of his subject-area, and keeps things interesting by varying up class with lecture, hands-on, and small-group activities. I cannot recommend him enough. Great prof!",1
This class was more difficult than it needed to be. lectures were long and very boring. I didn't understand his grading criteria he gave me the same grade on all my compositions no matter how well  written they were. He is very monotonous which made his teaching style ineffective. Hes a nice guy but more fit for his administration job than teaching,0
"She's awesome and super nice. It's a pretty easy class to begin with, but she throws in stuff we probably didn't learn before so we don't get bored. I took it as a Hybrid but the amount of work was easy to balance with everything else.",1
"She is a terrible Accounting teacher, she reads straight off of the powerpoints and expects you to write out entire balance sheets on a blank piece of paper with no help. If you're going to take this class then go to every single PAL sessions because she is awful. She doesn't answer any questions without being rude and freaking out at the student.",0
"She is rude, unhelpful, and tactless. Berates students in front of the class and expects you to be fluent at the 102 level. I am a disability student and she was cruel and unaccommodating. I am not moving on to FRE 201 because of how awful she is. Very strict on attendance. Take someone else, you won't regret it.",0
"He is a fun Professor who tries his best to make his lectures interesting and will make you laugh. His tests are pretty challenging  so be sure to study hard. Only one essay you have to type up for him and its just an artwork critique. Tests are multiple choice. He is pretty strict when it comes to class participation, so if your shy, get un-shy!",1
Didn't really like him as a prof. He would always show up to class saying how he put the lecture together late the night before. His class notes were inferior to the other 1051 prof teaching during the semester and he strayed off track a lot. He was a nice guy to talk too but it seemed like he was more focused on his research then teaching students,0
"You want an example of an amazing prof? This is the guy for you. Filion's inspiring in his love and passion for the subject. He makes himself accessible, gives excellent lectures, and assigns enjoyable assignments that aren't too easy, are manageable, and are very enjoyable if you take on the infectious passion he conveys constantly for learning an",1
"Very hard to understand, sit in the front row if you want to get anything at all from his lecturing. He's very knowledgable about the material and he expects you to be as well. Tests are hard, make sure you know DATES!",0
"Everyone said the teacher was horrible and terrible, but I feel the teacher was great. He was really knowledgable on all topics and very easy to approach. You have to write three essays in the class and he provides a rubric before every essay letting you exactly what he wants. If you cover all of the things on the rubric you'll be fine.",1
Amazing amazing prof. best in the english department. she is the reason behind me picking up an english minor.,1
You learn in his classes. He pays attention to every single detail and likes to make sure you have learnt new concepts.,1
"I would not recommend taking him. He whispers his lecture,and is really cocky also talks about his IV league credentials.",0
"She's hilarious and really adorable, but sometimes she moves very fast. Large classes suck because it's hard for her to make sure everyone is caught up. A lot of the time I have trouble following along. Apparently so does the rest of the class.",0
"Great teacher, class is very laid back. The best part about him? He looks like Eric Foreman's clone, from ""That 70s show"". They are identical twins.",1
"This was the hardest class Ive taken so far by far. Carlson was very lecture heavy, but thats expected. His tests were NOT multiple choice. He wrote them himself and were SO HARD! Weekly homework is sometimes hard but you get 5 attempts. Quizzes during lecture are group quizzes. Hes a hard grader. Not very nice either. Doable but very hard work.",0
Professor Wright was an interesting professor to say the least. Say what you want about his teaching style (lectures without power points or resources online). The concepts he taught stuck because he made connections of the material to real world or personal situations. Make sure you eat your kale and walk around sometimes.,1
"All of the midterms were extremely difficult. I have a good grasp on the concepts of the course (I'm an active class go-er and read each chapter twice- yeah I know, twice) and her mc questions are still difficult for me to understand and answer. This class has definitely been a struggle  for me and I pray for everyone else who has to take it. ",0
"He was pretty awful! I have been a strait A student my entire life with only a couple B's in H.S. and none in college so far till this class. His expectations were confusing and made the student feel stupid if he did not like the work. I get A's on my English papers, but got a B- on what he called a ""quick and easy assignment."" Avoid if possible!",0
"not a great teacher, condescending and rude",0
"Kristen was a great professor. This was her first time teaching 101 so there were a few kinks for us, but the class was fantastic. 4 exams and a few little quizzes. Take good notes, attend every lecture, and READ AND STUDY THE LITERARY TERMS and you'll be fine. Overall easy class.",1
"He's an okay guy, but half of the links for the extra readings were always inaccessible. Whenever I'd email him letting him know he'd have an attitude and say it's my fault they aren't working. Just read the chapters, follow along with the study guides for each chapter, and do each TD and W.A. and you should be good.",0
:-(,0
"Muir is one of the best profs I've had at the UofW. He is a lenient marker and will help you organize your ideas for an essay. It's easy to get confused because it is philosophy after all, but he will straighten out all your confusion if you just ask! He is very approachable, funny and knowledgeable. Also, his lectures never put me to sleep, bonus!",1
His lectures are really boring but you have to go to class to receive the PowerPoints.  Gives random quizzes which can be confusing. The midterm is all short answer and the first day of class he will tell you half the class will fail. Don't take him,0
"I thought the class was thought provoking. His opinions about America are very pessimistic but it does give you a different perspective towards the role America plays in this world. His accent isn't that hard to understand. He is very opinionated and somewhat cocky, but I did learn a great deal from him.",1
"Good lecturer, he's interesting and the dude clearly knows his stuff. Attending lectures - assignments are easy, and the exams were very fair. My biggest complaint is just that sometimes he was a little all over the place (ie forgetting things and going back and changing what he said / doing things a little out of order)",1
"He does not realize that we are not in the 1970s anymore and is absolutely a terrible professor. All he does is rant about how ""handheld devices"" have changed our society. Class is a complete waste of time.",0
"Gives opportunities for extra credit during lectures every so often, final project was fairly easy, and the only test was the final exam which wasn't insanely difficult at all. Handed it in online. Even for someone who doesn't care for art or literature it wasn't that bad",1
This was a great online class! Prof posted 3-5 assignments due every friday and they took me less than a day to do all of them at once. Just do the work and youll get a solid grade!,1
"At the beginning of the semester we only had quizzes on recitation day (Thursdays) but further. into the semester he made them on random days and often more than once a week. They aren't very hard quizzes and you can work together with the people around you. But you HAVE to go to class bc what the excuse, you can't make it up. SUPER boring lectures",0
He is extremely knowledgeable on this topic and has a ton of real world experience. Do not pay attention to the EGR 106 ratings because they don't know what it means to be in an engineering class. Engineering is not easy and  you need to expect to put in time for the class but it is extremely helpful for the industry and work after school.,1
"No idea how I got an A. We went into an online partway through (COVID19) and many people did not attend the classes, managing to get an A/A-. For some, this is great, easy A! For me, PURE PANIC. I feel like I haven't learned enough to go into FREN220. Yes, she's caring. I felt her lectures weren't organized well :/. Flexible deadlines!",1
"Very smart professor, he knows his stuff. HOWEVER, uses far too much jargon right out the door causing much confusion amongst students. Gets upset when you answer a questions incorrectly. Almost seems as though he expects his students to already know how to do everything before the semester starts. Overall: Far too difficult.",0
"has no clue how to use the programs she is teaching, much less how to teach in general. it's the end of the semester and she has yet to return a single grade, OR a comprehensible prompt for any of the exercises she assigns. good luck!",0
"Out of the 20+ graduate courses I have taken, this has been the worst class. A lot of (outdated) readings (especially for an instructor who insists materials for the course paper be no more than 5 years old). Minimal work for a grad course. Not challenging for a graduate course either. And who gives tests at the graduate level??",0
"Very knowledgable on subjects and conveys them well. I only had him for a strictly-online course due to everything being shut down, but lectures are VERY full of information that sometimes needed to be viewed twice to fully get all the information needed. Seems funny, probably funnier in person. Homework is straightforward with only one chance.",1
"Huang's lectures remind me of my mothers bed time story's when i was 3.  Exams are tough, lectures are boring, and attendance is mandatory, but i did catch up on my sleep...",0
"Nice enough lady, but it's useless disagreeing with her. Super easy class if you've taken management principles or marketing, or psych,. All the same stuff.  Class is a waste of time. She's helpful if you need it, but her lectures are basically her reading the powerpoint. Just read the bold stuff in  the textbook and you'll be fine.",0
"Weekly readings and questions. This class is easy if you do your homework because the tests are open notes. The readings do get repetitive as the semester goes on, but the books are pretty straightforward and the questions are easy to find and answer. She offers extra credit throughout the semester. It's an easy A if you go to class, & do your hw.",1
"Lanning is SO great. He's such a good lecturer. If you don't go to class (and I mean every class), your grade will suffer. There is a LOT of content to memorize AND understand. Flashcards are helpful, but if you can't connect concepts, you're screwed. His tests are thorough, but gives detailed study guides. He wants you to do well.  Take his class!",1
"Excellent teacher, she was very helpful with helping papers, more interested in making sure students learned than paper grades (allowed revisions and went over papers with students). She will ask for input in her classes, but doesn't call on anyone. Good class.",1
"I wouldn't really recommend him because he has a thick accent and made it really hard to understand him a lot. Plus the material was really dry and he couldn't engage our class a lot. There literally was no sound in our class, just him talking. Take someone else!",0
"Such a sweet man. Only five, three page papers the whole semester. He is a very easy grader. Brought in a lot of inspirational guest speakers and got snacks once a week. Deep discussions and illustrated a lot of topics seen from different perspectives.",1
"If you're decent at math, you have absolutely nothing to worry about. I walked out of 241 without learning much-- if you want to learn something that's actually meaningful (for actuarial/econ), take her for 242 or take 241 with just about anybody else. She's rather frank about her class being the easiest 241 out there, and she's absolutely correct.",1
"He sent one email in first week of class then refused, correct word, to discuss anything the rest of the class. Impossible to contact, refuses to answer phone, will not answer emails. I turned him into his boss after the class for lack of teaching but nothing can be done because he's been at RMU Too long and is protected. Problem with Professors",0
"If you want easy credits take his courses... Long and fairly irrelevant lectures, but the tests are simple and he gives you the information you need to know on a review sheet. Attendance isn't req, but he does do ""pop quizzes"" which are not available for makeup later. I took his US History II and geography. Easy A if you can study on your own.",1
"Here's what you don't want to do: teach an ART class and grade people based on how ""interesting"" their work is. Julie Simon displays obvious personal opinion in her grading and she is probably the least helpful professor I've had. She claims CMAT 212 is a prerequisite for this class - IT'S NOT, so beware if you're going in with no Photoshop skills.",0
Im not sure if this rating will be posted because of how honest it is... But to put it simply. Shes a terrible teacher. Shes the department chair so you cant really complain about her to anyone AND she teaches a required class. I tried so hard in her class and put in so much time into all my essays and she still gave me a D.,0
Hicks is one of my favorite professors!! I've taken him for multiple courses and he is always more than helpful. Tries to explain things in different ways. Really enjoys math and computer science so will provide examples of applications of the topics you are learning. ,1
"This is the worst class you will have to take in your engineering career at UB. The subject could actually be interesting but Chung is terrible at lecturing. I've learned more in the follow up lab MAE 385, which is a 1 credit course, than I did with Chung's entire course. There's a quiz every lecture because previously no one attended lecture.",0
She is a tough grader and cares way too much about the assignments. She does not provide enough feedback on how to improve your grade and needs to be a little more relaxed.,0
"Truly makes speech class enjoyable and less scary. He lightens the mood with his humor and respectively becomes personal with each student to ensure confidents for when you have to give a speech. We only had one test (that is actually helpful) and had 5 speeches, which one was just reading a poem of your choice. Highly recommended.",1
"The most boring lectures I've had in my 2 years in CSM. His notes are pulled right from the textbook,  so you can probably skip class and still do well if you study the textbook, IF ONLY he wasn't so stingy about attendance. Very unfriendly and boring professor. I'm honestly shocked by the overwhelming amount of positive comments. Don't take him.",0
HE IS A BEST TEACHER IN MY LIFE,1
"Be thankful for this teacher because you won't get many like him. He was nice, his lectures were interesting and actually helpful, and he was easy. His weekly periodic assessments were annoying but as long as you understand what you are reading and write at least 3 pages, you will most likely pass with A's on all of them. ",1
"Dr. Slough scares students, demands respect, and grades harshly. However, despite initial impressions, he cares about his students, and wants them both to enjoy and succeed in chemistry.",0
"Am a marketing and entrepreneur major in his finance class, so it was very foreign. Most of my class was investment bankers who he loves, and then talks in their language. However, his class is very interesting and he's always available when you need help. Also, he curves it well so you will get a good grade. Awesome prof.",1
"Great class, I would take her again. Clear on requirements although there aren't too many. She had a lot of experience and it shows in lectures. Show up and you have to take notes, but I liked the class a lot.",1
"Really nice lady, she means well...but her lectures are dreadful. The content could be covered in a third of the time she takes. However, the content of the course is not difficult, both midterms are easy and there is no final.",0
"I don't even know where to start on him. Nice guy, and meaningful lectures, but he shows up late to every class and doesn't use powerpoint. Doesn't have notes either.",0
"His lectures are extremely long and boring! Simply read the slides on your own, and you will get the content he is talking about. There are labs every week which are easy marks, four essays which you submit via his own web server (outside of D2L), and a final which was not bad! Easy course, boring professor, but learned a few things regardless!",0
"Great at explaining difficult topics. It can be a hard course if you're not good with Chemistry, but he explains well, and is available to help. Had him for ChemII after a bad professor for ChemI. What a difference. He was able to explain the stuff I didn't get the first time very well.",1
I hate to do it... but he just cant teach....,0
Easiest class Ive ever taken. Super clear expectations.,1
"He is a really fair maker, you dont have to come to class, he puts voice memos online if you choose not to come! Very helpful",1
Best professor at UofT I've had so far.,1
"EASY! 50 min lectures. he posts the notes ahead of times. 3 articles for the entire week, 5 comments each article. Maybe a video to watch with it. Anthro is the type of class you enjoy taking because its applicable to the real world. Quizzes are straight forward IF u do your work. Easy GPA booster, great teacher, loves what he does. TAKE HIM!",1
"Horrible teacher for an online course. No matter how many e-mails you send asking him questions about the course, he will NOT respond. Very frustrating, first horrible experience of an online class at GRCC. The only thing I can give him is that he has clear due dates for each unit. Don't take this particular class with him.",0
Dr. Wydner is the best biology professor in the school! She gives students detailed study guides whenever they have to study for exams. She gives a lot of extra credit which can help boost your grade up.,1
"If you're looking for an easy A then take Professor Nelson. If you're looking to learn anything at all then don't. I know she has a high rating because she is an easy a, but if I had known how little I'd get out of her class I wouldn't have taken it.",0
He is very unclear about his papers. The class is really hard and very boring.  He grades really difficult.  You have to pay attention in class to do good on quizzes but a lot of the questions on the quizzes aren't from the readings.,0
"So basically I had to teach myself everything, which was not too hard for me surprisingly. I would use the ""help me"" when doing homework and take notes from just doing the homework and the help the program he uses provides. I watched some of his lectures and I did not understand a thing. So, take this class if youre good at teaching yourself things",0
"AVOID HIM AT ALL COST!!!  Worst professor ever!  I don't mind a hard professor as long as is good but he is not!!! He never follows the book, not helpful at office hours, expect us to know everything, never post the grades and TAs dont know what he is doing.  I passed his class but it was a total struggle. DONT TAKE HIM OR YOU'LL BE SORRY",0
Worst math professor/strictest grader that I've ever had. He is distracted by everything and he bunny trails every single class period. Takes an hour to teach a topic that should take 10 mins. Google taught me more in two hours than he has taught me this entire term. Homework feedback is degrading VERY unhelpful.,0
She is super nice and tries to be very helpful but the textbook is very dry and so is the material. ,1
I had Atkinson before and I didn't find his way of teaching helpful but thats my opinion,0
"The most boring professor I have ever met. He constantly goes off-topic and takes forever to explain the material. Sometimes, he runs over time (even after a 3 hour class) and rushes his last points as everyone is leaving. The only reason he is rated so high is because his exams are easy multiple choice and you can just memorize the slides to pass.",0
"she's great during lectures and makes it interesting, however make sure to note down anything she says because exams will be based on it. she often makes mistakes on her exams, and isn't cooperative in regrading or responding our emails. but she gives a lot of extra credits, so make sure to take advantage of it!",0
"Never take PSYCH101 online course! Tons of reading, assignment and projects. Prof Ennis was mostly not able throughout the course (answered 1 or 2 questions on LEARN). Contents were much harder than expected (as 101).",0
I love him..,1
"you want to learn new skills to increase your speaking skills, this is the place. I am now more comfortable speaking in front of people and I prepare better now than I did before this class.",1
This class punishes students for using prior knowledge by failing them on course work. Discourages independant thought and goes against industry standards.,0
I put hilarious because I feel this class is a joke in general. the game is a GIANT BUG that messes up. Freddy boy expects you to also do multiple readings and lectures. He somehow feels that a level one class should be this complex. If so he is deluded. Put 50 on the table he'll get his TA's to negative vote people's comments next semester!,0
"Sort of cooky, in a cute way. Friendly but the exams are just plain hard and detail oriented. 100% regurgitation of information. You have to read the book. Passable class, no papers, 6 equal exams, but very time consuming to study.",0
"The readings are great, worth it. However, this is one of the most awful, demoralizing classes I have ever taken. Prof. E has strong opinions, and will harshly criticize opposing views. She grades unfairly harshly, and outright intimidates students, often implying student stupidity. You will regret taking this class if you don't agree with her.",0
"Nice guy, but he didn't teach me anything and the class was essentially useless. Class time is wasted discussing mediocre articles and books that don't pertain to the subject matter. He also abides by a rigid (and arbitrary) essay format and grades your writing harshly, despite never giving us any writing instruction. Avoid this professor, for sure",0
"He's a grumpy dude, who doesn't seem to have much of an interest in teaching. He straight up tells you that what he teaches in class WILL NOT BE TESTED. But, you have to go to class for attendance marks and to meet with your group. The 2 tests are pure textbook info, no final exam. Group project is easy. Weekly group participation questions, easy",0
Can be difficult to deal with but seems like he wants the best for you. Just do the work and give it your best!,1
SO BORING!!!!!!PLZ DONT CHOOSE HER COURSE!,0
"Will call out students, calling them students and degrading them and the rejoice when they leave the class. Likes to remind film studies students that they will never be as good as film production students since they didnt get into the program",0
She is a great professor who seems to enjoy what she is teaching and makes online class/ lectures somewhat entertaining.,1
"Gary was an amazing prof! Funny and gave many interesting examples that aided the points of the lecture. He made dry course content as easy to follow as possible, overall great prof. ",1
"International Business students - I'm so sorry if you get stuck with this. I'm a straight A student that struggled in this class at every turn. Blenman is condescending, disrespectful, and unwilling to teach - he told us that he doesn't like to prove what he's teaching. In other words, don't ask him to explain anything. Prepare to teach yourself.",0
Very helpful teacher that ensures you understand the material she's going over.,1
"Prof. Nuchereno is engaging, funny, and gorgeous, if thats your thing. Her Money and Banking class is easy, with little math involved. Expect 3 exams, some online homework, 1 simple term project, and a final, which you can skip if you have an A going into it. Some of the exams are scantron based, others short answer. Extra credit may be available.",1
"This type of course is definitely ment to get you ready for upper level courses. Participate, study and use office hours.",1
"I don't know what all this BS is about her being caring, etc. Actions speak louder than words. She'll tell us all day long that we're her colleagues and she's confident we can succeed in the class. AT THE SAME TIME, she'll be treating us like she thinks we're clueless and must be led around by the hand. Give us a little more credit, please.",0
Cool dude.,1
One of my favourite profs! She is so much like me in terms of always being late and not finishing her sentenses when she talks. I love her!,1
McCay is a wonderful professor who always seems to be in a good mood and spreading positivity in the classroom. His lectures weren't really necessary to go to to pass the course but I sometimes went anyways just to hear him talk about something interesting. Getting a good grade in here is criminally easy. Did the two essays and no assignments,1
"This is an easy class if you stay on top of everything and don't make silly mistakes. All you have to do is watch the weekly lessons, do the homework, and practice. He also gives practice quizzes that are very similar to the actual quizzes. He is very strict with how he wants you to write your solutions, but it's doable.",1
"Prof. Thoo is a good teacher, but his tests are tough. He teaches the material a little different from the book at times, but the Math Cafe is a good source for help and questions. In our class, he didn't grade on a curve, but he did drop our worst test score at the end of the semester. He does like to help his students, and provides study groups.",1
Not the easiest class but a with a little hard work you can do really well,1
"He was brilliant!  The kinds of ideas he was able to integrate into the course material stunned me, and I appreciated how much he tried to engage each and everyone of us.  No prof has ever shown that kind of interst in their students in my experience.",1
"Textbook is listed as mandatory but we never actually used it--don't waste your money on it. Astronomy is held in the planetarium, which is really cramped. Attendance isn't taken but he gives in-class exercises every class instead, which is basically an attendance grade. There's a lot of material covered on the exams, it's hard to memorize it all",1
she sucks i regret taking her class cos she expects you to come to school even if you seriously sick or she is going to reduce your grade by half...people try to rate yr professors before you take their class cos i assure you if i had done that dis wouldn't have happened to me.,0
"I got A's in all of my English classes and am a good writer. She gave me a 60% on my first philosophy paper, with comments that did not make sense and she was no help in revising papers. Out right said that it was an online course and she would not meet with us to help. Also doesn't email back in a timely manner, nor revises/grades papers timely.",0
"Took two courses from Prof. Flage at UT in 1993-5. Was a wonderful teacher and mentor. Was a Philosophy major and when I was applying to med school, he wrote he a nice letter and gave me a signed book. I will always remember his lessons and his kindness. He is a special person and great teacher",1
"He uses a lab program that most of the class had issues with because the program is not up to date with what I've heard other profs use for this class. He used readings instead of lecture videos, and for a stats based class was hard to digest. The material is much easier than the async, reading based format makes it out to be.",0
"Honestly the most exceptional professor EVER, he is passionate about what he teaches which impacts ones views on politics positively. He is funny & roasts everyone calling us dumbasses sarcastically, but he really does care for his students. He doesn't take attendance but its best if you show up. Without further ado take him you won' regret it! (:",1
"Professor Mullendore was a prosecutor was 14 years so she really knows her stuff. This class was lot of reading and the tests were half written which is usual for law classes. The grade is based on two tests, participation, court observation assignment and paper. Bring a laptop to take notes on she often goes through the Powerpoints very fast.",1
"tends to rant about random topics in class. He'll pick out really obscure historical events and focus on them for days. Not too bad, but definitely not fun. One time we actually talked about the rap group fu-schnickens for an entire class period. other than that though it kinda sucks. research papers are the only grades. avoid him.",0
Brilliant lectures.  Goes fast but keeps it interesting,1
Anyone who does not like pete probably has bad work ethic and attendance or just sucks at art hes honest and blunt. He wont hold your hand and tell you everything you do is pretty but he will help to the best of his ability and is a great teacher to those who open their ears and minds.,1
"The class overall has interesting material. You have to memorize a lot of theories that are very similar so it can get confusing come test time. Try not to take the 3 hour, one day a week class. Your butt will hurt by the end of lecture.",1
"this teacher is a bit difficult to deal with and her class is a bit difficult but hey it COLLEGE! As long as you do the work, the very specific way that she expects it to be, yu will do fine. I started will a low grade but as soon as i figured out how she wanted things done, i was able to bring my grade up.",1
"He has a passion for his work, and strongly wants students to succeed.  I think he just doesn't always know how to relate to the class.  Read and study the material and pay detailed attention to ALL of his lectures.",1
"The material is exceptionally interesting (which will get one researching outside of class time), and very dense and dispersed (but there is no other way around it!).  Must listen to lectures 2x and work hard. Really wants one to learn (succeed) by problem solving for oneself, really. Truly cares about learning. Intense in class; chill outside",1
"I had a really hard time with this class.  I feel like it brought so much unneeded stress into my life.  For just a General, it is absurd the amount of studying you have to do each day before class, and for the tests.  I never really felt like I could ask a question.  He is very smart, and he tended to be snarky when people asked ""obvious""questions",0
"Prof. Bartl doesn't waste his student's time or money. I'm usually bored with my other online courses, but the readings in this class were interesting.",1
the easiest class I've ever taken.,1
"Dr. Li is a sweet man, however is not the best professor. He tends to explain things that are not presented on the slideshows, which makes it difficult to grasp concepts since he is often hard to understand. Labs are generally easy, though I don't feel like I retained much knowledge from them.",0
"Hummel's grading style is if you improve, you'll pass and participation. He does give quizzes after most readings until everyone finally starts to read. Exams are pretty simple because he gives you a study guide that has the exact passages he wants you to analyze and only picks 8-10 from the study guide. Likes to tell stories that relate to myth.",1
"Hardest class Ive ever taken, and this is coming from a Bio major with 3.99. Got all As and one A- throughout my college career, and now in my last semester Im getting a C in a 100 level class. Lol what a joke",0
"Not helpful at all.  Don't even think about asking questions, will react to you like you are stupid. Very boring teacher. Not recommended at all!",0
"Decent guy, horrible professors. If you think the previous writers were over exaggerating, think again. Even for the most diligent student, his classes are outrageous. Do not take him for a short course. He purposefully makes the class difficult for non-majors. For all 12 days of the short course, you will have a test. Avoid at all costs.",0
"The most thoughtful professor. Extremely caring and put an insane amount of effort into his students. His lectures material is super boring, but I had him for 3 classes in my final year and I would have him again. In his office hours, for research papers, he will take so much time with you. Which will push back appointments, but so kind of him.",1
"His lectures had a lot of energy, and he knew what he was doing, but don't waste your time asking him any questions. He's one of the most arrogant profs around and will just brush you off, if not completely insult you.",0
Not a good person. Mocks a lot!! Should be give resignation ASAP!,0
"I took his class last spring semester . I have never been to any worst class like that . At first it seems like he is great . He talks a lot . But nothing related to book . You have to finger it out by yourself . Very forgetful . He is a old man . Every weeks so many essay assignment .if you don't want bad grade ,don't take him .",0
"Second course I've had with De Looze and he really is one of my favourite profs. He'll make an effort to learn your name and he is one of the best lecturers I've ever had. You can tell he is really knowledgeable and passionate about literature, art, history, etc., which makes lectures very interesting and engaging.",1
not a good professor in my opinion-she'd be saying one thing in lecture while i would be reading another from the text. not clear at all and jumps all over the place.  makes the class subjective to what she likes to hear.  grades harder then she teaches.  not helpful at all.   not a very invigorating lecture - ended up teaching myself from the book,0
I would not recommend taking this class online. It is a HUGE time commitment. It will not be the kind of class that you can just blow through.,0
"Misspelled words, used bad grammar, made sweeping generalizations and actually insulted the entire class during one session.  Glaser is much, much better as a Creative Writing teacher.",0
"80 multiple choice questions determine your grade ( 4 quizzes with 20 q's each), oh and he puts the term ""none of the above"" to good use so you really need to know the material. definitely do not even think about taking this class",0
One of my favorite professors at Rhodes!,1
"Mr. Tyson is my favorite instructor so far at MSU and I'm a sophomore. I took PLS 101 for a gen ed and loved it because of Tyson. He is hilarious and teaches his information clearly and will go above and beyond to give examples and really make sure you understand it. There aren't many tests, no papers, or homework assignments. TAKE HIM! :)",1
"Very knowledgeable of the subject, but hard for those who don't understand the material easily. Her class is her putting up a PowerPoint and talking through the content without any classroom activities which don't prepare you for the large amount of homework that is given, or the challenging tests which involve a lot of memorization.",1
"honestly, not a bad prof. her marking was quite fair on the projects and assignments. all you have to do is follow her guidelines exactly, and actually do the work. her tests on the other hand were horrible, she set them up to auto grade and wouldn't even give the option to review the tests after and run them by her.",1
THIS IS NOT A CULTURE CLASS IT IS A HISTORY CLASS. What I thought would be interesting ended up being super boring. I skipped class all the time and when I did go I never took notes because she went way to fast. Her tests are pretty easy though. Get the english version of the book if you can...that saved me in this class.,0
"Soci of Religion- Bibby is a good prof and very knowledgable, but if you don't agree that religion is on the rise, it may be a tough class to sit through, take his seminar class instead.",1
"Worst professor I've ever had; doesn't know how to teach; you will learn nothing from him. Just stands in front of the class and mumbles incrompehensibly. The class is so useless; less than 20 usually show up out of 140. He is also very mean and not willing to help students either. If you have to take this class, please find a different professor.",0
"This is not a bird course, unless you're really willing to dedicate a lot of time into memorizing detailed, boring information. The final exam was pretty challenging (compared to the midterm). To do well, go to the lectures, also read the book, and DETAIL!! Course may be helpful for MCAT verbal.",1
"This professor likes to show off how much she knows about everything. Be prepared to hear a lot of stories about herself. Be prepared to teach yourself, this woman is a joke.",0
"She is the best chemistry professor. She replaces your lowest exam scores with your final. Her lectures are really good. She gives you lots of opportunity for practice. Take her, and do some practice problems you can pass her class with 100%",1
"WORST TEACHER EVER!!! I have never met a teacher that does not teach in class at all. He always tell stories about himself and never anything related to test material. The tests/ quizzes are pretty hard. And he makes you go to these concerts, which is interesting but you have to write this review on it. And he doesn't give you any guidelines on it.",0
"Professor German is the best professor I have ever met in all aspects! His lectures are easy to follow, with excellent pace and detail, and opens to questions Assignment/exam grades can be improved in OH, which he holds 8hrs daily, devoted to helping students You can learn a lot and succeed in his courses with all the resources he provides",1
Weak teaching and extremely hard marker.,0
"rude, too many emails about nothing",0
"Very helpful, sweet, and intelligent.",1
"Seemed like an interesting class at first, and don't get me wrong, because it is. Funny prof and very knowledgable too. Tough exams, but studying the material properly will get you through. Midterm was exteremely tough and too long, so it was slightly changed. Rhoda was a nice/helpful TA. Easy to learn from past mistakes.",1
"Dr. Wisla is a very good person, but I would consider this course to be the most pointless course of my academic career. There is no need to be forced to attend class to comprehend this material. It is completely self explanatory. The tests are weird and his grading system is interesting. Super easy material. I had an A before attendance.",1
"Please... just dont take him. His grading criteria is so vague, it solely revolves around the midterm and final. The homeworks are lengthy as well. All youll be hearing is You cant make this stuff up from him every class. Also be prepared to take notes because he doesnt provide you with anything really...",0
This professor is really something else. I've never dropped a course before and i had to because of her. shes impossible to please with her assignments even when you still do what she wants she finds something wrong and gives you a really low grade on it.DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS AT ALL!Save yourself from your time being wasted and take another teacher,0
"Dr. Hess is a pretty chill instructor, she expects you to participate and be active in class. She goes over historical context to understand the movements and the authors. Test can be difficult, since she picks a random poem or passage from ANYTHING that was read in class. Midterm and final, four response papers, two presentations, and one 8-page. ",1
gives precise information. Gives clarity however sometimes gets sidetrack and talks about non related subjects. Also portfolio work is not credible. Great inspiration but deadlines of assignments are hard to fulfill in matters of short timing.,1
"I withdrew this class I couldnt make it to possible. So much work ; IQs, review quiz in every chapter you read 25-30 multiple choice, and after every 3 chapters you got TEST with 75 questions. He make all the materials so difficult and hard to understands, you have to work really hard to get even C average. Worst experience. Not recommended",0
Mt. Watts fell asleep every class period and when he was actually teaching appeared to be confused.,0
"This class wasn't the best, but definitely an easy A if you show up to class and listen to the lecture. There is a quiz once a week, but she tells you exactly what is going to be on it the class before at the end of the lecture, so make sure you come to class. A summary for homework every week on a chapter and a few follow-up activities.",1
The only thing that mattered was his opinion and he was not willing to listen to others.,0
"Prof Babb is very helpful and always available for questions. This course is a lot more difficult than the 003 level suggests.  The weekly quizzes seem unreasonably hard but the labs are easier.  Some of the units are crammed too tight together considering how important they are. This isn't an ""easy A""",1
"You will absolutely love her if you are passionate about Chemistry. That being said, she has online homework assignments that took me on average 6hours to complete. I am NOT exaggerating; it is brutal! I got only a handful of perfect scores, and I feel that after pouring so many hours weekly into just HW, I should have gotten a better HW score. ",1
"Very professional, gave helpful criticism throughout film making process. Hard to consider marking objective as clear rubrics were not provided. student focused. This is a time consuming course.",1
"Terrible Professor. Talks about himself the majority of the class about how ""cool"" he is. Doesn't teach much then has the audacity to give a 50 question final exam when  he didn't teach anything out of the book. His class is a complete joke, the highest grade you can get is a C regardless. Insults his students for not participating. Waste.",0
She was fine at first but she became very disorganized and had poor time management in the last two months of class. Most of the films we watched were not that interesting. If you miss more than 3 days your grade will be bumped down a letter grade (this didn't happen to me). There is extra credit but she will often tell you the day of.,0
He is the hero.,1
"Worst professor at Pace. Please do not take him. I repeat, PLEASE DO NOT TAKE HIM!!",0
Sometimes difficult to understand so it is important to pay attention. He was ready to help you learn by offering extra help in class and open tutoring hours. Takes attendance randomly and it counts for 100 points.  Subject was difficult for me in high school but with a lot of studying and utilizing the learning commons frequently I earned an A.,1
Being a juco professor his students get a chance to move on and see a wide variety of professors. Now 3 years after having him I still realize that he is the worst professor I've ever taken,0
"It's a very detailed subject with a lot of information covered in a relatively short time. Show up (most important!), read the text, do your homework and it's easy-peasy. Make sure to take notes because he gives a lot of extra explanation in class to help understand the text/labs.",1
"Dr Kelley is my advisor, so when I took ERS 101 which she taught she took special attention to my other first year majors and I in the program. She taught study groups for us out of class, which I'm sure she would also be happy to do for students non- related to the major as well. Overall she really cares about her students and that they do well.",1
"Physics is tough. Dr. Reynolds gets that, and is more than willing to help get you through it. Very humble and approachable - learned everyone's names by week two. Top notch professor - highly recommend.",1
"Worst professor I've had at UVM thus far. Vague and completely incomprehensible...I don't even think she knows what she's talking about half the time. Classes were boring and unnecessary...you would think you were doing fine in the class until test time when, although upon finishing the test you felt fine, you actually did terribly.",0
"Psycholinguistics was super interesting. Though I wish we could've gone into deeper detail on a lot of the things we learned, that wasn't Dr. Baker's fault. All the tests were take-home open book tests so just put effort into the class and you'll do great.",1
"She is great!! There is alot of reading in this class, but if you go to class you will get at least a B or an A on the test with out ever reading the book. She offers alot of extra credit pts. It was a great class, lots of fun, and very intresting. Pretty easy class!",1
Best professor I have ever had. Knew so much about all of her students even if you never talked to her.,1
"Lectures cover the first few page of required reading. You end up reading, doing assignments, and taking tests online. I can do that online without having to show to class to hear my classmates anecdotes on their lives.",0
"As a whole, professor McCoy is great! For the time I had him, his lectures, although confusing at times, were always interesting. With that said, you really need to pay attention and do the readings, as he gives weeklybi-weekly quizzes based on the readings. While the class won't be an easy A, it is nonetheless interesting for history lovers!",1
Half the time you are there you won't know what he is talking about. Stick to the book. You have to go to class for the iclicker points though. Sometimes he is funny. The TA's are your best friends for this class. Get to know them check blackboard and your e-mail frequently. There are curves on almost everything. tb not used in class but at home.,0
Very knowledgable. Went through essays with the professor but failed them each time. Have to give yourself a few days to do the quizzes with them being very long and difficult. Would suggest meeting with her very often to go over your essays over and over till she's very happy with it. Would suggest to show up to every class.,0
"4 exams, weekly quiz, 12 credits participate and a few essays",0
the worst teacher i've had so far,0
"So Wulfemeyer is generally a good guy; fun, quite nice, caring. However, he pours on 3 tests at once, all open notes and open book, but they are very detailed. You have to buy the book too as there's 1/3 tests is a textbook exam. Lectures get really boring, but you have to pay attention.",1
"I know a lot of people do not like prof. Lichtenthal and I get why. Sometimes I feel like he is more like a kid genius who came to teach with an attitude and got pissed off easily when we can't think like him. I still love him though, the videos he showed in class was very inspirational along with the life tips he gave.",1
"The quality of Mr. I's class is so much higher than is typical for an introductory speech class. I learned so much about both speaking and listening better. I'm the kind of person who really needs specific, actionable advice on something as difficult as public speaking. Mr. I did a great job breaking it down and offering real techniques to improve.",1
Take him the first chance you get! He the best professor I've ever had in college. His lectures are inspiring and very interesting.,1
I had Professor Salsini for colloquium and she was by far my favorite professor that semester. She is very nice and helpful. Class was fun to attend and the assignments were not difficult. Participation is a must because it is a large portion of the grade. Overall one of the best and kindest teachers I have had so far at UD.,1
"Hoover is a sweet guy, his class was so easy.",1
By far the best class I have ever taken at this institution. Professor was so excited and into teaching that it made it great to come to class.  I would HIGHLY recomend anybody to take any of his classes. Keep up on the reading and tests are a breeze.,1
"Best class I have ever taken!  Easy SWS credit.  Prof is interesting, intelligent, and funny.  His classes are mostly group discussions about everyday decision-making.  Take this class!!",1
"While sometimes a bit vulgar, he's hilarious. Definitely pay attention during the lecture, especially his tangents bc those will be test questions too. He tells you what to expect on the weekly quizzes so make sure you remember that. Get ready to read a play per weekend, shmooping doesn't always work b/c he asks about certain lines.",1
"If you want to learn the material you might as well just buy the book and read it, you'll probably learn alot more by doing that.I don't know why they call him a professor because he can't teach****.  A complete waste of time and a sorry excuse for a professor.Alot of partiality.Be Careful",0
HOMEWORK AND QUIZZES HARD COPIES HAND OUT ARE SUPPER HELPFUL. DR. randy waterman MAKES BUSINESS LAW 2301 -83501 ONLINE IS SUPPER SIMPLE TO UNDERSTAND IT. THANK YOU DR. RANDY WATEMAN,1
He is a decent guy but I wouldn't recommend taking him if you aren't the best at math. He thinks everyone should know what they're doing at all times. I was doing poorly in the class and went to his office hours and he didn't give me the time of day. The only way I would say to take him is if you are proficient at math.,0
"She was helpful, but strict. Her exams are hard but she will give them a nice bell is the average is low.",1
hello all just wanted to let you know she is teaching online com st 7 class in the spring 2016 so she might be retired but she teaching sometimes,1
Was not helpful or intersted in the students at all,0
"She goes through around 12 pages of notes in one class. There tests are hard and there is a lot of ""all of the above"" and ""b and c only"". Unrealistic to memorize all her class notes ALONG with the massive textbook. Hard course especially for a first year. Would not recommend as an option.",0
"DO NOT TAKE. Highly disorganized, to the point of making the students schedule a time outside class time for final presentations. Extremely long and boring lectures, not to mention he's constantly bragging. ",1
"If you need to take ACC 213, by all means please take another professor. You will be much better off with another professor regardless of the rating. Don't take this professor, and you will be much happier with your semester.",0
Awesome teacher. Hearing latin never sounded so good.,1
Nice guy but not so great at teaching. He stops in the middle of the lecture to do an example (which is good) but does not explain it. So either you spend time getting nothing done or halfway complete a problem because he does not give you enough time. It is nice that he gives last years exams for you to practice on.,0
Dr. Santoro is a heavy lecturer. But he is a really nice person :),1
"Are these UVa kids rating Peter, or maybe Tech transfers? This class is not for E School or Comm School numbnuts, frat boys, or PreMed type a freakshows. This class lays it down for those entering the creative field of architecture. That means it is ambiguous and difficult and self-directed. No motivation and interest = you will struggle, and do poorly. Don't be fooled by the 101 tag - if you want easy see Anthropology 101, with the jocks and rugby folks. Peter seeks to inspire",1
His class actually went very well at first. It wasn't too hard and his homework directly correlated with the test. Last few weeks before exams his tests had nothing to do with homework and exam had nothing to do with the study guide. My grade dropped from a 98 to a 89 and there was a girl in the class with a 4.0 GPA and she ended worse than me.,1
"Her class was really easy but she talks in Italian from day one so she was very hard to understand. I did not learn enough in the class to move onto ITA 102. If you want an easy A, take her but do not expect to learn much.",1
"Does not explain material well, or explains material that you don't need to know in that class. if you don't know your chemisty, do no take krumpe",0
10/10 teacher and guy. loves cats and loves his job. world would be a better place if there were more cohen's.,1
"Have taken several courses with this prof, and thoroughly enjoyed them all.  He is the funniest prof I've ever met, and very, very fair with grading.  Interesting material and not too difficult - but you will learn a lot.",1
Great Professor!!,1
"Prof. Castro is a difficult grader and his discussion sections are very hard to follow. He sent me a very rude email in response to me sending him an essay draft I had been working on. He said, ""I have read several drafts and frankly yours is the weakest one yet."" I didn't need to be compared to the rest of the class. Stay away from his classes.",0
Dr. Alali is a very understanding professor. I went through a rough patch in the beginning of the course when I was unable to take an exam due to a funeral and he helped me through it . I was in his Health Communications course online and it was fairly easy and he focused on his syllabus and never goes off course. Hands down a good professor !,1
"Honestly this was the worst class i have ever taken, all he does is bounce around the class room spiting out facts that he has memorized. Your grade is based on 3 tests.  It was so boring i couldn't stay awake. He's a nice man just a very awful professor. He also knows a lot about the subject so you cant bs it. DO NOT TAKE HIM.",0
"Take MUN with him, AFP, WIC, anything and everything he teaches. Very informative with a deep commitment to his students. Even after graduating I still go back and chat with him.",1
Professor Logue was amazing!:) I learned so much with her and her grading and expectations were very clear from the start. I have had her for Spanish One and can not wait to be able to take Spanish Two with her!:),1
Boring lectures.  Can be tough if your not one of her favorites.,0
"Although many people found her to be extremely helpful, the advice that she offered me was nothing more than what my openoffice grammar check could have told me. Business 1000 is a boring course, but I don't find she tries to make it all that interesting. She simply read off of slides. She did, however, give a good review for the final.",0
"Amazing Professor, show up to class; study the notes for an easy A!",1
Very soft voice -- sit near the front. This class has a LOT of information so obviously its not super easy. You NEED to study and put in the time required for a good paper. His tests are not easy. Make flashcards. He is a good teacher though. He does his job very well. Makes history as interesting as possible. Put in the work/time required!,1
"She is horrible, she moves way to fast and does not care that you are not cathcing on. She say she willing to hel if you need answers but she never answered any of my questions. She also does not let you make up work if you did not do well on a test or quiz. She gives to much homeworkand there is test and quizzes every week. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS",0
"This course is as ancient as the philosopher's you'll learn about. The TAs are abysmal too. Save yourself the headache and just take it over the summer. No one is gonna pay you to do ""political theory research"" anyway.",0
"One of the best professors I have ever had.  He has a sense of humor. He lectures, but is will to stop for conversation and to discuss material in greater detail.  I learned the most for my master's degree from his classes.  It's stuff you can really put to good use.",1
"Great lecturer, and was knowledgeable of the content. However on multiple occasions he has belittled me and harassed me, even saying ""don't you think the reason why you finish lab last is because people are just better than you?"". You see, that's not only hurtful, but confusing, since I hadn't earned lower than a 91 on any lab report or quiz.",0
"hard, language barrier, and moves too fast...much teach yourself...",0
"Mrs. Wang is really sweet. You have to show up and apply yourself, however she is fair and clearly states expectations in the beginning. She is easy to contact outside of class, and even makes herself available on the weekends.",1
"The worst professor I've ever met.  A lot of work loads, which form a huge contrast with last year. He is harsh to us. I've never seen a professor who'd like to run away when student wants to ask him a question. He tries his best to make our study more difficult.  His course lacks transparency, not using learn, hide the grade until the very last.",0
"Political Communiation is his passion - take this class especially if you like Stewart and Colbert. Kolluri is an awesome person and a great professor, listen to his lectures because you will learn a lot",1
"I really enjoyed Haberman's classes! It sounds like he's really hit his groove with the distance learning, and he has several really good videos of his lectures prerecorded. He is pretty picky on his assignments, and will take small deductions off for little things, but never enough to change the overall grade, just enough to make you think.",1
"I took her field experience class and it was good! We discussed about the importance of public history. She's a Jewish woman from the East coast and gives interesting information about Jewish holidays like Rosh Hashanah and that we had no class for it, I'm Christian but thanks for the free day off!",1
"Took her course because I thought it would be easy. Easy content, but literally the most UNFAIR and DIFFICULT marking. Also will not answer your emails until months later, if she even answers at all. So if you have questions about anything, good luck on that!",0
I loved Dr. Pittman. She really cares about her students and will do anything to help you out if you put the effort in.,1
"If you are a non-physics major, I do not advise taking Professor Holland. His lectures are dry, and his quizzes and tests are rather difficult. I came out of the class wishing I never had him to begin with. The only upside is he lets you use one sheet of paper on exams, but there is a lot of content, so one sheet is hardly enough. I warned you.",0
"His classes are not ""blow off""....If you really want to LEARN Geography, take a class with Prof. Doolittle.   He is a great professor, but he doesn't mess around.  His tests are difficult, but if you actually STUDY, you'll do well.",1
"Dr. Bailey is a tough professor. His lectures are very organized, but he goes back on his word a lot. He printed out notes for us, but he would skip slides during lecture. There are no extra credit and the test are pretty hard. I recommend doing the practice problem over and over again until you can do them in your sleep. I zoned out a lot in class",0
"Dr. Evans is very into what he teaches. He wants everyone to get an A, and it's easy to do that. He moves along at a good pace. Exams are right from his basic notes.",1
"Always go to class, pay attention and take notes. She uses every minute of class because theres a lot of information. She teaches quickly but is very clear and always willing to explain if you have questions. Extremely nice and funny. Invites students to her house for reviews before tests. Great lab also, lets you design your experiments. Love her!",1
Great Professor.  Very helpful and VERY VERY understanding. Love all 4 classes I have taken with him.  Do not regret ever taking him. Just do you work. Great teaching material. THUMBS UP,1
"There are two tests the entire semester, a group project, and weekly homeworks. I didn't do so well on the midterm but I never found out what I got on my project or my final. Got a C and it lowered my GPA so much. If you know what's good for you, don't take her.",0
Tanya Robertson is a tough grader Ive heard her say many times that a C is if you follow all the directions perfectly. A B is for a student that went way above and beyond. And an A is reserved for a paper that truly blows her away... suffice to say I never got an A and I havent heard of anyone else getting an A on any essays in her class.,0
"She worked through examples in class, which helped, and lectures were quite easy to follow generally. There were only a handful of assignments, but they required a lot of thought. The midterms were straightforward.",1
"Anyone who rates this professor over a 2 is absolutely lying. There is a combination of assessments, tests, quizzes, homework, discussions EVERY WEEK. Don't even think about asking for help, sarcasm will be the answer. Professor puts down students in class and laughs if they get something wrong. THE WORSE and will have your GPA take a hit.",0
He does not explain things very well and he rambles during his presentations. He grades test very hard and if it is not what he is looking for it is not going to be counted correct. He is not very understanding of certain situations and why you may be late to class or why you have to leave class early. This is the worse professor Ive ever had.,0
"Peterson is a very caring person overall, but I wouldn't take COM 101. I'm sure that she teaches those classes well but the content you figure you'd learn in an early communication class, was all over the place. There was no direct correlation with the material taught, and towards the end it seemed as if I was in Business 101 ): sweet lady!",1
She is so good! knows a lot about the industry and really just knows what she's talking about she always lectures the best and does everything she can for her students! I honestly can say she is one of my favorite professors!,1
"Kildea is an awesome professor and chairman. He's super nice and really funny! He can be a bit disorganized, but as long as you study for your tests (READ THE CHAPTERS!!!) you'll do great. He's a good guy to keep in contact with, so make sure you're courteous and nice.",1
"An inspirational lecture every single class. She goes to the moon and back to make her students better writers. Do your best and you will earn your A. She is definitely old school, in the best way. A truly remarkable person with unbelievable intelligence. I took her almost two years ago and I am impacted to this day. Recommend for all freshmen.",1
"I took the physics based section of this course. Marek is a phenomenal professor. You learn to see math from a new (more practical) point of view. He is very bright, and often very haphazard about his methods. Go to his lectures, or you'll never be able to keep up with the way he covers material. Overall, an excellent prof - loves what he does.",1
"She is a very nice lady, but I would NEVER take her again! Totally disorganized and barely teaches! I was excited to take this class & learn some new skills, but instead I wasted a whole bunch of money & time on nothing. She would come in, take attendance, tell you to look at the posted assignments & then leave her student assistant to do it all.",0
"Belkin is awesome.Yes, he is liberal, but quite a few of the readings were from the opposite point of view.Not only that, but he encourages and welcomes students to ""push back"" if they disagree.  His lectures are easy to follow and take notes on, no midterm, and a fair final. I highly recommend him.",1
Hard Class..... Book had NOTHING to do with the lecture. Never missed one class and pulled an %80 percent; Barely. Very nice guy though... topics were cool,0
outstanding professor - excellent resource for anyone in the field,1
"This professor's teaching style is to read off of notes. After each lecture, there was a hard quiz with content sometimes far beyond the scope of the lecture. She gives long homeworks & unreasonably difficult, long exams. She also takes forever to grade them. We didn't receive feedback on our projects for a month and a half - well after our final.",0
Horrible professor. She didn't make history fun or actually motivate students to learn.  Wasted my quarter in that class. Do not recommend. You're going to have to basically read to learn yourself in order to know what she is talking about.. ,0
"So uninspiring. She always wasted the first 20 min of a 50 min class explaining course policy or how to do and find things and the most nonsensical extra credit, or just really irrelevant subjects. She doesn't give good explanations which are detrimental to calculus. You must be an excellent student to get a good grade. Absolute no procrastination.",0
Very funny and very cool,1
"To pass this course with an ""A"" just make sure you do all homework and sample exams beforehand. Everything you need is on his website, you are responsible for all of it. No one is going to spoon feed you, if your stuck make sure you get the help you need from the TA or online. The professor can lecture, but not always good at explaining.",1
"Prof Meyer records/uploads lectures per week. Optional weekly discussion post. Graded only by 2 short papers and 1 final paper (6-12 pages long, double spaced) on topics of social movements/theories in his book. Advice: read the book to get a good grade on ur final essay and write about a movement you're interested in! Advice 2: start papers early!",1
"Dr. Hammond has been the most influential person in my life. Ever since I joined the Concert Band during the summer of 1999, he had always been more than willing (and patient) to help me improve both as an aspiring musician and a person. Now that I'm moving on to attend a university, I hope to return afterwards and join the band once again.",1
we didn't pick him in the first place then the school switch him into our class since nobody pick his class. there were like 5 people left in his class after the first day cus everyone drop out. Dude makes math way harder to understand and demand you to use the calculator as his damn way which was extremely confusing. don't take his class!!!!!!!!!!,0
"Ian is such a great professor. He knows so much from his many years working in the field. He has a very funny sarcastic sense of humor, so don't be offended if it seems like he's picking on you. He deeply cares about what he's teaching and about his students' success. A real upstanding guy. Ian is wonderful professor and a wonderful person.",1
worst psychology teacher ever in my opinion,0
"I love Mr. Melville. He is so interesting and he tells you what is on the test the day before. Just take notes, only study what he reviews the day before the test and you should make an A.",1
"Class was very easy, actually to easy if you ask me. I gained as much information as I could, but it doesn't feel like enough for a college. Maybe my expectations were to high for an introductory level course. Who knows. She is very kind, helpful, and really enjoys teaching this subject.",1
"Easy grader. 4 quizzes(lowest dropped), 1 midterm, 1 final, and 3 ridiculously easy projects. Go to class because he only announces quizzes in class.",1
you have to put a LOT of effort in the class. He is really boring. its an average class.,1
"THIS CLASS SUCKED!  FIRST OFF, HE TREATS YOU LIKE A MATERIAL SCIENCE GRADUATE STUDENTS FROM MICHIGAN TECH.  PLUS, HE HAS YOU DO THIS RIDICULOUS CASE STUDY THAT DOESN'T TEACH YOU JACK.  IF YOU TAKE THIS CLASS, BRING A TUBE OF VASOLINE WITH YOU ON PRESENTATION DAY, IT WILL HELP REDUCE THE SWELLING!!!",0
"Amazing, the class genuinely applauded after his last lecture. best class ive taken in the last three years. All you need to do is take good notes. Dudes a genius and has a sense of humor.",1
"Very bland guy.  Lectures straight from the book, which is a very terrible book.  Tells you to break turbines.  He writes/grades the closed notes portion of the exams, which are harder than the open notes portion.  WAY TOO MUCH HOMEWORK.  Class has a huge curve, so it's not that hard to get a decent grade.",1
"If you ever get a chance to take academic success with Caitlyn, do it. She's extremely caring, inspirational, and funny. She truly wants you to succeed in academia and in life. She's extremely approachable and walks you through everything. Small groups were fun. Definitely an instructor who has impacted my UofM experience. Highly recommend!!",1
"The word I'd choose to describe this professor is 'rough.' I had such a hard time learning from him in class and in office hours. He doesn't connect to people well and doesn't try to teach things in different ways. If you have him, read the book and good luck.",0
"I had a hard time in the class. I am a student who has A's in all my other classes, but this class is very difficult. I do not understand his teachings. When I think i understand, he moves on to another section of the chapter. I wish he would do multiple problems with the same formula. Also, he doesnt go over homework so you don't know what was wrg",0
"He's really hard.  You must write your papers EXACTLY how he wants it.The opinionsmust be HIS opinion, not yours not a class to think.  Just know the facts, his facts.  he's pleasant and VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE.  Knows his stuff, you'll learn, Also, expect the unexpected on the test...you'd better study everything.  Questions will come out of left field",0
"Craig is cool and has done a lot in his own career, but thats all his lectures are about- correlating everything back to him. He doesn't respond to emails, cancels class from time to time, and never grades anything. He isn't the most helpful to students in class or those he is the advisor for",0
"He doesnt actually lecture in class, but we learned how to program mathcad to do the math for us. First exam average was a 49.5, but he compensated by curving everyone so much that the average became a B. He has tenure, and is quite complacent. He Even said one class he would put in more effort if he was paid more.",0
"I would not recommend her. Tries to cram all lessons into a 50 minute class, and therefore couldnt answer any questions class had. She is horrible at getting back to you (e-mail), and it would be more helpful if she could load your grades online too keep you up to date with the class. She was not that bad, but could be a LOT more helpful.",1
"Best class I have ever taken. Dr. Atterton is inspirational and a master lecturer. This class is a lot of work, but is so worth it. There is so much to get out of the class and Dr. Atterton is a master at bringing out the best in his class. Truly a special class. One of a kind. If it was offered every semester, I would take it every semester.",1
"Taking his class during summer semester. If it wasn't for lecture recordings I wouldn't be passing. It's 100% based on lecture: no slides / no textbook. Grading is solely off of tests. Each summer lecture is 3hrs, so it's pretty hard to pay attention. He is a nice guy tho. Overall, not for everyone so avoid if this isn't your learning style.",1
"She might have been having an off semester, but could have given some more feedback. Feedback was pretty sporadic. Assignment due dates were mostly unclear or changed at the last minute. Useless syllabus. Project instructions were vague, which may have encouraged creativity, but definitely inspired frustration. Probably needs to improve rapport.",0
"This class material was challenging. Professor Houston has a decent sense of humor, but the lectures can be difficult to follow. There is a good amount of hw and you can redo problems, but it doesn't count enough towards your grade to make a big impact. Quizzes and exams are difficult and have free-response questions that aren't always clear.",1
Very knowledgeable man. Good attitude. Always willing to help. His labs were fun and he always made the class seem fun. Just keep up in class and learn to take notes fast.,1
Professor Tavss is the sweetest professor I've ever met. He knows his stuff and gives practice problems that will help you succeed at Chemistry.  He is very approachable and helpful. I highly recommend taking him because  he wants you to do well and you will do well with Tavss.,1
Worst professor for this class. Love the class material but she assigned way too much work for a gen ed class. Not to mention she basically completely ignored her students when classes became online.,0
"I took Dr Burke for an online class, Psy300, and she essentially does not teach this class at all. You're on your own to read the textbook and her voluminous lecture notes. The exams are multiple choice but tricky and also badly written (factual errors). On the occasions I emailed her, she was not polite or thoughtful in her answers. Avoid her.",0
"Hardly ever lectured on anything pertaining to the tests. Somehow I did well on them. The constant 3rd person referrals amused me initially-until they didn't. I'm a straight A student. He gave me a C. I say ""he gave"" because I definitely did not earn that low of a grade. No clue what he bases grades on. My opinion is if he likes you, you get an A.",0
"I absolutely enjoyed my time in this professor's class! Lectures are usually based on the homework assignments, which is absolutely necessary to pass his class. At times the homework can be a bit overwhelming.  He is tough grader but he's fair about it and does give you the grade you deserve. You have to work to get a good grade. Effort is required",1
"She's my favorite professor!! She is so caring and loves her students so much! She is lenient and gives many assignment, but if she see's she's being taken advantage of she will fail you.",1
I took Kuefler for Fall of the Roman Empire and this was my biggest mistake at SDSU. Kuefler is incredibly boring and has an odd pitch that goes up and down as he speaks. He's incredibly inconsistent on the use of laptops and told me to put mine away while allowing other students to have their's. There's a fifteen page paper at the end. Do not take,0
"Goes off topic every class, hard to concentrate. Seems to favor athletes. Not very personable and doesn't remember if you tell him something. Do not recommend as an elective unless this class is necessary. Does not use blackboard or email so if class is cancelled you won't know until you get to campus.",0
Abrams is a really smart guy and a pretty good professor. Lectures are pretty boring. Exams are easy.,1
"This professor is awful. He expects you to read the whole book and then the assignment is to prepare Q&As along with explanations by yourself and do a paper memo To explain a topic from this semester. So, literally the professor has not put any effort in teaching for this class. ridiculous. All he did is to come online and explain general topics.",0
"Deb was a great Instructor. She is very passionate about what she teaches and wants her students to succeed. The marking breakdown is very fair, and the tests are not to difficult if you go to class and do the assigned readings. She also allows for you to earn 100% on the integrative report which is worth 35% of your final grade. Highly recommend!",1
Very organized. Writes down everything very clear on the board. She's really enthusiastic and really gets her students engaged in the topic. Learned so much from her class!,1
Wayne is awesome. A great person and teacher. He is concerned with everyone on an individual level and helps as much as he can with developing ideas and techniques. Would take again!,1
"This professor definitely plays favorites. He's primarily interested in hearing his own ideas. His goal is not to teach you how to think, but what to think. He teaches from the same lecture he's been using for over a decade. Make sure you get copies of them from older students. Avoid taking this professor. Take Crooms instead.",0
"To whoever left the really good review about PSYCH 253, you must have taken it in class. This prof clearly does not care about you if you take his course online. Tests are super hard and he barely does anything to help students. It's so sad that he bell curved for his in-class course but left his online course to fend for themselves. ",0
"This woman LOVES Jane Austen. The course spends 12 weeks studying the 6 works of Austen as well as looking at film adaptations. McKim is  passionate about what she teaches. It is very refreshing. She is always available to her students especially email, and ""happy to chat, whatever the medium"". Very approachable and sweet. Awesome for extensions.",1
"I did not have a problem with professor T, he makes you responsible for learning which is what college is about. His exams are tricky but not impossible. MUST attend review sessions. Mostly freshman take his class and are not prepared for how much work they will have to do. Overall a good teacher but tough on exams.",1
He doesn't hand out a syllabus and expects you to go on concourse to look it up. I honestly did not enjoy his class very much and he talks in a very low voice and it's hard to hear if you're not sitting in front of the room. He is also bland and hasn't answer my phone calls and I told him it's the best way to reach me not to email me which he did.,0
"I would lay down my LIFE for this woman. Best professor I have ever had. Not sure if I want to marry her or to be her, but probably both.",1
"Hardest Prof I have ever come across. No matter how hard you try to concentrate he goes on and on in his lectures endlessly. All his lectures are just proof, proof and loads of useless theory that is of no use in his exams. Assignments are so hard that half the students skip them(he says it himself). Never take a class with him.",0
Great class. Labs were amazing. Cannot wait to have another class with him. Learned a lot.,1
"He is the most fast moving teacher you'll ever have, but he is absolutely brilliant and I'd take any class he offered",1
"Worst teacher/professor I've ever had. She's a scatterbrain who loses work, gives inaccurate grades, plays favorites, and is always in a bad mood. She gives free grades out to students who help her with yearbook during class and gives grades based on if she likes you or not. I literally learned not one thing from taking her English Comp class.",0
"Quite frankly, the worst professor I have ever had.  He puts zero work into teaching his class, and requires the students to do ridiculous amounts.  It's amazing how terrible he is.  I would not recommend this class - a fun-sounding class ""game design"" - to a single person, because I treat even my enemies with more respect than that.",0
"Literally, just don't. He's the worst. Expects everyone to be some type of Chemistry genius, like him. Not helpful, even if you go to his office hours. Way too much homework, but that's kinda a dept. thing. Either way, you'd be better off with another professor.",0
"DO YOUR READINGS OR HE WILL MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT. Very engaging class, you will learn a lot. Always pay attention, he will ask questions at random. Middy/final are hard but fair,& very much textbook based! Can come off a litte arrogant but is overall a nice prof, respect him and he will respect you.",1
"Was an amazing instructor. Challenged me. Transition to remote was hard with COVID, but he was readily available and returned my emails. Not sure what other post's experiences was.",1
"I have never had a more confusing professor ever. She will say one thing but mean the total opposite. This class you will not learn anything, its more about passing and getting your work done before exams than learning anything. The work was easy and came along with pre recorded lectures. Questions on the exams would be worded very confusingly.",0
She is an absolutely awful teacher who doesn't care about teaching or her students. She grades extremely unfairly and will fail you even if you do all of the assignments and ask for extra help. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS. Trust me... I would have rather taken a class at 7-8 o'clock rather than take this again.,0
"He focuses on the text book for everything. Doesn't like to be wrong, he's always right because ""he's a professional"". I thought I was doing great and expected a b+ ended up with a C!!!!! he sure is a tough grader. Expects for you to be working on his class all the time.",0
"I am required to take Martin's class for my major, and it has been terrible. He is misogynistic, and does not grade fairly. His class is boring, and he spends more time picking on his students than teaching. The only saving grace is that the textbook was free and online, and he has the entire day-to-day lecture schedule laid out on his website.",1
"Dr Kean is a very kind person, and very musically talented. He does care about his students, but he cares most for the music. He'll treat you like an adult if you act like one, and if you show up and give an honest effort, you'll have an A at the end of the semester. I, honestly am thankful to have him as my prof, he's made me a much better singer.",1
The guy brings his own headset microphone that sounds like a radio from the 1940s. Compared to Physics I I learned NOTHING. You can't teach physics from powerpoint slides! He didn't do a single problem on the board. His tests are all multiple choice so memorize the answers and when in doubt pick a random answer.,0
"Beware of exams, they are difficult. Reading & rereading the book in addition to looking over lecture slides on EduCat and making flash cards is a must. He expects you to know artists names, tribes, and time period, in addition to the history and cosmology of all of the tribes. The class average is currently at 68% after the final if that helps. ",1
"This class is TERRIBLE. There are too many things to say here, but basically, there was no grading scale, a pointless presentation worth 15% of the grade, and while she knows her stuff, she can't present at all. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!",0
"Dr. Donnellys Psychological Investigations of Literature was easily one of the most interesting courses Ive ever taken. Donnellys lectures were fascinating; she is very intelligent and very well-read. She knows a lot about what shes teaching, and opened my mind to so many concepts. (She also gives amazing feedback on papers.) Lots of reading!!",1
"Ross Shaw is a great prof! He is pretty hands off, so if you work well independently I would definitely recommend him. His lecture notes are excellent and his assignments are pretty easy and straight forward. Make sure you read the assignment instructions carefully and do the required readings and quizzes for practice and you will do great!",1
"Nice person, Horrible Teacher! But don't worry you'll learn how to do all the equations on the exam because she doesn't teach them in class.",0
"professor rombo is a very nice lady but honestly a horrible professor. she is very smart, but goes off topic in class and ends up lecturing about god knows what. her tests are kinda easy even if you don't study (if you're fine with a mid 70 - low 80 grade), but shes a super tough grader when it comes to projects and assignments.",0
"Would go on rants about how the students are taking up parking spots, blame us if the class doesn't do well, asked for help and extra credit and he would not help at all, was late on givng grades out on time. Don't take the class with him at all.",0
"If I could do it again I would drop her class. The class itself was boring. It is a science based class so be prepared to learn about the science part of nutrition such as hyrdogen bonds ect. Her tests were multiple choice. A lot of the questions were obscure. Bottom line take Geology for your science requirement, not nutrition",0
"Very intelligent man, which he should be proud of, but he takes his class too seriously. If you are a history major, definitely take his class because it seems that he lived through the lessons he teaches. If you are not good at it, stay away. I struggled more than I ever have in this class. Also, when he grades you cannot read his writing.",1
"Science is definitely not my strong suit , but Professor Smith was by far one of my favorite professors. You take 3 exams and for your final you get the choice to retake both of your first two exams. I recommend her for any student, but especially those who struggle with science, she's amazing!! ",1
"If you participate, you get EC. This man cares more about you as a person than most profs. He will take time in lecture to make it known he cares about you and your success, he supports a learning environment in which all students are more than happy to engage. He explains the material extremely well. Lots of office hours. Classes are not recorded.",1
"Terrible. Do not take him even if your good at math. I took online Finite Math. The course load for each week is overwhelming and very demanding. - The weekly assignments take 5 or more hours. - We are expected to teach ourselves everything - Doesn't provide feedback -emails back at midnight the day the assignments due. Overall, Do not take!",0
Not will to help you understand information. Rushes through lecture and expects you to learn information not cover in class on your own. Tell student that they should not be working if they are taking his class,0
"He just reads off of a word document with walls of text for lectures. There are 5 things total that count for marks in the whole course, 3 assignments, a midterm and the final. So if you get a bad mark on any of those say goodbye to any possibility of a good mark. I learned more from Tutorialspoint's compiler design tutorial than I learnt from him.",0
just wish i had failed the class so i could take it again. Yeah. He's THAT good.,1
"Matière à l'examen beaucoup plus difficile que les exercices, en plus d'être beaucoup trop long.",0
"Professor Ramirez makes lectures fun and interactive, but he does assign tough projects that will take time. He will have you spend a lot of time coding, but you'll come out better at it. Study for the exams, they are heavy. He doesn't curve, but he will explain common mistakes after so students can prepare for the next exam better.",1
"This guy is terrible. Very condescending and flat out disrespectful to some students. I once counted the times he said ""obvious"" in class, the total was 35. Given, the material is not difficult, but almost every question is a stupid one to him. Puts stuff on exams that he never goes over in class or even talks about, definitely avoid.",0
He's a great professor.  He makes you work for the grade that you deserve.,1
"Nick Harland was a great prof. He converted the online learning of MATH 1500 very well, where you would follow through a set of established problems he made. I found his lecture videos to be a little dry. Homework wasn't bad, just put in some effort and you should be fine. He's also easily accessible outside of class. Take a class with him if u can",1
"I have mixed feelings about her. Some days she was kind and helpful, other days she would humiliate you in front of the class and tell you to ""go back to Spanish 101"" It is nearly impossible to get an A. This was the only class I cried about this semester. Because of Covid, we had to use LockDown Browser which was the most stressful thing ever.",1
"I highly suggest NOT to take this professor. Hes hard to follow what he is talking about in class. Go off topic often, and when you ask questions he always has a comeback. As well as makes you feel stupid whenever you ask something.",0
"I actually really enjoyed Wendling as a prof. Class consisted of 2 essays and 1 final take home exam which was another essay. I got 80's on my papers, but the class average was 68 and I know people were disappointed in their mark. Maybe if they attended class they would have done better.. I would take her class again!",1
"Seriously one of the best teachers you could have at ELAC. She cares about her students and will make sure you understand the material. She is very clear when teaching and she doesn't assign to much work. Overall a great teacher, would highly recommend.",1
"Grades homework hard, but cares about the students.  If you skip you won't pass.  Tests line up with homework, but he will help you if you show the drive.",1
Don't take it,0
"Actually not willing to help much, and tend to give low score to the assignments.",0
Professor Maurer is a hidden gem. Always clarify the rubric assignment. Pretty good for a liberal course. Easy A,1
My favourite professor so far.  Highly recommended.,1
"Many excellent UOW students future/carrier will be ruined, if he does not do his usual curving of final grade PHYS141. He has been curving every final grades. Hardly any learning from his teaching. Hope he does curving now so as to lead peaceful retired life. God is watching professor. Remember you have also kids and family. God bless!",0
Took him online in the summer. One Discussion Board and one quiz. TAKES FOREVER TO GRADE THE DISCUSSION BOARDS!!!!!!!! Doesn't reply to emails. He would tell us a grade would be up the next day and its never there,1
"Good luck with Baldi. You're gonna cry. You're gonna fail. You don't know what's going on. You won't finish the homework. Satan just sent this guy directly from the deepest hell. He also looks like Michio Kaku, which is very intimidating. The first and second week was easy, so don't be overconfident. Starting the 3rd week, welcome to hell.",0
"Classic great Prof, take all of his classes. Lecture oriented, you get out what you put in. This means you will learn a lot, or you will get an easyish A.",1
Ueda sensei is amazinggg!! she is energetic and entertaining. she knows how to make learning japanese fun for everyone.,1
Nothing like his Intro to Bio course. My class had only 4 people- he likes seniors. Material is his expertise- he clearly loves the class and enjoys lecturing and discussing; wants to give everybody A's,1
"I have taken him for few of my CS classes. Despite the fact that he is disorganized, he is very good at explaining new concepts that are hard to understand from other professors.  He is more than fair when it comes to grading, and will not fault you for his disorganization. I understood every thing he explained in all classes I have taken with him.",1
Dr. Crawford is a sweet man who is a great teacher. Does lots practice problems in class and provides you with more challenging ones on the course website that make the tests seem fairly easy if you do them. Go to him with questions and he is very good at dumbing things down at first so you can learn it. Gives a little extra credit which can help,1
"Professor Evarts is not only extremely boring, but also nasty and sarcastic as well. He does analyze material but makes it difficult for students to understand. I wouldn't take his course again.",0
Nice Lady Poor Teacher,0
"Look, whoever gave this professor a good review must have had a COMPLETELY different experience. Let me let you guys know, she is not understanding at all.I am not exaggerating in 1 week we had 30 assignments: various videos that you can't skip 2-51 mins., many quizzes,tests, and a discussion. Grades aren't tallied till the end. Just don't take it.",0
"Go to class & take notes & you will be fine. He is nit-picky with grading but as long as you pay attention to what he wants, which he makes explicitly clear, you will get full credit. Class pace is just right, exams are fair.",0
Her accent and slow speech might not be best suited to some. Just make sure you follow her slides/chapters and attend the exam review class (the final's exactly the same),0
"very passionate instructor, however she gets distracted very easily and talk openly about her political and religious views.",0
"GREAT INSTRUCTOR!!! only draw back is he will make you feel guilty if you don't join LAPD. I have taken every class available with him Many people say he is an easy teacher. NO! He is a teacher that can teach, therefore you learn! That why you passed! Always willing to help, especially when you want to join law enforcement. Take him!!",1
"Really disorganized, although he tries really hard.",0
"One of the best! Actually cares about your schedule and is an understanding guy. Class itself is difficult but he makes it interesting. He can be hard to approach but likes making small jokes during lecture. 4 exams and each around 80 points. No curves. Average for first exam was around 60%, so study early. Concepts build. Great guy overall!",1
Sorry that I only could take Professor Russo for one class.  Great class. ,1
"Fasten your seatbelt - it's gonna be a wild ride. He posts his lectures online - and if you read those (and Linux man pages) - there is no need to read (or buy) the books. Projects are tough. Make sure your SSH client works - you'll need it. Nice guy, good prof. Recommended.",1
Does not speak english. Very bad at answering questions. Do not answer her questions in class b/c if you are wrong she will make you feel like an idiot,0
"I loved his class so much. However, be aware it is a lot of writing. If you struggle with writing essays he may not be for you. He did help a lot and provided a lot of materials to help you write better.",1
"He assumed that the student knew too much, was too fast on his examples, and didn't seem interested in talking to his students after class. He was not helpful in the least. I would recommend anyone who may struggle with math to steer clear of him.",0
Very Fair and understanding,1
"Dr. Matson is the best lecturer. He loves to get into discussions with his students and is very good at his job. I loved this class, very interesting subject. Takes attendance randomly. If you show up and do the work, you should pass.",1
"Ms. Walker is very unorganized, won't make time for you, and doesn't care about her students at all. I asked her for help when I was struggling n quizzes and her advice was to change my major because I wasn't good enough to be a nurse. Seriously, she's rude and doesn't care cuz she's head of department. Worst professor I've ever had DON'T TAKE HER!",0
"Don't even bother coming to class unless it's on a lab day, she will just ramble on and on about one or two slides for like 90% of the class and explain over and over concepts so simple a child could understand them. Wasted my time going to extremely dull lectures before realizing that I could just study with the PowerPoints and get an easy A.",0
"Nice guy. Thick accent. Class was a waste of time. I only went to get extra credit for perfect attendance. Lectures were all powerpoint slides that he later posted online. DON'T BUY THE BOOK! It's not needed at all. If you can turn on a computer, you are probably overqualified for this class.",0
Shes great overall. There is a lot of reading by yourself. Youll be assigned chapters and there will be open discussion about what you read in class the next day. She trys to be flexible with turn in dates. Shell ask if things are too much and if we need help to call her or email her. She cares about students and want us to have #WakeTechSwag,1
"I enjoy class with Professor Galbraith.  She's an anthropologist, so her lecture tends to gravitate towards indigenous or victimized cultures.  I find it easy to take notes off her speaking lectures.  Hardly uses the computer, and somewhat organized.  It helps to type out the notes in an outline form, so you can organize them yourself.  Very nice.",1
"I took Honors Calc in high school and failed. I was then put into Touhey's class and passed with an A+. He over-explains everything, but it is a huge help. His practice tests are exactly like the actual tests. Homework is optional, but it is good practice. He is also hilarious and I would honestly recommend him to anyone.",1
This professor is the worst professor I have ever taken and i am not exaggerating. The class material is way too much and the tests have nothing to do with the hw. I don't learn anything in his lectures because he just talks for unrelated things.,0
"Horrible teacher, never know what he is saying. He will yell you if you ask a question until you say you understand it. Highly recommend NOT taking him. Only grade is his tests, which are not difficulty if you know the work, but be ready to teach yourself. Is not willing to work with students, unprofessional, and overall the WORST professor I took.",0
The meanest person at marist hands down,0
"I think that Dr. Wilson was a really fun professor. He is very energetic and it's always a good time. I've only had to use the textbook for the labs. He really wants you to do well, and what more can you ask for in a professor. You do need to put in the time and effort to really do well though. Go into open lab. Do your best and you should be fine.",1
Amazing professor.  Incredible experience.  She managed a class which was 4 times too large with a host of non-philosophy students and managed to maintain an engaging discussion for all participants.  You cannot possibly go through the class and not learn something.,1
"I am a psych major, so PSY211 is required. I took it in an 8 week format during the summer, and it was horrible. I worked extremely hard yet still fell short on so many exams due to the awful format... I even politely asked *halfway* through the semester if any extra credit was available and was shot down. Long story short, NOPE",0
"If I could take back one class from my mind it would forever be this class. The tests are completely awful with nothing but trick questions. Ms. Chapman hosts a study session and he uses her key words to trick you and make you fail the exam. The lectures made you fall asleep. I did talk to him and he is a very nice guy, but it was still awful.",0
I don't get it this teacher is a master at making people think she's something she's not.  What she has been is incredibly rude and just spiteful to me.  Doesn't anyone else see what's really going on?  Shes the reason my husband dropped out.,0
"Dr. Brinson has a reputation for being a difficult professor. This was not my experience. She has been an engaging, clear and no more difficult than is to be expected in a college course. The load was not at all too much and the tests are not awful if you pay attention during lectures. Her class is all lecture, but still very engaging and fun!",1
"Very nice, she knows a lot and if you're struggling let her know so that she can help you. Make sure to check moodle and turn in packets even if she doesn't bring them up.",1
Very unclear with expectations. Hit or miss with getting good grades. Tends to be rude when asked for help. Easy assignments but if you don't read his mind or write his exact way you will get bad grades. Almost no points in the class. I am usually a pretty strong english student and am having difficulty with his assignments.,0
"bad lecturer Has long pauses in the middle of sentences then starts talking about new ideas Notes are available online, but they dont help much Required to memorize 50+ ids for both midterm and final a lot of writing needed for a class without a writ. req",0
"He definitely knows what hes talking about, just VERY disorganized. Labs were terrible this year because they changed the microcontrollers and he didnt update manuals until last weeks. Lectures will make little sense unless you already knew this stuff. He skipped several lectures. Helpful outside of class if you can get a hold of him. Easy marker",1
"Curtiss is a really confident professor, but is a very picky grader. I'm an A student and had to work for this grade. Weekly hw assignments using SAS and SPSS take a few hours and must be very specific. Her tests are tough but she lets you bring a cheat sheet.  DON'T SKIP; you won't pass.",1
Homework is more of a suggestion since it isn't collected and is therefore worth 0% of your grade. Grade is determined by 2 midterms and a final exam. The exams pretty much cover what is in his lectures and lectures are very proof heavy. He often gets off topic talking about physics problems that are loosely related to lecture material.,0
"Rude. The final exam was synchronous but the website crashed because he decided to do deliver the exam synchronously in a class of 400 people. When the students emailed him about the technical difficulties, he said everyone ""STOP emailing me."" How could we have known that other people are having problems too??? I don't get him",0
"Absolutely hated his online class. It was a HUGE amount of weekly work, as well as long essay exams.  Really annoying how he says ""again"" half the time and ""agane"" the other half. Just seemed really fake and pompous. Don't take this as an elective.",0
"He's super helpful and wants everyone to pass. If you take Gen Psych you have one paper; you critique 4 peer reviewed articles through out the semester and at the end use those for your paper. 2 tests, 1 final (not cumulative). Take notes in class and you'll pass the tests. Didn't even open the book. Takes attendance by in class refelction",1
She's truly amazing. She was very kind and caring. Accounting Was Very Difficult An Dry. She seemed understanding An was always willing to help. She made herself as available as possible for any help students needed. She suggested tutors math lab anything that would help the students. There is a lot to remember so learn how to study accounting,1
Multiple choice questions are in his book. Don't get the other textbook. Essay tests are pretty hard.,1
This teacher does not know how to teach.  I did not learn anything in his class. Nothing but vucabulary that is hard to remenber. Not good. If you want to learn don't take him,0
Worst professor I ever had!!!,0
"His lectures did not keep me engaged: he doesn't use PowerPoint, so be warned. He lectures from some talking points listed on a document, that's it. Some images would have been really helpful - especially since lab topics are pretty complex. 2 WRITTEN, exam-like quizzes are given, and they are hard. 2 papers and 2 presentations also are required.",0
"Her classes were extremely boring, I found myself zoning out ALOT. Her textbook was very helpful though, it gets to the point and helps you learn the skills needed in stats. I wouldn't recommend this professor if you are somebody who needs guidance from the professor as I  was very confused most of the time in the lectures.",0
"This Class is extreemly hard.  The lectures are not hard to understand, but his homework and tests are impossible.  Good luck if you have to take this class and say bye to you GPA.  He is very polite though.  As a person, he is very nice.",0
"You will have to read and watch lots of long videos for this course as it is online. While Professor Duplass does give lots of feedback it can often times be contradictory to things he has previously said and condescending as well. He will make you a better teacher, but don't expect a cake walk in his class. I received an A- but it almost killed me",0
was such an easy class and he was very caring and graded very nicely.,1
"PROFESSOR HUFFMAN I LOVE YOU SO MUCH! THANK YOU FOR MAKING ME WANT TO BE THE GREATEST TEACHER IN THE WORLD. EVERYONE, LISTEN, PLEASE TAKE THIS 82 YEAR-OLD'S CLASS. HE IS THE SWEETEST THING EVER. HE WANTS YOU TO SUCCEED IN HIS CLASS AND IN LIFE. LOVE YOU ALWAYS HUFFMAN!",1
"Beware she will test you on information that she does not cover, nor say to read in text book. Also you can write what you think is the right answer, but she will mark it wrong. When you ask her for anything she is not approachable, and is arrogant and rude. She puts students down in and out of class, and shouldnt be a professor period.",0
What a complete waste of my time!,0
"Good seminar prof, but gives TONS of readings. Only go in for guidance if you are 100% certain of what you want to write on, if not, you will come out confused.",1
he is kind and knowledgeable professor. You will be an expert after take his class.,1
Richard Johnson is a pretty good guy. He may come off as condescending but he doesn't mean it in a bad way. He's actually willing to help even though it seems like he's not willing to help. Just don't take it personally and work for your grade and you'll do fine.,1
Its my privilege to  be part of this class.,1
"There are weekly online quizzes, which are generally pretty easy and follow the book. However, his lectures do not follow the book at all/boring. The midterm and final are essay questions where you are expected to write 2 pages per question. There are 3 major papers throughout the class based upon supplemental books and a topic of your choice.",0
He's a nice guy and all but gets easily sidetracked so you don't accomplish much in class. I only had him for a freshman introductory class which he agreed was pointless and shouldn't be required so he just let us blow it off.,1
"tough grader, she expects too much for an introduction class, lots of homework, no extra credit",0
"95+ for an A+, 80 for a B+. Ridiculously many questions for quiz. Avoid her at all cost",0
"Yes he is a hard grader, but he's very willing to help with writing but you have to make the effort. The lectures are the best part of the class. I thought he was helpful and genuinely concerned about the students.",1
Good choice! Teaches material well but sometimes hard to understand. I enjoyed his class and he is a funny professor. You must pay attention though to do well on tests and assignments,1
Terrible teacher. Does not answer emails and is very unclear. Her online videos do not make sense and uses YouTube to teach the class instead of her making an effort. Want to know your grade? You wont. She doesnt grade anything till last minute.,0
"a mean, nasty and rude person. do not take any courses with this teacher. he doesn't cover any course material in class and he hates students.",0
"This course is probably the hardest course I have ever taken and it had the most work. The lab reports are super long, about 50 pages. The prelabs also take forever to do. This prof teaches by just going through the theory from the notes. Make sure to go to his review lectures as that's when he actually shows how to solve the problems.",0
"DEFINITELY not an easy course or professor. I busted my butt in that class and barely passed. On the first day of class, the class was completely full, some students even had to stand because there weren't desks available (40+ students) at the end of the course: there were only 6 of us left. SIX STUDENTS. SIX!!! But I will admitI learned A LOT.",0
She lectures throughout the entire class in spanish without writing anything down so you're likely to fall asleep. She is also known for interrupting your presentation if something is wrong and making sure the whole class knows it. You probably won't learn anything from her. You need to study by yourself,0
"How can you go wrong with a guy that drops an F bomb right in the first lecture? Gary is engaging, incredibly intelligent, knows his stuff and passionate. He is the reason that I am pursuing CMNS. However, be prepared that he doesn't talk about the readings at all. Great prof, would highly recommend!",1
One of the worst profs I had.,0
"Revlin is a nice guy. He is smart and knowledgable in psych. He helps you in office hours if you go. However, his tests are ridiculous. He takes concepts from outside of the classroom and expects students to study things that are not taught in class. If you can stay away, I would.",0
"Erika was one of the worst professors I ever had. She's very rude and only lectures. She showed us really boring movies also and I wanted to fall asleep every day in there. I enjoy history and anthropology, but this class made me question that. Also, the readings were so long and hard to do. Please don't take her class.",0
"be forewarned: its not her accent that gets to the class....its her lack of organization and failure to give  specific expectations for the class. the papers and presentations, she modifies the expectations as the class progresses. she might have notes prepared for what to say in class, but one question from the class can lead to a another lecture.",0
I had him his first semester he taught undergrad when he was really hard. I hear he's gotten better since then though.,1
"Dr Lierberman is a very spiteful and miserable human being. One of the most disrespectful and rude professors I have ever met. The TAs run the entire lab and she only comes out of her office to be mean to students. On top of her awful character, she pressures students into breaking university COVID guidelines in order to come to lab. 0/10.",0
"Always available for students, always ready to help you learn.",1
"If you are an A student, expect a B in his class. Extremely harsh grader! Must work on grading rubric, much too strict. Also was a lot of reading, important to know if you are taking a large amount of credits like I was during the semester I had him.",0
"The course material is interesting but the prof. makes it harder than it needs to be. Many errors from the handouts and his mistakes during the lecture cause a lot of confusion. Yet, he marks really harsh and gives no marks for trying  unless you solve the question EXACTLY how he wants it to be solved which defeats the whole purpose of the course.",0
"Professor Olney is one of my favorite professors at Olivet. Very godly man, knows the Word. very genuine, down to earth... take his course!",1
I'm not sure why this professor hasn't been fired. He TOOK POINTS AWAY for doing a discussion 4 days before it was due. Doesn't make sense?? They shouldn't be open if he doesn't want students working on them yet. His comments don't make sense. And he never responds to students. Why are people still taking this class? He needs to not teach anymore.,0
the subject in general is super boring but so is the professor so it doesnt make it easier. Also class is not mandatory which is great but if you have zero self discipline you will never show up again and fail. the tests are all that matter especially the final you could fail everything then get an A on the final and that will be your final grade,1
"Eric made Calc fun! I thought the class would be a dredge based on my previous math class experiences but, I was excited to go to class each day. Take this class if you want an easy A.",1
"Poor class with too much work. It focuses more on the communications as a whole than from an IT perspective besides several weeks. Helm himself is actually a nice guy to talk to, but the class content and course itself is tremendously difficult. Sadly the reviews of the class itself are very accurate. Prepare for long hours on homework too.",0
"She has an accent which can be a little tricky to understand. Goes over material very fast. Expects you to spend a ton of time outside of class to read and study. Occasional pop quizzes. Much of grade is from exams. I would highly suggest a different professor. She is however pretty caring, though that doesn't make up for how the class is taught.",0
Great professor who really wants his students to learn!,1
"This teacher is by far the worst professor I have taken. She makes countless spelling mistakes/ grammar mistakes, and the test questions are written horribly. Avoid at all class. I was supposed to have another teacher, but she got pink slipped. They did not pink slip this teacher since she has been working here for 20 years. Avoid for your sanity",0
Professor. Martello was an amazing teacher who was always there to answer questions and give help when needed. Her lectures weren't confusing at all and she made class fun. Very generous about tests and was there for all her students. Definitely would recommend and would take again.,1
"Read the book, don't even bother going to her class unless you're spanish or someone who is very capable of understanding english w/ a heavy spanish accent. She is a really nice lady but her accent doesn't make up for it because if you don't understand her, you're screwed. Good luck to her future students.",0
He failed me even though I got  an 80% on the group project... Terrible prof. Not responsive to emails at all.,0
"you may as well just take him.  after all,  how hard could it be to memorize 50 pages of notes per test?  don't worry,  be happy!  give dr. hoidal a chance.  if nothing else,  his class will change your life.  he's a nice guy too.",1
"Dont recommed taking this class unless you really enjoy movie watching. I was too long of a class and was too boring for me so I dropped it. I guess if you really really really like movies, then you would enjoy it but it was not that great of a class",0
"The hardest class I have ever attended. While she is a nice person, her grading system is subjective. It's almost as if she expects prior knowledge of economic perspectives before taking the class. Avoid her class(es) if possible",0
His lectures aren't exactly lectures he does I Clikers and uses those examples to lecture. The homework that is assigned does not go relate to the weekly Monday quizzes. Which makes it really hard to pass his class.,0
BEST PROFESSOR EVER.,1
Why is this professor even a professor at Pace! How is it possible to retain 15-16 articles of information having 20-30 pages each! There has to be a more effective way of teaching.,0
I failed.,0
"Good professor, very soft-spoken and approachable. Attend every classmeet with him when you miss or you're screwed. Posts notes online but does not include what hes talking about on them. Often a lot of information is given in a table that will only be understood if you were there to hear him talk about it. Do the HW its 50% of your grade.",1
Tough Grader.,0
Isn't really available when needed. When asking for help he talks down to you because he expects you to already know what to do in his class. Not really willing to work with you. Knows the material he is teaching which is good but again expects you to come into this class basically knowing how to do everything. Tests are a majority of your grade.,0
He gives you 9 exam throughout the semester. Gives you quizzes everyday. Rushes through lecture due to the fact of having to take the quizzes. Gets side tracked very easily. Doesn't go in depth in his lectures and just has you copy down the notes and expects you to teach yourself.,0
"He genuinely cares. He's not an amazing lecturer, but he's alright, and he hopes to do better. A lot of people complain about him, but it's just because his tests were frustrating. His tests were too unclear, especially multiple choice, every question he asked could have gone many ways. Too many things get piled on at the end of the semester.",1
Sarv is truly an amazing person. She has the ability to turn 350 complete strangers into the most incredible family. Being a part of the UDMB has created a true home in a place as big as UD. Being part of the UDMB has been the best part of college and it is a large thanks to Sarv.,1
I had to laugh at the earlier post. Yes you do have to rewrite a rough draft which would be why its a rough draft. There is a lot of writing but if you are always planning to attend class you know what you are doing,1
This is beginners Stats so it is not really a hard course. Most already took this in highschool. The problems is Kazlow love making this class 100x harder than it needs to be. Tutoring center is not much help at all b/c sometimes even the tutors don't know how to approach his problems. Test are drastically different from the textbook.,0
"Eastman is definitely an easy A for remotely computer savy students; He's very disorganized and gives a lot of handouts, but he's VERY engaged in what he's teaching because it's his passion. Attendance wasn't mandatory last semester. Really nice guy who cares a lot about his students, definitely take him for cs111. He also doesn't use the textbooks",1
He is a great researcher and teacher.,1
"Fresh new graduates can deliver the material better than him without using bad words in class and back bite students. no slides, u have to attend his class because he wont post a summary or info about what he said in class, hid class isn't interesting at all",0
don't be a guy and take the class. ****,0
"Martin was good, funny, interesting prof. He didn't use slides, so attendance is mandatory, but he often let us go earlier. He gave one pretty weird and silly assignment about zombies, and 3 tests, plus final. Tests were hard but short. You have to study very good and write down all what he tells in class. Get ready for surprise questions. ",1
"This class is hands down the worst class I have ever taken. Do everything you can to avoid this class. Dr. Herbener means well, but he cannot teach a principles class whatsoever. His exams are so hard and have multiple correct answers- you have to know your notes inside and out to know the correct answer or even a guess. His quizzes suck.",0
"Took this class because it was necessary. Absolutely no interest in Dance what-so-ever. However, I thoroughly enjoyed this class. Would take this professor again. Did not go to every class, and still did well on tests. Go to the review session the day before the test.",1
"No tests are nice but the man is so boring. I had to force myself to go to class. There are 3 essays, a small presentation and a research paper. Its a lot of work for a gen ed. That being said he always lets you revise your work and resubmit. I have no excuse for not getting an A+. Bring a pillow if you do take him",0
Professor Stewart was an amazing professor. She is very passionate about art and made the class interesting even though I am not much into stuff like that. Easy class if you focus. Grades based on small quizzes and few short papers. Last assignment is a trip to a museum on your own time. All you do is write about you experience. Defiantly recommend,1
Lives in another world where students are only taking his class and only his class. 2 different kinds of hws + 2 group projects with same group+ 1 individual project+ TSQL textbook that is dense+ he can't teach. Wait until you have senior status and take Obrenic or Levitt.,0
One of the BEST professors at ELAC!!! If you aren't too well at Math I suggest to take her. Very understandable and patient. Test are really similar to the review. The homework is a lot but it helps with remembering the material. Her lectures are the best and the notes are really easy and understandable.,1
She doesnt have any control over her classroom and just makes up assignments and lectures as she goes. Extremely unprepared for class. I showed up to every class and no attendance points were given so its not even worth your time.,0
25+ people emailed him for more time on the quizzes and he never replied to them,0
"He is really smart and his examples are super helpful - but, you won't be able to understand him in class. He is very unorganized in terms of teaching: he enters the classroom, starts right away with random examples, leaving the students puzzled of what he actually wants to teach. Overall terrible class experience, but his examples do help study.",0
"She's the BEST english teacher. Very nice, down to earth, and has fashion sense. Getting an A is not that hard as long as you put in effort. I got A's for basically all my papers. Finals are pretty hard tho, I screwed up, but I still managed to get an A since finals only take up 10% of your grade. Slacker will NEVER survive this class.",1
Dr. Cozzens was one of my favorite professors! She is extremely helpful and nice.,1
AVOID THIS CLASS. He honestly gives so much homework and expects you to follow his answers word for word. He makes you read the chapter in the book and then you are allowed to revive lecture videos afterwards which I think is ridiculous. This is honestly the worst class Ive taken and I regret doing it online as well.,0
"Nice guy but he couldnt care less how you do in his class. His lectures are monotone and if you lose focus for a second youll be lost. The class is graded on 4 exams. He posts the slides on sakai and there is ONE practice exam for each exam. Other than that youre on your own, no hw to study from, only the book and slides you have to teach yourself",0
"-Has a strong accent which can be hard to understand at times - tries to explain as best he can, nice guy and willing to answer questions - honestly would not take any of his classes again - notes are super import if you dont take any you will fal",0
DIDNT LEARN ANYTHING!!!>..she thinks she's the smartest person on earth. With her water bottle and fake smiles....She will fail you ..if you sit and understand everthing...u need to stay after school and suck her toes just to get a D,0
"Worst teacher I have ever had. Went to him for help and he told me there was nothing he could tell me and didn't know what to say. The tests are 90% of your grade, and they are essays which have at least 3-4 parts/questions to them, and if you do not answer with exactly what he wants you to say (which you don't know) you do poorly. AVOID",0
"His eaching style is all lecture-based, but if you do the reading beforehand you can follow the class easily. Participation is 10% of the grade but never makes you participate. Assigned one research essay; get a writer's manual because structure/grammar is graded as heavily as content. Figured out I don't want to major in govt but would take again.",1
You need to do the work outside of class. Moves very quickly through lectures. Requires attempting a lot of practice problems on your own. Definitely use the textbook. Tests are hard but he marks fairly. ,1
She is incredibly rude and condescending with a nasty attitude. She has an air of arrogance about her and is very particular. She is by far the worst person that I have ever met in my life!,0
"He keeps his part to a minimum; tells the truth that he is old, can only be helpful after class. You are responsible for showing up, taking notes, making use of the study resources he gives. For the Easy A, use the sample Qs for the final to know what to take notes on. Memorize image, name, importance that's it. SampleQsFinalGrade. Easy to pass.",0
"Deidre is one of the best professors I've ever had. She is passionate, intelligent, and sincerely wants her students to do well. She strikes the fear of God into students - which is necessary be motivated and do well in this course. Go to class and follow Deidre's instructions to a tee. The gold standard for professors!",1
"I really do respect Ian as a prof. He truly knows his stuff and is passionate. Sadly, he tends to go on rants that have nothing to do with the class. You will hear tons about the Simpsons and American politics. The course is rather dry due to his endless monologues in class. His marking does seem a little unfair at times too. Great person though!",1
"One semester long group project, 5 short reading papers, 2 exams, 10 online responses. Easy grader, gives study guides for exams, gives time in class for project.  Attendance mandatory, 3 skips allowed,  but she reads directly off slides so it's easy to zone out or discreetly do other work. All assignments are short.",1
"She is very manipulative and plays the good intention card very well, but when it comes down to it, she is mainly concerned with getting people in honors college to meet her quota.  She puts her own personal goals before those of her students.  She also has the tendency to go to students professors with issues instead of the students themselves.",0
"Get ready to teach yourself.  Todd proclaims to never like using more than 10 ppt slides per class, but proceeds to use 40+ slides per class 90% of the time.  Speed reads through them all, then you go home and try to interpret them yourself. His multiple choice questions on tests are impossible to get, don't bother trying, just guess.",0
Everything taught in class you can go back over in the read it textbook for more understanding. Textbook not need in class but it will be helpful to get it especially if you dont pay attention in class. All exam were online. When I went to her office hours to explain a subject she would with no problem. Overall great professor.,1
"This might just be the most boring class I have ever taken in my life. Quizzes aren't that bad and neither is the homework. The tests can be difficult if your not prepared, But its hard to be prepared for a class that bores you to death.",0
"I would love to hear one of his lectures, but as a professor? You couldn't pay me enough to take him again. If you can avoid his class, do it.",0
I don't think I learned a damned thing in his class but damn I had a good time. I'd say teaching myself out of the book was easy enough so I didn't mind the class basically being Professor Taylor's comedy hour. I'd take another one of his classes in a heartbeat,0
worst class ive ever taken. 2 huge assignments that took up more time than my 300 level classes. she is condescending and demands a lot. attendance is mandatory even though class is pointless. every day i wished that i dropped... do not take this class unless you want no life and want to live and breathe the most boring shakespeare plays,0
Should anyone trust a Journalism/ English Professor whose last name is Blank-Book? Just saying.,0
"He's called Prof Awesome for a reason.  Compared to all the other profs we've seen this year, he is truly #1.  Wish he could teach everything - which I bet he could.",1
"YOU HAVE TO KNOW THE MATERIAL FOR THE TEST, but she is whilling to work with you if you have trouble with it being an online class.",1
"Dr. Meehan is the funniest sweetest lady in the psych department. She's always willing to help you and she really goes the extra mile to make sure you understand the material with in-class examples. She likes people that come to class, and her tests aren't easy As but you'll learn a lot and she keeps you interested. TAKE HER!",1
"His lectures are a bit hard to follow, he doesn't explain things horribly well and it's sometimes difficult to understand what he's saying. That being said, it's difficult to not get an A in his class, as he pretty much reviews the exact content on each exam the class period before. He wants you to get an A and understand the material.",1
"Murrie is a HORRIBLE teacher.  Has no clue how to deal with people in a major that REQUIRES people skills.  He's not challenging, just not good at actually TEACHING kids. Nuff said.",0
"Great guy but teaches so fast that it can be hard to keep up. Weekly quizzes were super hard and the exam was even harder. He definitely knows his stuff, but trying to process it all can be overwhelming.",0
One of the best professors Ive ever had. If you listen In class and study itll be hard not to get an A. He makes lectures not as boring and is very thorough and passionate about teaching. Im taking him again for micro.,1
"Class is easy to pass as long as you do the assignment on time, which there aren't too many at all. Not a tough grader until the final exam-beware. Finley just reads powerpoints word for word and then will repeat what they sid until class is over.",1
"She's a great lady. Not that good of a prof though. I had prior music experience, and I still had to teach myself everything before each test. You really need to have prior music experience before taking her classes, and a lot of patience. Maybe even a tutor. Tests were not easy, but still got a B. Good luck, you'll need it!",0
ANyone that doesnt like her teaching style should never become a programmer.........,1
"Great teacher, fun class and informative. Also helped me set up my schedule for next year",1
"Assigns labs, projects and exams all coinciding with each other giving you too much work due at once especially if youre full time. Very tough grader and does not give partial credit. Rude when you ask questions and unresponsive to emails. Dont take this professor.",0
"He's Jamaican can be hard to understand sometimes. He is very eccentric and will be bouncing around the classroom during the whole lecture. He does NOT compromise anything (no extra credit, curves, nothing). His lectures can be confusing. He says he will do something and does not keep his word. Do not recommend him AT ALL. Super hard class (A&P2)",0
"I had this prof. for Spring of 2020 and he very difficult to reach through email. He was very confusing, and unhelpful. Unless you had previous background in it like I did, you will most likely struggle. I had to guide quite a few students through the material. Some were promised regrades but did not get a response at all towards the last few days",0
"Earned a 98%. Everything is open book, so its impossible to fail. He also encourages you to use the book as well. Assignments are not locked, self paced course. Finished all assignments in less than 3 weeks, all while being a full time in seat student and employee. Do not be afraid to ask him questions. He constantly sends the class jokes. Easy A",1
"Mark is a really good professor, and I always enjoy his lectures. It has been mentioned here many times before, but you have to stay on top of his workload. Mark gives out a lot of readings and assignments, and it can be very easy to fall back in his course. His instructions can be broad, but he really encourages new ideas for his assignments.",1
"worst prof ever. i got 60/61 required outcomes and he gave me a B. this guy is rude, curses all the time, and is straight up mean to all students. dont take him if you cna help it",0
"You will hear good things about professor Stapp, but these things should be taken with a grain of salt. Stapp does not take attendance, but instead scatters random facts throughout his lectures that he will later include on the exams to make sure you attended. The exams are exceedingly long and difficult and make up pretty much all of your grade.",0
I loved taking Dr. Connolly's Disney class. There were only 3 tests (one got dropped) plus an optional final. If you show up to class and take good notes it is an Easy A. She also handled the switch to online classes very well.,1
Easy but didn''t learn much,0
Professor Kegler is an all around amazing guy. I highly recommend the class even if you are done with your fine arts requirement. As long as you show up and show progress on the piano you'll definitely ace the class.,1
"She is absolutely crazy. Unorganized, spaces out, very confusing. Talks about awkward topics in class and makes them even more awkward. She laughs at herself too much and stares you down which is so uncomfortable. Quizzes every other class but she drops the lowest one per exam. Goes through her slides way to fast. Honestly just an awful professor.",0
"Trina is amazing! Her lectures were easy to follow and she always took extra time to explain the material. She is a touch grader and requires full participation, but is very caring and is always willing to help. I absolutely recommend her, she is the best!",1
"You are in for the fight of your life when taking his class. Multiple 100+ page assignments are due every couple of weeks and the work is more than all of my other classes combined. Good luck keeping a job or social life while having a packy class. I will probably get a passing grade, but at what cost? I don't recommend taking his class at all.",0
"Comes off as intimidating but isn't once you get to know her. Study study study!!! You will not do well if you slack off, and she will not let you slide. But as a person (and Chairperson) she is quite adept and helpful. She knows what she's talking about.",1
"Tests and quizzes were only about quotes--not anything you actually learned. Quotes matter, yeah, but they don't tell you about anything you learned. So basically, you're memorizing nothing. Lots of reading and the textbook was hard and terrible. Long, old English, boring even for Philosophy majors. It was also an 8:30, two hour lecture. THE WORST.",0
"very unorganized, and i hate group projects, and in this class everything is a group project",0
"Lecture class but the outlines are not specific at all and doesn't always follow the readings exactly. I sometimes felt the three multiple choice exams we were graded on were more application-based than anything we learned. If you go to most classes, take some notes, and study the terms, it isn't hard to get a B.",0
a geat teacher,1
Mr. Mezik is very knowledgable about biology and he's genuinely enthusiastic about his students' educations and careers.,1
Amazing teacher. Make sure you go to class or you will fail. She will definitely bring the actor out of you. Will defintely help you cope with stage fright. Very easy DEC class for D. MUST TAKE!!!,1
"He's a good guy. This is a great class to take if you just need to get your gen ed math requirement out of the way. You still have to do the work assigned and put in a little effort, but all in all it's easy. May want to consider a different professor if you'll be taking higher maths, though. Doesn't let the class drag on-- teaches what's necessary",1
"He does have an accent, but honestly, it's not hard to understand him. His practice test are very close to actual test, he's willing to help and answer questions if you ask. He can get ahead of himself sometimes during lecture and will skip steps, but he'll explain if you just raise your hand and ask. If you study, you should be fine.",1
Janet is awesome. Awesome.,1
She's a hottie and a very nice professor. Woof!,1
"Ed is incredibly knowledgeable on database related topics with relevant experience and he is actively sharing this expertise with his students. His teaching methodology facilitates conceptual understanding and encourages student to become active leraners. By far one of the best computer science professor I have seen, sad to see him retiring.",1
"Only the grace of God was able to deliver me through this course. Just remember, if there is anything you should know about the REAL WORLD, is that you do not owe any form of kindness to someone that makes it a challenge for you. Even for authority.",0
"The textbook he recommends is pretty much useless as it does not relate much at all to practice questions. His lectures only cover around half of the material and can often leave some people in confusion. Without Carleton Math online resource, you might pretty much get lost in this class unless you like to face more challenges.",0
"I've read through many of the reviews of Betty and agree with most of them. She assigns a good 1 to 2 hours of homework for every class period. This is absolutely ludicrous for a MWF class that has nothing to do with my major. Every student getting a BA has to take the class though. My condolences to you all, fellow sufferers.",0
He is a good teacher but the class is hard. all of the test questions come strait from the lecture notes so study them and the test grades will be a little better,1
"Reviews that I read were so misleading. Grading is very inconsistent. He gives pop quizzes over 30 page chapters pretty often. Lectures the whole time, but not about anything in the book. Gives a take home midterm and final, but he grades them so tough that it doesn't matter. Also have 2 book reviews which aren't good either. Would not take him",0
Probably the worst professor I've ever had as far as teaching the material. He has one tone: quiet and boring. If you really want to learn the material don't take his section. My lab TA was awful and barely spoke English. His exams are near carbon copies of his previous tests. Homework solutions are posted online. Should've got a B but got an A,0
There is way too much work for a 6 week summer course I wish I chose another subject.,0
DO NOT TAKE HIM. EVER. IN. YOUR. LIFE.,0
"He truly makes the class more complicated than it should be. If you have to take him, take it online so you can use the book and notes. Don't bother with the powerpoints unless you are really stuck. He's not going to answer your questions, so use practice problems to help. Most assignment questions are based off the ones in his book. He's no help",0
Great prof with a funny sense of humour. You can tell he enjoys teaching and loves math. I would definitely take another course he teaches.,1
He really knows what he is talking about and he is very energetic. All his lectures notes are uploaded to blackboard so if you miss a class you are not screwed. You will need the book and don't study just by redoing previous midterms.,1
Shes literally amazing take her,1
Everything you read on here is correct. Dr. Sefton is the hardest professor at CSUN. I've never felt more pressure as a student. I am a history major and he has improved my study and writing habits dramatically. Visit him in his office and talk to him about coursework and about life. He is happy to guide any student in the right direction.,1
she's aight,1
Autumn does NOT keep up with putting grades in the grade book. She grades differently than stated in the syllabus. She does not respond to emails and keeps you from knowing your accurate grade until the last day final grades can be entered. She tests on materials that is different than what she lectures about and refused to help me in lab.,0
"Horrible class. Lectures are just 50 minutes of him rambling and saying things that don't really make much sense. Exams are impossible to complete in the time allowed. Both papers were scheduled within two weeks of each other at the end of the semester. Impossible to get a well deserved grade. TA said she loved my paper, but gave me a B anyways.",0
"It's extremely not true that she'll tell you exactly what's going to be in the test/quiz. She will only tell you which chapter to read. But, she's helpful. You may not understand what she's explaining in the class because she's a foreign professor from Saudi Arabia, if I'm not mistaken.",1
"Dr. McBeth's classes are ivy League with a small town mentality. This gentleman and scholar not only makes a rather boring class into something to remembered, but takes the time and patience to make sure ""all"" students are on par-onboard with the material. What a pleasure it was to be in this scholars class.",1
"A great guy and an amazing professor. You can tell he is very passionate about this subject and that he knows a lot about this subject as well. He doesn't give like almost any feedback on any exams or makeup exams, but they are not super difficult. You have to study because they are short answer exams.",1
"I can't think of one thing to say about her, neither good or bad. That is the impression she left on me.",0
"Tom Hardee... where do I start? His grading is SO hard. It was almost impossible to get an A on a paper. He was a very opinionated teacher. He talks about Spiderman a lot, so if you like that, you'll like him. We watched a movie at the beginning of each class that had nothing to with what we were learning. It was very hard to want to go to class...",0
This professor is incredibly full of himself and spends the entire class spewing his own ideas and philosophies and does not allow full discussion or debate amongst his students. He is rude and condescending towards the students in his class and is unclear on expectations on assignments. His class is poorly structured and it is difficult to learn,0
"Do no take this course, Cramer is good guy but his course only has 4 midterms (25% each) no assignment, no papers. The tests are designed to make you fail, and he expects you to know too much info - His slides and the textbook, then tests on the smallest info that you wouldnt remember. DO NOT TAKE",0
Don't take him if you can take someone else. I switched teachers and it was a great choice,0
Awesome teacher - really insightful however takes a bit of time to get back on assignments however this was the first time the class ran online. Fairly easy assignments that are actually beneficial to have i.e. resume and cover letter you'll get to use. One in person interview required.,1
"I loved the class. Hall explains things well. He warned us about 2 of the exam questions.  It really boiled down to if you remembered calculus or not. I panicked about the final, studied a lot.",1
"Wow. Worst class I've ever taken. Whether you're an engineer or an artsie, STAY AWAY FROM STV 100. And to Morley, the topic presented is appropriate for a thesis - NOT an entire class. Simply tries too hard to make something of nothing.",0
"While Dale comes across at first as very approachable,his overall atitude is one of superiority. In his classes it feels less like he's trying to teach you and more like he's putting on a show. His lectures are disorganized to the point where we spent a month talking about the sum of squares in theory before he remembered to show us the formula.",0
"Professor Prentiss was AMAZING!! Yes, we did have to write a few papers, but they were easy and she gave amazing feedback. She is very caring and wants you to do well and will work to help you catch up if you miss a class. I would very much recommend her as a professor because she is the best one I have had!",1
"If this professor knew how to keep to the subject matter he would be great, unfortunately, he goes off on tangents (usually about Judaism) and will frequently insult students with inappropriate remarks.  He's very unprofessional and it shocks me that he's been there for so long.",0
"I'm taking his class online and Mr. Manley is great! Encouraging, funny, and understanding. It's not too much work, and about what you'd expect for an online class. You get to learn about Adobe Photoshop too, which I love. Really cool guy who personally responds to you each week- I'm learning a lot!",1
"Lynda is pedantic and preachy. Actual quote in response to a reasonable question ""I didn't go to eight years of graduate school to entertain a question like that!"" She knows her stuff, but she lets you know THAT way too much. Nice person outside of class. Too much busy-work in her Intro class. Take Intro with Lanegran or other.",0
Professor Ciro is one of the worst teachers I have ever had. He is hard to understand and teaches 2 problems a class then makes you work on homework. He does not give study guides and never tells you information that you could potentially see on a test. He makes an easy math hard. Take someone else. Im probably going to get a C and Im an A student.,0
"Stephanie is passionate, but not a good professor. She is all over the place, constantly forgetting things, she doesnt really give homework and when she does its insanely out of our skill level. She also only gives a few quizzes and 2 exams- not scan tron. Also dont hold your breath for your grade. She has taken over 2 months to grade our midterms.",0
Harsh grader and doesn't provide rubrics. You never know what he is looking for. Claims that you don't need prior coding experience but still assigns multiple coding assignments without teaching how to code. I also went to his office hours once because my computer wouldn't run program. He couldn't even recommend a specific computer to replace it.,0
"Doc does a very good job with the music ed students, always looking forward and even making sure to talk about small schools and bring in people that will help.",1
Worst Professor I've had at Tech.,0
"Challenging but engaging. His into level class was great. It was a little difficult at times, but a lot of the discussions and assignments were designed to make us think. I have had few professors that encourage free-thinking as much as he did. If you want an intellectually stimulating class, he's your guy.",1
"His style is old school, he loves his students and teaches because he truly loves spreading his knowledge. He wants us to apply our knowledge, not just test our ability to memorize facts... Great guy!",1
"This course is fundamental to ECE243 in the next semester, otherwise of little value by itself. Nice prof, but lots of self-learning is required to figure things out, especially for labs. Labs (pre-labs especially) are very time-consuming, but worth very little.",1
"Although he might know what he's talking about, the thing is when he rambles and goes too fast, it's extremely hard to follow!!! Also, his writing onthe board was so hard to read, I barely took notes. So, if there was another teacher to take, I would say take em'. But your SCREWED, cuz he's the only teacher!!! overall, I absolutly HATED this class!",0
Doesn't really make an effort to help you improve.  Group critique sections are kind of useful but unfocused.  He provides almost nonexistent feedback until you get your grade.  You pretty much have to hound him for input.,0
"One of my favorite professors at AU. You can learn a lot if you take this class even semi-seriously. Professor Streitmatter is sweet and understanding when you have to miss class. He's really down to earth and has written like 9 books about race and gender. His exams are very specific and you have to read if you want to be in the ""B"" to ""A"" range.",1
"Dr. Craft is the best chemistry professor I have ever had. He is brilliant, without question, but his knowledge of chemistry is only rivaled by his ability to connect with students and make them feel capable of learning the material. He is always willing to offer extra help and wants his students to do well.",1
"ALL you have to do is read the text book, do the inquisitives (you can do them as long as you need till you get the grade you want) and pass the tests there are very few of them... easiest class I have EVER taken and I am not great at school. Requires little work, but you learn easily and quickly.",1
"Did better on my second exam, where I didn't go to lectures and just read the book. Everything he says in lecture is in the book. He didn't give enough examples for us to do in class. He seems nice, but boring and does not interact with students.",0
"soo adorable and very intelligent. amazing teacher. but you really have to keep up with the readings. his lectures were a bit boring at times, but the fact he was extremly helpful VERY easy to talk to made up for it. take CLAS 1000, you wont regret it, believe me.",1
"This class is a lot of work. Make sure to take really good notes while watching her lecture. She has 4 exams and there is really no room for error if you want an A. She gives some extra credit don't count on it helping that much. Quiz after every module. A lot of work and need to pay very close attention, almost needing to take word for word notes.",0
"I got an A in this class and didn't learn a lick of Spanish. The homework can be done using Google Translate and he'll still mark it as right. I bought the textbook with the supersite, never used it, and still passed. He lets you cheat on his exams using your phone, laptop, notes, etc.. He even tells you the answers to them the class before.",0
I'd rather impale my eyes with an ice pick than bother with her again.,0
Read and do yourself a favor by learning basic african geography or you'll never understand what's going on. You HAVE to STUDY. The final is cumulative but he grades on a curve,0
"He was basically impossible to get a good grade from. I got a C on my first paper, worked really hard on my next paper and got it proofread by a Masters student and ended up with another C. He has unreasonable expectations for first year English students and I dont feel confident in my writing skills anymore as a result. His lectures were awful.",0
GREAT TEACHER!,1
"Professor Reeves makes a difficult subject tolerable. I want her to be my grandma and bake me cookies. LOL but seriously take her class, there isn't a better RETL 261 Professor.",1
Somi has a significant clear step by step on board explanation on sample questions and principles. Overall excellent prof. Indian accent may hard to understand but not bad.,1
"I have no idea why Professor Warden has such a bad rating. She's my favorite professor at this school. You have to be willing to put in the work, but she is willing to help you as much as she can. We had a quiz on most Fridays, but they were only 5 questions and super easy. I LOVED this class. I wish I could take her for all my English courses.",1
"Aronson Was great. 3 tests throughout the whole semester. He hasn't changed them in years, he also goes over the test the class before . He wants everyone to learn. He calls on everyone. He makes tons of side comments, ""are you mumbling"". He is not afraid to call anyone out if they show up late, etc. He usually curves the tests. SPEAK UP!!!!",1
Profe Bedford is one of the nicest professors here at TCU and is well respected!! He is super easy to work with and he really cares for each of his students and gets to know them on a personal level (social and academic life). His test are super easy and nothing is a surprise on them if you go to class.,1
Made me want to stick a hot poker in my eye!,0
His class is a JOKE..... he may give confusing lectures but as long as you do the review sheets you will have an easy A...... i spent my whole time playing solitare and I have an A,1
"I loved Dr. Gray! He's a great guy and a great teacher. He's easily accessible and so is his TA. They're both really helpful and update your grade through out the semester to let you know where you stand. If you have to take stats, take him!",1
"The online class is self paced and has about 40 assignments, but they are not time consuming. The class is designed for you to get an A. The criteria is clearly spelled out and you can redo assignments to boost your grade, but its unlikely you'll need to. There are several extra credit opportunities. It's easy to get ahead and finish early.",1
"Heavy workload. I've always loved my Spanish Professors, but she was something else. Very difficult to communicate with, very harsh grader, very abrasive. I didn't feel like language learning was the priority; pure academics was. New languages are difficult and unless you have an excellent knowledge of the Spanish Language, be cautious.",0
"Super easy and fun class, definitely one of my favorites. She's really nice and genuinely interested in helping everyone become better writers, but does that through feedback and discussion, not grading. Straight 100's, no exams",1
"If you don't like to talk in front of a class, don't take him. He gives over 100 problems for homework and the only way to get credit for the homework is if you go to the ""homework days"" in which everyone, one by one, has to read the question and their answer. If you get it wrong and/or don't fully understand how to answer it correctly he gets mad.",0
"Accounting overall in general is tough. Go to class and follow the lectures, read the chapters before class, study as much as you can all the practice problems in the book and homework and you should do pretty good on the tests. Overall laid back professor and explained everything extremely well. Smartest accounting professor I've seen.",1
"This professor is term paper oriented. Makes absolute no sense it was she says, asks, lectures, responds, etc. She was very vague in what she wants from us. She is rude by reacting to questions by scolding you. The only reason I was able to pass was the extra credit she gave and her lenient paper grading. Good luck if you have her.",0
Absolutely horrible professor and person. She talks down to people and half the time doesn't know what she's talking about during her lectures.,0
"I did not like accounting coming in and I'm not keen on it going out...but I understand it a WHOLE LOT better than I did because of Prof. Sprinkle. Very open and helpful with the patience of Job, he knows his stuff, if you want to learn managerial accounting he's your man...if you don't WANT to, but HAVE to he's DEFINITELY the guy to go to!",1
deeply disappointed. discouraged me in aspiring a law career. does not direct students in learning at all.,0
"I felt like I was getting a lot out of the text/discussion boards until I took the midterm which completely plummeted my grade. I'm a senior, and an A student. Studied very hard for this test. Questions are very tricky. I didn't feel like the exam was testing my knowledge, but rather, trying to trick me.",0
"Had her for three courses, and sometimes regretted it.  You'll learn how to write well, but expect her to be unclear, tedious, difficult to compromise with, but office hours are helpful.  If you love the language and the subject, you'll do fine.  Tedious work in her book of grammar.",0
This class is not easy and requires a lot of reading. Dr. Paler is available and is always open to help students. She made the topic interesting and I learned a lot from this class. This class would be more boring and difficult if she did not teach it.,1
"ok, word of advice, study the powerpoint presentation, pretty much all of the exam comes from that.  this guy is awsome and has a lot of passion for jour. plus field trips! who can complain?!?!",1
Tests were for the most part well diversified but heavily weighted towards the essays. He obviously knows the period of Soviet/Russian transition (the topic of the class) and brings modern events into the class lectures. Not the most exciting class but good information to obtain if you are looking to pursue anything related to Russian Economics.,1
"He's a very sweet guy, but he is a very tough grader. If the response you give is a correct one but not what he was looking for, you will not get the points. Even if your response is researched, meaning it's not something you made up, and you have proof that the response is a valid response, it's not what he was looking for. So very close minded.",0
"Prof. Robbins is amazing; she loves her job and it is easy for students to see that. She is willing to put in the effort to see all her students succeed, and does a great job of effectively communicating the material, which is by no means easy. Get ready to study hard before exams, but if you show up and participate she gives some extra credit",1
"Professor Fowler is one of my favorite professors of all time. His lectures are so interesting and he his insightful (and can be funny!). You're graded on a mid term, final, and a term paper. It's tough to tell exactly how he's grading, but take LOTS of notes the few classes before the final and you should have a good idea about what to expect.",1
"He is a good guy and he means well. However, he will drive you crazy. He doesn't hand ANYTHING back, so you have no idea what your grade is. He is very unclear with assignments. Also not good at ILearn. However, you WILL learn stuff in his class because he often teaches whatever he feels like. Don't buy the textbook for HBio, you NEVER use it.",1
"Very down to earth and approachable. Makes an effort to relate to students. Subject is very dry and I cannot imagine anyone making it interesting, but he makes it bearable.",1
"Literally reads directly off the powerpoints, her voice is so monotoned that you can't help but sleep. Didn't go to lecture for 5 weeks and still got an A. Your grade is only made up of the 4 exams and the material tested isn't on powerpoints/study guides! Good luck my dudes",0
"Good guy, but terrible teacher. Class is start to finish lecture where he shows no energy for his subject, and merely talks in a monotone voice the whole class. I showed up every class and took notes. His online homework is absurd, takes at least 3 hours for each homework, and there is about 25 of them. Online quizzes are easy. Tests are hard!!!!!!",0
"Loved Professor Tate. Go to class, do the homework and you're guaranteed a good mark.",1
The class is very reliant on the textbook but his lectures are so interesting! Definitely my favorite class this semester,1
I really enjoyed taking her class. She let you work at your own pace and gave extra credit opportunities as well. All the quizzes come directly from the textbook (which you can easily find online). TAKE HER!,1
"Everything taught in the class is common sense. The virtual section was a joke. There's always going to be someone who doesn't participate and someone who does all the work, yet everyone receives the same grade. The lecture instructor also likes to make fun of minorities. Not a lot of chance to get points as tests are only about 40 Qs worth 120% ea",0
"Dr Beaulieu knows his stuff, however does not seem enthusiastic to be teaching the course. His lectures heavily repeat the notes he posts on courspaces in addition to the weekly textbook readings. The grading method for this course is very much not clear, and there is not a lot graded on.",0
"She was very hard to understand but as you spend more time in class you start to catch on. She is very scatter brained and easily gets off topic. She assigns a lot of essays and never posts grades online. If you want to know how you're doing you have to ask and it's rare to get an answer. Other than that she was very nice, just hard to take serious",0
"He is definitely a geek and really does care for his students. But he can get a little too weird at some points. I would say he is a pretty tough grader, especially for a basic English class. You have four major essays throughout the class so you would want to focus on this. He only allows for three absences before he can kick you from the class.",1
Richard Smith is the MAN! His lectures are extremely interesting as well as extremely organized. You can tell he enjoys what he does! By far one of the best Prof's I've had in the CMNS department at SFU,1
"Manchester is hard- but somewhat fair. Her grading is difficult- and she expects a lot out of you. She thinks her class should be your top priority, and is in denial about the amount of work she gives- overall good with extensions when needed and not an awful teacher- just frustrating due to her expectation of perfection. Work hard & you'll be fine",1
I took him for some American Indian Studies courses.  He's very knowledgeable and will answer any questions.  Tends to get off topic a lot though. Easy A if you do the work.  Tells a lot of stories based on personal experience and has a good sense of humor. If you need to up your GPA with an easy class take him.,1
Not helpful. arrogant. shouln't be tenured.,0
Great teacher. Went over everything in detail and very easy to understand.,1
"I am a history minor, and I was expecting to have a great semester because I'm a history junkie, especially U.S. I just love learning and talking about it because it's something I'm genuinely interested in, but Professor Hall just made my semester pretty crappy. He is the worst grader I've ever had, and won't explain what you do wrong. It's stupid.",0
"Listening to Ryan Dill through a computer is torture. His voice is completely monotone and expressionless and he puts forward the material in the least engaging way possible. I don't know if the class is boring or if it is Ryan's terrible delivery. When it comes down to it, Ryan should not be teaching in any way shape or form.",0
"Hypocritical grader.... Isn't friendly, and when I tried to come by and explain myself on my speeches she just shoots you down like you're an idiot... I've never given a teacher a bad report, but this was just awful. I thought this would actually be a more enjoyable gen ed but she just makes you want to not go to class. ",0
"Was a bit irked at first because it seemed more like a philosophy course than an English course, but readings pay off because many of the texts show up in later English courses. Had 'writing workshops' and formative feedback for papers which helped to not procrastinate and do really well. Attendance mandatory: -2.5% per missed class!",1
I think Terry is a great teacher and he would give you as much as he would to fulfill your questions. One of the nicest teacher I ever met and one of a few knowledgeable teachers at CFA.,1
"She's the best professor ever! She's so nice and actually cares. She always lets class out early or cancels it. She's a pretty easy grader and she lets you rewrite papers if you're not satisfied with your grade. You just have to show up, and sit through it, you don't really do much in class. I would definitely recommend taking her class",1
"Not many tests, just 3 big speeches and a couple of smaller ones. But when you do get exams they can be difficult and graded hard, don't go over studying for exam as much as like the speeches. Can be a tough grader during speeches. She does offer help for your speeches you just have to ask her and she'll tell you a clear answer of what she expects.",1
The worst teacher I have ever had. I went to her on several occasions and she was rude and never helped,0
"I LOVE Dr. Forcade as a person. I took him for Math 290 over Spring term. HOWEVER, and this may have been a mistake on my part, taking a STEM class during a single sprummer term, it was very difficult course. I also wasn't particularly motivated to care at this time in school. BUT, Forcade is a very caring person and knows math very well. thumbs up",1
"I can definitely see why Prof. Testa is such a polarizing instructor. His lecturing style is a bit disorganized and rambling. The readings tend to be on the heavier end, and he does expect a high degree of class participation. That said, his classes are always entertaining and interesting. I learned a lot from him!",1
"Greattt teacher. Really cares and goes out of his way. His class is really hard, but what do you expect, it's ochem. You should take really good notes and write all of the logic down, or get a recorder. He'll help you at all costs. Highly recommended, challenging, fun, good at teaching.",1
"STOP TALKING WHILE I""M WRITING... I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU JUST SAID BECAUSE I AM TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING FROM THE PROJECTOR... Great teacher I must say but geez man you'd better have a good outline for what you are SPECIFICALLY looking for on the exam... Unless you give us a day to write it...I'll name my next pet fish after you.",1
"I had him for 3 classes- 135, 136, & 137. As long as you do the work and participate a bit, you'll get a good grade. He gives a lot of leeway because he considers writer to be ""artists."" Inspiring and knows his craft. One of the coolest teachers I had at Palomar.",1
"The class is very interesting, just show up to class and take good notes. His pop quizzes, midterm and final are open book and open note. You have 3-4 papers to do.",1
"Dr Jamieson has a good heart, and is a nice man, but I did not feel that he had the qualifications to teach my course. Additionally, his lectures were virtually pointless and not supportive with the rest of the course. Most of the semester was taught by students(via presentations).",0
"He takes this stupid crap way too seriously. Dumb class. He waits for an eternity for someone to answer a question. Don't expect to do good on the exams, his questions are weird. Also, never misspell anything, he'll take 25% off for dumb things like that.",0
"Lectures are dragged-out and could be much shorter if she didn't give multiple 30-minute breaks. Also, Aplia assignments get graded by average instead of your highest score. Let's say I get a 5/5 on the second or third attempt of a problem, the final score would be something like 2.7/5 depending on what you got in previous attempts.",0
"I personally loved having him for Psych 304, everything was made very clear during lectures and he goes over the problems specifically. His tests are kinda weird bc he focuses a lot on math during lecture but his tests have conceptual idea that need to be explained thoroughly in order to get credit. I recommend honestly",1
"love this class, very interesting, great lectures",1
I took this professor for MATH 1070. He is a good professor. If you just put in the decent amount of time as a diligent student should you will have no problem passing the class. Exams are a little tough but still manageable.,1
Too Slow,0
"Labs and some lectures mandatory. Extremely well adapted for the online format. No midterm and NO exam in this class. All project based. The complexity of the work isn't hard, you just have to put some time into learning the DFMA software/doing the projects. Good prof.",1
I had Angie as a clinical instructor. She was able to provide good feedback on all my clinical paperwork and allowed the students to contact her with any questions. Yes she is a bit behind in grading papers but if you contact her she will give you the feedback that you need to make improvements. Overall I think she was a good instructor.,1
Hey they don't call him the silver fox for nothing.,1
"I am a senior as well and have written many papers and was unable to get full points on anything. Quizzes are extremely tricky, almost like exams. Even if you read and study you probably won't get full points. Wants you to engage in discussion and ask questions, then gets irratated and annoyed when you don't talk about exactly what she wants. NO!!",0
"Avoid her at all costs, harsh teacher, awful grader. Boring class. Take any other teacher for 312",0
"If you are looking for a professor that will inspire you and make you believe in yourself, do not take her course. Dr. Wilson does not present confidence in the material, is a moving target for assignments, and treats her students as delinquent HS freshmen. Spends too much time on powerpoint slides, you're better off reading at home. Bored nightly.",0
"If you need to take anatomy or micro, TAKE IT WITH HIM!!!! He's amazing and tries to actually simply all the information and tests to make it easier on us. He tells you exactly what's going to be on the test. His lectures are dense, but he explains a lot. Also, so much extra credit... he really helps you try to pass even if you're doing bad.",1
Really helpful and has great stories. He will give you his honest opinion so don't be afraid to ask.,1
She was very easy to understand but challenging,1
"Very helpful, clarity is amazing, friendly to the max",1
"Dr. A taught Modern Physics for the first time in a while and did a great job. Its a tough course. Thats just a fact. But I learned a lot and for a course of that difficulty I never felt overwhelmed. Great course, and would definitely recommend any student take University physics over general just to have him as a prof",1
Mean-spirited,0
"Avoid him if you can. His teaching method is him directly reading from his PDFs. He's extremely unorganized -- he comes to class and then starts thinking about what to teach, and begins to look for PDFs. You'll here this line very often ""The PDF I wanted is on another device, maybe we'll take a look at it next class."" --Then he never goes over it..",0
"If you are enrolled in her BIO 120 lecture, GET OUT. She puts out lectures and seems to be reading from a book (she often messes up and has to go back) and just reads off slides with very confusing diagrams. Not tech-savvy and the material on her exams were not covered in the class. Assignments are ridiculously hard and I had to get a tutor to pass",0
"Professor Gilbert takes forever to grade the assignments that were assigned, that why so many students didn't do the work because the assignments would never get graded. When you would try to contact her about the questions you had, she would never email you back. With her grading things late it was hard for us students to help our grade.",0
"absolutely hated this class. tests were nothing like textbook, old tests didnt do much as hes new so no base to follow. save yourself the trouble. take it at utm and get a 95",0
"Dr. Borden is very sweet and motherlike. She made online lectures fairly interesting and I enjoyed the readings. Classes are pretty lecture-heavy and the material is challenging, though. There were lots of papers and it was actually my most time-consuming / challenging class. She is very caring and will make time to talk to you if needed.",1
"Dr. Pigg is a wonderful professor. In this class you will read a LOT of plays and you will have to read aloud in class. He has tests, but they are out of class and open book for the most part. You will have to give a presentation and write a 6 page paper.",1
"The most insulting aspect of this class was the fact she using cross-word puzzles.  My God, I thought I was back in elementary school again.   This is not a college-level instuctor and I will never take another class with her.  The Department of history has the best professor on campus and the worst.  Very sad.",0
"I am so confused in his class, the whole class is. His lectures barely scratch the surface and his tests are the hardest thing that you will ever take. I do not recommend.",0
"He was pretty good. A lot of people talk about how he's too vague, which is true, but honestly it's not that bad, I think it's been a bit overstated. Slides are not too good, very little detail, so I highly recommend using the textbook to get a good understanding of the material and make your own detailed notes from the lecture and textbook.",1
"Waste of everyone's time.  Anyone actually interested already knew it, and were an extreme rarity.  This is a class designed for people who are going to get Ph.D.'s, but regardless, it should be made accessible, useful, and interesting, instead of the acad",0
Kender is awesome.  Enough said.,1
"Her online class was pretty basic; read a chapter, take a quiz answer a question. but it seems like she asks you trick questions on the quizzes. Also, even if you follow her rubric for the preschool observation step by step, she will still say you are not in detail enough.",0
"Prof is a nice guy and is really willing to work with you provided that you're willing to try. Does a pretty good job lecturing, but you can only make data structures so interesting. Assignments are challenging but not necessarily unfair. Expect a hard course that requires some work, but not because the prof is trying to make it hard.",1
"He goes through the material very quickly. Class was relatively pointless except to turn in homework (which is graded!) Review sessions were pointless, and the previous exams he posts are nothing like the exams he gave my class. He is a nice enough guy, but you have to ask specific questions if you expect any help from him.",0
"Professor Liggin is an amazing professor. The lectures are exciting. attendance is not mandatory but if you skip class, you won't pass. Professor has a bold sense of humor that will keep the class engage if you have questions ask he will answer!!!! Take him, best professor",1
"His tests were almost impossible unless you reallllly understand Physics.  If you made a 7.5/15 on the test, you had a A.  The stuff on the tests isn't covered in class.  I would recommend taking someone else!  He is very smart however...too smart to teach a general physics class.  Has awards in nuclear physics, etc.",1
"Boring, but nice.  She's really knowledgeable and tough, you better study!",0
"She is overall a nice woman, but her teaching style is tedious. Be prepared to take many notes: if she doesn't see your pen moving, she will call you out. She also starts class a few minutes early, so if you're on time you are late.",0
"Not as pretentious as some profs, and she'll go out of her way to make sure you understand the course material.",1
"Dr. Kostopoulos is a great instructor. Participate in the conference activities and submit your papers on time ( he is flexible if you are not on time but communicate with him), you will get a good grade. Make sure you post useful entries in the conference.",1
"he was a very nice teacher. we actually addressed him about the accent and he attempted to work at it. that was fall '02. other than that intro wasnt so bad, just a little hard to understand.",1
I love her! Will take every class of hers. Very organized. Her website is the best thing since sliced bread. I learned so much. I enjoyed the assignments. She knows her stuff. She is patient & kind. Always willing to help. Take her classes! You will learn & grow.,1
"I never thought I was interested in psychology until I took this class, and all of a sudden BAM! Very easy tests, very easy paper, very easy everything! And the material was incredibly interesting (however you do have to be slightly interested in genetics to thoroughly enjoy it)",1
"The professor's method of making up for in class time was to assign tests every week and a ton of reading. Tests aren't a limited time so it's not hard to look up the answers to questions you're unsure on. Posts readings, powerpoints, articles, and vlogs every week. No way to keep up with it all while taking other classes. Harsh on extensions.",0
She's very passionate about what she does and her lectures are very interesting. I wouldn't say that the class is easy but it's not incredibly difficult either. It's crucial to actually read the recommended readings because we discuss them in class.,1
"One textbook is required, but she gives you links to other readings that will be required. You will have a reading quiz every single day of the semester with 5-10 questions of the LARGE amount of reading that she had assigned. She's not a very easy grader. Extremely passionate about feminism.",1
"Professor Ravi's 212 is a really in depth look at C. You need to pay a lot attention to the lectures to be able to handle each homework. The homeworks themselves can take quite a few hours to solve, so don't start them on the last day. Luckily he has a lenient late homework policy. Going through this class will make you a much stronger coder.",1
This teacher was by far one of the HARDEST I've had at UH.  Her notes are very mixed up and her tests suck.  They're multi-choice/fill in the blanks and essay.  NO EXTRA CREDIT ever.  I went to her for help and she basically kept repeating herself over and over again to just re-read the book even though I've already done that.,0
McCargar is a passionate professor. He love the subject he is teaching and students feel it too. He is funny and serious at the same time. There is a lot of work and it's tough but we learn a lot.,1
Awful teacher and human being. I had him for two or three weeks and decided I would rather NOT do math at all than be taught by a terrible prof who takes marks off for stupid things (or who can't make sure his own assignments are printed correctly).,0
"MOST BORING PERSON TO EVER LIVE. monotone lectures are better than white noise for sleeping, reads the textbook, and does exercises, no initiative to ask students if they're learning, don't even read the chat if people have questions! HW and Exams are via 3rd party. no need to attend cuz he can care less how many ppl join, hell teach an empty class",0
"She is the worst professor I have ever had. An absolute joke. Shes often off topic, goes on long rants, is very pretentious and condescending. I truly would transfer universities before taking her again.",0
"Great lecturer and good person, but extremely difficult class. She calls herself the ""dream crusher"" and prides herself on being tough. Her exams are hard, but get easier as they go since the topics get easier. The final was literally impossible. Good luck.",1
"He's a nice guy and that's about it. All he does is talk about things that don't even apply to sociology and when you actually pay attention, he has culturally rude remarks to say. Only take him if you want to fall asleep in class and never learn anything.",0
"The course itself was easy and interesting, but the prof made it difficult as some of the material discussed would be completely different from the quizzes.  I enjoyed the class but not the prof who taught it.",0
"Just save yourself the headache and take someone else. Not that the class was extremely difficult, but she definitely makes you work for the grade. Very nit-picky about things that don't really matter and is a harsh grader, although most of the work was graded by Connect. Without the Connect assignments, this class would be unmanageable.",1
"Callahan is probably my favorite professor so far at kettering. This is a hard class, lots of reading, a good amount of writing and research. the guy is smart, really smart and makes class discussion interesting, would take again in a heartbeat for another class even knowing how hard he is. good sense of humor too",1
Joe is hilarious which makes learning the subject far easier. Really enjoyed how he conducted his online class and am happy to continue learning Latin despite not having a prior interest.,1
"John Jones is a nice old man who moves very slowly and makes math INCREDIBLY easy. He has this ""homemade"" textbook, which is a bit strange but works fine. He tries to incorporate activities and stuff to make the class fun. Sort of felt like a high school class- but in a good way. I'm terrible at math but was able to excel in his class. Take him.",1
"He assigns homework every night and although it is easy, it is extremely pointless and repetitive. During class, he will call on you and challenge you. Also, he is an extremely hard grader its very difficult to get 100%. Before you can turn in an assignment, you have to visit the writing center. Take this class with a friend, you do peer reviews.",0
"God he's so bad at teaching. Doesn't show up to class half the time for no reason. Brushes off all complaints. Doesn't listen to students. Also cringy and pretentious. Tries really hard to be ""hip and cool"" but it doesn't work. Seriously though, he grades tough, doesn't give proper instructions on assignments, doesn't listen to student feedback.",0
What is he talking about?  Not sure he knows.  Doesn't seem interested in what the students do.  Just do what he says.,0
"His classes are heavily discussion-based. You will lead one class discussion, which isn't hard. Reading the textbooks are a must, but he always holds review sessions before each exam so you know what's on the test. He takes attendance. He is also very inspirational to every psych major -- a revered man in the field of psychology.",1
"Really nice lady. She does a good job of relating key ideas from textbook to lecture, always willing to answer questions from students. Enjoyed going to class and felt like she was a professor that cares.",1
"Don't be scared of this class. If you put in the proper effort to study for the exams, you'll be fine. There are 3 exams and a final(all MC)- questions come straight from his handouts and the images he shows in lecture (many are different from the textbook). There's no homework (all lectures), and he curves each exam by 4-6 points.",1
"His class is boring.  He gives out very little partial credit. He overcomplicates every situation and doesn't teach from the book.  Then, when you do the bookwork, you find the concepts seem easier.  Remember, though, he makes the tests using the same format from class, which sucks.  DO NOT TAKE HIS SECTION.  Even a geinus could only pull a B.",0
good prof kinda dry though good pairing with allison,1
He is a very thorough professor who does an awesome job teaching the subject.  He is extremely organized and helpful to those asking questions in class.,1
Good teacher. You need to be self motivated since it is an online. It is a mostly self-taught course though if you ran into any problems she was always happy to help figure out what the problem was. Her style may not be for everyone but overall i recommend her =),1
Mr. Burt is the worst professor that I have ever taken. His tests are hard but would be doable if he actually taught in class. He gets half the example problems wrong during lecture then when students ask questions he tries to dodge them by answering something he actually knows how to do. Lab is bad because he does not know how to set up the lab.,0
"Lectures arent very hands on. Hours of homework each week, pages on pages of open response, very tough grader on those. I took AP physics before so I knew a lot of this stuff in advance, but the way he explained it just made it confusing. Dont like leaving a bad review but hopefully this helps prof correct the problem for future students.",0
Assigns too much reading and lectures are kinda dry and boring. But he is a nice guy and really easy going.,1
"Though she doesn't always show it, Dr. Ernst is very sweet and willing to help, as long as you put in the work and follow her rules (e.g. no cell phones in class). Grade was average of 6 exams, which aren't easy, but they're reasonable. Buy the study guide, and review your test with her during office hours! Good attendance gets you extra credit.",1
"Shes not a bad professor, however sometimes she does not really answer questions and is not clear at all.  The whole semester is sitting watching classmates present their lesson.  Two big papers to do that are tedious but otherwise it is easy just boring",0
"language use not professional at all, lectures and similar day after day and he is very opinionated.",0
"I'm about to be dropped from the class for being more than 10 minutes late a few times. A buddy of mine was incapacitated for two weeks and was dropped because ""that wasn't a good excuse"". Unfortunately, the class she teaches is a mandatory gen ed, and it appears she teaches every one. She is extremely rude and disrespectful to all in her class",0
"Tends to use internet videos as a tool to teach students and requires students to participate in saying what they learned from the video. If not, a pop quiz is promptly given. Lectures given are over  PowerPoints that are recited word for word.  Doesn't express much enthusiasm in the field of psychology.",0
"Very respectable, respects his students, helpful, seems humble which is important because often times other profs egos can impair teaching, good at relating physics to real life, difficult but I loved this class and miss the physics. .",1
WOW,0
"Dr. Smith was a very knowledgeable teacher. You have to really study the court cases, and if you have a great memory, take his class. Consequently, hes a great instructor, and I would highly recommend taking his class; he makes it enjoyable.",1
Marking is extremely biased and unfair - and can you say BO? She downright stinks in more ways than one!,0
"Prof Marlowe is awesome. Lectures may be long but you have a very thorough study guide for every test. I got a 100 on all the tests without spending tons of time studying. There are also a few essays and if you're good at writing, it'll be easy for you. Participation and attendance matter. She is a great professor to have. Don't bother buying book.",1
"...Dang. This class. The professor is kind, energetic, knowledgeable, personal and hilarious. Type really fast!! Get everything! His test questions are one of those kinds where all the questions sound right, in fact, all of them usually are but you have to choose ""the one that is BEST"". Killed me every time.",1
Cool guy easy class,1
"Great professor, easy to talk to and tells great stories of when he was a cop.  learned a lot and highly recommend taking this teacher!!!",1
"After taking 3 of his courses, I made a clean list of pros vs. cons: Pros: 1. Life-changing lectures 2. Encourages everyone to talk and tries to manage a good atmosphere for discussion 3. Not really approachable (busy with his research& youtube channel) Cons: 1. Atypical criteria for assignments&essay(need merge psy&phl) 2. No slides or notes :(",1
"Dr, Carol is very good at what she does. I admire you information and her willingness to learn from her students as well. Most professors that teach graduate level courses feel they are only source of information that matters. The reason why I said she grades hard is because she follows strictly follows  APA formats but she provides great feedback",1
"His lectures consist of online powerpoints which you can access at home. There was no point in going to class because he would just read off the slides. I passed the course by reading the textbook, constantly. He does curve test scores. The test consists of phrases from the text and slides.",0
"He is so enthusiastic about Shakespeare, and utterly brilliant!  As an actor, he adds extra excitement to the readings whenever he quotes the readings, making class time fly by. He's a genius.  The best at Marymount, (and NYU is lucky to have him too!)",1
"I found the class to be really laid back, and the subjects we disscussed were very interesting. But there are only 4 exams, and attendence counts toward your grade. If you aren't a good test taker like me, I wouldn't recommend this course. The teacher is kind of funny and really chill, but I never felt like I could come to him with any questions.",1
Best Teacher Ever.  Period.,1
"Group Projects were my downfall. There's homework due in-class first thing every day(luckily its for completion). But that's on top of online WeBWorK assignments, and exercises graded for accuracy every week. Also a conceptual quiz every single week. More conceptual than any math class should be.",0
"Tons of reading. Speaks either way too quiet or way too loud. His stories were pretty funny, but overall the class dragged on. The quizzes were constant and confusing. The material covered was much different than what was seen on the quizzes. The essays will save you in the end if you're a good writer and competent in the subject of Philosophy.",0
"Clear about what he wants from his students but its alot. Way too many quizes that require meticulous reading of 20+ page almost every week. 2-3 essay assignments each semester on top of that and lots of memorization (ALL of the quiz answers, plus notes) for exams. Too much for a core class even though he lectures well.",0
I had professor Mathis for poetry and I had a solid B the whole semester(because only grade were the daily worksheets ) until our first test 12 weeks into the semester she grades unrealistic on the paper I got an F because I didnt meet the page requirement. When I went back to redo it I was literally 2 sentences away getting an A in rare,0
"Everyone has to take this class in the SMAD major, so it's important to do well. Super lecture heavy, I missed one class and was confused afterward. Miss four classes and you don't get extra credit, so go! The extra credit brought my grade up an entire letter. Only tests and extra credit so work hard. Soenksen makes the class interesting and fun!",1
Staples is a nice guy be expects way too much. Multiple assignments will often be due the same day making it a heavy workload. Lectures are incredibly lengthy and would be a lot shorter and more bearable if he didn't talk about himself so much. The midterms are actually pretty hard; they consist of one essay question and a multiple choice section.,0
"Great Prof. He's one of the most interesting people I've met and tells great life stories. As long as you show up to class and take decent notes, it'll be cake. There's 2 quizzes, 2 exams, and a final paper which are all quite easy if you ask me. You won't regret taking Prof Buckridge.",1
Very knowledgeable professor. He loves when you ask questions or participate in any way because most of the time it's just him talking. He expects a lot for essays and exams but that's only because he prepares you well for them if you take good notes and study. Laid back class and he doesn't take attendance. Glad I had him as a professor,1
"Professor Baker is awesome! I recommend you guys take him because his lectures are very interesting and his assignments, quizzes, and online exams are relatively easy. Just follow the instructions and you'll be fine.",1
"Gave papers made classmates revise or else itll hurt your grade.. didnt have class the last two months, still had essays due tho!",0
"I liked the class, but he was a really tough grader.  I thought my final grade was unfair given the amount of effort and time spent inthe photolab, but whatev... I still liked the class.",1
his final is so hard!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Even harder than hw and I even could not finish it.,0
"Took terrorism and Contemporary . Amazing lecturer and kept me engaged and interested. Work is really not that hard if you go to class and pay attention to his anecdotes on the readings. Honestly,  I skimmed the books and got A's in both classes since he goes over books in great detail in class. Very interesting classes. Pop quizzes but small %. ",1
"Not her biggest fan. She interrupts you a lot, especially when you voluntarily read in front of the class from the book. You need to write down word for word she says in class in order to even pass an exam and she'll take away lots of points if it's not word for word what she said. Very frustrating and hard to sit through the class.",0
The exams are too tricky. Tough Grader. He wants students to come meet him in his office hours and ask him their doubts. He loves it when students do that.,0
"He's not the best at teaching, and he doesn't take into account that students typically are able to use PHIL 140 as a mark-booster. The way he has formatted this class isn't representative of how most 140 classes are, as there is a term paper (worth 30%), discussion posts and the final has an essay portion as well. Taking this class was a mistake.",0
"Professor Searfoss comes into class expecting the students to lead the entire thing for an hour and 15 minutes. Instead of teaching or asking provoking questions, it almost seems like she is so bored that she could care less about planning out a thoughtful class discussion. Prepare to read a lot and talk about what you read every class period.",0
"Literally one of the worst online profs I've ever had. No online lectures, FOR A MATH CLASS, expected you to learn everything by reading the textbook. The quizzes and tests are not reflective of the graded homework whatsoever. Only allowed one side of a piece of paper to use for a 50 question exam. Not willing to work with students AT ALL.",0
His class helped a lot!  Be prepared to spend hours studying though.  Be on time to class too!  He's very strict about that.  This class helped a lot for PHY 211...I couldn't have made it through PHY211 without Shultz's PHY 111. Don't take Goodson!,1
"Demers is very inspiring. I really loved ECON3900 with him. Out of all the profs teaching 3900, he is 100% the best. Slightly better than his wife's ECON3900 i think",1
"Hands down, best CJ instructor I've had yet! Very clear grading. If you pay attention to all lectures you will know exactly what he is looking for on exams and briefs. He aims to create thinkers, not minions so you'll get your money's worth. He's also very approachable in office and in class. Wish he taught more CJ courses.",1
"He never gave direct answers. Lecture was very boring and useless. Questions on tests were harshly graded and covered material not discussed in lecture or of great importance. He rarely gave bonus opportunities. The labs conducted didn't line up with the chapter discussed. Luckly, easy points was from online assignments.",0
"Great professor, really explains course concepts well. This year the class sizes were very big (150 students), making it a bit hard to hear him from the back, especially with his accent. The midterm was also really difficult (60% class average) but thankfully he gave us a really easy final exam. Overall I enjoyed the course and would take it again.",1
Phoney = Lim. I think this is self-explanatory enough.,0
She taught the lab course well. A nice and helpful professor. i recommend the tissue culture course.,1
"Tate pushes students. In my case, he pushed me too far. He threw away my art because he didn't like it. He gave so many assignments that I was forced to withdraw from the class so that my other classes weren't affected. While he is great, Tate is extremely unrealistic and I was disappointed that his class has nothing to do with interior design.",0
"not the best class.not the clearist teacher. but you can't change that, he's the only one who teaches this class.dont worry if you dont understand at first, every is clear during the last week of class (review classes)",0
If the class is online expect to teach yourself most of the material.. The examples shown in lectures are no where near how hard the exam questions are.,0
"I hated this class with a passion. He is a cool person but I don't think he is teacher material, or maybe because he hasn't found his groove yet since he was a new teacher. The lectures dragged on, he would get off topic easily and we wouldn't cover all of the material before the tests. Easy A/B but be ready to be miserable.",0
Good class! Great prof.,1
"She is my all time favorite professor. No one can top her, she is INCREDIBLE. After taking this class I have become a book horde. Thanks to her, I know what books to look for and how to find a quality book for my library. I learned to become a good storyteller and how to make reading fun. I loved her class so much. Do yourself a favor and take her.",1
One of THE best and most experienced professors at Babson! I had the pleasure of having him during his first semester as a professor and he was phenomenal. He was able to relate the course information along with his experiences as COO of Wayfair! Extremely friendly and down to Earth guy considering his power and who he is! Would definitely take.,1
I loved her ! She was extremely helpful. I took her for African American literature and she actually found a way to relate each reading to current issues . I would take her class again,1
"Catherine was kind, however not a very engaging lecturer. 90% of our grade came from 3 multiple choice tests that consisted of specific, and challenging questions. I found it extremely hard to do well in her class as there were not many chances for us to demonstrate our knowledge. Our TA was great and picked up a lot of the slack.",0
"A smart guy, knows what he's talking about. Outgoing with a sort of corny 80's sense of humor as expected of someone his age. The class itself, compared to other Radford classes is probably among the most difficult ones. If you're smart, you should be able to handle it. You are going to have to see him after class, but he makes himself accessible.",1
He is very enthusiastic about the material and is very approachable. Sometimes is harder on tests than necessary but is a great prof overall.,1
"Sandra Baker is extremely likable and truly seems to care about her class. She does her best to get the class involved (since it is a fairly large class) and offers numerous extra credit opportunities. There are three exams, a final, and a diet analysis project (which is an easy grade booster). If you take this class, take Baker.",1
"Covers lots of material (she is an attorney and a Ph.D.).  She reads from notes but only because she is being thorough.  She breaks up the reading with legal cases, videos and 2 jeopardy games (to aid in studying).  You will learn a lot.  I loved this course!!",1
"Clear and concise! You know exactly what to expect on the exam. Grading system sucks, because you are ranked against other people in the class. Not a prob with enough studying though. Also, he is kinda rude (sometimes). Good teacher though!",0
"Dr. Spener is an extremely tough grader, he has unrealistic expectations about his students; which could become real ones if he would provide clear grading criteria, but no one knows what he is looking for and suddenly you get points deducted for extremely minor things, which is very unfair. He knows what he teaches but he is very disorganized.",0
"The structure of this class was very different than any other psych class I had taken. It was nice to be able to watch the modules on your own time and I found my discussion group helpful. Chris is a great guy and his videos were very straight forward, but I think for this course in particular, you interact with the TAs way more.",1
"He does not teach. His instructions are not clear and often they contradict themselves. Do not, under any circumstances, take this class. It is more work than what it is worth, and even if you try hard, it still won't help your grade as much as you think. The professor has boat loads of character flaws to say the least.",0
"his class kicked my ass, but he's a great teacher. i think he passed me so he wouldn't have to deal with my drama again.",1
"I took this prof for PS 110 in the summer semester. I was so nervous because of the online format. I had trouble with my Cengage code and emailed him. He emailed me before class started to make sure that I was good! Class consisted of watching a video, answering questions, taking a test and writing a 300 word essay. Great prof and cares about you!",1
"Upon coming to Hope, I checked BP's ratings on here because I had him for FYS. That made me very nervous because many said you couldn't have an opinion in his class. I didn't find this true at all. I thought he was very accepting. I loved his style of teaching and took Rel 100 with him. I think he's a great prof and truly cares about the material.",1
Her lectures are solely talking which is very hard to follow along with. 10 online Pearson quizzes which are easy. 3 timed blackboard quizzes which are tough and mainly the going to the source book which is very hard to understand. Final is a group project story map. I would not recommend her.,0
"no one should ever have to take this class, but since we have to Keys is the best to have, he cares about his class and somehow makes it somewhat interesting",1
"MAT300 is a very difficult course, and Steve is an ""ok"" professor. If you have other decent options, I'd recommend taking someone else. His lectures are sometimes all over the place, and they're so long and boring it's so hard to pay attention. Tests are hard only because they cover a lot of tricky material. Homework is impossible too. ",1
"Gives terrible feedback, misspells almost everything, demands too much for how little he seems to care about the students.",0
"THE CLASS ISN'T HARD. HOWEVER, THIS PROFESSOR GIVES EXTRACREDIT( JUST 2 POINTS EACH EXTRACREDIT). YOU HAVE TO WRITE ALL THE NOTES BECAUSE YOU GONNA BE LOST IN HIS TEST, WHICH IS 20 QUESTION MULTI-CHOISE. THE QUIZZES ARE HARD AND HE NEVER GONNA HELP YOU, SO FORGET THIS GUY FOR SURE..iTS DIFFICUL GET ""A"" FOR THE ""HARDER"" QUIZ.",0
"The most liberal professor I have ever had. Do not disagree with him on politics. He will try and make you feel super dumb. Had class period he would not teach but just hate on the president. If youre a republican, do not take him or just keep your mouth shut. He was very easy but super negative and pushed his beliefs on everyone.",0
Very hard course for a gen ed not related to your major. This would be an okay class for a talented independent learner who was ready to work really really hard and interested in this subject or an Anthropology major. If that is not you don't take it. Make sure if you take this course to READ the book and study HARD. Please. Take notes. Good luck.,0
"I did not enjoy him. His comments always made you feel like you were extremely lacking in knowledge. While criticism is critical to improvement, you did not receive a good grade unless you ripped someone else's piece apart, which is not productive in the least. AVOID.",0
Not helpful to students. Rude during my interactions with him. Talked to me as though I was still in high school and could not explain his own mistakes in class.,0
"For the school he is at he was difficult. I have taken five classes from him at this point and have learned so much. He's unique in his approach, but definitely have respect for him, even if I don't always agree with him.",1
GREAT educator and most importantly good person. You will learn immensely. I recommend him for your divisionals.,1
A really good professor who cares about her students. She makes sure you understand the material. Its an easy A if you study and do all the assignments.,1
The class was difficult but manageable. When the semester ended she did not grade one of my papers and wanted me to meet with her during break even though I specifically told her I can not come back next semester. (I am not from Geneseo and it is an 8hr ride). It is already a new semester and I have an incomplete on the assignment. DO NOT TAKE THIS,0
"A teacher who wants you to succeed! Even though the lectures were long, they were very interesting and full of wisdoms that should help in the future.  Not a very hard class.",1
"Though sort of challenging material, he makes it enjoyable. It's clear he wants his students to actually learn something. Most homework is started in class where he's available for help. Do the homework! It's worth more than tests overall and it's good test prep. Be prepared to think very critically and try not to miss days, as he covers a lot.",1
"One of the hardest classes I've ever taken, and it wasn't even for my major. Do NOT choose to take LAS with her. Like another post on here, I did have a 4.0 but I struggled by to get a C with her. Grading on papers is unfair for freshman level non-English majors.",0
Silva is very difficult to reach outside of office hours and doesn't respond in a timely manner to any emails sent to her. She can be unclear regarding the level of participation she wants. The online homework is very heavy as well as the tests. Do not attempt this class without a textbook. Weekly online discussions mandatory,0
"Nothing was good enough unless it came out other own mouth. Very tough grader. Asked her to release her comments on our final presentation (that she said she would release) so we could use them to write the final paper, and she told me to get the critiques from my group member who took notes. Nobody took notes on the entire 20 minute critiques",0
Really great guy who's there to help students. One of my favorite professors at Geneseo. Extremely clear in lectures and is quick to clear up any miscommunications or misunderstandings. Test are on the challenging side but bearable. Not the easiest A I've ever earned but definitely worth the effort.,1
He may be a smart man but no one can understand him.  He has not done anything to qualify him to be an entrepreneurship professor.  It's amazing that he still has a job because after four years i have not learned a single thing from this man.,0
Teaching the old fashioned way. Gives you lots of foreground for your studies and still makes it challenging.,1
"he is very knowledgable. but very hard test. he will help you, so use that to advantage.",1
"Generally a very sweet woman. When it comes down to ANT, she's passionate and because she's the chair of ANT, she's pretty serious about her work. Weekly assignments and LOTS of reading from textbook and multiple articles every week. Not a lot of slideshows, mostly lectures. I like her, but I don't like the extensive curriculum. Tough class to pass",1
"He was really good. Everything was straight forward, he was also very nice when I emailed him.",1
"She gives you everything you need to be successful, it's up to you to take advantage of it. It's not a hard class at all as long as you put in the work. She posts example videos, has her lectures posted and has the schedule very well laid out. She's very organized which helped me immensely. Jump ahead of the coursework! You'll be glad you did.",1
"He is super nit picky on the homework. Did most of my assignments and still received poor grades. Tests are actually pretty fair, but homework is impossible. He gives a lot of projects. Would suggest taking an easier Stats teacher because they are out there. He treats his class like we are all Stats majors.",0
One of the worst professors i have had as an undergraduate.,0
AMAZING PROFESSOR! YOU MUST TAKE HIS CLASS. HE IS VERY INTERESTING CLASSES ARE FUN AND TEST ARE EASY IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO HIS LECTURES!,1
"Extremely helpful and passionate about what he teaches about. Not only does he share his love of learning with his students, it is evident that he really cares about students as well and wants to see them succeed and do well. His classes are always interesting and engaging and he is extremely knowledgeable in what he is teaching.",1
"He's a brilliant professor and is great with his students.  However this is a very heavy topic so make sure to work on your final exam immediately as this is not an easy exam and he expects multiple page essays for some of the exam questions.  Though he is a great lecturer, this was not an easy topic to understand even when he explained things out.",1
"Knows his stuff but doesn't know how to teach. Humiliates students who don't immediately understand the material, talks poorly about other previous students, lectures are all over the place so you have to learn everything on your own, intentionally is unhelpful outside of class to embarrass you. Slog through it if you have no option.",0
"Hard class, but very interesting",0
"Lack of professionalism when dealing with students who actually might disagree with his advice and have a thought of their own. Cares not about how well we do in class, but if our actions will make him look good or not. Ask around...he is getting worse the higher on the ladder he climbs.",0
"He is really good guy!!! So intelligent, smart, and stylish:))) 3 essay and easy A!! Thank you professor Gulli for your interesting lectures!",1
She is a really nice teacher but  you can never understand her. She mumbles to herself most of the time and she never seems prepared. You can go to class without doing the homework and just make it up on the spot or tell her you dont know and she doesnt mind. Nice lady but she cannot tell time. She will hold you a minimum of 7 minutes after class.,1
Useless prof. He doesn't explain why we're doing anything in class. He just writes a bunch of formulas with no motivation behind them. He laughs when you don't understand something.,0
"Great prof, his lectures made the materials easy to understand and he is patient when explaining to students who doesn't understand. Also very lenient towards students who have not done the readings. ",1
"Don't skip class; he gives you important information. Take lots of notes; you never know which parts of them you'll need. The tests get easier after you see the first one, and the listening tests are pretty easy. You don't have to read outside of class, but you should because it helps on the written tests. Has  interesting trivia for music lovers",1
"So I am a 4.0 student. However, this man DR. Edwards, does not teach. He puts slides up in front and has you read them yourself. They are right out of the book too which shows he doesn't customize them at all for his own use. He also laughs at your questions when you have them. Tests impossible. He also grades papers by the works cited not content.",0
"The professor was incredibly understanding and was always willing to work things out and help when needed. Class is practical and the material will will help me in my life and profession/career. Clear setup of the class, easy navigation of blackboard although i would have preferred a regular and not online class.",1
"Dr. Haldane does a great job of making the class interesting and relevant to what students want to learn about. This class was very small and so it became largely discussion led. I would definitely recommend Dr. Haldane as she communicates what she wants on assignments very clearly, and doesn't simply assign ""busy work.""",1
"You can tell that professor Blair is a passionate teacher and is a really smart person, but he is a horrible teacher. His lectures are scattered brained and don't make any sense. He just writes random notes on the board, it was very hard to fallow. I don't suggest taking this class.",0
"It was a hilarious turn-out for my last concert critique, I analyzed every specific component that happened in that hall. It was just not to her liking that specific events that she felt were inappropriate, even though she told me analyze everything going on. I had been doing great all semester so that 40% didn't budge my ride at all,bemorespecific",1
"I would take her again if I could. She cares about her students and responds to emails promptly. A lot of HW in the class but as long as you do everything I believe it's easy enough to achieve a good grade. Explains everything very well, never had to do any extra practice. Gives extra credit, just do the work and you will get an A.",1
"Finnicumm is a pretty bad teacher. She just does exercises straight from the textbook and does not put any effort into producing her own material. The test are pretty difficult, considering she doesn't really teach in depth. Going to this class 4 times a week was not fun..",0
"Idk if its just the pandemic, but all your learning is done outside class times. During lecture you meet about the extra homework he has you do. Easily spend 8 hours a week on this class alone. You do learn a lot because reading the textbook is necessary and the textbook homework ranges 90-280 questions. Good luck with that.",0
"Going into tests I never felt very prepared and found myself guessing on many questions but managed to get As on the first two exams. Did not help me decide if I want to declare my major in Advertising, which I was hoping this intro class would've done. Not many notes taken in class so it is up to you to read textbook.",0
I have never seen a prof who knows LESS about what she/he is teaching. How did this happen?  Tenure? Tenure anyone? Wow!,0
Shirin is the nicest prof there is. She really loves her job and you can tell. She wants you to come into class with your ideas and she wants you to learn how to back them up. She doesnt tell you how she stand politically which is a good thing it lets you learn for yourself!,1
"Hands down the worst professor I've ever had. He talks a big game and tries to sound smart by using a lot of random vocabulary but it just makes him sound like a jerk. He is so abstract and the criteria of the class is so unclear so you never know what you're doing. He is not willing to help his students, and just belittles you when you ask! 0/10",0
"Like Professor Ryan, except the other way around, and not interesting.",0
"I had him as a discussion class for calc 1 and my god he seems so irritated to teach. As if it's not his job to??? Also, he graded my work with really rude comments. I attended his discussion once and I asked a question and he seemed super annoyed that I did. Never joined the class again.",0
"Dr Yu has a great talent for explaining challenging concepts in a clear way (Choo can only dream about this). I was very apprehensive about taking this class but Dr Yu made it fun. Thanks to him I love statistics now, he made a change in my life. The greatest prof I've had at UofT. Thumbs up!!",1
"I took him for Music Literature, and it was really tough but great. He was a smart professor, but tests were hard, harsh grader. You need the really expensive textbooks he assigns, they are necessary for class. Theres two papers per semester, but one is eight pages so get started early as possible. Go to class, TAKE NOTES, do homework, and study!!",1
"This class is just piece of trash, Horrible prof at Baruch, he uses his old assignment and tests from paste semester. He is worse and this class is even worser. NEVER RECOMMEND this class to anyone. I didn't even learn a single thing.",0
"take this teacher for accounting, nice guy as helpfull as can be cool to hang out with, makes accounting interesting..just dont miss his class or u will be lost",1
It really doesn't get much better than Mark. Knows his stuff; his dialogue is clear; even his choice of words seems chosen to avoid any kind of confusion. The assignments and tests are relevant and you leave each course knowing something useful.,1
"Really?  Everyone thinks she's great?  She uses the terms ""Arab,"" ""Pakistani,"" and ""Muslim"" interchangably.  Makes sweeping generalizations about race, gender, and class in a course called Women in Religion offered for the Women's Studies Minor!  Clearly does not know a damn thing.",0
Dr. Wells' class had extremely inconsistent structure. Some days we were given handouts to work through and other days we stared at him running Maple code all class. Your entire grade depends on a portfolio at the end of the semester and to get an A you have to do your own project outside of class. The grading to me feels extremely subjective.,0
"Overall a bad professor. He is very unorganized, and doesn't even know what he assigns for credit. He'll put a due date on something and then he changes the entire assignment two days before it's due. I thought the class was going to be very interesting, but he ruined the whole class. ",0
"Lectures are awful, incredibly boring and monotone. Lots of reading quizzes and group discussions (both online) that he does not tell you about. These things are a large chunk of your grade. Will count you off in the group discussion if you do what you are asked, but no one else replies. I did not enjoy him, look elsewhere if you can.",0
"Brother Goodwin is awesome! I took a 5 credit class from him but he made it worth it every day. He is always willing to answer questions to make sure everybody understands! He teaches in a caring and funny style! When it comes to grading, he gives you many chances! If you come to class and do the work, you should have no problems.",1
"this class is so hard.  the lectures are impossible, and so is the homework.  Your only hope is to study with a whole bunch of your friends.  He can't explain anything.  He was enthusiastic about choosing this really unfriendly black and white book, which is impossible to read on your own.  pick someone like kalekar if you value your grade/sanity.",0
"What an awesome professor! the only thing graded was 4 speeches, the midterm (which were exactly the same on the review) and the final (which were also exactly the same on the review. it took him some time to get grades back, but he is an easy graded. Great to take for intro to public speaking",1
"CLASS IS REALLY HARD. You have to put in extreme amounts of work. You use the book a lot for 7 homework assignments. Lectures are extremely boring and he literally has POP quizzes which are really hard and are only 10 minutes. He doesnt make much sense of things. Try to avoid if not, suffer.",0
"Overall, the quizzes are the hardest part of this class. The other assignments are pretty straight forward. You dont have to show up to the lectures to do good in this class, as long as you have a friend who can send notes, youre there for the quizzes and there to hand in assignments. The lectures can be dull and there is a lot of note-taking.",0
"Wants u to do good and actually learn the info, passionate about the subject, cracks jokes to lighten the mood. He wants to get outta there early just as much as you do so lectures are short and to the point. HW pretty much everyday but never graded or collected. Not necessarily an easy A but deff an easy pass. I would absolutely take him again.",1
"If you can, take MA 213 with Dr. Perry. Calc 3 with Dr. Harris was confusing and I feel like he overcomplicated the course material. After performing poorly on the first two exams, I stopped listening in class and taught myself and my grades improved.",0
His lectures are terrible and he doesn't make what he is saying clear. He makes a lot of mistakes on the quizzes and tests which he writes himself. Do not take this class. His grading is all over the place. He curves his tests to about 70 because everyone does terrible on them due to not knowing what he expects us to know.,0
He is awful,0
great teacher. easy A+ if you participate in class,1
"She seems okay in class, but I can't get a flippin' A on any paper. When I go to talk to her about my papers, she gives me really convoluted and weird answers, if you could call them answers.",0
Best Prof. ever. Treat each one of his student like a private tutor. Super smart and clear.,1
"Completely pretentious, does not hide the fact that he does not care about teaching.  Consistently rags on people about the usefulness of their projects when in reality, he researches video games.  Horrible at replying to emails and takes over a month to give grades back on simple assignments.",0
Literally nothing happens in her lectures. Her lectures don't relate to what is happening in the labs. Reading quizzes always have incorrect answers too.,0
"Butler is an amazing teacher, he does so many examples in class and the HW isn't too bad. Sometimes the quizzes were a bit tricky, but if you do the MPODs and ask for help outside of class if you're struggling, it's not too bad. Calculus II is a very hard subject to learn in college, but Butler does his best to help his students understand.",1
"Online was a breeze. 10 discussion posts, 4 exams, 2 essays. Easy A if you do the assignments.",1
"MSU has a top-10 accounting degree program in the nation, that being said, his grading system is competitive and you can easily end up hating the class if you're not earning a good grade. He is helpful though and even though the failure rate of the class is high, he is hands down one of MSUs best professors.",1
"This class was so fun! I learned a lot from the lesson plan assignments. She is an awesome professor. Throughout this semester, she was the only professor who gave me thorough feedback.",1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH THIS TEACHER! Very disrespectful to students, doesn't e-mail back if you have a question, WAY too much work for a 100 level class. She doesn't care about student success. Information is hard to retain and she goes through way too fast. Avoid if possible!",0
"This teacher is amazing. She is the best Spanish teacher I have ever had. She does primarily speak only Spanish during class, but does it in a way that is understandable and will explain multiple times if students aren't understanding. There is outside of class work to do and you have to be willing to learn, but overall she is really great.",1
He will not curve the class. Made the course harder than it suppose to be. And does not want to help you in his office hours. Do NOT pick him if you can take it with someone else.,0
Intro to Lit is one of the easiest English classes I have taken since high school. If you like to have more of a class discussion and little teacher input this is not necessarily that type of class. He gives you the answers for tests in lectures and provides study guides that have everything that will be on the test.,1
Best teacher I've ever had. Extremely generous when it comes to turning in work. There are no late-work penalties (except for a couple of peer discussions),1
"As an honors student I'm used to a high GPA and generally understanding/being able to handle what classes I take. Should've read the reviews. She is an awful teacher. Doesn't go over readings, doesn't prepare you AT ALL for her exams so you'll never know what you're going to get. Ridiculous expectations. Do not take her class, your GPA will suffer.",0
"Sheffler is what you want in a professor.  He is just challenging enough to weed out those who cannot read and write clearly, but very approachable and willing to help everyone if you make a small effort.  Will sit down to go over research problems, easy to chat with, etc. The research paper in non-negotiable, the rest is pretty fluid",1
"Awesome teacher and a very interesting class. Fairly easy work load, only two years and two papers. Most class time spent talking about current issues in society. Very good class, would recommend that everyone take this class before graduating.",1
"Kaplan is really wonderful professor and connects with his student well.  But, lab was disorganized and there were no rubrics on how he would want the reports written.  We never really knew what to expect on the exams.  But, the teacher himself tried and is really nice.  Also, there are pop quizzes, make sure you attend lectures.",0
"Love him! A great professor, so kind and ready to help. Do the work in class and you'll get the most out of it. He explains things very well. I would definitely take his class again.",1
"Professor Canedo structured this in a way that most students will either barely pass or fail. Quizzes are 8 questions, each worth 5 points, and they are based off of a reading of 50+ pages. No study guide. He won't work with you or consider your feedback. If you can avoid taking this class with him, please do so for your peace of mind and good gpa.",0
I enjoyed D. Dyers class. His lectures were great and helpful. He gives Webassigns and assignments roughly once a week that are usually pretty easy. The hardest thing was the short projects but they aren't worth much. Overall if you put in the work it's not a hard course.,1
"1/3 Lecturing, 1/3 Class Group-work, 1/3 Actually Writing. Dr. Aguilar knows what she is teaching and has a special way of making students better as long as they keep up. I took her Maymester course, which was fast, but ultimately finished seeing improvements in my writing.",1
Really bad,0
"inaccessible, disorganized, avoid at all cost. you will not learn anything from her class anything.",0
"Good professor.  Very nice guy.  His grading was very forgiving - if it worked you got an A.  If it didn't work, you'd get reasonable partial credit as long as you showed good effort.  I took the class via distance learning and found him to be extremely hard to understand, so just print out the handouts before you listen to lecture.",1
Very caring and enthusiastic teacher that gives some easy points in assignments. Labs are manageable to get A's if you put in a little effort. There are two tests throughout the entire semester that make up a good portion of your grade and they are pretty hard if you don't study (and even if you do). Study is needed as there is a lot of material.,1
"Very Unorganized. Contradicts himself and the textbook. I would only recommend taking him if you also have to take Pathopysiology. You will be better prepared for that class. Otherwise, avoid him at all costs. DStudents are required to learn much more than other sections. Take Mr. Bill.",0
"Decided to take a summer class forChem. Honestly was so hard I wanted to cry. Knows what he's talking about but his accent is so heavy its impossible to understand him. Chemistry uses big words so this was even worst. The whole class was failing so he curved GENEROUSLY, I mean I got a B and failed most exams I thought I was getting a D possible C.",0
"Good professor. I liked the subject & textbook for this class. Only one discussion post per week, but the mid-term was harder than I thought, thus the B, just missed it. Lots of reading, postings were easy!",1
"Syllabus is very clear, keep up with each weeks modules, quizzes are fairly easy, exams come from the quizzes and chapters, most of the questions can be found on quizlet. Fair grader, would recommend. I took the 8wk class and worked ahead finished all of the assignments in half the time.",1
"She is a good person, but I feel that she asks for too much as an undergrad who never plans on going to grad school for psyc. She always wants MORE. There is no way to avoid her. Put it this way, I would rather take Human Neuropsychology than take a class with her.",0
Explains concepts with impeccable precision.  Communicates very well.  Has an unsurpassed knowledge of the material.,1
"Very interesting professor with a lot of stories about his early days and thought-provoking discussions, but that really isn't the point of the class. He lectures and has one TA that he leaves essentially everything else to, and the class grade is based entirely on quizzes and exams. The TA at least tries to teach algorithms, but is not lenient.",0
"While teaching he seems absent minded. He will spend an entire class going through an example, realize he made a mistake, and say he will correct it the next class. He never follows through. He loves to call people out for answers and then will insult them if they are wrong. Please refuse taking any course from him. Katz and Duncan's wife are best.",0
I am an easy going person by nature but when I leave that class I would like nothing more than to kick her out a window. I took this class expecting to actually learn something and for it to be a semi easy class but what I got was a nightmare where I have yet to learn anything I would not have on my own. Biggest waste of time EVER. DON'T take her!,0
"Picks favorites, and demands that problems are worked her way. Does not use the book in any way (openly admits so), and often wastes time talking about irrelevant information. This being said, she is very willing to help.",1
"Worst teacher ever!!!! STAY AWAY!! Gives very long confusing in-class assignments, then does not give enough time to complete! Assigns a ton of group work that you must present in front of the class. She makes you do dumb, embarrassing things like ""still frames"" and dumb drawings that teach us nothing about mythology. Her grading makes NO SENSE!!",0
Very unorganized worst prof I have ever had. First of all assigns us 2 books which in total we only have to read 5 chapters for BOTH books! Than she procceds to make us buy a third book which isn't listed on the syallbus which she tells us the second wk of class. She expects the whole class to get a book from the library which only has one copy! ,0
"Acts like Jim Carrey alot, very set in his ways",0
"He's incredibly boring and the material was dry. Read off his notes most of the time and attempted to make it interesting sometimes but not very well.. Could have taught myself better. Tests were pretty straightforward. Makes you use Connect which sucks, but it's pretty easy. Probably wouldn't take him again.",0
"He wasn't so bad through the first 2 exams. Everything was clear, and easy to understand. He teaches matrices like you have already learned them. Didn't do any matrix examples. Straight definitions for 2 weeks.",1
She's horrible!!,0
She does not explain things very well at all. I was so confused on every single paper we wrote and when she is demonstrating how to do something in SPSS she goes fast through all of it and takes up all your work time. Very unclear on her instructions and tests are very difficult. Papers took her forever to grade and we almost never got out on time.,0
"Honestly awful. He is possible the worst teacher I have ever had. He manages to make everyone fall asleep. Had him for MATH229, and it is the hardest class I've ever had, not only because he cannot teach for the life of him but because his notes are the most cluttered, godawful POS I've used. 15-20 hours of studying per test netter me 70s.",0
"While VERY passionate about math, I’d rate him slightly below avg in actually teaching it. Spends a LOT of time going over definitions/theorems, very little (often no) time going over tough examples. HW (10% of grade) req $90 access code (WileyPlus). Weekly group quizzes. Exam Qs are 90% identical to class & HW. Allows cheat sheet (incl on final).",1
"PSY 220 IS about the psych of learning. In this class you learn that punishment is ineffective. Ironic. If you do not get every single thing right, youll have to redo the entire assignment. To get beyond a D, yes a D, every assignment expects perfection. A class literally about learning, this was the antithesis. 400 level work for a 200 class.",0
The worst professor I have ever had. I won't take her even if she is the last professor alive - Due dates are on Mondays at 8.00am - Miss a quiz because of that thinking its at 11.59pm - Wont allow you to retake the quiz,0
She has a fairly strong accent and has extremely high expectations. Failed the first exam but bounced back with a tutor. She is a tough grader when it comes to homework. Got pretty miserable but I pushed through. She usually teaches more advanced classes and is the head of the Economics Department. Wants you to succeed though!,0
"Professor Ball gives great lectures and relates it to our everyday life. I recommend to watch the lecture video first, then refer to the textbook to understand the text clearly. Overall, I thought this class would be harder but I highly enjoyed it. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!",1
"Chisholm is very ""sarcastic"" with students, gives little instruction, and is an unreasonable grader. I would not take him again.",0
He is not a good professor if you take him for an online course. Also doesn't provide good feedback. If he has an issue with your writing instead of letting you know with the first few weeks so you can correct it and still pass the course he waits till the end so you end up failing. Worst professor I have ever had is no help what so ever.,0
NO class! Must read book and articles that seems like the professor wrote?? The class is taught by yours truly... yourself. If you want a class with no just information you need to know and teach yourself then be my guest. Professor does email you reminders and quizes and tests have long extensions but I would not recommend this class. Timed tests,0
A wonderful Professor.  She is the very best you can get.,1
"Mathi clearly knows how to do Calculus. However, her delivery is poor IMO. Her accent is heavy and makes it difficult to understand what she is saying. For example, when she says ""8"" she will instead say ""yayyyt"", or instead of ""A"" she will say ""yayyy"". This isn't to be rude, but rather totally honest about my experience with her.",0
"This was one of the most discouraging classes I've taken so far. Prof Gillon has completely unrealistic expectations for the homework and the tests, and your grade will suffer. He is extremely intimidating and asking for help is uncomfortable. I found the subject pretty interesting, but overall I had a bad experience.",0
"VERY polarizing. Don't take a big lecture with him-take a seminar course. You can't have a thin skin with him, but if you're tougher, you'll probably feel like the course is very worthwhile. A tough-love kind of prof. He's helpful in a answer-your-question-with-another-question way. Whether you enjoy the course depends on how fragile your ego is.",1
"Very good teacher, I feel prepared for the rest of this degree",1
Easy grades,1
"AMAZING PROF, If you can definitely chose a class with Adelle. She's always making jokes, making us laugh, very knowledgable and loves what she teaches and makes it very easy and fun to listen too. She gives lots of examples and stories, not dry material at all",1
"One of the best teachers I've ever had. Lectures were a tad boring due to the type of content being taught. But he really did his best to try and make it more interesting. Gave really good advice, and genuinely cared about his students. There was a decent amount of notes, and relatively easy assignments. Would definitely take him again.",1
Professor Lee is a great history teacher. He is truly knowledgeable in Asian history and his lectures are very engaging. I would definitely take him again because he is accessible and aspires to help students succeed.,1
"Take a different teacher! he will insult you before answering your questions.very rude,arogant, and seems to hate teaching.",0
"I am not a fan of history but Professor Gordon makes history interesting. He is wicked smart and definitely knows his facts. He takes random attendance but if you go to class on a regular basis, he doesn't waste your time!",1
"Ms. D is awesome! she rekindled my love for sciences. She's a sweet lady, she is very thorough and her tests are pretty easy as long as you pay attention to your notes and her lectures. Would def recommend !",1
"I really like Mark as a prof. He is an engaging lecturer, one of the best I have had at TRU. Despite this, he gives minimal feedback on assignments which sucks, and he is a very slow marker. Also, in this class in particular he gave tons of difficult assignments which are only worth 10 percent each. I still liked this class and would recommend him",1
The worst prof ever! Just avoid him.,0
Classes will most likely not happen on Friday! Projects and assignments are easy.,1
One of the best professors I have ever had. Gives great insight on all of the material covered and is so sweet and helpful when it comes to any questions you may have. I had a lot of personal issues this semester and she was more than happy to work with me. Would always recommend her!!!,1
"Decent teacher overall. He bases everything off of Powerpoint and textbook, he usually switches up which will be more on the exam. He is strict no electronics and will yell at you if he thinks you're using them. His lectures are kind of boring and he only has 3 tests, that includes the final. This was for 2340.",0
Learned a lot- made me see things from a different perspective. Fun learning activities,1
GREAT PROF,1
"This class is definitely tough. Only 3 exams, 10 or so pop quizzes, and a ton of content. Keep up to date with the readings, regularly go to office hours, NEVER skip lecture and you'll be fine",1
"Worst teacher at Trent. She has no clue whats talking about. Reads off cue cards like an anxious child and has absolutely no brain without them. Hard marker. Likes to be nice in public, rude in private. Surprised the department hasnt fired her yet. Never again.",0
I took calculus my senior year of high school and passed that with an A. This man made a complicated subject somehow more complicated & the TAs have strict grading guidelines. He maybe teaches 15 minutes and then rambles for the rest and tries to relate it back to the question 5 minutes later. Good luck in the 34 series.,0
"Professor Turcotte is a very tough grader, but also doesn't really give clear guidelines for what he expects out of the assignments. Not really easy to email with as he has resent the unclear instructions for assignments. The google earth assignments are very time consuming for only 20 points.. Not worth the frustration or taking the class.",0
Very fun and engaging class.,1
"He is so terrible, don't take his class. Lectures put you to sleep, and unless you want to cram over 1000 lectures slides plus 10 chapters for one exam don't take it no matter how interesting you find the topic area. DONT TAKE THIS CLASS...",0
"Imagine trying to follow a professor when he only reads off long paragraphs of explanation; it was REALLY hard to follow, at least for me. No powerpoints, no bullet points, ZERO materials to refer to after lecture. The man himself seemed nice and always willing to discuss questions but I absolutely hated the way he lectures.",0
"The expectations for this class are unrealistic. Hardworking students like me(i have a 3.87) barely passed this class. You're given no guidance on homework; prepare to get 60% on them. Exams are cumulative, and increasingly weighted.",0
Swart is awesome. Take a class with him if you have the chance.  Seriously...do it.,1
Way too much work and reading for a 200 level class. He expects his students to do way more work than should be expected for a class at this level. He is very opinionated & seems to make personal vendettas against students who voice opposing thoughts. Anyone who thinks for themselves rather than just saying what the professor wants should stay away,0
"Be prepared for a lot of self teaching from the standards, there was very little explanatory support given. Most classes were spent on a very rough debrief with 15mins on the weeks standard with little substance. The slides added very little and sometimes she didn't even prepare slides for some of the more difficult, key issues in a case.",0
She's an amazing professor and is really knowledgeable regarding the war. She pushes you to reanalyze things in a way you hadn't before and even though it's a 3.5hr class it feels like 15min. Take this over the summer. It's great!!,1
"Sandoval is a nice guy, and does seem to care about his students. The problem is that nothing is clear in his class. He doesn't give out specific essay prompts, and a lot of the time you end up writing a 4 page essay that's based on a 4 page excerpt you read. class lecture time is pretty useless, he tells stories for most of it, and repeats things",0
"Arts and crafts for babies was the most difficult course I have taken at MacEwan university. I took Gerard's class becasue I heard he was inspirational and it would be a GPA boost, but instead I just found myself up at 2am gluing googly eyes into a scrapbook in order to explain my life story to my classmates in picture format the next day.",0
Absolutely terrible. Completely called me stupid. Did not like his class at all. Has no business teaching teachers how to teach when he doesn't do well himself.,0
"VERY awesome and kind professor. He teaches well, teaches a lot but his exams are ALWAYS what's taught in the class. He reviewed every exam we took the day before the exam and including the final. Final was WAY too hard in my opinion but he will work with the class. If a test is too difficult he will eliminate one question or count as extra credit.",1
He's literally the best professor I've had. Lectures are super informative and going to class is a must because he has a very specific teaching style. You definitely have to work for your grade but he really wants to see people succeed and has a lot of practice problems and review you can do before your exams.,1
"Kelly rambles most of the class and his lectures are typically very boring. Most of the time no one would do the discussion papers. Sometimes he isn't clear with what he wants and he doesn't grade discussion papers with a rubric. Your grade will merely be what he felt it was. As long as you show up and are a decent writer, you can pass the class.",0
"Knows about everything you can know about US history which is great but also makes the lectures super detailed and packed with information. For online school he just posts an hour long audio recording with no visual aids. super interesting content, I recommend you like American history although he is a bit of a hard marker",1
"Professor Johnston is a good person. She wants everybody to succeed, but you have to put the work in. People who complain are the people who don't want to learn or take her criticism. The class is watching films and talking about them. There is a film exercise paper, a midterm and final paper. As long as you follow the guidelines you can do well.",1
"Ok I really liked this prof. At first I was scared because there are no power points, only articles. But you get used to it and if you go to class and take good notes, you will have no problem. His exams are fair throughout. He summarized the articles in class and can be downright hilarious. I really enjoyed this course. I recommend him strongly.",1
"Mrs Peedin is awesome. She will definitely work with you and wants you to succeed. There are a good amount of web HWs, but they aren't terribly difficult. There is a webtest due the night before the in class test. You have unlimited attempts on those, which is nice. If you skip more than 5 classes she deducts pts. Textbook is online. I recommend.",1
"The midterm research paper and final count for like your whole grade, so the other stuff barely  matters! She is VERY broad on what will be on the tests, and most are short answer ques. & essay. Teacher is not friendly or helpful at all!!!",0
"Guys, please, please! Do NOT take Joseph, he is literally the worst professor I have ever encountered in my college career. He assigns way too much work for a simple introductory course, and isn't even clear about which assignments are due when. Lectures are long and boring, he just reads the slides verbatim. You're better off learning on YouTube.",0
"Class average semester GPA was a 2.9, he's satisfied with giving hard-working and talented students mediocre grades. Personally, I did not learn anything and the whole experience was just insanely stressful and unrewarding. Avoid, as this is a GPA killer. Makes students uncomfortable with inappropriate jokes as well. Intimidating person.",0
"Took Physical Geology as gen ed over winter. First half is online, then the rest is in person. Professor Gorring is a pretty laid back chill dude, you can hand in assignments late as long as he has them before the end of the semester! You mostly do lab work each day like looking at rocks and maps. The exams are all online and answers are in slides!",1
Awesome Professor,1
"whoever said her 102 class is easy is on crack. if you are a graduate student who wants to do nothing but read and write about shakespeare youll be in heaven... but if youre expecting a normal 100 level english class get out now. papers every week, a huge research paper and a ridiculous amount of reading. dont take her",1
"Her class is easy, but it generally seems like she doesn't want to be there. Not a bad teacher by any means, but she's certainly hands-off and leaves us to our own devices.",0
This class is one of the worst PSYC classes I have taken at UBC. He has over 100 lecture slides per week which all have a lot of text on them. Hard to know what to study for the exams and the average was super low for our class. ,0
Sometimes hard to understand,1
You have to teach yourself. No matter how many zoom recordings reviews & practice exams BE PREPARED TO TEACH YOURSELF. I regret taking this professor esp. online. Homework takes up majority of your time and has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE EXAMS & reviews HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE EXAMS! take her if it's your last option. You've been warned! Be wise!,0
"He never took attendance and was late to in person classes. He never emailed, the only way the online students knew what was happening was because the class made a groupchat. No work until two papers and a quiz at the end, and never gave feedback",0
"FSE intro to engineering easy class, he has an accent but its not a problem, you dont need to go to the lecture to learn. grades leniently",1
"no tests. class is surrounded by the group project and individual paper. she is really helpful and there for you every step of the way. good structure to the class. attendance is optional but you'd be stupid not to go. very helpful, tough class overall but you will learn a lot.",1
"She grades very hard and I feel that she says different things for every one of my essays. There is a lot of reading in this class and by the next week you should have read 100 pages or more. Then, you have to answer three discussions and she has you to write a lot of the discussions. After that you have to respond to three people's respond.",0
"oH mY gOd! One of the worst pro. ever ever known. If I have to describe about Chef Haze' class: boring, boring, and super boring. Does he know how to teach? Do homework at home and take quiz online. No choice for hospitality students to have a wonderful chair who is super un-organize and lazy. Dont take this ""hero"" otherwise you gonna cry out loud.",0
"This guy just needs to get it together. Please dont take his class if you care about your grade. The first paper he gave everyone a 76%. Literally, everyone. The second he gave everyone a B. He wont give grades you deserve so only take his class if you are fine with getting a B or a C. The work isnt hard but something is wrong with his grading.",0
"Honestly one of the best professors I have had at SJSU. He knows what he is talking about. Clear when it comes to exams and quizzes no trick questions. You have to show up to class for his lecture. Is willing to help you with any questions you have after class or during office hours. 2 midterms, 1 excel project and 1 final exam.",1
Was the worst class I've ever experienced,0
She is an amazing professor. She is fair and teaches her class in an interesting and engaging manner.,1
"If you have no background in  stats, absolutely avoid this class. He honestly reads directly off the powerpoint, (which he didn't even make), and he is no help if you ask any questions. It always seems like he just wants to get out of the class as quickly as possible. He is the worst professor I could ever imagine having in college.",0
Very hard course for a 200 level course. A ton of reading as for the quizzes even though it is open book the questions are extremely tricky. The VOH sessions in general are completely useless they do not provide any relevant information. I would not recommend this course.,0
This class was pretty much 100% independent study. The lectures were posted and expected to be completed before class including example problems. Classes then were announcements for tests and homework. Each day that homework is due there are two assignments that are long. Miss 4 of them and you fail. Total # HWs > 15.,0
Just no bueno.,0
"This is my first and only review I'm doing. Jubis is a hard marker and her tests are brutal. All 4 of the tests were multiple choice with 50+ questions, but with less than 60 minutes to do all of it. You are given a 10-minute break before you need to finish theIf you're bad at time managing, good luck. Emailing her is like talking to a brick wall.",0
"Social Psychology. Great professor. Everyone should take a class with Katovich. Tells lots of stories. Really cares to be involved with students. Three tests that are mostly lecture, but you should at least know what's in the book. Speaks very slowly, but you get used to it. Doesn't care if you pay attention as long as you show up on the work.",1
This was one of da best class i have taken at Delta. he is a gr8t and intelligent teacher. u have to b at a mature level to be in his class bc if ur not then u wont enjoy it. easy A wit alot of extra credit. dis wasnt only a good class about real music but also about real life. to understand n enjoy his class u have to understand were he came from,1
"Old school, but he will E-mail you a glossary list with all the answers to the quizzes, you just have to put them in the right places, which is easy if you can read. Papers are a different story, you really have to take initiative because the prompts are short on detail, yet high in precision. He will challenge everything you say. Ask questions!!!!",1
"He's very intelligent. Intelligent does not automatically mean kind. He frequently mocks other religions and will make fun of you if you question him. I took this class while going through a lot of spiritual turmoil, and his intolerance only made it worse. You'll learn, but it's at the cost of pandering to him if you want a good grade as well.",0
"only online. 0 lecture material .  must understand intense math & finance terms all on your own! it's no joke.  look online before buying book, found pdf version! i recommend getting chegg study to help w homework questions, it's an edition behind but most of it is the same.  takes up a lot of time! only understood 13 of the material : ",0
she is really goog,1
"Ackerman is a very passionate prof, but he really expects you to regurgitate what he has to say. His tests are aimed to trick you; in a third year level English course, you should be evaluated more on essays, not on your ability to memorize and identify passages. I've taken multiple courses with him. Be careful before you take any of his classes.",0
"Prof. Engelman's lectures are boring and cover mostly common sense information. The readings are long, but only contain a few important details, so learn to skim. Overall, the class is an extremely easy A.",0
"A great professor who knows what he's talking about. Lectures are boring but provide a lot of good information, but in order to succeed you must read the textbook chapters he provides. Going to lectures and reading the textbook will get you an easy A. The first few weeks are boring but he grows on you and I ended up really liking him and the class.",1
"Roberts is extremely kooky, but somehow also one of the best professors I've ever had. His lectures are weird, but you remember things from his class, and really learn. Make sure to take your laptop to class and write down everything he says (no matter how trivial). Study for the quizzes, and you'll be fine!",1
"Shobe is honestly really chill, this was the easiest class I have taken she does not give any exams only quizzes, 7 of them and lowest one gets dropped each quiz has about 40pts worth of extra credit you can hand in before the class so the only way you will fail is if you are lazy. She reads right of ppt and it can be boring but its okay.",1
Worst prof ive ever had..,0
"She is really enthusiastic and makes the subject look interesting. You have to read a lot for this class and the exams are not that easy, but there are a lot of extra credit opportunities during the semester to improve your grade.",1
"Jude is awesome. Funny, helpful, and a real joy to talk to. You absolutely have to show up to class and you must pay attention. She does not like to repeat herself.",1
"Honestly, I learned more from reading the textbook than I did in the class. If you care about political science, DO NOT take this class. She puts in minimal effort, cancels class, and covers the bare minimum on topics. I'm sure she's doing her best but I got very little out of the class. Lots of extra credit, tests are all online. Easy A.",0
Really tough quizzes are extremely difficult ,0
Makes the subject harder than it needs to be. Gleans clicker questions from another Biology text book (& does not cite on PP slides). Will put challenging & convoluted questions on tests not covered in class or explained by the book. Definitely do the review sheets & homework (marginally helps for test;more about extra points) Take Prabhu instead!,0
"Dr. Day's lectures changed my approach to life and school. This class isn't easy, but it's certainly worth it.",1
"Professor Chen is so sweet, she kept us engaged & is just such a great person overall. However, her tests are essentially impossible. That's why I didn't do well, she taught the material really well, but her tests are very confusing and worded very weirdly. I did well on everything else though, she's great at verbally explaining things.",1
"Professor Langer is the prototype for standard professors. The majority of his class revolves around the lectures, so it's worth it to attend class. All of the exam questions and essays can be answered based off the lectures. He may be unclear at times, however he will announce which details are important. Just go to class and you'll be fine.",1
"Homework will help, but make sure to do reviews. He is difficult to understand and not clear on explaining some topics. I read and did examples in the book and still was confused. The final is extremely difficult. Make sure to study and do reviews and extra practice.",0
"Her voice is nice but her lectures are a bit challenging to focus on. Grade is based on reading quizzes and the midterm/final. Go in with caffeine try to ask good questions, if you participate the class will be a lot better.",1
"Eh, some days I really liked him, and other days he could be a pretentious jerk. Overall I will say that I liked him/would take another class with him...but I do think he could lighten up a bit.",1
"Good lecturer. Got a thing for cheese, especially brie.  Which is great, cuz i love it.  Always wears the same suit, is very helpful.",1
"I took him as a breadth requirement thinking it would be easy, but it definitely wasn't. The lectures are painfully boring, doesn't make his lectures or notes available online, and he doesn't even have a gradebook online. Nice guy but unbelievably borin.",1
"Dr. Holtan is an excellent teacher! She's caring and makes lecture very fun and interesting.  There isn't a ton of homework, and I didn't open the book once so don't get it. As long as you take decent notes in class, and put in work on the projects you'll do great. The final project is really difficult though, but she helps you through it.",1
A really amazing professor. He is very nice and passionate about psychology. He often shared personal stories which made the lectures very interesting. I will miss having him!,1
he is really funny and understanding.,1
"Throughout the semester I thought I was doing reasonably well, but at the end my fate was secretly sealed.  He stands to be my only ""B"" ever received in college. I would never take him again if he was the last professor in the universe. Although I learned many things from this man, his grading is very unfair!",0
"Amazing prof!!! Lots of lectures but very easy to follow (put on 2x speed). He goes really slowly and hes really easy to understand. Gives past exams and answers, practice quizzes and answers, doesnt use lockdown browser for exams. Super nice guy who just wants everyone to succeed. Love this man",1
Awful experience here. She can't teach. No help. Lots of homework. Blah blah blah in class (not about the material and subject we need).,0
"Dr. Parry is one of the sweetest professors I've ever had. She truly enjoys teaching and the subjects we go over. She grades fairly, so if you don't put in the effort you won't get the grade. Dr. Parry is super helpful, replies to emails quickly, and takes the time to learn every student's name. You won't regret taking her course.",1
"Excellent professor! Very interesting subject overall; loved every class. Highly recommended to anyone with interest in Pop Culture. Not easy, but take the time to work on the papers and participate in class discussion and you shouldn't have any issues. I plan on taking Dr. Drew at least 2 more times in the fall. TAKE HIM.",1
Heather rocks! I am appreciative of everything that she does for the students.,1
This professor likes to repeat the same thing over and over. She is great but there are many things she could improve on. If you do all the work and put some effort into your presentations you should be able to get an easy A. She treats most of us as high school students so dont miss class and dont be late.,1
"As a person he is friendly, but he can't teach.   He swears & has strong backward beliefs. Class is a waste of time. The homework is easy.  He is confusing.  If he says he won't make your class do an assignment, don't believe it.  Do it anyway.  If you choose a paper based on tech, be prepared to defend your work, he doesn't understand it. ",0
Val is one of those teachers you try desperately to please for some reason. She is amazing  but if you aren't her favorite you will feel left out. She coached several of us for URTA's each of her favorite students got more time and ended up benefiting from her contacts at colleges.,1
"Dr. C confirmed why I want to be an English teacher. Best teacher I ever had. Caring, friendly, helpful... He lets you go in any direction you feel fit for your essays and helps you make them better if you let him. If you struggle with English, I would suggest writing a draft a week or so early and let him help you make it better. He is THE BEST!!!",1
"He lectures for the full class, sometimes even longer. He gets side tracked very easily. He is a really nice guy, but I would not recommend taking his class. ",0
"Dr. Gilyard is an awesome, albeit intimidating scholar. He is knowledgeable about his content and doesn't mind sharing his wisdom gleaned throughout the years. He is a hardworking professor who can, at times, appear hard/harsh, but I assure you his classes will not disappoint. He's a great school/teacher, someone I truly look up to.",1
Professor Semaan did a great job and explained everything that was taught very thoroughly. Although the class was online Professor Semaan did the recorded lectures as if the class was face to face. I think everybody should take this class.,1
I hated this class when I first started it. The class isnt structured and he's all over the place. I realized later that he really just wants us to become interested in the subject. He is very knowledgeable and I appreciated the class after it ended. I would take another class with him.,1
"One of the sweetest people I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. I only took english because I needed the credit but Sandi made it a pleasure to come to class. She was funny, kind, and caring. She understands not everyone is interested in the class, and tries to make it as least painful as possible. An bit of a tough marker, but not bad.",1
He is a great professor. Knows his stuff. He also has your back on future goals and gives suggesting overall on your career path. The class itself was great. I highly recommend having him.,1
"He said that the grade would be 50% midterm and 50% final, but ended up grading based on participation only. Doing the readings & ""optional"" writing assignments are helpful for participating, but often assigns too much hw and doesn't explain the content clearly, so it can be hard to participate.",0
She's a little hard to understand during lecture but she is always willing to help you when you have no idea of what to do. She also helps with the homework questions if you visit her in her office. She basically gives you all the answers if you want her to.,1
"This guys is very understanding and fun to be around.  He gives certain people nicknames like banker, chaplin, governor, or whatever else he comes up with.  Don't tell him if your in singers cause he'll try to get you to sing!",1
Lectures were so monotone. It was very unclear what he is looking for on exams. Take this class with a different professor if you can.,0
"This class was difficult for me, as I find history boring.  He has high expectations for his students, but as long as you pay attention, study, and do asssignments on time, he will work with you.  You will have to study a lot for this class, and his take home tests are a lot harder than the ones you do in the classroom.",1
"Daily is an awesome professor. He gives very specific feedback on work, and if possible will even give page numbers to help you refine your work. 5/5. Also likes trains.",1
Frazel is really funny and makes class really really effing hiliarious... totally sarcastic and totally helpful. He made latin poetry interesting enough to get up early for class.,1
she is hard and she grades terribly!!! Don't take her. Try taking any other professor. She will torture you!!! Beware!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
"He's definitely in my top 5 favorite professors of all time at UK. Great lectures, and he makes them enjoyable, so I really love coming to class. His accent and handwriting are sometimes hard to understand, but you figure it out as the class continues. Grading on tests is very fair, and 3 assignments a week to see how you understand the material.",1
"Yes, very smart and too much for  Susquehanna University",1
"With this class youll feel ready for the exam and maybe even confident that you did well and then look at your grade and see that youre failing. The grading is super harsh, and the timed multiple essay questions do not give you a chance to thrive in this class as they are difficult to understand. Probably the worst class Ive taken at this school",0
"Doug is a great teacher, he tries to relate to his student so they can understand things better. He makes coming to class worth it and doesn't force material down your throat. I highly suggest anybody whos interested in business take one of his classes.",1
"I have never had a teacher that grades so ridiculously, she has no clear rubric for how she grades at all. I wholeheartedly believe when grading she takes into account if she likes your or not (your attendance/attention in class). She try to make it near impossible to make a high A, only allowing a 95 as highest grade on discussion boards.",0
"I had an awful experience with this professor, he was extremely condescending towards students with questions and showed little respect. He also did seem to appreciate the need for disability accomodations and even attempted to avoid providing them. If you can take this class with anyone else, please try! This class will only add unecessary stress.",0
"Very boring, loves the fact he is tenured and rides those coattails. Just an overall inconsiderate prof!",0
Marrieta is very nice but very disorganized. She doesn't give out much homework and a single small 10pt. assignment can end up being worth 10% of your grade. Specifically Lectura and Cultura. She only gave 1 quiz as well so if you did bad there is no trying to balance it out. I would avoid her if possible.,0
Grade is solely based on exams and pop quizzes. He will dock your grade after three absences from the class. Tons of reading but the exams and pop quizzes aren't too difficult as long as you do the readings and pay attention during class. Exams get easier through the semester as you go.,1
"Pro: You will be doing a lot of assignments to weigh out your grade in the class. Con: Very strict grader, you need to put 100% in your papers or responses or you wont expect a good grade. She is bad at lectures.",0
"Great teacher, hard class. He wants you to understand it so he's receptive to questions and encourages questions. Comes off strong but, he's great. A lot of reading and effort. The class is hard, but interesting and worth the work. If you're looking for an easy class this is NOT it, look elsewhere. If you are willing to work and read, this is it.",1
Take Voice and Movement !!! It's sweeter than HONEYYYY ����,1
"Dont take this teacher, mean and unfair",0
"She is terrible, I read that she was a great prof so I took her class but all I have experienced is no teaching in class and lots of homework outside class. She will sign three or four things at the same time and make many mistakes on the homework she is assigning. She also makes mistakes on tests. She also talks very slow-making it hard to focus.",0
"This guy is AMAZING. I absolutely loved his energy and his teaching style. This class is hard, for sure, but you can pull off an A. Do all the sample work he has on his website and read the book. Most of all..go to class! He knows all his students and he is so helpful!",1
"Dr. Arevalo is one of my favorite professors at providence college. Her rating on here is very questionable, she is a super nice lady and I adore her. You must attend her lectures to do well, and she tells you what to expect on the exams. To gain a better understanding I would suggest reading the book as it definitely helped me on her tests.",1
This guy is really passionate about History and an interesting person in general. I literally never went to class online but we had the chance to talk on the phone twice. He and I discussed the random history things that we enjoyed for like an hour. He doesn' grade THAT hard but READ INSTRUCTIONS FOR HIS CLASS!!! You need both books for this class.,1
"Frau thibault is a nice person but in German 107 she refuses to let our TA teach differently when all of her 4 TAs tell her that her teaching methods do not work well. class is horribly organized and focus on tests is not what is focused on in class. she is definitly not worth the $40,000 a year udel costs which is annoying",0
This guy is funny especially with his australian accent mate! He's not the nicest prof. but better than a total jerk. His test are alright and sometimes v. hard.,1
"Rambling, unhelpuful, and misguided  professor .",0
"Buy the book. If you don't have a book, you won't pass. ",0
"Link knows what he's talking about, but presents it in a way that is challenging for first time econ students to understand. When students do ask questions his response causes more confusion and he becomes frustrated with the class. Link is honestly too smart to be teaching intro classes. Find another econ 101 professor.",0
"Horrible teaching skills. She loves transparencies, which would be fine, except that she has a ton on them and they are pre-prepared, so as you start scrambling to copy down notes, she's alread taken off the transparency. Go to study your notes later, and you'll find that they are pretty useless. Mastering Physics doesn't correlate with class.",0
"Great Teacher!! You can't take any of these Nursing classes and not expect to study, so make sure you study!! If you put forth effort in your study you will be fine!! Get to know the teacher as well!!",1
"i actually worked with andy on a mural project and it was one of the best experiences of my life, i wouldnt trade that time for anything. the man is so understanding and will do anything to help you out in life as well as studies. i learned so much from him. if you have the chance of meeting the guy, just smile and say hi.",1
Professor Lane teaches well and will make sure you understand the material. In Cisc110 we were given quizzes weekly that usually allowed you to attempt it 3 times. Having the multiple tries was nice in understanding my mistakes. Highly recommend her.,1
Doesn't know what she wants to say to the class. Doesn't have any type of lecture plan. Teaches very slow and speaks very low.  ,0
"He is by far the best prof at this institution. He is funny, engaging and extremely respectful.",1
"Her heart definitely seemed to be in the right place, however her grading was extremely biased and she will not let you get an A no matter what you do. She is condescending and does not have respect for her students. Do NOT take for your own sake",0
"This course was perhaps the most difficult class I have even taken, but ultimately proved rewarding. Dr. Hart pushes his students to the max, but only to make them better writers and critical thinkers. He is readily available outside of class and via email. Participation, attendance, and reading journals are easy points, but critical for your grade",1
"Dyer was easily my worst professor this semester. His lectures are not helpful, and you end up having to teach yourself a lot of the material. The excel projects are long and graded harshly. I was 2 points away from a B, and he refused to round my grade up.",0
"Great lecturist, funny, and I was actually interested in philosophy for once. A lot of reading, but its fascinating stuff and as long as you take good notes, you're golden. Tests are open book/note.",1
She was fabulous!  She made learning so interesting and fun that you really didn't need to study. You learn it all in class.  It was the best class and the best teacher that I've ever had.  You would be dumb not to take her!,1
He's a very difficult professor.  I didn't feel he was really teaching us because I had a very hard time doing my homework because I didn't understand.,0
honestly would not recommend her. making me rethink what I want to major in.,0
"Does not have the student in mind, not sensitive to lab conditions, short times to complete assignments (3 days sometimes), harsh grading practices, recycles the same two examples, overall poor attitude for a learning setting. Pose a problem- he basically shrugs his shoulders and says you’ll have to figure it out. Worst class experience to date.",0
"Horrible man in general. If you're trying to go to gradmedical school, this guy will ruin your GPA. 4.0 at CSUSM for a year and a half, and this guy gave me a C. Mean, condescending, rude, makes you feel stupid, and absolutely unapproachable in office hours. Won't tell you how to succeed. Do this at Palomar or Mira Costa, seriously, NOT MUSTARD.",0
"Excessively strict on topics that should not matter (i.e., wearing an analogue watch during an exam). This prof will not allow any kind of electronic device such as a laptop or smartphone for note taking. She skips through certain slides, which usually would not be a problem, except for the fact that she does not post her slides online afterwards.",0
"I don't think there is much to add about this professor: he sucks. Look in SH381. See the paint peeling from the walls? That's how boring he is. He wants you to memorize everything. Solving problems, not really. It seems the EE dept does not want engineers that can actually solve problems; only those that can spit out definitions like a robot.",0
"I absolutely loved having Zhou as my prof for water quality. He is a bit hard to understand so sit close to the front. He is probably one of the smartest people I've ever met, and if you listen close he is actually quite hilarious. He is pretty easy going, ex. if we had a midterm in another class he would move a due date without hesitation.",1
"Westpaul is great.  He goes very slow, but makes sure everyone gets it.  No tests either.  Just homework.  If you have trouble with the homework, ask for help.  Often times, he'll do the problem for you and hand it to you.",1
"Horrible lectures. Reads from slides provided by publisher, maybe 2 slides class. At least one assign per week, easy if you follow the textbook. His exams are horrible. Doesn't teach half the questions on exams and they are nowhere to be found in the textbook. I've taken 5 higher level econ classes; unnecessarily difficult",0
"She is wonderful! Very helpful..and wants you to learn & understand the material. Her night class is real fun! All Bio tests are hard, if you stay on top of it & do the work your suppose to, you'll be fine. She's really nice & has a great sense of humor! I highly recommend her.",1
"Love her style of teaching. She really cares about her students and tries to make difficult material easy to understand. She wants the class to be fun, and enjoyable, but not an easy ride. Quiz questions come directly from lecture and outlines and test questions come directly from quizzes. Just do your work and you'll be fine.",1
"Best Professor Ive had yet! He will always reply to your email (which is hard to come by in WSU). He will give you an A if you show effort and don't BS the essay which speaking of, he will proofread and revise your essay to the point of perfection. Overall, this guy makes a somewhat dry subject very fun and engaging.",1
Do not take his course... ,0
"Dr. Gibson is a great teacher. No textbook needed, but you have to print the skeleton notes off before every class. Good at keeping your attention. He's easily accessible and ready to help if you don't understand something. He words his tests and quizzes tricky so you need to know the material. it's hard to earn an A but you actually learn a lot.",1
Cool dude. Didn't trip about my attendance. C's get degrees.,1
"This class was a lot, quizzes and assignment s every week. They are difficult if you do not read or review material prior. The discussion boards required a lot , she graded the, pretty tough but you have Tom make sure you meet the requirements. Over all i learned a lot there Ismaili a lot of reading.",1
"ME 340 with Professor Brennan was one of the best classes I've taken at Penn State.  He is very clear in everything from his lectures to his expectations in terms of assignments.  He's also incredibly motivational; I always looked forward to going to class because even though the book is a little dry, he made the course interesting and enjoyable.",1
"Although my rating seems low, I definitely recommend this class. Take notes and get everything he says. He's super nice -I went to talk to him twice and he really makes you feel better about the class. As others have said, figure out the tests early (I bombed the first). The class is funny and very interesting but you must have good notes and read!",1
"Beery is a very knowledgeable guy. he tries to act like he's inflexible with grades but he gives you plenty of make up chances. the book is important but for help in the course. after the first few assignments, you get the hang of what he wants. you can revise your first couple assignments too. no midterm or final!",1
"I found Lubert to be one of the most unapproachable professors I've had. I went to his office hours a few times, and if you don't seem like you know what's going on, he doesn't seem willing to help. He always told me to ""go deeper"" on written assignments but I would literally write until the end of class. Only timed write exams and quizzes. Avoid.",0
"She is very nice and approachable. If you try and she knows it, she will give you a good mark. Sit up front, listen and don't miss a class if you want an A.",1
somehow manages to take the most interesting topic in the world (world wars) and make it boring. He talks about the most useless information. If you want to learn about war memorials and his uncle. then take this class.,0
"Disorganized class structure. A typical day consisted of this professor talking to the class for the entire three-hour period. We were advised to take notes, but I found it nigh impossible to discern key information I absolutely NEEDED to know.",0
Horrible class. Took him for mythology because I needed an English credit and he is by far the worst professor at Nassau. Expect tons of homework (more than any other course) if you care about your GPA don't take him!! He also hates when you leave the room and lectures are extremely boring. ,0
"This is an easy class if you've used Microsoft Office before. You go more into depth of Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. All of the work is done online or on Blackboard, so you can basically show up to class and do the work at home.  The books aren't necessary, but the access code is. There's teacher's aides that help you when needed everyday. Easy A.",1
Had him for an online class and it was a HORRIBLE experience. He offers no zoom classes or office hours so all your information is from reading the textbook or watching random videos. Can tell he puts little to no effort into actually teaching the class. Quizzes are also pretty difficult and his review questions are not helpful for them.,0
"Class is just a big discussion about new technology that he or other students have heard about recently.  You learn very little in this class.  If you like to sit around and talk about tech rumors, then this is the class for you.",0
"Simply one of the greatest professors you will ever have. If you have the opportunity to take his class, DO IT. He is hilarious in this dadjoke kind of way and because of his experience, he knows the best ways to simplify the content so that we understand it. This course is hard, maybe brutally so, but I wouldn't take it with anyone other than Ward",1
"Definitely the hardest class I've ever taken. READ THE TEXTBOOK. He doesn't use PowerPoints, he just shows pictures. He also doesn't use a microphone so make sure to sit close to the front. He drops your lowest exam grade. Questions on the exams can be very vague to super specific. Anything in lecture and in the textbook can be on the exams.",0
Students have to buy the notes and grades were pretty low. Exams were beyond assignments and notes.,0
"Seriously the best professor I had at cc. Shes so understanding and caring. She knows her material and has personal stories to connect with the lecture. would seriously be friends with her out of school. easy A class if you pay attention, take notes, and participate.",1
"Haaaaaaaard. read my lips. she. is. tough. i had asked my advisor (who was the toughest professor i had taken a course with until then) how tough she was, and he said she was tough, and he was right. do the reading or she will humiliate you. very intelligent, will help you be very intelligent too, if you do the reading and the work.",1
"Dan Gross used to be a really good teacher, but it seems that he's given up. All content is copy and pasted from last semester, and he is nearly unreachable for clarification. I despise his classes. If he didn't teach required ones that I'm forced to take, I would avoid him at all costs. Tests are ridiculously terrible, also.",0
"Ned is.... Ned. He's a unique butterfly that will blow your mind or destroy your life. He has no filter, so take whatever he says with a handful of salt and understand that he has offended most people during his career. That being said, he can teach you a lot if you are open to learning and have a slightly twisted sense of humour.",1
I took his philosophy 100 class online and it was very manageable. His videos are so helpful and the assignments are not as difficult as others make it out to be. He's funny and a great professor! My advice for online students is to be really attentive during his videos and take lots of notes because it will make your assignments so much easier.,1
Bleah bleah bleah!  Arrogant and so unclear.  You'd be less confused if you were blinded and dropped in the middle of a cornfield and had to find your way home.  DO NOT waste your time.,0
I would not recommend taking Roe at all. Only grades are 50% midterm and 50% final. He is disorganized and rambles in class. We had a textbook and 4 ethnographies to read. If you end up in this class do all the extra credit because it will save your grade. He does curve which is good though. But not an easy breadth requirement.,0
Be prepared to teach yourself after about the first 30% of the semester. Youtube videos are the only way I made it through this class. Labs take 10-15 hours for a 1 credit class. Rafla is quite disorganized and often makes many mistakes during lecture. Going to class and doing homework is not enough to do well. Exams are very difficult.,0
"She's phenomenal! She takes mundane material and makes you want to listen. I've never known a professor with more enthusiasm or intelligence. Her stories are my favorite, she really knows how to humanize the past. On top of that, she has a big heart! I struggled a lot with personal issues and she went out of her way to help me.",1
"She's very nice, and attendance is mandatory, but I didn't learn much in her class. She talks alot and her lectures don't seem very helpful if you plan on being a teacher. She is a tough grader, and even if she tells you that you did a really good job that means you might had a B or lower. Her quizes are specific and her insturctions are not clear.",0
Worst teacher I have ever had. He does not help much when asking for feedback. The test a very difficult because of the abundance of information needed to learn in a short period of time. Very wishy washy with extra credit and quizzes in between other Chemistry class.,0
"Hardest class I've taken, tough grading, reading and writing intensive...I'm serious. I'd say 4-6 readings a week, a paper a week, and no attendance/ participation points. Almost impossible to get an A on papers based on the rubric. However, she is incredibly knowledgable and can be reached easily via email. Definitely has a passion for her content",0
"Sometimes she can be pretty nice, and then she does something that reminds me why I didn't like her. If you just talk to her she isn't too bad. The students who don't make an effort are the ones she isn't nice to. She tends to make fun of students. But the class itself isn't very hard; online homework twice a week and a test every other week.",0
This guy was great - and I'm white...,1
"(online for pandemic) He's very sweet and does care about his students, however for your grade you can either have 50-50 final-midterm or 40-40-20 midterm-final-quizzes. Considering the average on our midterm was a 37%, the majority of the class is failing. There is extra credit and a good curve, but tests are much harder than HW, at least online.",0
"This class is very difficult if you are not used to this particular style of teaching. Very textbook heavy, no power points. Little instruction given on what to expect for the exams,",0
Amazing Professor! He really cares about you and your future. A great person to discuss your future with and he really explains the key accounting concepts well! Take him for corp 1 and any other classes if possible.,1
"Awesome, awesome, awesomeeee!!! He loves math, it's his passion. He's funny, understanding, and knows what he's teaching and helps the students 110% HIGHLY RECOMENDED!!!Not too bad to look at either",1
"She is super nice. She gives great feedback, she tells you what she's looking for. Overall a really good teacher!",1
"DO NOT EVEN READ THE REST OF THESES! incoherent lectures, relies on you reading book but never tells you where we are, confusing tests. Do not take him. Stuck in the 1970s education. unclear due dates and what is wanted for each assignment. tries to teach over your head and uses big words when he doesn't need to. maybe knowledgeable, doubt it.",0
"he literally just reads off of his projector. dont take this super early morn it will be the end of u. HOWEVER quizzes at the end of each class are SUPER helpful w/ final grade. you have 2 easy 2page essays, i got perfect scores on both. you have 5 big tests including final. took an ap psych class in hs so advantage but slides kinda help to study.",0
"Great guy! He has so much energy for an old man too and he's very passionate about the stuff he talks about. He actually makes History sound very interesting with his enthusiasm. He does give out lots of homework but he isn't unreasonable. If for any reason you can't hand in all those things, communicate with him and he'll work with you",1
Teacher doesnt know what she is doing. She grades on a curve an is super confusing.,0
"attendance is mandatory even though nothing she goes over is on the exams. Exams are based solely on the textbook. Probably would be better as an online course. Her attitude was not the best, i wouldn't recommend",0
"Took her class in my freshman year with absolutely no background knowledge of computer science. I loved this class so much! Wished she teaches upper CUS classes. Always reviews before an exam and cares whenever you get below average scores. Most importantly, lots of extra credit opportunities. :)",1
"Great Professor! Very helpful, always willing to help! quick at replying and getting back to you! Always gave great advice. HIGHLY recommend!! great guy, and professor!",1
"She never gives full credit to anyone, ever. She is very interesting and I learned a lot from her. However, I do not recommend taking her class unless you want to be challenged. the amount of homework can be overwhelming, especially if you miss any classes. Must be organized!",1
"Sorry, this is not the route to go for a gen ed class. I'm sure some students work well with him, but there's a fine line between a gen ed and an anthropology seminar.",0
Class is not impossible. Do the homework. Study like she suggests and you will have an A. She is a different breed of person but she cares.,1
"Knows a whole lot about Non-Newtonian fluids and cornstarch, but really eccentric.",0
"Dr. Schmurr made taking statistics class more interesting than any other math class Ive taken. He is very knowledgeable, and is very accessible, in class and over office hours. His lectures are engaging and understandable, and he has a good sense of humor. Would definitely take another class from him!",1
"Worst class imaginable, I am in my second to last semester and I have A's in everything else and I'm currently failing this class. There are 4 exams, no new formatted material, just shoved together garbage from past semesters. The sad thing is that she's getting paid a professors salary to use proctoru and upload old stuff. I am disappointed UD.",0
"He has different teaching style than professor for 1st half of course, but is still good.  Knows his stuff.  The content is interesting.  Does like his eye contact--move to the back if don't like that. Exams aren't that bad.",1
"Very nice guy. He means well, but not a good teacher. He goes through the same material over and over. His class is an easy A, even if you didn't learn anything. Thankfully, I went into his class knowing a lot of coding because if I didn't, I would not have learned anything.",0
"WORST TEACHER I EVER HAD!! so much work! Every day you had to do 5 pages of textbook homework, we had bimonthly quizzes, a midterm and a final. MANDATORY NOT FOR EXTRA HELP, we had hebrew table in which u had to go once a month for ur grade!! she graded ur participation on how much english/hebrew u spoke that day and she doesnt round up ur grades.",0
Absolutely awful. Not helpful to students who approach and has the most terrible marking scheme. Avoid her class.,0
I've encountered a ton of great teachers at this school and Professor Patterson could be one if she would drop the attitude sometimes. It made me nervous to ask questions in class. Someone needs to audit her class.,0
"Sophie for cps420 was terrible, not only where her assignments extremely confusing and difficult to do, her midterms and finals were also challenging. You need to go above and beyond and really understand the concepts to do well with her. I found this unfair since we already have a lot of studying/coding on our plates. BEWARE !!",0
Very helpful when I asked questions. He is also very clear about what will be on the tests.,1
A ton of unnecessary work so I don't recommend her.,0
I don't know how the E.E. Department allows this kind of professor to get tenure. He barely speaks English. His lectures are so boring and useless that he now has to do pop quizzes just to make sure that people come to the class. He also is not fare grading. It?s a shame that people like him teach mandatory courses in the curriculum,0
"One of the most useful classes that I have taken for my major. Gives a great overview of everything you need to know about HR, very interactive lectures. Quizzes/tests aren't bad, straight out of the book. Other assignments include mock interviews (very helpful IMO) and a career assessment. Loved her, she was an awesome professor, would take again!",1
"He makes long lectures fun. He has a good sense of humor. Makes the information  and reading easier to understand and digest. A lot of reading, two small papers and two exams. Quiz sections are a must to maintain your grade, quiz sections were mandatory.",1
You will never experience a better anatomy class than you get from Tim. His anatomy class rivals a med school anatomy class.,1
"I've spent a few years taking classes and learning to be a good scientist from DW. It has been one of the great joys of my life to get to know him. He loves helping students and constantly strives to be a better teacher. He goes above and beyond the call of duty and truly believes in his students. However, make no mistake: he expects hard work.",1
Very friendly and caring professor. Feedback is a bit confusing sometimes though. Had a couple short writing assignments and a large research project at the end of the semester. Really passionate about English!,1
"I'm from UIC and I took the 5 week summer course to get all my physics out of the way over the summer. Big mistake! If you need an A in physics to get into PT school, DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS! They use U of I exams and there's way too much homework! But Dr. Carter is really great. Clear lectures, really cares, stays late to help you. Great prof!",1
"All he does is lecture the entire class. He doesnt actually teach anything, he just talks about what hes passionate about. Classes are so boring. No one listens to him because theres nothing to take notes on. All exams are online but INSANELY hard considering that he teaches us nothing.",0
"His knowledge on literature is endless. Seriously. I bet you could name any novel and he will know exactly what you are talking about, plus a full biography of the author. Brilliant prof, and he makes classes beyond entertaining. I looked forward to the seminar every week. You MUST read the books assigned BUT they were unfailingly enjoyable!",1
Clear and accessible lecture slides. Ignores emails. Frequently misses office hours. Unfortunately he showed a blasphemous picture in class (under future contingents). Is freedom of speech freedom to insult?,1
"As noted below, PMATH 351 with prof Davidson was one of the hardest classes I've done so far, however, also the class that I've done the best in. Quizzes and assignments were very heavy and difficult, but were curved pretty generously with bonuses. I have learned so much from this course overall. So sad that he's not teaching anymore :(.",1
"A deeply knowledgeable, articulate, and caring professor, with an immeasurable knowledge of Greek sources. If I had to cite one shortcoming, it would be his tendency to use his Q&A with the class as a foil for advancing the thesis of his lectures, rather than more vigorously addressing questions.",1
"Can be a bit scary, but totally knows her stuff. Don't ever call her ""Miss!""",1
"Just drop the class and get a different instructor in the very beginning of the semester. Trust me. I'm a hardworking student but this one particular class is just not worth my time. Every time I enter the room, the atmosphere is just horrible.",0
"Great professor! Notes are already typed for students to fill out and are very straightforward. Dr. Farkas cares about if students understand the material and will teach until it is understood.  He is very available for help.  This is a very hard class but if you study everyday and take advantage of Dr. Farkas's help, you will do well.",1
Useless teacher - I had her class and wouldn't take it again!!!,0
"If you need to take LIT3115, take it with Soh. She is very organized. Get to do the work that really matters. You get to teach using lesson plans that you do for her assignments. Her feedback is helpful.",1
Awesome :) so interesting and knocks out so many requirements. i love the class and he's so understand and nice :),1
"Professor Reyes's class was the only SPA class that I didn't stress about. We had a small class of about 12, so there was a lot of attention to each student's skills. He put a very heavy focus on speaking and writing, which helped out majorly for the tests (all that was left was memorizing vocab words). He was also super personable. Great prof!",1
"super easy, just get the study guides on vista, go through ppt and find the answers, study, take the 8 question quiz, the 2 assignments are easy. he's a nice guy and is willing to help if you need it, but i can't imagine you'd need any... he knows the material very well. takes roll once in a while, about 4-5 times, lets class out hour early",1
"Professor Chang is extremely professional, nice, respectful and knowledgeable. He knows how to engage the students and make us participate. Very helpful to students regarding writing their papers. A very good professor.",1
"This class would be great if someone else taught it. He is very distracted and disorganized. Assignments, expectations, and rubrics are unclear. His lectures are boring and do not help explain the text. I genuinely think he doesn't understand mythology either. I couldn't stay awake in this class without coffee.",0
"Nice guy who means well, but his teaching techniques for this class are not the best. Every week we took an online quiz which covered material we were to have read on our own. The day AFTR the quiz was taken we would cover the material in class..this doesn't make much sense to me. Also we never went over the quizes. Can be rude to students at times",0
Rusty's the best!,1
"Dr. Amstuz' classes require work, but they are manigible.  Like others have said, he teaches through stories.  And reading the text is mandatory. He's a great guy and offers great advice and cares for students. Do a dine with a mind with him.",1
"Patrick is an easy-going guy, extremely lenient too. I had him last semester for a night class and he always let the class out early. He's really sweet and exams are easy-peasy. If you want the easiest 3 credit class, take CS 101 with him :)",1
"Sat there and spoke to the class for an hour and a half trying to teach French. Tests and homework were easy but I taught it all to myself with the textbook, didn't learn anything from her.",0
"Nimrod made Macro not only barable, but interesting. He put everything in terms we could all understand. He made himself available at all times and went to whatever lengths necessary to help every student. His love for coffee is life changing.",1
"300 word reflection due every week and lots of lectures and films to watch. good teacher and semi-interesting class but it feels like a lot of work for a gen ed. Easy A if you do all the required work and all the quizzes are online if you're struggling. ALSO do not buy the book, it's online for free with various websites.",1
"I agree with the previous statements.  He asks you to ask him questions and then mistreats you for asking. His practice tests are great, unfortunately he seems to make the test questions purposefully confusing.  I decided to drop and take it from another prof. in the the following semester. If you take his class plan on teaching yourself.",0
"Her classes usually consist of a lot of easy, busy work. Expect to be assigned work every class in addition to Question of the Day(bellringers). You'll rack up enough points to maintain a good grade at the end. She gives study guides for her tests which are usually EXACTLY the same. Her lectures are fun and interesting.  1010 would take again.",1
"Mrs. Bowlin does not teach at all. she just sits there and reads the ""questions"" that will be on the test. i have not really learned anything in the class. and we don't have any type of disscussion. any time that there is an attempt at disscussion from one of the students she shoots it down.",0
don't late or absent easy to got A,1
"As a freshman, I had to take Sociology from Mr. Darman and it was a pretty terrible experience. The class could not be more dead. This guy is the biggest liberal I've ever seen that loves to make up stories that interest almost nobody and talk about his personal life for 2 hours straight. The only learning comes from the text book. Terrible grader.",0
"Very helpful, encourages questions, explains material very well.",1
"Talks way to fast, and his lectures are very boring and hard to follow",0
"I took this class as one of the options for the honors program and regretted it so much. She grades really hard and it's basically impossible to get an A on any assignment. If you spend 6 hours or 10 minutes on a paper, you'll always get lower than an A. The classes were long and boring also. The class required so much time and energy for nothing.",0
"Rude. Condescending. Technologically inept. Disorganized. Judgmental. Uses out of date CNN sources. First five minutes into the online class he said ""I dont hear around of applause for not requiring you buy a text. You must all be rich students on mommy and daddy's money"" VERY politically biased. Loaded and racist questions. Should not be teaching",0
"Never knew what she wanted. Would ramble about things we didn't actually need to know about. Obsessed with microbiology, which is cool. But not everyone is going into microbio. or cell bio. Was about three lecture behind for majority of the semester, but hey, made our final easier.",0
"He seems rude, snobby, and really disorganized.  His lectures are all over the place, he loses his train of thought frequently, and is late all the time.  I hated this class because of him. He looks like he is having a mental breakdown every class.",0
Worst teacher I have ever had. He made me and other students in his class feel like we were all idiots. I would not recommend taking his class. Worst teacher ever.,0
this guys tests are extremely hard im not even joking. his final is a killer. you could study all night and still not get an A. avoid if possible.,0
"She is the coolest teacher, she is such a funny person.",1
Great teacher! All his lectures are thorough and to the point. You'll have lots of photo assignments and your work is displayed in front of the class for critique. He gives constructive criticism. We all had a lot of fun in class. The textbook was used half the time (necessary for studying). Make sure to always bring your camera to class.,1
"Heidi is an amazing professor and you can tell how much she cares about your progress as you write, and wants you to improve.",1
Reads directly off the slides and does not do class examples. Uses Minitab which only people with PCs can use and it is not offered by the school. Teaches coarse through minitab but tests students using equations. Half of the the test is multiple choice and have no connection with statistics. Gives no reference material to help study for the final.,0
"Professor Thorpe knows the material extremely well but does a terrible job presenting it. He expects you to know everything before coming to class and just reads off the power point. Your entire grade depends on the final, a couple exams and a few quizzes, he doesn't offer and assignments or extra credit to help boost your grade. Get someone else.",0
Roxi is a pretty good lecturer. I enjoyed her class and I became a better writer thanks to her. The only issue I had with the class was the amount of time spent philosophizing over the small stuff. Getting too deep and too technical with the boring stuff. That made class a bit less interesting.,1
Terrible teacher!!!!! You are tested on material that isnt taught yet. You take blackboard quizzes everyday. He will keep you late.,0
"She was a very caring and personal professor. She was a very easy test giver, and her assignments were to the point and precise. You need to go to class, as your attendance is taken every day, and it is 150 points! Very easy and a nice, relaxing class.",1
"Professor Kearl is an economics wizard. Because of that, his lectures are fast paced, interesting, and engaging. However, the tests are hard if you don't pick up the content quickly and they account for a lot of your grade. All in all his class was a great experience.",1
"Nice guy but horrible teaching method. I had to drop the class because I fell way behind. Hes alwars confused, and its hard to follow along because he is really boring. He does try to lighten up the class by going off topic here and there.",0
"Just dont take her class. Though this class has easy art assignments such as coloring and cutting, this is not the class you want to sign up for. She is a bad professor esp. when it comes down to explaining. Quantity over quality with her so expect to do 20 assignments in one day. Itd be a mess if you miss one day of class. She gets mad easily.",0
"Econ 410 is a really tough class, but prof. Chapman does his best to make it easier. Make sure u know calculus cuz u will need it in this class.Go to his office hours it helps a lot cuz he explains everything clearly and in detail. He is a good professor just the class is hard but its also very interesting.",1
"The textbook assignments aren't worth wasting your time on; the book is only useful for researching the test questions. Lectures were often useful in understanding what Professor Long thinks about George W. Bush's policies, but were often useless otherwise. However, to his credit, Professor Long is clearly very intelligent and knowledgeable.",0
It seems this class would be hard so the second week I dropped because I need my GPA.,0
"He isn't super organized, which was hard for me, and his testing criteria never seemed to be consistent. ",1
"He's a nie guy, but unless you want to have to teach yourself, steer clear of having him as a professor. He doesn't answer questions clearly either.",0
"Rebecca was a very nice professor, but I despised her class. With all the mundane group projects and the activities we did, I felt like I was back in elementary or middle school rather than a college class. However, while she assigned a lot of work, most of it was easy. Attendance was mandatory though, which was annoying since class was useless.",1
"If you can avoid her, do it! Pretty sure 80% of the class failed her midterm because it was just nonsense we were not taught and had to guess every single question, despite studying for 5 days for that thing :)",0
Essentials of Lifespan Development online course is poorly structured and disorganized (you have to wait much longer for homework assignments to become available on Canvas Instructure and faster due dated deadlines exist); via e-mail communications are much slower in terms of waiting longer for follow up on Canvas; AND DIFFICULT DISCUSSION ENTRIES.,0
"By far the worst professor that I have ever had. She never responds to emails, but those rare times that she does, she wont even answer your questions. Shes never taught .. just gives the work. She makes it hard to learn, and wont help even if you're begging for help. You're really on your own. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS. YOU'LL BE SET UP FOR FAILURE!",0
"Not the best teacher but I guess he wasnt the worst. He was very unorganized.  All the quizzes were online but there were constantly problems with them not working or being scored incorrectly.  Also we did Quick Fire response which was pretty much an essay, We did 2 and they had to be 15,000 words -about 8 pages. You had a week to finish it.  ",0
"This teacher is nice, but is not a good teacher. Doesnt seem like anybody in the class is doing well, pretty bad when the class avg on tests is a 42%...take another teacher if you want to pass",0
Dr. Burkhart is the best -:),1
he was my advisor on the study abroad trip to england... what an amazing guy he is!,1
"Even though I checked textbook needed only for terms, only once did I read the chapter assigned but if you go to class and pay attention (just write notes) and you will remember what the concept was about for the exams. Go to class easy 40 credits and if you don't read the book. Do the newspaper analysis's easy 3-6 points. Great Professor!",1
"If you want to keep a healthy state of mind, stay away from him. he expect you to know everything. in class very easy examples to solve, on the test, nothing similar to the lecture.",0
Mary Elfring is okay. She often will bring about current events which can be quite uncomfortable in my opinion. She gives more attention to certain students who talk more which is not right. Her classroom environment could be improved by allowing for balanced classroom discussion.,1
"BRAGS ABOUT HOW 60% FAILS THE CLASS!! IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR GPA, DONT TAKE HER CLASSES! VERY RUDE TO STUDENTS WHO ASK QS. IMPOSSIBLE EXAMS AND QUIZZES. 500 LEVEL EXAMS!!! LECTURES HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CLASS CONTEST. THE BE PAPERS ARE A JOKE 100% FAIL RATE EVEN IF YOU HAVE A GORGEOUS PAPER!! LOVES TO GIVE FS OUT!!!!",0
"Really an awesome person and scholar. Hilarious and engaging, Shearer is one of the absolute best professors I have had at UD. His readings are guidelines, and your grade is entirely derived from three papers, typically 10 pages in length. Fantastic teacher and person.",1
Professor Fowler is a great math teacher and the best for MA132 at Clarkson.  She knows her material and presents it in an easy to learn manner.  Her class sizes are small so sign up early.,1
"I know everyone thinks Siebels is some kind of poetry God,but as an older student, while an easy teacher, I found him to be a narcissistreads too much of his own stuff, smiles like a phony and knows hes good looking. Do the readings, come to class,participate, and youll get an A.",0
Her attitude changes every class. She would always find something negative to say for every presentation. I would not recommend her!!,0
"DO NOT take class if you have any love for your country. She does not have an open mind to anyone elses opinion besides hers. If you are a radical liberal you will probably enjoy her but if you want to learn about sociology, take it with a different professor. She hated me because I didn't believe the government blew up the trade centers...",0
"She expected you to know everything, but taught you nothing. Lovely lady, but terrible professor. Avoid her at all costs unless you want your GPA to drop!",0
"Never take this class as an elective. Forget about the online component, It's way too much work (readings, assignments). You are supposed to read the whole, 300 page textbook, as well as watch hours of lectures. Every now and then you are supposed to buy the newest version of the textbook (which she was an author of) that costs $100+. Ridiculous.",0
"The worst I've had. She picks a couple of students in as her favorites, and it is disgustinly obvious who they are all semester long. She was my advisor and did not advise me at all - didn't have a grasp of the requirements at HWS. Spends too much time in the bars trying to be your friend when she should concentrate on being a better professor.",0
Professional pompous jerk.  Enough said.,0
"Hes an awesome guy and very caring for his students but not the best teacher, she talks a lot doesnt let you take pictures of anything when hes not talking hes playing music though its a music class but most of the time its literally JUST music. The testing is very messy hand written and sometimes have nothing to do with what he taught sorry",0
"Easy, but you have to first understand to visualize in a 3-dimensional way. He is funny in a dorky way but that makes it even better. Any papers for him are easy because you baiscally get an A for just doing the requirements.",1
work load is heavy. lots of reading.  Great professors. Won't get an easy A.,1
"AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Her style of teaching forces you into uncomfortable groups (youre stuck for an entire semester), concept maps are a joke and so are case studies and online quizzes. Info to answer online quiz and exam questions is never directly stated in lectures, rather inferred. By far the worst professor Ive had at CSU",0
"He'll say class isn't mandatory, but if you skip class you'll be far behind. Pay attention, participate, take good notes and study for tests. Always around for extra help. Knows his students well.",1
Prof Mawani is really full of herself!! She is interested in you only if you are interested in what she is interested in.,0
"Not a terrible teacher, but not an amazing one either. She seems to know a lot about what she's talking about, but she DOES NOT appear passionate in any way. She smiles and tries to relate to students, but at the end of the day, most students in the class do not respect her. Her class isn't extremely hard, but the prompts are a bit silly...",0
Really cares about her students and wants you to do well.,1
"Awesome professor! Super helpful and made the class enjoyable/entertaining. DON'T BUY THE BOOK. You never use it. I had never done any sort of programming before, and I made an A. Leahy made the material easy to understand and the homework assignments were pretty fun! Make sure you go to each lecture. Quizzes are pretty easy as well.",1
best in biology dept...very student oriented,1
"Prof. Martin is clearly a very smart and nice guy, but just doesn't seem very interested in teaching. Lectures are often hard to follow and he tends to tell irrelevant (but funny/interesting) stories. However, he gave a large curve at the end of the semester and his practice exams are almost exactly the exam. Doable, but there are better professors",0
She is always energetic and keeps the class involved. Stay off your phone and try to participate in the class and you will have no problems. I was not a marketing major before this class but after speaking with her I have added Marketing for my second major.,1
"This was my first art history course at SCAD, and i truly enjoyed it. As an 8am class, I had trouble staying awake at first because of the long lectures, but they were very interesting. Even though at midterms I had a 57% in the class, I was able to finish with a high B. His tests are fairly simple once I figured out how to study. He's a cool cat.",1
"Do NOT take this class. He is very inconsistent and unfair. He gives pop quizzes multiple times a week and they are very different from the tests. He assigns up to 5 worksheets for homework a night. Granted it is easy math however sometimes It is very time consuming. Overall, he thinks hes never wrong and is very hard to work with.",0
Do Your Reading assignments and take notes because when you have a reading quiz you can use your notes. DO THE READING. don't be lazy and it will be super easy!,1
"Took her for chem111 and she is mu favorite chem professor out of the 3 I've taken. Yes it's a tough class but she is easy to approach and explains things better if you ask her too. I would take her again, assuming I pass the class",1
We didn't talk about the material at all. I learned nothing and her pop quizzes were hard and stressful,0
"She should not be teaching. At first I really liked her because she seems really sweet, but then she turns on you. She definately picks favorites in every class, and I have had her twice. I had to take my Grandma to the hospital once, and she still told me that if I miss class I will lose points. She will never admit she is wrong. She is very rude.",0
"Definetly the worst class I have taken at LVC, she expects entirely too much from a 100 level course. Avoid this professor if possible!",0
"We rarely had class due to his absences, which made it very hard to understand his unorganized lecture notes. Class was long and dragging, and don't expect to know what your grade is until after finals. He openly insults all questions, and never gets us feedback in a timely fashion. Avoid him at all costs.",0
"It's extremely easy to get a high grade in Dr. Wood's class, but if you're actually interested in learning things I would not recommend her. She doesn't like to invest time in her students and can also be extremely unclear/subjective with her grading scheme. She often ended class early and cancelled office hours, which made her come across as lazy.",0
Killed any interest I might have in Spanish. An incredible amount of class time is spent with her rambling about her family in Spain. Please read other comments on this page--they are absolutely rght.,0
"Terrible Professor. He looks bothered when you ask him questions. He is very confusing. Be ready to teach yourself this course. Gives hw and does not even grade it, which is bad because his quizes are terrible and that's all that your grade will be based on.",0
"During Covid Im convinced that this professor hasnt lifted a finger to do his job. There are very very few assignments. Literally just tests and one report worth nothing compared to exams. Lectures are recorded from months ago, go over time limit. test questions suck, and are timed harshly. This class should be interesting, instead Im miserable.",0
He is a good professor though sometimes he goes on tangents.,1
"Loved the material of the class, video lectures can be around an hour long each, book chapters can be up to 100 pages each (bc there are a lot of pictures). Miller is a very kind man and is willing to explain anything your confused on. Be prepared to work for the grade, also the book can be found online for free. Recommend making a studygroup!",1
Never take her if you want to graduate!,0
Hands down the best professor I've had at OSU. If I could have taken more of his classes I would have. TAKE HIM IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO LEARN. Don't if you're expecting an easy A. He has a lot of quizzes but they get the material in your mind. He gives out old tests and you can borrow notes from previous years as he doesn't change them year to year,1
"Dr. Sanford's lectures were very difficult for me to understand, and in my experience, she was not accessible outside of class. Even when I set up meetings through email, I ended up waiting half an hour to an hour to actually meet with her because she is so busy. I felt like I was treated as incapable when I had any questions or needed help.",0
All around great professor. He takes his job very serious and is extremely professional. Lots of notes on the board but he covers everything on the exams. ,1
"Very smart man, but his teaching style wasn't for me. Very strict and assigns a lot of work. You can't miss more than 3 classes or you fail. He is very passionate about Spanish and will help you, but I did feel like he could be rude to some of the students in our class. I probably won't take him again if I can.",0
Amazing guy with a good character. Very hard to understand exactly what he's looking for. His grading rubric is unclear and often does not grade consistently or on time. There were many occasions where he'd apologize for not handing back an assignments on time.,0
Knows his information but the way that it was delivered and taught in class was not efficient. You have to teach yourself from the book and can't rely on him lecturing in class.Granted this is college but I also pay for these classes and expect some sort of an education during class.,0
"Incredible, sweetest person ever. Even better lecturer. Very approachable and caring. Best notes youll ever get, incredibly organized and thorough. Biochem II is harder than I, but she makes both understandable and fun. Very clear expectations, thorough reviews and practice problems. YOU DO NOT WANT TO MISS OUT ON TAKING ONE OF HER CLASSES!",1
"Professor griffin is very rude . She missed class at least three times for personal reasons, which is fine , life happens !!! But lets hope it doesnt happen to you because she will give you an F for missed assignments ! No late turn ins. She is unreasonable . Rude. And unhappy . I worked extremely hard and still for a D . Her grading is bias.",0
"She's not bad, but really boring lecturer. You have to remember all the readings though, and she takes off for every little thing on exams. Nice person, but boring. Tests aren't bad if you really know about everything she says in class. You need to go to class to do well in the class. ",0
Thompson is hands down the best professor at USC. He is super kind/caring and makes it known that he wants his students to succeed. He turns a hard class into a very manageable one. I would advise anyone to take 322b off track just so they can take him. His tests are challenging so make sure to do the problem sets multiple times before each exam!,1
"Honestly, he's not a bad person. He contradictions his logic often and acts like his the OPRAH of teaching. His tactics may seem helpful but god forbid if you actual need consideration for having a hard semester. I would just indulge his annoying nature and do what's required. Just expect a lot of contradictions when grading comes around.",0
"Not the best CD teacher. Everything has to be EXTREMELY detailed for every assign, which she only made clear during 1 assign. Shes also very unprofessional with making her test. There was a ton of mistakes and then she would give you credit for a couple of them. She also tried to trick you with test questions to make you get the wrong answer.",0
Professor Ruml is a kind and generous professor. You can tell that he used to be a lot tougher with his expectations and has softened some over the years. This is not bad you will have to read...a lot. There will be pop quizzes. At first he seems serious but if you bring interesting convo he will engage interestingly. I would take him again.,1
"not anything like you think it's gonna be.  she refused to give human examples because they were ""too complex"" im sorry but i dont care what happens with a rat..i want to know how humans learn and are motived...she is a hard teacher. unless you read every single word of the book 2 or 3 times, and go to everyclass its hard to do well",0
"She is very knowledgeable and opinionated which is fine. However, as an instructor she is awful. Mostly because she makes little or no attempt to explain what she expects you to know for the test and the book is dense and as boring as it could possibly be. Also makes no effort to know whether or not the class knows what to study weekly.Bad syllabus",0
"I'm not even finished with the semester yet, but I just hafd to leave this review. Adam is an amazing professor. He is very clear, straightforward and in-depth. With all of the math teachers I've taken over my life, he is the best. He explains things in a variety of ways to make sure you understand. Isnt afraid to slow the course down if you dont.",1
"PLEASE disregard any positive  comments since 30 May 2010.  Prof. Debessay sent out emails to his ""A"" students asking for good evaluations: TOTALLY UNETHICAL -  in reality, his students cannot understand him/his accent, he doesn't teach current issues, and he is known as one of the WORST profs. in the department per evaluations. Avoid at all costs.",0
"The best professor Ive ever had... he cares about his students and he tends to get off topic, but everything he talks about... is helpful and helps me remember what we went over in class. I recommend taking his History 1302 class, it was super easy to pass.",1
"Intelligent guy but very anal with grading & with writing. I understand he wants his students to do well but he looks down on you a lot. I did decent in the class but every student learns differently. I would not want to take a course with him again, ever.",0
Favorties are Political Science majors,1
What a dick.,0
"I took this class completely online Fall 2020. The homework was easy enough, but did not apply to the exams. The course grade was made of total homework points and four exams. Do not expect Dr. Williams to help you, my friend had a Zoom office-hour meeting scheduled with him that he never showed up for. TLDR; homework is not good practice for exams",0
Very good prof. Took 3 classes with her. Tends to give good grades if you give a decent effort. Some classes are focused very much around discussion instead of technical learning ... for better or worse.,1
"Communication is poor, but he makes up for it in his good looks.",1
"Pretty easy class. Professor isn't that hard to understand. He makes things easy for you to learn and gives you what you need to know, not pointless material. The group projects are the worst part of the class. They are time consuming and completely pointless. Pick your group members wisely!!!",1
Just DO NOT DO IT!. spare yourself the time and money. I felt like I was getting ready for my board exams...,0
HORRIBLE teacher. rants about how much he hates the administration too much. i mean i would too if i took leave came back and almost all my music classes were cut.  makes student's feel lesser of him. 1st music teacher that made me not want to go to class.,0
"Norm is a great professor. He is highly knowledgeable, and makes his lectures appealing to us. He gives a lot of examples to really help us learn the concepts, and truly makes learning enjoyable. Although the material can sometimes be a bit boring, he tries his best to make it interesting. He is very engaging, and readily accessible. Def recommend!",1
"Honestly she was a really nice lady, but her class is so confusing and heavy of group discussion with little to no explanation. Reads off of PowerPoint and the book selection is pretty boring. She even picked a book she never read and we hated it. The essays and projects are easy but the class was disappointing.",0
"Horrible professor! Doesn't care if you learn. Messes up in lectures, says he'll start over next class and ignore the day's entire lecture. Minimal partial credit on exams. Went to his office, he said I just needed to practice more, that I didn't need a tutor, & wouldn't suggest another book to learn from. Withdrew, will NEVER take him again!",0
"Worst sdcc teacher I ever had. This professor does not want his students to pass, so he fails his students by giving D. He releases his students so early, and this obviously does not help his students pass the exit exam. He uses his MacBook Pro to do something else while students do useless worksheets. Avoid him at all cost.",0
"He is very quirky and very passionate about what he teaches.  I like him a lot but his class isn't an easy A but at the same time not very hard.  Usually everything that is on his tests, he talks about during class so attendance is basically mandatory.",1
"Prof. AB cares a lot about his students, hes more than willing to repeat and go over the material thousand times but wants you to learn and pay more attention. This class is HARD, I mean you gotta work and pay attention to pass the TESTS but the test questions are mostly from HW. Hes funny and makes the class more enjoyable. CURVES FINAL GRADE.",1
"Phillips was quite rude for the duration of the course. His teaching style is not accessible to all students, as he lectures by mouth only and is against repeating himself. Being graded on only 3 tests and a paper for the year is not a fair representation of learning as the tests are the most obscure questions possible.",0
"Every lecture is like a Ted Talk because the way she lectures is so inspirational and soothing. Five exams, an optional final, and attendance are the only things in the grade book. She splits the exam questions half and half between lecture and textbook. Love her!",1
"Boring guy. Lectures are terribly slow. I shouldn't've gone to class the first few weeks. Tests are predictable, just read the book and ask a buddy when the tests are. He doesn't know what Canvas or email are. He'd give old tests still labeled as old tests (ex. ""Spring 2016 Test 2""), and they'd still have mistakes",0
"This was the hardest class I've ever had.  He is a very sweet man, willing to help out however he can, but there was just way too much material.  My brain is toast.",1
Very bad vibes!! annoying with all the extra homework. Dosent help at all. STUCKUP,0
"Awful. All he does is read his nebulous ""lecture notes"". Notes are a mish-mash of random colors, incomprehensible jargon, and ridiculously over-numbered diagrams and pictures. Everything you're forced to read will take at least 5 read-throughs to actually begin to comprehend. Nothing is ever clear, and approaching him is unthinkable. AWFUL.",0
"1 lab report, 1 biological drawing + portfolio, 10 quizzes, 1 final. Everything is SUPER detail oriented. Quizzes aren't too bad, sucks that you have a time limit, screenshot wrong answers, e-mail him, often adds the point if he agrees with you. Lab final absolutely sucks. 55 stations, you have 1.5mins to answer questions that are way too specific",1
He tries to make the class funny but he makes awkward jokes and sometimes gets super off topic. All he ever talks about is Asia. Not a bad professor and for the basic level of the class it was pretty easy. The only textbooks you need are the Lamy and Robertson one.,1
"He has the tendency to stereotype and segregate the class by gender, race, etc. He also plays favorites to certain students & excludes others. I have yet to learn anything of value in this class. He's unorganized and runs his class as such. He even lets people talk loudly during tests! I will never take his courses again.",0
I did not like how he weighted so much of our mark on the final of the 3 projects. He also does a really poor job of explaining the statistics in assignment 2. I would avoid classes with him in the future.,0
"Johnson was the worst health sci professor I ever had. He's rather rude, uncaring and can't teach for beans. I hated stats because he ruined it for me.",0
"Possibly the best prof ive ever hard. Interesting contemporary readings, good lectures with great sense of humor, genuinely cares about his students. Helps to break down biases and show the beauty and the flaws that every religion have. Anyone who doesnt like him has serious issues",1
"Hes a terrible person. Doesnt know how to teach, exams are too vague, worst professor i had ever had, dont take it with him, take it with James",0
Boring. Forces participation during lecture instead of teaching the class.,0
"Demands a lot of memorization and regurgitation for her tests. Even though I would get A's on her tests they took me over 3 hours to write! She tends to have ""interesting"" ideas about certain areas within her ""expertise"". Has weird memory problems.  Definitely plays favorites and will treat people like they are children AVOID her classes!",0
"iClicker required. Can be a bit condescending if the iClicker responses are varied - ""How disappointing"". Ed speaks very quickly and very quietly; keeping up with notetaking is difficult. Midterm was easy; MCs and SAs only. Will tell you assignments aren't mandatory and only for help understanding, but boom! they're on the test.",0
"Doesn't even teach his students, just berates them.",0
Professor Clarke was very caring and responded quick to emails even in the midst of our crazy semester. The work was easy and clearly defined in the syllabus. would definitely take her again!,1
Professor Meyer is a really great teacher. He's passionate about human rights and his work and has a lot of knowledge. The exams are based off of in class notes and the readings and he gives you a study guide before each test. There's also a final paper. Willing to work with you and laid back.,1
Dr. Lovric is a good professor however he is hard to understand at times. The notes are all hand written and can become quite difficult to comprehend for somebody who did not attend lecture and looked at them after being posted. Do the assignments and all previous tests and exams. Not many grading opportunities so hard to do well.,1
"Dr. Connolly is an amazing professor, definitely one of my favorites at UNCC. The only grades are 3 tests (lowest one dropped) and a mandatory final. Her textbooks are a few online readings and a few short Disney books. Make sure you do the online readings and watch the films.",1
"Assigns ALOT of readings. But the class is easy. 1 Paper (6 pages) but you had to read the books she assigned in order to do the paper and can't use outside sources. 1 midterm, 1 final. 1 short presentation(5 mins) on jews in a certain country which I just googled before class. Class is fun you just listen to her talk but I just went to sleep.",0
"Classes were very boring, and her monotone voice didnt help. She goes over tons of things during class, with an oral lecture, which was horrible because she would go so fast. Didnt really take much out of that class. Only need the two reading books because one is on a test and you have to write a paper based on the other. Dont need the history 1",0
Take him!,1
"Had this teacher for both of my math classes and she is intimidating, she is very smart and if you are a nice class she is nice back, once she knows her class, she is much more engaged to the students and is a nicer teacher. If your participate she likes it alot, if your wrong she doesnt make a fool out of you, you need to earn your grade in this.",1
"Kazlow seems to think that we need to spend 8 hours a week on his class, regardless of all the other classes we are taking, jobs, e. He has no problem failing his entire class. I've had five friends drop out of the class this semester. He cares more about being a ""good teacher"""" then about his students actually passing and getting through his class",0
"On the newsgroup, one student said ""The assignment never said we weren't allowed to print extra stuff"" because marks were deducted for extra output. Peter responded ""The assignment never said you could print extra stuff!"" It's perfectly normal to print extra helpful feedback as the program runs. Talk about helpfulness and professional behavior!",0
"Lectures are tedious and seem completely unnecessary, yet are the main focus of the class for some reason. The lab is fine, but instructions are often unclear and I found myself coming in outside of class far more often than any other I've had. It is hard to understand him at times and this makes communication a struggle.",0
He is definitely quirky and I found him to be quite funny. As long as you study his lectures and the definitions from the book you should have no problem. I think he's a good professor. ,1
A terrible professor to start my freshman year. It's very hard to understand what he's saying when he has his back towards the board and has the worst handwriting I've ever seen. He's also bad at answering questions and doesn't care about his students. I thought people overreacted when reading these reviews at first but he really is that bad.,0
"CSC Majors: Avoid at all costs. Knowing anything about anything seems to be a BAD thing in this class. He dances around questions, goes back on assignment instructions, and is a general pain to be around. I almost never have only bad things to say about a professor, but here we are. If I didn't have a char limit I would go on for pages.",0
He gives an absurd amount of homework. He rarely does anything other than lecture during class.,0
not very willing to help,0
Dr. Friedrichs is the best history professor. He is so clear and easy to understand in class. It's apparent that he is interested and passionate about the topics. Also very accommodating and caring outside of class. Just be sure to do all the readings and attend lectures. Would definitely take another class with him!,1
"When it comes to lectures, Professor Xian is soft-spoken & tedious, but provides plenty of opportunities for your questions. Don't come late, you'll get an icy stare down. Her study guides for exams are thorough. Do the practice problems. In this exam weighted class, it's as easy to pass as it is to fall behind. The exams are thorough, but fair.",1
She was pretty good with this course. I wouldn't recommend taking it in the winter and that was a mistake. The course itself was very demanding and you had to work extremely hard to get a solid grade. The final exam was probably the toughest part of the course. Sniffy the rat was pointless and annoying after awhile. Not highly recommended.,1
Vandenburg is great prof. She has a great sense of humor and made my class laugh almost every day we were there. She is passionate about PHI and it is obvious in her lectures. They are interesting and thorough. Sometimes I would get so into listening to her talk I'd forget to take notes. She is also very helpful and encourages class discussion.,1
"I have nothing but good things to say about David. He goes above and beyond just teaching. He legitimately wants to influence you for the better and make a difference in your life. The best teacher I've had at Iowa and maybe anywhere, I'll be hard pressed to find one that's better.",1
"This class was on the holocaust and we had to watch/ read/ think about some really horrible things that have happened. There were lots of quizzes on language and key terms/ concepts, too. Catherine was really good about telling us expectations and was so thoughtful about the material. It made a shi*ty subject a lot easier. Earned my respect 100%.",1
"Took the online course and dropped it within the first week. Assigned 3 quizzes in the first week which were open note, internet, and book. Alas, none of those helped. Way too demanding for a 101 class. I couldn't even find the proper information using the internet. Seems like one of those teachers where if you can't learn anything it's your fault.",0
STAY AWAY,0
"This was a hard class, especially online, but she did great. There is a lot of information on Communication Theories and a lot of memorization, but if you study her PowerPoints and take the help quizzes you'll do fine. 7 quizzes and 5 exams, including final. She drops the lowest quiz and makes it extra credit at the end of the semester. Great prof.",1
"This may be the worst professor at IUPUI. Whatever you do, do not pick her. If this doesn't tell you anything, at the end of the grading period, she has a 0% in for every person in my class. I have yet to have a professor that was so incredibly bad at grading, AND putting in grades. I'm running out of characters but I have so much more to say...",0
"The man is all over the place!  I've had instructors before that you can tell they feel it's beneath them to be forced to teach at a community college level.  I get that vibe from him.  Condescending.  His quizzes are easy if you listen to 10% of what he says.  The rest of it is just talking to hear himself talk, I think.",0
"Nice person, but the assignments are completely nonsensical.",1
"Funny, cares for her students and she pretty easy going. Beautiful also.",1
"Dr. Savage really cares about his students. He makes sure everyone knows the grammar before he moves on. His tests are incredibly easy if you've taken AP French, but if not, he would be a fantastic foundation for grammar. If you have a choice between Dr. Savage and Dr. Abel, take Savage; he's a much more predictable teacher.",1
"hated her, UNCLEAR, pulls questions on tests out of her you know what. RUN the other way!!!!",0
"If you attend class and take good notes you won't have to read much of the text. Very approachable,kind of funny in a corny kind of way.  Believes each student is an individual and is graded that way.",1
"estefania gordo-garcia is willing to help you if you need it, easy exams",1
One of the best at Northwest! ,1
"The hardest professor you could possibly have for any math course. Do not take this class unless you belong in courses taught at Carnegie Mellon or MIT. Incredibly difficult problems for homework and calls us ""greedy"" when we tell him we want to actually understand everything about the homework.",0
"I took this course and followed it with her ECO 152 course, I could not have asked for a more understanding professor. Even in her online section, she was willing to work with me when I had to leave the state at the last minute and finish the course from across the country. She gives her students every opportunity to succeed.",1
I would recomend this professor to anyone taking english... She is an understanding and awsome professor... I loved her class and she is so helpful.... I highly recomend her...,1
"I did not enjoy her really bizarre book choices at all. A ton of work to do for her class and way too much reading to do outside of class. Also, if you're shy, be weary because she really wants a lot of class participation",0
"The worse class I took my freshman year. Dr. Wood has an extremely pushy liberal agenda and it comes out during his lectures. It is absurd how Wheaton allows him to advertise a class as something it is not. I truly wish someone had warned me beforehand about this, so here I am writing this. Beware of taking his classes....",0
Lots of personal stories told.  Long three hours (more so than usual),0
"Very hard to understand during lectures bordering on the edge of not actually teaching. Did not reply to emails, and simply stopped teaching at all during the COVID-19 lock down only emailing days before the exam to confirm that it was even happening at all. Do not take any class with him that matters to you, or that doesn' have a good text book.",0
"Don Olson is the cutest old man ever! You don't really have to go to class (some old tests are online). Olson does what he can to make sure you have a good grade for the class - drops lowest test grade and then adds bonus points from homework assignments OR if your final exam grade was better than your other lowest test grade, it gets replaced.",1
"As a professor Mukamel is ok, the material she covers is interesting, but her tests ruined the class for me. Her questions are beyond vague, Ex: ""Write what you know about the RAND"" Really? Worst tests I have ever taken. She does not post her notes online, she lectures using the whiteboard, no power points. Gives extra credit for evaluation.",1
"Great teacher, very enthusiastic every day.  Fill-in-the-blank notesheets are really helpful.  Tests are fair and certainly do a good job at testing the covered material.  His between-class office hours are a huge help...be sure to catch him between class whenever possible.  A great guy overall.",1
"Overall this class was a joke. It was the most un organized class ive ever had. His Wife is just annoying!! Does not teach well at all, Kevin will say one thing and his wife will say the opp and over time it gets you all messed up. Im just not rating him because he did bad i would say good if there was some. Geology 111",0
"He is a solid choice for mod civ. He's upfront about his expectations. You have to do the reading to do well on the quizzes. His lectures can be boring sometimes, but I thought it was interesting material. His tests have essays, but he gives you the possible prompts beforehand.",1
He teaches clearly and wants every students to understand the material and pass the class. He grades fairly and give extra credit too. He takes things slow so we can get the idea.,1
"Dr. Childers really wants people to do well. If you take good notes in class and know a summary of each article she gives you, you will do well on the tests. She is a generous grader on exams and curves once in a while. I recommend taking her classes.",1
"Professor Carson is a great guy who cares about the success of his students. He gives a lot of writing assignments but they're worthwhile and can be finished within the class period. As long as you put in the effort, you'll do well! I would gladly take him again.",1
Nice guy but dont take him unless youre really good at Math. His tests are not multiple choice and he puts no more than 10 questions on a test. Its incredibly easy to fail them and its almost pointless to do the homework because it counts for very little of your grade.,0
Extremely boring teacher.  Did not enjoy the class at all.  Lectures were pointless.  He is pretty awkward in person too but he's really funny.,0
"Terrible professor.  Can never finish his lectures and isn't a clear speaker.  He is also kind of a jerk when approached.  Thankfully, you can cover the entire course by spending the weekend on wikipedia (would have been nice to have been challenged and inspired by the professor).  Class is a waste of money/time but an easy half credit.",0
"On the first day of Clinical Psychology, he told us not to go into clinical psychology and that it was pretty useless.  He asks questions on the test like ""What is Freud's birthday?""  This is probably the biggest waste of time I've ever spent.  Didn't study for one test, got a 77%.  Studied for six hours for the next one, got a 82. Not helpful.",0
"He is very rude and i would even dare to say feels like he is ""sexist"". He is superficial, disorganized, lazy... he said: ""ask questions, but make sure you dont ask stupid questions""... i felt bullied and afraid to ask questions because of his rude answers, as if he knows it all and we are just stupid kids not knowing 2+2.. very disrespectful...",0
Do not take Jack Suvak's 1050 Math course he takes an easy course and makes it supper complicated. Not only does he not teach the course his notes are even worse. When emailing Suvak his responses are very rude and unhelpful. He also does not allow students to use their accommodations.,0
Hard marker and boring class,0
The lecutures are extremely boring and long. He basically reads the powerpoints and expects you know 6 chapters on each test. TOO much information to memorize for only 50 questions!!! He is very demanding and rude to students when you ask questions. He dosen't care if you come to class. 3 hour lecutures on sundays is not worth it.,0
This class was awful. She lectures from powerpoints that have very little info on them and she gets sidetracked a lot. The exams don't match up with the lectures at all and are very difficult so it was very hard to know how to prepare for them. She's a very sweet lady but it seemed like she was more concerned with being our friend than our teacher.,0
Jeff is the worst option for the algo course. You have to memorize and write algorithms using jeffs way (using fairy tales) otherwise you will get a low mark. But his fairytales are useless for actual algorithm analysis and job interviews,0
"You will learn nothing from this class. She gives way too many quizzes and she is TOUGH with grades. Even if you are an A student, you won't get an A in her class. I would recommend someone else if you are truly interested in knowing your material, coz this class is just a read and test class to be honest. (worst class during my undergrad for sure)",0
"Quizzes are basically all trick questions. Multiple choice questions on the final are mainly straightforward, but some questions are tricky. The short answer questions on the final are about the most irrelevant details out of all the material that was covered (when you're studying, everything you think is useless is probably one of the questions).",0
"The prof was amazing. He is kind and treats you like a University student, however the way the course is structured isn't really helpful. The short answer assignment and essay were fine, however, I found the take-home exam questions to be difficult to do. If you want to pass or know what's going on in the course, you need to be there.",1
 if you happen to not be in class the day of the test or forgot there was a test and didn't go. Then he will not let you take it. So if you miss a test you are screwed. He tends to babble about random stuff during lectures which makes the lectures a bit confusing. The class can be easy or very confusing. No inbetween,0
this guy is so amazing! he is such a hottie! I look forward to attending his classes! I love it when he tells his stories about his personal adventures! I look forward to my next class with him he is extremely helpful,1
DROP THE CLASS IF YOU EVER GET HIM,0
She is awful. I took her for Soc201 and there was one test worth 49% of the grade. She takes forever to respond to emails and is not understanding at all even if youre a good student. She overcomplicates concepts and moves really fast in class. She does not care if students succeed. Do not take her class if you can help it.,0
"jeff is really scary during class. he gets angry when people are confused. if you go to his office hours you will do a lot better. basically, they are mandatory bc if you don't go you will almost fail. there isn't daily hw but there are group projects which are always confusing but not graded.",0
"Magleby- Will not talk to you or spend time to help you. He's got ""a lot on his plate"" running the ""fantastic"" BYU MOA. He will mock people in the most disrespectful of ways (not funny). Tests are a joke as many others have said. The TA's are possibly the worst part, they do the grading and half the work for this ""busy"" man. Inconsistent and hard.",0
The first class I took with him was ok. But the secobd class was boring. Nothing but voc-prepositions ans NPR boriiiinnnnnnggggggggggg.,1
"I love Dr Tigner, I feel like shes one of the best professor I ever had at Nassau, if you dont pay attention to her lectures you will be behind Also take notes it helps a lot , shes so down to earth and really good at making you understand each lesson. Make sure you do your assignments on time,And dont be late, I would definitely take her again",1
"He is funny....and knows his material! His midterms and exams are fair...and you dont need a textbook, if you attend his class",1
"If you struggle at public speaking, giving speeches, talking in front of a group, etc, you should avoid this class!  I was appalled at the amount of speeches (although simple) were required! There was even a day where we discussed speech giving tips for the entire class period. This is a geography class but there is a LARGE emphasis on speeches.",0
"He is a good Prof.  If you completed the assignments, and practiced the previous exams you should get an B+ min.  Always open to discussion even outside of his office hours",1
"Do NOT take this dude. Literally an insane amount of reading as if we don't have other classes with homework. He also changes assignments on students last minute which is incredibly unprofessional. He also is very polarizing with his political views so you either love or hate him there. Not a mean guy, but not someone I want to have again!!!",0
One of the best professors I've ever had. He is always ready to listen to students ideas and discuss them. He is very open minded. And he's got a great sense of humour.,1
"She seems so sweet at the beginning but she avoids questions and just assigns more and more homework.  Then on her tests she makes you write word problems and will take a lot of points off she doesn't think its a ""good"" question, she makes math subjective and takes points off for small things.  Not the worst professor, but not the best either.",0
"This is not an easy A! Dr. Nelson is SUCH a nice lady, but she will make you work for your grade. The tests were fairly difficult, but that's with all SCOM because its such a weird subject and they all seem right. There's a lot of work for speeches, but its entirely doable. She doesn't give many lectures so you have to read, but only for tests.",1
"His grading and homework is straight forward, but its gets boring often. ",0
"Took this course for arts requirement, and I happen to like ancient Greek history, but like the other comments said, a lot of memorization and you have to be very specific, you have to memorize the name of the piece, where it is from when it was made etc.. Do this times 60. If you must take this class, attend the office hours.",1
"Horrible lectures, drawn out **** that she spits out randomly off the top of her head, the best notes you will ever get is her reading out of the book verbatim at a variety of tones while she double fists 32oz. coffees...she might be coked up and dodges questions like its her job.",0
"McIntyre is great. He uses fill in the blank packets which take a little getting used to. He explains things super fast, which he is aware of. If you ask for help during office hours, he'll be more helpful. The homework isn't mandatory, but you should do it in order to better understand the material.",1
"Loves to teach 5 minutes before the bell and 5 minutes after. I admire the fact that he wants to show nearly every proof in the book, but it takes away time from actually showing a little application. Tests are hard, but curved. Very ambiguous about the grade you are getting until the very end. Occasionally assigns an absurd amount of homework.",1
Class is interesting after first month. I would not recommend for anyone who does not have a car on campus. All tests are taken in testing center near acme. I ubered to every one. You must also attend 2 concerts which can cost money and it's annoying. Tests are 100 questions online including listening portions. Do not take for breadth!,0
Too smart for basic finance.,0
"Honestly I really liked David as a teacher, very respectful, knew what he was talking about, always on point. I don't know why he's so low",1
I didn't find it helpful. Giving examplse for latin in languages that none of us know... does NOT help,0
"I found this class to be pretty dry, and the professor was a little ridiculous with his explanations. He would go on tangents, and then say you don't have to know this. The material is tough enough, there is no need for extras. Made an A, but the class felt like it went on forever...",0
Just prepare yourself for a really hard semester if you have him. It's not impossible to pass his class but it is very well a challenge. I know straight A students who struggle with him. he does not care about the students but one good thing is that he can be funny sometimes,0
"Quit whining and participate. Dr. Moore really cares about each and every student, and it was amazing being in his class! You really have a great opportunity to learn and grow as a person taking his class. I was able to make an A by reviewing the reading before class to take his quizzes (set up on a very integrity heavy basis) and participating.",1
Best professor I have ever had!,1
"Professor- mostly serious, dull The class- only guest speakers, boring and long, annoying, heavy group work. On top of this class being pointless, he was not a good professor. Constantly talked about himself and about how he made it through college and complained about his paycheck like theres no tomorrow. Super Easy hw Pointless class but easy A.",0
"Professor De Francesco is a really great guyhe has interesting lessons and his class is easy as long as you pay attention. He's willing to help you if you're confused, but I would encourage you to do the reading in order to understand what is happening. There are a variety of assignments/projects about media-related majors but they are fun!",1
... he's great!,1
"Being a nursing major, I wish I would have dropped this class when I could. His lectures are long and confusing and often adds information that is not needed at all. He often starts to lecture on one topic, begins on a long tangent, and then does not finish his point of what he was trying to say in the first place. This class is frustrating. ",0
"awful prof, awful examiner",0
THIS WAS THE MOST BORING CLASS EVER!! NEVER TAKE IT UNLESS YOU WANT TO FALL ASLEEP!!,0
"ok people need to stop complaining about her b/c she is an amazing teacher. She gives out easy hw & her quize/tests easy as well. she gives u 3 months to work on the research paper, what more can u ask for? almost all assignments r from the text. I learned so much in this class, just pay attention, stay on top of ur game & you'll end up with an A.",1
An easy A for a music major (and probably even if you're not).  Creepy pauses and awkward stares a given.,1
this man's corrections were incorrect or just opinions.,0
Grades unreasonably difficulty. A LOT of textbook reading that needs to be done before the lecture in order to participate at all in class. Also never ends lecture on time. He's still deep in lecture 3 minutes past the end of class. Only good thing is that he pulls test questions from note guides he gives you,0
"In my 4 years in college so far, Professor Wilburn is the best professor. I've never known a professor more skilled at teaching than he is. He is clear about the subject, he encourages student involvement, gives examples and explain in details, knows what's most important in the class and leads the students through, and is kind and understanding...",1
"This guy is honestly awful as a professor. Just finished another exam in which no one could even manage a B. The way he words questions is terrible and unclear and he refuses to change anything or take suggestions, despite the fact that out of the entire class 15 have below a C.",0
"The lectures are not helpful, you will learn much more practicing problems and understanding mechanics that way; I mean, really, he reads off his book (with typos). Student questions brushed off to the side. So no one attends his lectures, and then it seems because of that he's merciless and won't curve or drop a test. Averages are low as heck too.",0
This professor is amazing - she alone inspired me to pursue graduate studies in post-colonial theory.  Best class I ever took at Queens.,1
A very hard grader. Only one kid got an A- in the class. She calls you out a lot in class.,0
Course is interesting & if you attend class regularly he provides many hints as to tests and exams. Offers bonus points. But this man talks way too much about his personal life. Comes across rather full of himself and self-absorbed. Even in the book he wrote for class had too much personal stuff. If you can get past that & do the work you'll b fine,0
Horrible I had him for calc III and almost our whole class ended up dropping b/c he was so bad...then i took atif and rocked it,0
"Super hard. He knows everything and teaches it in a way expecting everyone to know it too. I attended all lectures and am still completely lost. Homework assignments are incredibly difficult, and both he and the TA are very hard to reach by email. Office hours are not helpful either. You will pretty much have to figure out everything on your own",0
He's a great prof but too bad the course material isnt always interesting. The grammar section can be quite tedious,1
"I read the reviews, and figured I could self study my way through the class, but this is not and easy class to teach yourself in. I ended up watching professor Leonard videos to just scrape by. I am a straight A student so this man really ruined my GPA. He has take home group quizzes with like hourssss worth of work, which I hated. DONT TAKE",0
"Just don't take him with any ONLINE class. In class, he is a great professor. I had him for principles of security and he was great. However, he just doesn't know how to run an online class and it was so unorganized and theres a group project that was extremely annoying!",0
"he is going to make you read like there is no tomorrow. He skips from topic to topic and its not very clear. He's also in love with American history and politics. No midterms or final, just weekly Questions that take up a lot of time.",0
The worst ever.. by far,0
"So bad, this guy doesnt know how to teach. Talks over you, when you try and ask questions he just talks right over you so you cant finish your sentence. Terrible teacher, not a real professor by any means.",0
Her lectures are amazingly funny she really cares about you and will talk to you in private if you need help,1
Rampton's lectures got me excited about American literature. He is a fair marker who rewards hard-working students and he is extremely passionate about literature. Watch out for being called out in class to answer and analyze works!,1
"This class is basically a guaranteed A.  As long as you show up for class (which is not mandatory, but it makes you look good) and do the assignments on time you cannot fail.  He wants you to succeed and will help you to do just that! He's a great guy and the assignments are seriously easy.",1
Just had her for health care ethics- one of my new favorite professors at loyola. she knows what she's talking about and easily one of the best lecturers at loyola....take her- it's such a great class!!,1
"Awesome. The man has lived history, has high standards, knows what he is talking about to the nth degree, and won't take crap from lazy slackers. What's not to love?",1
"His lectures are enjoyable and will with plenty of material. The homework is mandatory if you want an A. He will give easy problems on the tests and quizzes. Overall, it was one of the best classes I've taken.",1
"unfortunately he is an unorganized, soft spoken, and unclear professor. His handwriting is barely legible also he is so often making mistakes that we the students are often correcting him. He also takes weeks to grade anything so it's hard to keep track of your grade. Over half the class dropped. I highly advise against taking his class.",0
Easy class- interesting professor.  Tests based mostly on reading.,1
"Philosophy is tough and if you aren't strong in it don't take Sarah's upper level classes, talking to her in person is almost always the best way to get questions answered but if you put in the effort to truly try and understand you will get a lot out of working with her. Better be damn good at essay writing to cause she has high expectations there",1
"I may be one of the few out there, but I really found this course interesting.  It's really helpful to review periodically throughout the course and the labmanual has a lot of really helpful information too.  Spend the full three hours in lab, you'll be happy you did.  Go and talk to the prof after class, he really is good in person and one on one.",1
"I am a very active participant when it comes to classes. He dissuades you from wanting to do that. The lectures are long, incoherent and have nothing to do with what you are reading. My advice is to read the textbook, study the many quizzes he gives you for the exams and sit in the back and do homework for other classes.",0
I'm shocked to see any good reviews. His class was horrible and his attitude and energy are even worse! He doesn't have any power points and doesn't write anything on the board. His tests are based on his lectures. You're expected to write every word he says as fast and he says it. He is a true narcissistic. AVOID AVOID AVOID and you will thank me!,0
"Dr. Deegan has an interesting personality; however, as most of the class was taught by a TA it's hard to accurately rate him.  I have nothing good to say and nothing bad to say.",1
This professor only lectures and doesn't let others talk. Hard to participate or be engaged when so negative and rude.,0
"Professor Charette is one of the best professors I have had at JMU so far. He is a true example of a great leader and helped my class and I learn so much about leadership. There are big group projects and there are writing assignments, but they are very manageable. I highly recommend this class!",1
"Only teaching done was teaching myself! Twice made references and expectations of being a 300 class.  Rude comments with very little actual feedback!(example: highlighted paragraph and wrote, what is this?) I paid for a professor, what I got was a JOKE!  Avoid him at all costs!! Other kids taking Engl 250  couldn't believe how hard   he was.",0
"very easy class very good teacher, just make sure you show up to class.",1
Do not take this course online with him!,0
This class was nearly impossible. His lectures are useless as he only goes over generalized concepts. The exams were very detailed. He basically picked obscure sentences from the textbook and made them questions on the test. Whole class is memorizing the textbook. Refuses to send powerpoint slides. Horrible professor. AVOID.,0
"His grading is very unclear. He never sets specific guidelines for projects and then grades on things that weren't taught. The class layout is odd, where things taught after assignments were due would have made their quality much better. I am by all means avoiding him for the rest of my time here.",0
"I would not take her again. I submitted multiple projects and she ""never received"" them.",0
"He's a great prof, but I feel really uncomfortable asking him questions. Definitely makes you feel stupid if you hesitate or ask an unspecific question... almost like you're wasting his time. Personally, I think he's a great lecturer but one on one I'm not too sure.",1
He may be fun but the lecture halls are too big for him to actually care about you and your struggles in his class,0
"Easy professor for studio, doesnt give much work usually. but when he does he gives a whole lot together. Wen it comes to grading he sucks. If ur a teachers pet and suck up to him, then he's great for u.",0
"He definitely isn't a great professor. He is quiet and his accent makes him hard to understand. He is very nice though, and he will give partial credit very easily on questions as long as you know just a little bit. Keep in mind that he gives frequent quizzes. His lectures are not very helpful, and I ended up learning everything online via YouTube.",0
"Fantastic Professor! Really understand the materials and knows how to teach. His assignments are very challenging, yet help tremendously learn beyond the course. However, if you work hard on assignments, it's very easy to get good marks in his class. Very helpful after class, he usually replies email within an hour.",1
"Not a fan of this prof. He rips your papers apart, and gives you a ton of homework. All he does is lecture and laugh at his own jokes. Choose a different prof to fill your requirement.",0
"Joyce is the chair of the anthropology department for a reason-she is a brilliant professor.Lectures can sometimes be a little over the heads of her students,but her number one goal is that her students learn and are engaged.Provides excellent reading, articles mostly.Class is set up like grad seminar, so how much you learn is up to you. ""easy"" a.",1
"If you have the option, take as many classes as you can with John.  He excels as an effective communicator and mentor.",1
"Ehrhardt is the reason I enjoy college courses and love the honors college. It is a lot of reading, but her classes are extremely interesting, entertaining, and you'll learn so much about real world things that make you a more educated/well-rounded individual. Definitely one of those professors that wants you to succeed.",1
"This a tough upper level course needed for HPFM majors. I'll admit many of our HPFM courses are simple, but you really need to work for this one. Chaloupka has been published many times, so he knows his stuff. I recommend reading ahead and watching Youtube video to really understand the material. Overall really nice guy!",1
DRAW a line at 1600!!,1
"Good lecturer, but his lectures are all about theory and not about how to solve the problems on his tests, which look nothing like the problems in the textbook and he gives no problems sets or quizzes to prepare. Not helpful or interested in helping - refused to explain a basic concept in office hours because it was below him. Avoid at all costs. ",0
"Super clear notes & stuff. Boring lecture. If you are math major hes pretty good. For non-math major, avoid. BTW, easy on marking (exam), but super loooooooooong homework takes 4ever to finish.",1
"Tries very hard for his students, genuinely cares about student success. Not a great lecturer. I never really learned the real material for the class from his lectures, so the online tests were very hard for me. really nice guy, he just tends to ramble on and on about ""real world"" stuff that doesn't actually pertain to the material.",1
"He doesn't use Blackboard at all, rarely uses his emails (it's a struggle to get in contact at all), and his syllabus has next to no information that is needed, ESPECIALLY the Final Exam (a paper) and when it's due. He calls people out just on the way they dress, doesn't really give a crap about his class, and doesn't like showing up on time ever.",0
worst proffesor i have ever had do not take music theory if you were never in band,0
Study hard for these tests. The lectures are all power-point but Dr. Hill does a great job interacting with the class even though there are over 200 people. The clickers really help involve the class as well. Dr. Hill certainly knows her material in the class so do not hesitate to ask a question and she'll gladly help you out.,1
Good professor. Kind of too focused on German virtuosos but whatever. As long as you meet out of class with her you should find what you are looking for. Fun professor.,1
This was a summer class. Quizzes and discussions due every week. Had a midterm and final worth 150 points. He curves the quizzes and tests. The way he does curves is he has them as a separate grade in the book out of nothing and just continues on through the term so my class ended with about 25 extra credit pts. Highly recommended for summer class.,1
"the course was great.  fun, and an excellent learning experience.",1
"Amazing professor. ""Tangents"" are always relevant.",1
"Professor Qi was a great professor. She was nice and easy to approach. Her tests were hard, but it is quantitative chem, so it is going to be hard. If you write down the problems in class, and do the homework you will be fine.",1
"This is the easiest GenEd ever! She can be boring at times, but it's the easiest A you can get. As long as you do the work she will give you all the points for it. There are a few essays, but no textbook or final. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!!",1
"She loves adding in last minute requirements for assignments, doesn't throughly explain what is required, really unorganized. There's a lot of assignments given, but it's easy if you have a couple of days open to finish them. I didn't learn squat.",0
"One of the best teachers at Seneca. Knows her stuff. Extremely kind, understanding and helpful. She also knows how to get her message across well. Fair marker!",1
"Dr. Vineyard really knows what he is talking about, but he teaches the class as a higher level CS course. I had more projects assigned in this 101 class then I had in my other two upper level math classes all semester (Calc 3 and Abstract Algebra).  Be prepared to work A LOT and have A LOT of assignments. You will learn a lot IF you pay attention",1
Best Professor at BYU! He really cares about each individual student. Non-judgmental and willing to help whenever needed. Do the work and you'll be just fine in the class.,1
"One of the worst professors at DSC. He is rude and gets upset when students ask questions in class, not helpful during office hours either. The lectures are useless since he just reads off slides from powerpoints. Got an A in this class, learned nothing. I would like to say avoid him but unfortunately he's the only professor teaching physics.",0
"After two semesters of Howell, this is what I have learned: Focus your energy on tests, memorize his solutions like the back of your hand, pay careful attention to his written instructions - there are hints abound, learn his lingo - he takes extreme care in the way he words himself, & reach out to TAs for help b4 its too late - they felt your pain!",0
kudos,1
Treats students in a horrible and disrespectful manner. Can be reported anonymously to protected disclosure office at university.,0
very hard prof.,0
Roberta was not a great teacher. Our class work consisted of either Roberta going on about something not related or bringing in guest speakers. 6 classes to be exact. 4 of the schedualed clases Roberta was either away or simply did not run class. I dont feel like I learned anything in entrepreneurship 293 as she was no there to facilitate learning,0
"Mr. Hammill is by far the best teacher i have ever had. his style is incredible and i love the way he puts things. simply, but he still gets you thinking. i would recomend that everyone take one of his classes.",1
"Good class, not hard.  She'll tell you what needs to be fixed with your project before you turn it in.  Go to class and there is no outside work.",1
"Bring your calculator to every class, show up on time, do the work that's assigned, get a 3ring binder and keep all your work in it. Do NOT play with your cell phone, talk during lectures, bother buying a textbook, or take his sarcasmn too seriously. He's a crack up if you follow these simple rules, and he will help you if you do what he asks.",1
DR JONES IS THE GREATEST MAN ALIVE!!!!!!!!,1
Marvin needs to wear his glasses and get a hearing aid. He makes mistakes while he is writing on the board and if you correct him...look out! He needs to retire and let some new blood into the game of math teaching.,0
"what he did on the class was simply to copy his notes on the blackboard and read them again, with obsure English and unfriendly face. He is very weak on Economics: just look at his website on the department webpage, the latest published paper of his was years ago. Never sit in his class unless you want to kill time in a painful way.",0
Awful professor! Never take him if possible,0
"Dr. Fischer is perhaps, the most misunderstood teacher at MSU.  You hardly realize, until class is finished and you've barely passed, how much he cares about you.  I don't know another professor who works so hard to find internships for students and deeply cares for students.  That said, I did not like his class when I took it.  But, I love him now",1
"Pretty easy class; she really means well. Lots of busy work and the study guides don't help much but she lets you make up a test at the end of the semester, which helps. Attendance is mandatory, and she really will pass around a sign-in sheet every day.",1
"Hard class, course work, and exams. Professor didn't communicate well with students via email. This was a online class. Material was not explained well, what was on exams was not on home work assignments. very poor clarity on what to expect students to learn verses what was actually taught",0
"Certainly easy, but I got almost nothing from his class.  He doesn't engage the students, doesn't use real world examples to illustrate his points, lets every class out half an hour early.  Is nice and willing to help but even in extra help I still don't learn from him the way he teaches.",1
Labecca Jones is a wonderful professor and person. She truly wants you to pass her class and sincerely cares about you. Sometimes she gets a little off topic but she always steers herself back. She makes jokes a lot. She is available for you to speak with and is very helpful as long as you let her know what is going on. She is also a fair grader.,1
"Lots of group discussion. Class was always made to be fun. She brings candy and cookies all the time, she's like a mom at school! Absolutely love her",1
"idk what everyone is complaining about. Not gonna lie his methods and assignments are a little out there but overall hes a cool dude, and grades pretty easy. Lot of presentations but almost automatically gives u a perfect grade even if you dont present. Boring beg of the year but got alot funnier, and he takes jokes very well",1
"Classes are just rambling and rambling essentially incoherently. Tests are graded specifically on *his* views and only the stuff that happened in class, so the readings and original conclusions barely help you. Class isn't unbelievably difficult but is totally pointless and frustrating.",0
"HATED thus class. The professor teaches about how to teach students with learning disabilities, yet when you ask for help all she does is tells you to go to the student disability center. I would never recommend her.",0
"It's not fair to rate her TAs on her listing, but they contribute to make the course a NIGHTMARE.  My TA was literally the devil incarnate - unreasonable and difficult to please.  It's an easy A..if you plan on doing no thinking or analysis at all. Stick to the science read-and regurgitate and you'll ace the class.",1
"i'm sure i would be more engaged in the class if there was a child in my life and i had a vested interest to pay attention. the class felt disorganized, crowley just took her notes and wrote them on the board. low discussion/interaction in class, so it's very easy to fall asleep in. 3 tests, 1 essay. take for reqs, not to learn c&a dev.",0
"Whatever you do, avoid this professor. I am a 4.0 GPA student and couldnt get my grades up for this course which led me to withdraw. Before taking this course, I read these reviews and gave it the benefit of the doubt. WORST MISTAKE EVER. So many students are failing or struggling and he obviously doesn't think he has something to do with the issue",0
"Dr. Nelson has been in Economics for a long time and really knows what he is talking about. There are a lot of tests but everything comes from the book. Optional to come to class but definitely recommended. Also, I would recommend doing the homework because it is an easy ""test"" grade that counts as a test. He grades on a curve!",1
"She was a good teacher. Knows how to work a calculator which comes in handy. Quizzes are extremely difficult, I would get help from the TDC for them. Tests are really easy. Uses MathXL and assigns it about 2 times a week. ASK QUESTIONS, she will explain until you get it. Overall a good teacher and easy class if you did well in Algebra before.",1
"For the 4 HIS101 exam study guides you have to identify 140 people in the chapters and why they are significant. Her blackboard set up is very confusing. She posted an hour video explaining it and you will have to watch it over and over. Instructions for assignments are ""make sure you do this, dont do this, but do this, without doing that....""",0
"JANA IS A GREAT INSTRUCTOR, AND IS ALWAYS THERE TO HELP YOU OUT, SHE GIVES GREAT FEED BACK, AND YOU CAN ALWAYS GO BACK AND TALK TO HER WHEN YOU NEED EXTRA EXPLAINING ON ASSIGNMENTS.",1
"He didn't interact with us at all for the whole (6 week) semester. He didn't answer emails, he didn't give us feedback on exams, he didn't offer any help on labs, and he didn't try to teach the class. Homework was through Pearson and labs were for highschoolers. You will have to teach yourself the entire semester with zero help from the 'Professor'",0
"Brilliant professor, and you won't get bored during lectures. It is very discussion heavy, and she wants everyone to participate and it is a huge part of your grade. Also a ton of reading, but I found all of it to be really interesting although it did take a long time. Long midterm and final, some quizzes and one group project. Learned a lot!",1
"Absolutely terrible. Rushes through lectures in a pathetically ineffective manner to minimize her workload, then gives you a 2+ hour in-class lab filled with questions that aren't covered anywhere, then you are tested on these unavailing labs with exams that are designed for you to fail. Rude, condescending, bitter. Sad state of affairs for W&M.",0
"French guy teaching french, at first that makes sense till you hear he could not stand when someone pronounced things wrong or didn't understand. He chose the one guy in the class who was french to answer questions to move on faster. I had to get deferred out cause even with the final i wouldn't of passed",0
"The first day of the class took 45 minutes to do attendance. The class consists of him reading off the textbook with no visuals except his forehead through the camera. No canvas, everything is done through email. 3rd class meeting consisted of him figuring out how to use his mic with tech support there in the call for an hour. Would've scored a 0.",0
she is the most amazing prof ever...great course too,1
"This was by far one of my favorite classes at UofM. The topics discussed will quite literally change your perspective and how you see the world. The papers were slightly challenging but if you go to office hours and keep up with the reading it is fine. Discussion for this class is also actually very helpful. Overall, awesome class!!",1
Best professor ever. ,1
"This guy is a pathetic teacher. He knows what he's doing but can not explain concepts. The ""Let learning continue"" at the end of his lecture slides is ironic as the learning never starts. lol.",0
"Jim Wren was amazing as an instructor ! I didn't get too much time with him being that we had MFA teacher assistants that led our small groups but this class was so much fun and taught me the  fundamentals of acting , literally ! I got an A+ ! definitely recommend this course for others who love theatre or just need the credit !",1
"Just happened to think of this site recently...I graduated a few years ago and still remember  Prof. Das Bender as one of the best professors I've ever had. The class I was in was Advanced Writing and barely had 10 students in it which made it an incredible learning experience. I wasn't an Eng major, like the others, but she made me love writing.",1
Not fun being in his class.,0
Lessons and homework were on Tophat. Not the best software because there were typos in the problems rendering solutions incorrect but Patterson was quick to give credit for it. Reviews and practice problems were provided on iCollege after each section which was helpful in learning the material. This was a fast-paced summer course but manageable.,1
Good teacher. Be ready to read BEFORE going into class or you might be awaken with a surprise that you will not like. He gives extra credit and will help you along the way in this class.,1
Way too much reading and group discussions. A bit disorganized. Quite a few group presentations as well. Basically one midterm and one final and group presentation and book reviews. Take notes on what each group says to the questions she assigns. READ THE NOVELS!  There's almost nothing online for the novels she picks. Don't rly need the textbook.,0
He's hilarious and makes you want to come to your 8am class,1
"He's a good prof. he explains things slowly and clearly so that you really get it. Sure, he goes slow through the material, but this isnt always a bad thing. Chem 120123 are not hard courses, but I highly recommend keeping up with material and doing textbook questions regularly. believe me, dont screw yourself over. chem is just practise. ",1
"I really enjoy McCrory and his class. The only issue is that the exams are very hard and they are the only assignments in the grade book. Additionally, office hours are held multiple times a week and act as additional lectures. As my schedule didn't allow for my attendance, I felt like I was at a major disadvantage in the course.",1
Maria gets distracted easily. She does not allow for students to leave the classroom to go to the bathroom and she will call students out if they do. She has pop quizzes based on trick questions from the text that were graded. Attendance is not mandatory however she strongly suggests to attend all classes. Hard marker.,1
"If you can't read minds don't take this class. He expects you know what he's thinking, and if you have an opinion of your own it's probably wrong according to him. He thinks he's the smartest person out there when it comes to history. I wish I never would have taken his class. He's very ignorant.",0
uh-huh...uh-huh....uh-huh....uh-huh...uh-huh-uh-huh-uh-huh...uh-huh.  [cough] uh-huh...uh-huh...,0
We all love Doc!!! Best Instructor Ever!,1
"I liked how on the first day, he knew he was preparing us for engineering, not theoretical science. The labs are lengthy, but he grades them fairly. The quizzes and exams are easy, as long as you did both the assigned and recommended homework. He only gives you a few problems, because he understands we're taking other classes.",1
"For a 100 level class, this course is pretty hard. Riordan has us reading graduate level books that suck to read...especially if you're not interested in history. He is very passionate about history, yet his lectures are so boring. I think this class is too hard for someone who doesn't need it.",0
"I regret taking this professor. Lecture was sooo boring and he kept talking about his personal life like we asked or something. If you can take ANY other professor, please do. I always came to test day confused because he doesn't teach well and I had no idea what to expect. Took him for 2320 too and had to drop. Pls avoid him if you can.",0
"There was a lot to read and complete each week, book was poor. Didnt grade half my work/exams/labs for most of class. Ended class with no idea of my final grade. She didnt know course material or have any ability to assist with homework or lab issues. Written work was easy A if APA formatted since she didnt understand it. Would NOT take again!",0
Honestly one of the best professors. If you are a Poli Sci major or minor I highly recommend you take him. He does not lecture from power points so attendance is highly recommended. He gives you the opportunity to apply ideas to lectures and real life. Would recommend him for any poli sci class.,1
"Very organized! The lecture, the assignments, the exams are all very well-prepared. He went through the material in a very systematic way. Awesome. Highly recommended!",1
My favorite professor by far! He actually makes class enjoyable. Take his classes any chance you get! Sometimes he even cancels the final :),1
"If you want to write 24 essays, then take him. Yes, he assigned 24 essays and on top of it he grades extremely hard. Also, quizzes he puts together are around 6 to 8 questions so if you miss one point, you're screwed. Speaking about the quizzes, there are typos all over them, to the point it is confusing. Stay away from this class.",0
"As a rising star in computational biology algorithms, Jeremy simply oozes intellegence. Naturally, many problems deemed reasonable by him are often more challenging to the average student. 
 
 Bright and upbeat in class, resourceful out of class, and always ready to discuss theory, Jeremy is indeed a gem of CSE.",1
"Dr. Alse is an awesome professor!  His Money and Banking course was difficult, perhaps the hardest Economics course I have ever taken.  However, he really knew his stuff and his lectures were really interesting.  Tests were quite difficult.  Be sure to take a few days to study for each exam!",1
Had an amazing time being her student. Class isn't very difficult if you study 1-2 days before midterms. Be very very creative in your sequences and you will do very good. Prof is extremely helpful and you'd be surprised how much you could learn in this course.,1
You have 10 quizes each worth 10 points. 3 test and a final. No homework. Quizes and test are what make up your grade. His lectures can be confusing at times and he expects you to read to book. Test are a little tough. Gives one extra credit opportunity for 5 extra points. ,1
Avoid this class. Terrible teacher. The project makes no sense at all. The class is un-necessary. You do not use your textbook that he asks you to buy to break the bank and more.,0
"I have never been good at math and I was able to get an A in an online math class! It wasn't easy and I had to spend a lot of time studying, but if it wasn't for his lecture videos and the way he teaches I never would've been that successful. He is also great at answering questions and always responds to emails quickly. He wants you to succeed.",1
I love this prof! He is so helpful and clear. There is only a paper and a take home exam. Very fair.,1
"Ernst is fun but, teaches things the way she sees them. Once you understand how she understands the concepts, you'll be fine. Reading the textbook is the difference between an A and a B in her class. Final exam is just a composite of previous exam questions.",1
"Won Lee has great, very entertaining lectures. He is also very funny, and makes the topic fun. His tests are almost impossibly hard, you must remember everything from the lectures, and be able to recite it on your essay exams--in 50 minutes. Overall, there is not enough time to complete his exams sufficiently, in the way he expects them to be done.",1
"Doctor Evans is very smart but not as smart as he thinks, and he is very strong. He picks up heavy objects in class. If your looking to celebrate a birthday ask him to sing for you because he can really sing, but not A plus quality more like A minus singing.",1
Bad teacher the reason I say this is because he ignores your phone calls and emails and he gets an attitude when you ask a question he will not help you at all. Take at your own risk. I never even had a one on one meeting with him.,0
"Efa is my fave. He basically just lectures off of his slides and tells his own personal stories, which help to understand the material. He stepped up his tests this semester, so you actually have to study, but as long as you read the textbook, and write notes in your own words, you'll do fine. Participation is also worth 20% of your overall grade.",1
Perhaps one of the most intelligent professors on campus. She knows her stuff and enables students to understand things they normally wouldn't because of the intellectual discussions that are held in her class.  She will read every word in your papers and comment throughout.YOU CAN'T HELP BUT INCREASE YOUR SKILLS IN ANALYZING LITERATURE AND WRITING,1
Big nope. Professors make a big difference in how do you at school and this prof changed mine for the worst! Avoid at all costs,0
He is an incredibly tough grader. Very unorganized. Confusing to follow in class. Doesn't really give you any help.,0
Absolutely the ideal language prof! Her enthusiasm for Spanish is only equalled by her obvious love and appreciation for each student in the class (she knows each one by name and makes them feel like the most incredible students in the world),1
"I'll never take another class with him again. Frequently late to class, then he takes up to five minutes to get ready to teach. Worse, most of what he lectures on isn't on the test, and too much of what's on the test are things he either didn't mention or glossed over in class.",0
"While the material covered in Dr. Wright's lectures was demanding, his lectures were always well organized and insightful. He added historical content to the material placing advances in molecular biology sometimes in to a societal context. He is a very approachable lectuer, always ready to answer. Exam hard!",1
"Horrible teacher. Required us to write a 14 page family history paper and graded them poorly if our families were not interesting enough. Even if you memorize the notes word for word, you still wont receive an a or b on any exam. Don't bother going to his grader for help either because that is a huge waste of time. Also hollers in class.",0
"I took Garren for Math 220 which is already a difficult class. When sitting in lecture I felt like I was understanding the material, but the Webwork & SPSS left me more confused, and the tests were extremely hard, even though I did all of the textbook homework. Overall he's adorable, but this class felt impossible.",1
"Professor Chen is incredibly intelligent and has extremely well-planned classes. Lectures are optional (aside from a few, but he tells you when these are). Attending lectures can fully replace the textbook reading (I hardly read), and Chen really understands what he's teaching. Assignments don't take too much time, and tests are open book.",1
"She seems nice enough, but her classes are amongst the most boring I've attended. I never leave with the feeling of having learned anything. She spends most of her lectures asking students to talk between themselves before she writes their answers on the board and her voice can be distracting as it sometimes cracks and comes out squeaky.",0
"Thoroughly enjoyable class.  An elective, but highly recommended.",1
"Very Hard! He goes on the material really fast. He has no office hours. TA is only available for 1 h/wk. The tutors are so expensive (40$/h). The assignment language is difficult to understand. The prerequisites for the course are calculus and algebra with (recommended) knowledge of MATLAB, but the actual course needs way more knowledge than this!!",0
"Dr. Devenyi is a great person, but an iffy professor. Attendance is not mandatory, but if you skip, you might as well drop it. All his grades are based on exams (usually 5 of them) and the lab (30%). Get ready to go through the textbook. He assigns a bundle of problems, again not mandatory, but you won't pass if you don't practice. Very hard class!",1
"He teaches the whole class at the same level, which is more advanced than the average. If you ask a question, he doesn't change his answer, he just repeats the same confusing thing. Not helpful for office hours. I lived at the tutoring center. Don't take him. There are many other professors who do a better job than he does.",0
"He's so loud, eugh. He gives you 2 or 3 abstract assignments with no clear directions. If you're a novice Adobe user, good luck, pal! He won't go over the programs much in class, & def. won't teach you. Whenever we had class (he canceled a lot) he would just go on rants. (not useful!) Pro Tip: When he critiques, don't talk back. It can get uglyy.",0
"Lectures are not organized, attendance is pointless. Matt is a super cool TA & person in general, only reason I liked the class. Texts give you a little knowledge, but nothing crucial. Not necessary really to purchase all, yet I did use Native Voices as a source for my final paper. A couple short analysis papers on text & 8-10 pg final paper.",0
Professor Mitra is a very rude professor. He will not help you at all. His lectures are unorganized and all over the place. His ASSessments are also very hard.,0
"This guy is awful. 100 level classes are intended to spur interest in a subject, perhaps even teach a few core concepts. Instead Charles teaches this class as if it is a graduate level course, expecting not a surface level understanding, but rather an in depth (even philosophical) comprehension of everything. Horrible, avoid unless you hate your gp",0
"She's very rude to her student and talks to them like we're all kids. Almost everyday she come to teach with an attitude and makes rude sarcastic remarks to the class. Need to go to the bathroom? You'll get told you move too much. Want to blow your nose? Don't you'll be ""too loud"". I've never had a teacher be so rude and uncaring than walling.",0
poor.,0
"Exams every two weeks.  To me a very interesting subject, and a good teacher.  Go to class, and keep up on reading and it's not hard.",1
"Although he is very nice and knowledgeable, he is not organized in his lectures and he has a syllabus with assignment dates but doesn't follow it. A lot of quizzes over readings,but readings are fairly interesting. He would be a great professor if he had organization,its hard to keep up with someone that does not have a clear path.",0
"One of the best professors I've ever had. Very helpful in office hours, leaves time in class for questions, and a fair grades. The material is manageable but you have to really learn the material in order to get an A in the course.",1
Class is tough because there's so much information but she's crazy smart and explains it very clearly. READ YOUR TEXTBOOK!! Tests are tough but very straightforward with top marks if you can repeat her lectures verbatim. Has some amusing stories to augment the class. Do not fall behind in this class or you will never catch up...so make sure you go!,1
"This is by far my hardest class, he makes it very unclear on what you need to know. Exams are near impossible and there is a ton of them",0
"Kind of disappointed by the rate my professor when I first enrolled for this class. This class wouldn't let anyone of us breathe. Each week we had a discussion, 2-3 activities, 4 hw assignments, 10 pages of modules to read, 2-3 hours worth of video notes to watch and fill in, 4-5 quizzes, 4 exams throughout the semester, and a project. GL.",0
"Good prof, who is always helpful. Is willing to go the extra mile to help students. Will often give extra information (like exam hints!!), in class. Doesn't like answering the same question 4 times in the same 20 minute period... I can see why he gets grouchy!",1
"Professor Lockett is a very interesting teacher, she has a fun personality and provides thought-provoking assignments. She provides multitudes of extra credit and as long as you pay attention and do the work you shouldn't even need it. I was very engaged in this class and feel that it has been my favorite class I've taken so far in college.",1
Will get bored REAL QUICK. If you want a easy teacher I suggest not to take. Assignments be extra.,1
I took Alisa for math 108 and from the very beginning found her very hard to stay interested.  She was very monitone.  She also rarely worked problems on the board unless asked.  I went from 2 prior classes with an A to having to withdraw from her class.  I would NEVER recommend her to anyone.  She is super nice though but that's all I can say.,0
"Wasn't a big fan of Fetter.  His class consists of asking questions and watching Panoptos out of class, not the way I like to learn.  Quizzes and tests are lengthy and hard.  Likes students who ask questions and seem interested.  Doesn't really go off grading scale and curves, but class is difficult.  Go to review sessions and go to class.",0
Just about the worst professor Ive had. He only grades on 4 exams and attendance (only 5 times through the entire semester/ so if youre not there one day youre out of luck). Hes rude and has offended me and my classmates multiple times. He makes a hard classes even harder. Do not recommend whatsoever.,0
"He's a great professor. He lectures in a very easy-to-understand way, and he's quite knowledgeable in his field. The lectures are enjoyable to go to, and the class is easy enough to do well in if you go to lecture. He assigns reading, but it's not crucial (although quite helpful).",1
"He is so sweet and loves teaching! The only thing that sucks is the length of the class, it would be much better if it was a couple times a week instead of one night, he usually cuts it short though. This class is easy if you go to class and pay attention the entire time! He talks quickly but is passionate about everything! Read the articles!!",1
"If you go to class and take notes, you will be fine.  She may not be completely clear all the time, but in all honesty she is one of my favorite professors I have had at Marquette. She isn't too lecture heavy as she lets the students lead the class through discussion. Be sure to do the readings- or at least skim over them the night before.",1
"Excellent professor, the only class this semester I enjoyed. Just make sure you don't miss any of his class because you will fall behind. His notes are the key to get a A in his class, so make sure your never late to his class because sometime he write too fast and erase very important notes on the board to write more. Also no cheat sheet in exam.",1
"ASL is a hard language to learn but with Cheryl it was very easy. She is very knowledgeable of what signs are used around this area. She makes class comfortable, organized, and fun. She cares that you are retaining what you are learning and wants you to succeed. I will definitely take the second AMSL course. If you need an elective take this class!",1
"Part time  professor and he has own business during daytime. he just graduated from school only few years, it is almost impossible to reach him outside of the class. doesn't reply email until last minute, text message either. his project and assignments are unclear sometimes. if you take his class, ask him questions right after class.",0
"I'm not very good with science, but his test are over what he teaches in lecture. Many people drop after he mentions that he only has five test and each with five short answer questions. He is very lenient on grading your answers as long as you get the generally idea of what he is asking.",1
Bettina is amazing. I loved her class and I think that it should be mandatory for the whole school. Her lectures are amazing. she provides historical context to all of the current issues. She is also very funny and tells stories about her own life that are relevant to class. She opened my eyes to the meaning of intersectionality.  I love her!!,1
She cancels class sometimes due to a medical condition but I loved that. She takes a little while to grade things and gives an M or C. Her assignments are not too bad and I never really had that much homework which I was grateful for. A super nice lady who gives great feedback on papers.,1
"This woman is the most positive person alive and it's contagious. Also, she'll help you rationalize any horrible thing you do in your life. She's so much fun and she made me actually look forward to Monday classes.",1
Makes the class an actual seminar instead of another humanities elective. He is great at leading class discussions and makes the course interesting. He is a tough grader and there is a large amount of reading but I would still take him again.,1
"I LOVE Dr. McKim. She's honestly one of my favourite profs in the English department. She makes her expectations very clear, and she is always willing to help (even if it's through an email at 2am). She's also very understanding for extensions. I would take every one of her classes if I could.",1
"Prof. Harkins is hard to like right away, but he grows on you. Expect to read the book several times a week and make time for the assigned homework, because although its not too much, it takes some time to finish. He is hard on grammar, spelling, and punctuation in essays. Overall, he is helpful and is there if you need him. ",1
She gives super helpful feedback on EVERYTHING assigned. Will respond to emails usually in under 30 minutes and will reach out if she senses you are struggling or having a bad day. She speaks Spanish clearly and we did lots of practice with the vocabulary and grammar. I felt prepared for tests and knew exactly what to expect. LOVE HER!,1
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! I thought calc in high school was really easy and math is my major but now i might be switching because of this class. I dont even know if i will pass.,0
"Johnson is an educated English teacher. She knows what she is talking about but doesn't really give helpful feedback, it's more like she is just telling you what you did wrong and won't help you how to fix it. We wrote a lot essays; the research and argumentative ones wear the hardest. The presentation wasn't so hard to do however.",0
"Brunelle is a lackluster advisor, but a terrible professor.  She spends the bulk of the class time telling us why the class is so great, when in reality it has no bearing on the real world.  She doesn't listen to your questions, just answers what she thinks you said.  Very dissatisfying experience, my worst at ODU so far.",0
"Worst class I've taken at SJSU. Do NOT take this class if you're not a Journalism major. I cannot tell you how preachy and rude he is (especially to this one student in my class). His expectations are really high for a ""beginning "" Journalism class. This class has destroyed my interest in Journalism.",0
"such a good prof. 3 papers no test, no quizzes. participate and write decent papers you will do just fine. easy 4.0. DO TAKE",1
"If you watch his lectures and actually pay attention, youre set. I say that bc there are embedded questions in his lectures. He is such a sweet man and this class is an easy A.",1
"Hardest grader I have ever had. She is impossible to please. I was always afraid to ask questions in class because she would make fun of people in front of everyone. Lectures were extremely dull and they were followed up by a ton of reading for homework. Overall, worse professor Ive had so far. Would never take again.",0
Terrible professor doesn't teach anything during lectures and definitely do not need to show up to class. She expects us to learn from the 200+pages of reading she assigns per week as if we do not have any other classes to worry about. I would not take her course again.,0
I would take his class again. He makes you interested in what he is teaching. Be prepared to write lots and lots of notes. Make sure when he tells his corny jokes to laugh and make it seem real. Even when they are not that funny. Overall he was a great teacher.,1
Take him if you like mean person. He is the meanest pro I've ever had. He doesn't care about you at all. He is always right. Don't try to argue with him because you are always wrong.,0
"Such a rude lady!! She cuts people off when speaking, has no patience. Treats the class like a 9th grade hs class. So boring just talks and talks! Acts like it's not a college class. Very rude personality do not take ",0
"It is not difficult to get an A, but you must do a lot of work. 500word minimum discussion posts each week with the information usually in the chapter. A midterm and final which are 5 discussion posts in one and a 5-7 page paper. Do the work, you'll get an A, I got a 101 in the class.",1
"She is tough on people but it's usually well deserved. If you pay attention and actually try, it is a very easy A. You need to read because she has quizzes on the reading assignments. She gives very good feedback on your papers as well, and if she likes something she will make a positive note about it. She also talks about her personal life a lot.",1
"I would definitely take Schaefer again. He's funny, he showed us Monty Python clips in class and he puts Calvin and Hobbes comics on the quizzes. In terms of difficulty the quizzes are relatively easy if you read the chapter, but the exams you need to study for. He does review sessions before the exams which, with notes, can mean a good grade. ",1
"One of the worst professors I've ever had. Lectures consist of him almost verbatim reading his ""notes"", which are plain text files and incredibly unhelpful. We were assigned projects every weekend which were very vague, providing ""hints"" of how we were meant to get started. In online discussion, he is condescending and often chides students.",0
His lectures are very interesting and give real life examples. Read the notes and take notes during his lectures! Tests are essay questions so be sure to use key words.,1
Professor Cheslik talks way too much. I took his COM200 class that was 3 hours and 45 minutes long. He repeats himself over and over again. He distracts us by telling anecdotes. It is a very tiring class. Only take him if you're comfortable sitting still on a Zoom meeting WITH UR CAMERA ON the whole time while listening to his rambles.,0
"This has to be one of the worst professors I have ever had. I'm sure he hasn't always been this way, considering he is practically 90 years old. I showed up to class every day and I don't know why. It was a waste of fifty minutes every class period, due to incoherent mumbling. Avoid him at all costs. You will save your gpa and sanity.",0
"Very off topic, and jumpy through lectures. His expectations when marking exams and essays are totally different then what was told by TA's. He marks one piece of work by everyone.",0
Mr. Lee's teaching material is dictated by the department head. He is very knowledgeable but limited by the material allowed by the department. Nice guy.,1
"This prof is a little scatterbrained but her enthusiam shines through her lecture, especially when we learned about fungi and protists and diatoms. She is a so-so prof, in the sense that you will either love her or hate her for her teaching style. Her midterms and finals were easy but it will still take a decent amount of effort from you.",1
"Professor Clarke is seriously so sweet! She sends you motivational 'wisdom of words' each week and has a clear grading scale. Not difficult whatsoever, but make sure to complete her Application Exercises (make sure to read a little about the topic). Tests are easy A-B range, I'm taking her again!",1
"He turns his back to you for the majority of the lectures and speaks relatively quietly, making it very difficult to learn. He was also extremely dull, making it even more difficult to understand what he is saying. I was forced to learn the majority of the subjects on my own via Youtube and the math help centre. Overall, don't recommend.",0
Horrible!! Worst attitude ever!!,0
"While this prof no doubt is extremely knowledgable in his area of expertise, it seems Dr. Howell has been teaching so long that he seems unhappy with the regular result. He seems unimpressed at things he has seen before, and isnt very warm to a challenge. Although, he is extremely intelligent in what he teaches. Personally I wouldnt take again.",0
Really good guy which is too bad because he has no idea how to teach a class. Lectures are extremely boring and too much time is spent on unimportant material. Tests always have surprises and focus on insignificant details instead of comprehension of the important concepts. Easily the worst business class I have taken. Avoid at all cost.,0
UI100 Britain + the Brits... favorite class of the semester! He is easy going and incredibly entertaining. :),1
"Interesting lectures, keeps you engaged, nice teacher. Along with this class is a clinical experience which takes up a lot of time, but he is very clear with expectations. No way to get around it, I'd take him again if I had to.",1
"Very good teaching,I decide to take his MTH 208 too. Helpful and know how to teach MTH. You will study a lot if your attendence is ...",1
I'd select all good tags if I could but I only get 3. By far the best professor I've had at Eastern. His classes are clear and straight forward. You will always know what you need to do and when. He is always available if you need help and gives good advice. Great for professor and if you need an adviser. Super nice guy.,1
"I don't know why there is no grades higher than B in her class. If you want to fail this class, go take hers!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
"Good class. Used online textbook, no hard copy needed. Pretty easy math class. Very applicable information.",1
Avoid at all cost. Very distant and disorganized.,0
Good professor but not much for class work. If you read the articles and do great on the quizzes you will be fine. Also be sure to do assigned papers.,1
Her lectures are long and tedious and because you are only graded on your 2 or 3 tests if you don't memorize every single detail of each piece you won't do well in her class,0
"He's kind of funny, but most people just seem annoyed with his humor. He calls us ""people"" all the time, and makes weird noises when he speaks. Some days I would get lost in counting the time he said ""people, if you dont' know this by now, then..."" and I would completely miss out on the material. Really knows his stuff though",0
Dr. Riffe is the professor you want. She breaks the class material down and sets clear expectations for homework and exams. She is easily the most caring professor I have ever had. Take Dr. Riffe if you want to learn and have fun while learning.,1
Incredible professor. Gives great feedback and direction on how to improve. Hilarious and very easy to talk with. Will set you up with great connections for internships and future opportunities. Classes provide assignments that will push you. Gives generous amounts of time to complete each project. Best professor I've ever had.,1
"She is not a good teacher. She came to class and gave us ppt, then just 's for her class. She do knows much about statisitics, but she does not know how to teacher.She is not helpful at all.",0
This class is very lecture heavy. It is impossible to retain all the information given. Each exam is on approximately 10 units with 20 slides each. Additionally he is a very tough grader. DO NOT TAKE unless you absolutely have to.,0
Her class is a breeze. It's an Easy A. She's a chill teacher who enjoys discussion with her classes. We talk about what's happening in the business world and in world news. The homework is extremely easy. Most tests are open book -online on Blackboard. The Final is a project highlighting a publicly traded business. Just study for the Midterm exam.,1
"Professor Liberatore is the best. Prior to taking her class, I was unfamiliar with how to form a strong and arguable thesis. However, she changed that by explaining in detail about the ""They Say, I Say"" format. This class consists of: the discipline analysis project, in class quizzes, homework assignments, and a 5-6 page paper about an issue.",1
"Hey, look, if you want to take a class that feels like you're learning in the pre-internet world, if you think your peers are ""sheltered"" millennials and Gen-Xers, take his classes. If you want to read outdated, irrelevant texts and analyze them through the lens of a middle-class white man. By all means, please do. Not a modern class.",0
"You either take his point of view or you won't do well.  This man is the representation of what is wrong with tenure.  He sits around promoting his own ideals and will just laugh in your face if you believe otherwise.  Even if you do agree with his opinions, the class is rather boring and so you may not like it either. Strongly advised to avoid!",0
She is fun in lecture but speaks fast and if you don't write everything down you will miss stuff for the test. Her powerpoints have little information on them and the tests are much harder than she makes it seem. Her class is too specific and challenging for a 100 level class. She does weight the tests and homework the same though.,0
"One of my favorite teacher Ive had. He Deeply cares for his students by taking the time to meet with them to help with either class work or personal issues. No matter what is going on, he takes the time to pray and go through Gods word with you. Last, but not least, he is an excellent instructor. He sticks to his word and follows through as pro.",1
"Dr. Galbraith is an awesome prof, and I would recommend her to anyone. She loves seeing her students succeed, while encouraging them to think for themselves. Her use of RTTP games gets students engaged in and thinking critically about history. She assigns  a variety of interesting, pertinent readings. She is a great lady, and a dedicated educator.",1
he is a very good professor. you just have to put a lot of work into it. explains the material very well. if you ask questions he will answer you.,1
This boy sure knows how to drive a point home. The best dude at MMC,1
Professor Campbell provided scant feedback and is not open to others' interpretations - quite closed-minded. Not helpful during office hours and is quite condensing as a TA - she dominated the entire seminar and berated students' opinions. Does not want you to succeed. It baffles mean that she is still teaching. Absolutely awful.,0
"Mr. Daley is one of my favorite teachers at MCC. He is very knowledgeable about his subject, makes his classes very interesting with his examples and stories and he has a very easy and effective grading system. I would definitely recommend taking economics with him.",1
Loved good ole moulds,1
"Extremely pretentious and uninspiring. If you don't worship the French culture and think art is the only reason to live, she will probably inadvertently insult you, and you will feel miserable in the class.",0
"He is a very hard grader. Take this class if you want to learn, but honestly this class is similar to classes at a UC. Very intelligent professor, but it might hurt your gpa. Luckily, we can afford to learn and let our gpa drop a little when we're at CC. ",0
Demands alot but knows the information and cares. Tests are not easy but the class was rewarding in the long run.,1
SHE IS ABSOLUTELY AWFUL! DOESNT EXPLAIN ANYTHING AND IS ALL OVER THE PLACE!  She is very intelligent but you cant really comprehend what she is talking about! DO NOT HAVE HER AS A PROFESSOR!,0
"So great. I loved watching her train of thought and went out of my way to take another class with her this semester. Youtube her, if you really want to know. She's on there.",1
"Mr. Wisla is a great PR professional with a lot of real world experience, so if you're looking for advice he is a great source. He assigns a large group project that is a lot of work but as long as you do the readings to be prepared for attendance quizzes and complete homework assignments you will be fine.",1
"Goes off on many unnecessary abstract tangents and rambles for 2/3 of the lecture making it very hard to focus since 1005 is already quite elementary. Notes have such poor format and lack of explanations, its SURPRISING he's been teaching this specific course for so long. Doesn't reply to emails. Get ready to learn from the ThinkPython textbook.",0
"If you love arrogance, you hit the jackpot",1
"Did not know what this course was about. He teaches too fast and crams a lot into one day. He doesnt stay on one subject too long, which is why I struggled. I would not take a course like this again:",0
Dana most laziest teacher ever at GRCC. This dude will literally finish a class objective in like less than 15 mins. He just flys through every question thinking students understand perfect. Hell usually just zone out for 5 mins and do the problem without saying a single word and at the end say yall get it. Easy A though but dont take this guy,0
"East Asian History with Hon was an amazing class. He truly loves the subject that he is teaching and is excited to be there. His tests are a bit difficult but the class is totally worth it. He is a bit of a tough grader. If you need to take a modern history class, take this one.",1
"Not the best prof. No need to show up for lectures. He just records himself reading off of the slides and posts it. Slides are not detailed. Midterms were average. Final was brutal. Self study is the key. But, he was very caring and accommodating during the 2018 CUPE 3903 strike which was appreciated. But, I wouldn't take a class with him again.",0
she's full of herself.,0
"I thought she was awesome. She's hilarious, has been teaching for multiple years, and she has actual experience in her field in the real world. Make sure to attend every class because if you miss one you may struggle to get back. You're supposed to read the textbook but as long as you are their for notes in class, you'll be fine. Exams aren't hard.",1
"HE IS A GREAT PERSON! HE IS AMAZING, I RESPECT HIM SO MUCH! TAKE HIS CLASS, YOU WILL NEVER REGRET!",1
"He knows his content but, in terms of delivery, it is very poor. His English is not the problem but his accent is hard to decipher. Combined with that he has strict policies like mandatory lab attendance, huge weightage on the final exam(60%), and no recordings of lectures. The exam isn't too bad if you have used the textbook and YouTube videos.",0
Jeanne is an average prof. Her classes are generally interesting but get ready to read a whole lot more than any other class you're taking. You can tell she's been in the field for a while since she knows what she's talking about.,1
Do not take this class unless you already have a good understanding of the Catholic Church in the first place! He assigns around 10-20 pages per week to read and then gives a 5-min. quiz with 5 questions over these 20 pages. If Theo isn't your thing and your just looking to pass the course for your core then save your GPA and take another prof.,0
Dr. Bulinski is very smart and cares about her students. Her lectures are fun and she's very engaging. We went on field trips that were very fun as well. She's a great professor and easy to work with outside of class too,1
Rick Is by far the most relaxed professor I have had so far in my time hear.He is the type of guy that you could just hang out with and knock a few back. Cool dude and fun course.,1
Such an amaizing teacher.,1
Weekly quizzes which made what to expect on exams pretty clear. Focused on case studies and examples which made it way easier too learn. Dunn really knows his stuff and is a great teacher.,1
"Excellent teacher - seems to know the material well. Teaches well but the material moves so rapidly that students are unable to fully understand concepts.  Fails to connect with students because of a rigid attitude he has towards teaching. Tells students not to come to his class if they're even a minute late. ""This is not a hotel, this is my class""",0
she wants all of her students to pass the class but she doesn't really teach. You MUST learn from the online homework or you wont do well in this class but she is  very helpful if you don't understand.,1
Needs to retire,0
"Rambles off onto random topics during lecture, extremely complicated tests. You have to teach yourself Trigonometry pretty much. Expect him to accuse you of cheating, and don't expect to ever hear back from him in emails. His study guides and answer keys for exams consist of page numbers and references to lectures, doesn't actually explain anything",0
"Arrogant.  Does not encourage ideas, but ridicules people who disagree.  easy grader, tests right out of the book.",0
Nice man but the way he teaches is very annoying. Linear Algebra is already hard enough without the professor jumping from topic to topic like he has ADD then messing up after you've written and listened to everything so now you erase all the incorrect information he just gave. Doesn't really explain many things. Just talks at you.,0
"This guy is awesome. Makes pays 140 not as hard as it should be. Tests are what you learn so if you study and do the homework, and A is not hard!",1
"Clearly understands the material well, but regularly berates students. I wouldn't recommend asking him any questions, because he will likely make you feel like an idiot. He is extremely unforgiving, and doesn't seem to care about the students whatsoever. He only uses the textbook for the tables in the back.",0
Erica is an amazing speech professor! Speech can be nervous but she does an amazing job making you feel comfortable. Gives so much extra credit! Material she gives you are easy to follow. I enjoyed speech! Amazing speech professor!,1
"She is the best! The sweetest lady you will ever meet. If you just pay attention, show up, don't break he rules, and do the homework you will get and A. Take her!",1
"Dr. Ryder won an award for being ""best high school band director in the country.""  Well, now I'd say that UT has the best high school band in the SEC.  Being good at high school band does not automatically mean one is good at college band. - Someone needs to park a ryder truck in front of his house and see if he gets the picture.",0
world history gets transformed into african history...still thinks he's being repressed!!!Could not justify why his course was relevant to my education when I asked him.,0
One assignment due per week. Its required to post 4 times on the weekly discussion board. That gets quite annoying especially since she takes off points if you aren't detailed in your posts. Tests aren't bad. Its only required to post certain questions form the homework so you won't have to do them all.,1
"It's a good thing I was able to teach myself this material because she was not able to. She wasn't particularly helpful, her lectures were boring, and she made me not enjoy CS, I had enjoyed it up until then. Honestly she just wasn't a good prof. I understood her but all she ever did was examples, the exam had better just be examples then.",0
"Would not recommend Etoroma. He talks more about his personal life and where he likes to eat than he does Sociology. Has really disorganized slides and is all over the place. If you want to do good in his class learn from the textbook or somewhere else, do not depend on his notes and lectures. Really nice and funny, jokes are better than lecture.",0
"Great Professor! There's not enough of them any more. She kept it simple and made you focus on what was important. If you are not ready to study don't take her class. But she motivates you to want to do well in her class, she is not out to fail you. You earn your grade. Would take her class again any time.",1
"He isnt as bad as people make him out to be but at the same time his in class teaching isnt helpful. Your grades in 3 tests, a final, and homework. I passed by working in the homework until I got a 100 and I took time to learn the material outside of class. I was 1 of 2 people who passed my class",0
"he was AMAZING...can't say enough good things about this man. my mom had him and so did i...take him, you will learn tons.  made me pick history as my major, but no teacher could compare after him.  LOVE HIM!",1
"Really passionate teacher about Emergency Management and knows what he is talking about. Multiple papers throughout the semester. Pop quizzes or participation credit each week. 3 tests throughout the semester that require you to study hardcore; multiple choice, matching, short answer and essays are on the test. Be prepared to study and read!",1
"A nice teacher, very good in his field.",1
"I really like professor Liao. I think he cares about students a lot. Even though some students might perform not as good as expected, he would not give them hard times. His tests are 95-99% similar to his in-class lectures. If you pay attention to his lecture and do homeworks, defnitly you have no problem to ace the test!",1
Okay so Wilson is really a nice guy and cares about what he's teaching but he's not clear with grades and uses a curve so broken that 93s and 94s become B pluses. He's also very bad about responding to emails and the lectures are incredibly boring and dry. Also his quizzes are beyond beyond beyond arbitrary and unless you memorize readings no luck.,0
"Great teacher! Made the history class so interesting. Very straightforward with homework and tests. Papers can be tricky, but he definitely helps you out if you have questions. He loves class participation so be ready to raise your hand.",1
Professor was obviously new but semester got better over time.,1
"It is unfortunate that this professor teaches a class that is required for an undergraduate degree. It does not seem that she understands how to effectively lecture. This hinders the class the most in that even if you come to class, you usually do not gain anything from the lecture.",0
"Hilarious professor! Love him as a person, but not as a professor. Doesn't teach. Every class was not relevant to the homework AT ALL so do HW during class. His accent wasn't bad, but there is a language barrier. If you had a question, he'd try to answer it but you end up more confused than when you started. You'll get an A with YouTube and Chegg.",0
"Mr. Mac is the best.  Earn all the easy points (homework, attendance, lab) and you'll be fine.  Sit in the first three rows so he knows who you are.  Tests are not as bad as everyone says.  My pro-tip (got me an A+) - read the book before coming to lecture.  He moves FAST in lecture, but if you read ahead of time you can just sit back and enjoy.",1
"Considers herself to be ALL KNOWING and if you cross her then you better find yourself a new class to take.  Show up, do your work, keep your mouth shut, and don't tick her off!",0
"Richard Smith is a perfect human, ok thats going too far, but he is my favorite at sfu",1
"Gives an outline each class with underlined terms. On the exam, there will be an essay (100 pts) and 8 ID's  (underlined terms from outlines) & you need to choose 4/8 to elaborate on (100 pts) These 8 ID's could be any of the 40-50 terms from the outlines. Miss notes? you won't have enough info on ID's. Doesnt give any clues which ID's are on exam.",0
"All of Dearing's classes are the same, he's unorganized, he's late to return grades on exams or assignments, he's gives you feedback on your projects a few days to a week before the final submission is due, and there's no hands-on work. And the major project usually has nothing to do with the class. And its true about him being rude and unhelpful. ",0
"Wambsgans is a genuinely nice guy. But his lectures are awful, and he's the only reason this class was hard for me. Doesn't actually specify what you need to know, so I had to read the entire textbook to be ready. His lecture notes are full of typos and chemistry errors, and I could never actually understand anything he said. 0/10 do not recommend",0
"So much reading and memorization for a level 200 course. Quizzes are open book, yet they are built to trick you. The final exam is on all course content which is 15 weeks of slideshows, videos, articles and textbook. Teachers are nice but they don't realize how difficult they made this course especially as an elective. Would not recommend at all.",0
"Yes, everything does relate to Buffy the Vampire Slayer!",0
Not recommended if you do not speak Russian.,1
"I loved taking HKIN 226 with Angie! She is so passionate about what she teaches and she genuinely cares for us students. I would definitely recommend taking one of her classes. I wouldn't suggest assuming that her classes are 'easy.' You definitely need to put the work in if you wish to do well. Overall, this class was very inspiring.",1
"Professor Ziembo-Vogl is an incredibly picky grader. When taking tests, I was more worried about her ridiculous requirements than the actual content of the test. She often took 1-2 weeks to grade assignments, which I thought was excessive. The content covered for the class was valuable but I would not take this professor again.",0
"I was not worried about the class at first as I got an A- for SPA101. But, well... Professor Berardini would made it so that if you got things incorrect of if you were confused, she would make sure everyone knew... She even told me how my SPA101 professor should have been fired and etc. she shows that she wants the students to learn fast though...",0
"Al Marshall is a train wreck of a man. He has hilariously entertaining issues that will be touched on in most of his lectures. It's very easy to derail him with a simple comment. Have fun with the class, have fun with Al, don't take it to seriously he seems to assign grades arbitrarily.",0
"Great teacher, super helpful and really nice. There were a lot of projects but if you followed the rubric then he was a pretty easy grader.",1
"Wonderful instructor, great feedback, very concise and forward, not confusing on any of the homework/instructions for homework or projects.",1
"Excellent history professor! Typical lecture style, but far from boring. If you're looking for an easy A look somewhere else. Her classes and assignments are hard, but SO worth it. Really emphasizes excellence in interpretation and writing, AKA essential skills for the field. Is very accessible outside of class and will help to best of ability",1
"Professor is really rude and hard to communicate with. Grades seem random. We watched movies with no assignments attached to them. Easy A but useless class, didn't learn anything. Great for someone who just wants the credit, doesn't want to learn or do much work. ",1
He doesn't teach you anything. Don't ask questions. Even if he ask if their are questions. He will make an example of you. Read the text book and know all the limits. DO THE PRACTICE TEST.,0
She knows what she's talking about. Sometimes she goes a little too fast but if you tell her she'll slow down. She's there to help if you need her.,1
"The topics are hard. Most things are a bummer! But Angela makes us understand them, even when we don't wan to. One of the best at Stritch.",1
Interesting only when engaged in a discussion.  Lecture is very dry. Good sense of humor. Don't bother following study guide because his tests are off the wall.,1
Worse prof of UW Economics. Lectures were boring but you have to go since he took out the most important part of the slides on LEARN. Tests harder than other section and he never gave any clear instructions. The course was easy but don't expect anything from the prof himself.,0
"This course earned my first C in my 3 year college career.  Teacher would make us do hw and take tests before ever teaching the subject, which she thought was a hot new teaching method, so the only reason to take the class was for the weekly quizzes, because after that you would not learn anything new. Reading the book was the only way to learn.",0
Worst teacher of my college career. Very unresonable and mean. Doesnt use blackboard or any thing online. You have to pick up your tests from his office only during his 2 hour office hours. youll never know your grade if you dont have the time to go get them. Lectures are very monotone with no use of powerpoint. Its just him talking for an hour,0
"quizzes & practice problems aren't like her exams. splits exams into 2 parts- free response one day & mc in ashby another day. teaches 100 miles a min so you basically teach yourself. gives a quiz every 2 classes on a new chapter that have 1-3 questions on it. believes that class avg of C is ""better"" than previous semesters.",1
Very good at explaining things. I'd recommend her if you aren't good at math (I'm not),1
"Excellent prof, know's the subject through and through",1
"She wants her students to succeed and gives very clear guidelines for papers and exams. Cheat sheets for exams, fun and interactive lectures, readings all available online (no textbook to purchase :) ). She is great but hard work and doing the readings are both necessary!",1
"Dr. Freeman wasn't a bad professor by any means, but he took far too long on elementary subjects and taught to the people who've never opened a chem book in their life. If that's you then you will probably like him, but if not then you'll be bored and wishing you could just go do the homework on your own without being stuck in class.",0
Teacher is not approachable and does not like answering questions. The class is very difficult and her style of teaching doe not lend support. I would highly recommend that students avoid taking this class with her.,0
"Ms. Cindy is by far one of the best professors at JMU! Her class is super fun and requires minimal effort. Her class consists of lots of fun experiments to help prepare you for teaching young students about chemistry and physics. As someone who never liked either subject before, Ms. Cindy made me find enjoyment in them!",1
I just took Dr. Ingram's History of Interwar Europe. The readings are essential for the pop quizzes and for understanding the lectures. He goes into detail and will not clarify unless you ask for it. Very passionate for his subject and will give help if asked for. Also a fan of the long aside. He likes participation so come to class fed and rested.,1
too subjective of a grader,1
I love this man. Hes amazing. A real gem.,1
"Awful professor. Speaks too fast, makes mistakes on what he says. I literally have to watch his lectures backwards to take my notes, because he changes things and mis speaks so often. He allows his phone to ring while recording, and doesn't do anything about it. At least once a week it rings. He doesn't answer the problems he goes over.",0
"Cregger is a hit or miss. He's a decent individual, but you will spend hours upon hours doing meaningless labs. Few labs are actually worth doing. I honestly didnt learn from him in this class. I taught myself more than he taught me anything for the whole semester. Also he doesn't read your emails if you don't follow his ""email etiquette"".",0
One of the best profs i had,1
"This was honestly the worst class I have ever taken and it has nothing to do with the course itself. The lectures were great but often times the professor would cancel the class last minute, change assignments or just never grade your exams. I, as well as many others, still don't have a grade for my last semester from him. It's almost February. ",0
she is a really intelligent person who talks about a lot of interesting stuff  but for a course it's super inconsistent and I felt really lost all the time. because there are no slides given the textbook really helped me actually have something to follow. ,0
"I enjoyed this class with Trevor. I wouldn't say ""speech"" is my favorite class but he made it fun. Chill dude. Take him if you can. Graded on what you would expect. Various speeches, critiques, and participation.",1
Will never take a class from him again. One of the most arrogant and stubborn professors I have ever met.,0
"Very clear and organization. Take Tabea's class if you actually want to learn something. Do not use your phone/laptop in class, and participate as much as possible. Super knowledgeable, accessible, and cares about your success. This class was the most ""worth my money"" course I've ever taken.",1
"He was one of the hardest professors I've ever had, but it was worth it. I gained a lot of knowledge from taking this class. The class grade is based off one midterm and the final. I failed the midterm, but still ended up getting a B+ in the class.",1
"Randy is an awful professor, avoid if possible. Randy refuses to use basic technology even to simply post his syllabus online, took forever to respond to anything electronic, and his tests are very difficult and not clear.",0
He teaches off of power points that are very confusing and is very arrogant...I understand u make 85k a year but your ego hinders you from helping students succeed.,0
"This was the most backwards, delusional, flat out awful class I have ever taken at GVSU. Mel might be the most confusing man I have ever met in my entire life. I would not recommend taking this class unless you enjoy having no clear direction with the task at hand and you like to sit through a 3 hour lab that could be finished in 5 minutes.",0
"Took this class fall 2017, its like a free credit class. 3 projects. just listen to her talk can use phone, laptop, do hw do we. you want in class, just be quiet. let her do her work, and you do yours lol. Basically show up and pass, sign in and just do 3 projects. DO NOT BUY TEXT BOOKS never used them/ financial mistake",1
You cannot pass!,0
"Prof. Yezer is a great guy, and the Economics of Crime will teach you how to do a problen without thinking about it (you heard me correctly). Always read his lecture slides after class and you'll do fine. Don't listen to any other reviewer, trust me, he is very approachable if you have questions and you will learn a lot.",1
"Professor Melzer's class starts off slow the beginning of the semester and at first, I wasn't a fan of the class, but as it went on, it becomes much more enjoyable. He is extremely knowledgable about what he teaches and has his own flair to it. It was definitely one of the top 3 professors I have had at MSU hands down.",1
"Don't take Dr. Simkins if you want to just get by and check a core req off the list. He is highly knowledgeable and highly respected within the field. His work is amazing, and I have learned a lot from him. I really struggled at first, but he was fantastic in office hours and really helped me along. Highly recommended if you want to learn.",1
"This class was a podium for him to spit his political views out. We actually got told that fantasy football is a construct to keep the white man in power over the black man. Don't be fooled by the name of the class, this has very little to do with sports themselves. The second half of this class is an attack on corporate America and how to ""resist""",0
"Class is challenging and although he's a nice guy, teaches as if you already are an expert in the subject. Moves quickly and not the best lecturer, but study hard and you can do well. Textbook not needed",1
"This class was hard. He was a very hypercritical grader. I would often go in to office hours because he didnt answer his emails in a timely manner, and he would critique my assignment and if i went in again and ask for help after i had fixed my mistakes he would go in and make more confusing critiques. Hard grader. Heavy lecturer. And a bit werid.",0
"He is very nice. Really likes class participation, presentations and papers, but is a very fair grader. I really enjoyed how passionate he was about the subject (John Milton). He is also caring and wants to see the student succeed. Overall definitely recommend, but be prepared to participate",1
Not a fan of this professor. He is inexperienced and therefore doesn't teach the material clearly. He constantly makes mistakes and confuses himself and the class. Doesn't really adequately prepare the class for the homework or tests either. I also asked for help with part of the project and he was rude and unhelpful with his response.    ,0
I would avoid him at all costs. He lectures to essentially anyone in the front rows and he asks questions to the class as part of the teaching itself leaving everybody else to a disadvantage when we cannot hear the answer. Its as if the class is taught by students as much as it is by the professor.,0
Prof. Dyer is quite a character... be prepared to get bombarded with Simpson references all semester long. Lectures are useless- he always goes on tangents and doesn't explain much of the content. It was super frustrating that the class required iClickers because you'd be forced to sit through 80 minutes of rambling to get the participation points,0
Amazing professor. This man actually cares about his students. He accepts all opinions and has very interesting things to say. Death and Dying was one of the most memorable and interesting classes i've ever taken. Some of the things that Prof McLaughlin said changed my life. Thank you,1
"Do not take him. Impossible to get an A. I had a 4.o (took way harder classes) yet his grading is so unnecessarily tough. He is kind of rude, and if you don't remember a specific detail about a chapter, you get a minus. Tests are 100 questions, if you don't get a 92 on every exam, you're A is gone. Each test is 25% of grade. Do the math.  ",0
people swear like this class is so hard but its not. Does it require you to read a very boring textbook? yes. Are the lectures boring? yes. But if you read the book the night before and use her lectures as outlines you're golden. This class is pretty stress free. Barely put effort into it and have an A+. Very boring but easy A. Grades paper easy!,1
"For his theo 103 class, just make sure you read and take notes in class because all of the quizzes are online and are based on the notes you take in class. He also is a really nice guy and offers extra credit. Do all of this and you will get an A.",1
"He will hold a grudge if he disagrees with your views. 90% of what is taught in class really did not pertain to the entertainment industry today. Was not prepared for class, and when I went to his office hours for help he brushed me off saying, ?You need to go research this more.? I had to go to another professor to help me work though the problem.",0
Can't understand what he says.  He explains for 15 minutes and then makes you do work for the the rest of class.  Really pointless course to take towards your MBA.  You work on programs that are never used in the work place.,0
This guy is awesome. He gets straight to the point and expect you to do the same with your writing. Class usually does not go the full time. The book list for the course is pretty cool too. I recommend this guy for those who need this writing class for graduation!!!,1
Need to read the book and go to class/take notes - but a 4.0 isn't too hard if you do these things.,1
"There are a lot of dense readings, but the lectures and content are very engaging, and he knows so much about the subject matter. He is open to answering questions and always available to meet. There are four short essays, but he makes expectations clear. Each class period there is a chance for a quiz based on a coin flip, so always be prepared!",1
LOVED him. He is awesome he just wants his students to succeed. I love him and have taken all my classes through him. Way to be the BEST trower!,1
Professor Lecker is someone who clearly knows what he is talking about from a professor's point of view. If you are not an English major you will find yourself being utterly confused and frustrated in this class. He isn't very approachable nor does he try to aid the student's understanding. When it comes to exams he is very vague.,1
"Hes a raging conservative, but hes really funny and pretty cool. just cut through his slant and the info is all there.",1
"Kim is a nice and down to earth guy BUT he never answers emails, he confuses himself when he talks, and he goes through the lecture so fast. The class is a teach yourself course and half online. There are three tests, 10 connect HWs (one extra credit), and different assignments here and there.",0
"Honestly, the exams are stupid, the curves sometimes screws you over. No extra credit available. Don't buy the book",0
Ian is brilliant! He knows so much about everything and isn't afraid to digress from lecture material if he finds it helpful for his student's understanding of a specific text. Definitely be prepared to read all of the 6 plays and have them finished the day he begins to teach them. I would talk another course with him.,1
"Horrible, don't even know why he is the only acct 102 professor. Does not help you in any kind of way and just expects you to know it and if you don't then tough. Wish there were other professors teaching this course so i could have switched... now I'm stuck with him and he is useless. He doesn't teach and doesn't explain anything.",0
One of the best professors Ive had here at GRCC! Highly recommend her!,1
"One of the best professors I have ever had... Mark's lectures are engaging, entertaining, and extremely informative! Throughout my time at TRU, I can say that Mark is by far one of the best professors there. Even though he gives out a lot of homework and readings (stay on top..) compared to other profs, he appreciates students who put in effort.",1
"Really cool guy, interesting lectures. Very difficult class, project was the hardest I've ever done so far. Would avoid if you have never taken quantitative/qualitative methods, or don't care for politics.",1
"By far one of the best professor I have encountered in my academic career.  The benefits of her class are endless but be prepared to work hard and for many hour per day...the rewards of working hard in this class are both endless and fulfilling, she alos never lets you get stressed or overwhelmed if you take her guidance",1
I loved this class. She does have an accent but is overall easy to understand. You can pass the tests just by going to class and following along with the powerpoints. She gives a lot of real life examples that make things much easier to understand. My first marketing class and I truly enjoyed it. ,1
"She has decent PDF files though I did not learn anything from her. I had to teach my self the course. Very hard tests, not enough time to go through the problems. Also, she gives multiple questions and T/F questions which are ridiculously hard and confusing. The final was extremely hard. She does not give a lot of examples. Bottom line AVOID HER",0
"Bad professor, and he do not know what he needs, and you can not take any outside sources because he considered it as zero.",0
"Dont bother buying the textbook-- you will never use it. Bring something to do to stay awake in class. He gives the midterm/final essay questions beforehand, so just study that. He doesnt really give A's though, so stay away if thats what you're looking for!",0
"easy, but he is kind of uptight. he isn't as smart as he thinks he is (he took the directional derivative of a curve, but there is only one direction for a curve). he also can't integrate imo. arragont and mediocre. some of the positive comments are done by him btw, (he admitted this in class)",0
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS: -never posted grades until the week of finals -very poor communication -rude with students -vague instructions for assignments -self-taught class -posted assignments a couple days/the day before they were due and didn't extend the due dates -not flexible or understanding -no rubric for the final,0
"Such a nice guy and a very enthusiastic professor. Two test, three papers, and a final, but participation is counted. If you show effort and try you'll be set. ",1
"As others have stated, there are rediculous amounts of work for what you will get out of it.  It is hard to teach something that you have never been involved in.  Much of the material we went over was not relavent, plus outdated.  EM majors must take him so don't waste your time with a EM major. Both classes were a waste.",0
"She seems like a sweetheart but this class was a mess. She spoke so softly in class I could never hear her and let student talk over her constantly making it impossible to follow. When class went virtual she didnt even try to use zoom and just posted her lectures with audio, most of which didnt work. Assignments were simple but tests were tricky",0
"Absolutely impossible to work with. She doesn't care about her students and I am still baffled at my experience. I love lecture heavy courses and she just ruined it for me. I wouldn't wish this class on anyone, please do not take this course. If for some reason you have to, keep your head down and just get through it. Good luck.",0
Horrible is the only way to describe her. She does not respond to emails and the assignments make absolutely no sense.,0
"He is way too into the subject which makes the class more difficult. He wants everyone to enjoy the class as much as he does, which is very difficult considering many people take this class as a pre-requisite as an easier math class. He does not use the book except for maybe one or two assignments. Tests are not like study guide. Would not recomm.",0
21. Which of the following [b]statements[/b] is/are least untrue? a) Dr. Lai's class is easy.  b) Laboratories are not tremendously difficult.  c) Dr. Lai's class is [b]somewhat[/b] boring.   d) all of the above.  e)  a) and c) only.,1
"Dr. Rokicky is a sweetheart. She is flexible and understanding and keeps it positive! I learned a ton in her blended learning Native American History class. She is very fair and helpful, and keeps to the textbook/power points. The textbook and her study guides can be a little willy nilly, but she is passionate and knowledgeable about her specialty!",1
the teacher and the books is good for insomnia not real for the real world,0
"So apparently he screwed over the last semester's ITM207 class and I was faced with either him or Dong. He is the better of the two prof's but not much. His lectures are pretty dull but they contain the information needed to do well in the course(he tries to be funny, A for effort I guess). The course itself was good easy A. Project was long though",0
"I have never had a more confusing professor. Before his class I got straight A's. He lectures next to none, expects you to read and teach yourself, and quizzes you on things he never went over. He spends a great deal of time expounding on his foreign language skills, his revered teaching methods, and little time actually teaching. Take anybody else",0
Awsome experience.,1
Guido genuinely cares about his students and it shows. If you're willing to put in the work and study the material he wants you to do well. Seriously loved this man. The class was at 8am but it didn't even matter (I am NOT an am person). He allows 2 absences but it truly helps when you go to class. The lectures were very well organized and clear.,1
The flip classroom structure that McNally created is absolutely the worst - nobody goes to class because NOTHING is taught in class. He does not seem to care whatsoever about teaching students and being helpful. Word of advice for Laurier - scrap the flip classroom .... it doesnt work.,0
"Dont take fundementals of Athletic Training with this man!!!! he is boring, dull, and is unfair with is grading system.  the whole class is on a 100 pt scale, with 4 short answer exams 6 2PT pop quizzes, and 10 1/2 pt labs.DONT TAKE HIM!!!!",0
I learn more by watching you tube videos and going to tutoring than taking this class. This teacher will rather read the newspaper than nicely help her students. By far the worst teacher I have came across.,0
"Professor Griffis is the best science teacher I've ever had! I've been afraid of science courses since high school, but he truly helped me understand biology. His notes are very clear, and the tests are pretty word-for-word, and when there is a question that's obvious, he makes the wrong answers very obvious.",1
"She is rude!!!! Her assignments have nothing to do with what we disucssed in class, and will not help you within your future of teaching.",0
"Great professor. Take really good notes, because these notes are basically the exam. Use Chegg for the homework because it has little to do with the exams. Pick your group wisely at the beginning of the year because you will complete pop quizzes together for points. Overall, memorize the notes, ask questions, and you will be fine.",1
"Her class was alright.  It always seemed like she was giving me dirty looks, and she made me feel uncomfortable.  So if you don't like getting dirty looks, don't take her.",0
Don't even bother taking this professor! Poor teaching skills & yet confusing!,0
"Nicole was one of my favourite profs in four years of college and university. She was fair, caring, patient and most importantly, interested in what you had to say and cared about your future!",1
"I absolutely loved this class and Prof. Lay. He makes the lectures really interesting and clearly not only loves what he teaches, but is an expert in his field. Alex as my GSI was also really helpful and easy to talk to. I would recommend this class even if you're not that interested in art history. It will change the way you look at art.",1
"his class is horrible. He just uses textbook powerpoint and extremely hard tests. I thought marketing was be a bit easier, but this guy took to another level. You dont have to read the chapters 3 TIMES to pass, just go over the powerpoint slides on MindTap. Good luck if you have him!",0
She was very nice and gave extra credit. Grading was easy. She had 7 missed classes until take points off but if you have proper excuses would excuse. My favorite teacher I had by far!!! I heard all others lowkey sucked. So take her! I still talk to her,1
Best math class I ever had in my life! He is a fantastic teacher!He should teach more courses!,1
"Would have been an easy course if Duplass actually paid attention to the work we submitted. Tests were full of spelling and grammatical errors (Phd?), routinely failed to answer questions,feedback was rarely helpful. Every material we used was written by him. Test questions tended to be random snippets that had little to do with the module content.",0
"Multiple times couldn't solve basic circuits in class, test solutions were sometimes incorrect, and do not expect him to grade fairly at all. ",0
"Does not give very clear directions, but he does give you a chance to turn in a rough draft without receiving a grade which I found helpful.",0
Gives a lot of assignments and his tests are information that is not found in the textbook. I would take the course but with a different instructor.,0
"Not a ""chill"" professor whatsoever. Take from that what you will.",0
One of the best math professors there are .,1
Her class is really tough. Lots of assignments. The grading criteria is not clear at all. Don't expect to get an A. Very unpleasant learning environment in her classroom. Does not know how to teach. Bad teacher. Avoid her if you can.,0
"He's unclear in lectures. He'll start writing on the board, then he'll pull up the powerpoint made by WebAssign, then he'll try to figure out the powerpoint in front of the whole class in silence. (Not every day is like this, but many are.) I made an A in high school calculus and a 5 on the AP but did badly in his class. Not a good professor.",0
"His accent is so strong, its very hard to understand anything he says. Notes, tests, and homework assignments are all written like he speaks, broken English. He takes random attendance 5 times throughout the semester.",0
"Take professor Deason! She is an amazing professor, one of my favorites at UWL. She is very personable and engaging with her students. She gives study guides for the exams and they are spot on. Fill out the study guides and you will do perfectly fine!!! Also she does a lot of 5point discussions that are nice grade boosters.",1
"hands down the worst teacher i've had thus far at UMaine, so dry so boring... so tunneled when it comes to how he feels on issues.",0
HE IS AWESOME!  HE REALLY GETS INTO THE CLASS.,1
Do not take hos class if you like to get things done in the last minuets.,0
"I did every homework, spent so much time on this class, followed her rules and never got an A. I don't recommend her",0
Helmreich is so passionate about statistics and passes that passion onto his students! He made the class exciting and engaging. We had no exams. Our grade is solely based on problem sets. What he wanted though was not clearly stated in the problem sets; I suggest taking a lot of notes to mimic what he does in class on your problem sets!,1
"Do NOT taking an online class with her. The classwork itself was enjoyable, and were this in a classroom, it probably would have been great. She wants a specific form of citation, but her directions are less than explicit. Instead of clarifying, she docks you points and accuses you of cheating. Her online class turns A students into C students.",0
"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR FOR A GENED, YOU WILL HATE YOUR LIFE!!!! I'm currently taking my final exam and I am crying. The amount of time and effort you have put into to get a good grade is RIDICULOUS. I am genuinely so upset I took this class. It is hard for no reason. :'''(",0
"He was awful. tells unfunny jokes, isn't clear about what he's teaching. Takes forever to get to the actual coursework and likes to go off talking about whatever he feels like. Doesn't offer any extra credit.",0
Best professor at CMU,1
"Absolutely one of my favorite professors. Take him only if you are able to work hard. I learned so much from him and this class and I recommend it to any non science major. Really interesting stuff. He cares about what he teaches, just be prepared to put work in. also, he's always up to smoke a cigarette after class.",1
"worst class ever- grades class n a curve, never returns your work. Class is somewhat interesting then he has you spend hours citing sources and doing very hard assignments and never returns them.",0
"He's generally a pretty nice guy, but the way he grades students for their contributions to the course makes it feel like he's just trying to kill their motivation to actually complete it. By the way, I hope you're mentally prepared to write essays on some of the mundane stuff imaginable. Definitely wouldn't take a course with him again.",0
Is not good with online learning. Had a very hard time addressing concerns from students and instead implied that the students were the problem and were not listening in class. Multiple instances of disrespect during lectures. English is not his first language which inhibited his ability to understand his students' concerns. Yelled at us sometimes,0
"Dr. Tindell made me like Stats. She was by far the greatest math teacher I've ever had. No one can explain math the way she does. You HAVE to study the material tho and pay attention, but it's college. What do you expect! She is ALWAYS availabe for help, no doubt. Dr. Tindell is the best!",1
"The worst professor I've ever had. His expectations of you are totally unclear. The semester consisted of 2 papers (which he ripped me apart both times, and gave vague feedback why), 2 exams which are extremely hard and participation. I didn't miss a class and still got a C average for participation because I didn't talk enough in class apparently.",0
"BORING!!! but grades VERY easy and is not strict on deadlines.for papers,as long as you ask him what he's looking for he'll tell you.for tests,be ready to write.easy tho.super super boring tho",1
"I sat in his class and felt lost the whole time. He is all over the place, he does not follow the quiz/test dates, his review sessions are useless. Tough grader, be prepared to read and self study !!!",0
Arthur Holmberg knows so much about theater and wants to share it with students. Don't be dissuaded from the class by the students who chose not to read or participate. You can get a lot of the class if you show up and do the work.,1
"I wish I had listened to other reviews about her being a slow grader. It was week 4 before we had grades from week 1. This continued throughout the session.    She leaves feedback in odd places that no other professors use, so it's hard to locate.   Zero content in the class ""resources"" tab.   5th professor I've had at APU and by far the worst.",0
"unprofessional, poor judgement of students' work and effort, dropped education because of him",0
I would suggest that if you have to have a class and the offer another professor then take the class with the other professor. I would find myself emailing him for an assignment due in a couple of days and him not replying for weeks later. You learn absolutely nothing from him!,0
"I only took a year of French before taking FRCH 202. Everybody in my class has been taking French since high school, so I was, without a doubt, the most inexperienced/dumbest one. I only stayed in this class because she is an amazing teacher. I have actually learned how to speak French. You need to work hard, but it's totally worth it!",1
He's very boring and it's hard to stay awake in class. He just reads out of the textbook so there's no point in going.,0
"lecture material is often overcomplicated, leading to confusion on course material",0
"Very relaxing and funny lecture, totally a enjoyable time. ",1
"Tim is very passionate about whatever class he is teaching, but if you are not diggin' the class then it gets annoying and old fast. Pretty easy grader, quizzes every week, three paper and a final. Way too much reading at way too fast of a pace.",0
"Great guy and great class, helpful and funny!  One of the only classes I actually got something out of",1
This woman is the absolute worst never take her if you don't have to.,0
"Being a psychology major, I had taken her previously last year (first class on campus) and have noticed a significant difference in her demeanor and teaching rapport. Communication with her is rare at best and instructions on assignments are susceptible to changing weekly. Only recommend to those with lots of open time for studying.",0
"Professor Flynn knows what he is talking about, but he goes too fast over the material. He also only shows 1 or 2 practice problems, and then puts difficult questions on the exam. Taking this class online is stressful because he will randomly call on you and make you feel like and idiot for something you are just learning about. Very difficult.",0
"I cant say I learned that much, but I liked Prof. Watson. Shes knowledgeable, kind, understanding, organized, and fast at communication, and she gives good feedback on assignments. This class was a lot of work, but not very difficult. No exams. Just turn in good work. Honors has a big group project at the end, which I actually kind of enjoyed.",1
"Unprepared, very confusing. 1st and 2nd day of class he gave a pop quiz trying to weed out people from his class. Explaining if they did poorly they'll never do well in the class. Must read your text as that is how you'll learn, he goes over few examples in class, you basically need to teach yourself. I've never had problems in math, until now.",0
"I took this course on-line, and found it easy to follow the instructor's schedule, although there was a good deal of work expected. Hamilton always responded immediately to the questions I e-mailed and quickly returned rough drafts I e-mailed.",1
"Professor Sheridan is great at what he does. His lectures are great and allowed me to learn a lot about U.S. history. If you genuinely enjoy studying history, I would definitely recommend him. However, I struggled with his strict grading criteria, which was not expected in a lower division course.",1
"I did horrible on all his tests, mostly bc of a lack of interest in the subject.  But the exam was really easy, and brought my note up.  Attending the tutorials in the morning was mandatory, so the class was 1.5 hrs, 3 times a week, and early in the morning too.  He doesn't prepare his classes, so many of the ex. in my notes had mistakes.",0
"Paul is one of my favorite professors this semester, he has a genuine love of learning and his enthusiasm rubs off on me and the other kids in the class (I feel anyways). Excellent english professor, and incredible at math (oftentimes I'll stay after to get help in a class he's not even teaching). Overall a great guy and professor.",1
"Considering i am good at math and psych, I figured a psychology based stats class would rock my socks off. All he did was mumble, and use crazy methods to teach simple concepts. It was increasingly difficult to drag myself to class, and it was never clear to me what he wanted when tests came around. At least they are take home exams.",0
"Professor Marlowe is really passionate about history. She'll ask you to write up 3 discussion essays but you can turn in more than 3 if you want a better grade. Quizzes are usually unannounced but she drops the lowest 2. If you want to maintain a good grade, you must participate. She keeps track how many times you do, but overall she's very sweet.",1
"shes nice but her teaching is bad, she's also hard grader, don't take her if you don't like math coz she doesn't know what she's teaching and IDK why GGC has someone like her",0
"Funny guy who really knows his stuff and wants his students to do well. Always reminding everyone to relax and not stress. All exams but final are open book. Final is a bit brutal, but isn't worth alot of your grade. Willing to help if you try. Go to class, gives extra attendance pts at times. Meets you halfway if you try. Caring guy - take him. :)",1
"The only prof who TRULY cares about each and every individual student. He would always stay back after class to answer my simple questions thoroughly and made sure i understood everything. very accessible outside of class. Course was difficult and lots of reading to do for each lecture, but the prof made it worth it.",1
Avoid at all costs. Terrible at lectures and reads right out of the book. Practically no example problems. And he prints his power points with screenshots from the textbook and projects it during class. My math prof. while studying abroad who didn't speak English in class was better than Dunster.,0
Brilliant man,1
"Has an accent, but while it is easy to discern what words are coming out of his mouth, it is impossible to understand what he is talking about. He spends every lecture covering the board in equations and theorems that will never be used on any problems and does not explain what they do. After the first test the class becomes impossible do not take.",0
"Lizs lectures are unorganized & unprepared. She does not use visual aids which hinders the learning of majority of her students. She is incredibly soft spoken & without personality. Her lectures are dry, long & seemingly unimportant. It is hard to evaluate what information is most important in her lectures & what will be found on tests and exam",0
Not present for a lot of the course.  Students left to figure it out on their own.  Forums not working when an assignments were due.  Discrepancies throughout the course material. Didn't grade most things until the very end of the course. Rude and condescending when contacted about these issues.  Glad this class is over.,0
"If I could rate him a 0 out of 5 I would. I warn you now, If you can take this class anywhere else do it. He will speed through the lecture slides or negate some all together. Likes to over complicating concepts- quoted saying ""to make things more complicated, because thats what i do best..."" Doesn't take student questions and concerns seriously.",0
"Really boring and monotone voice. Talks for most of the class period. Homework quiz every single night. You have to revise your paper if you don't get an A (???). I don't even like music and I was put in a class purely about the blues. You have to write 3, 4 page papers about the blues. It's terrible. Would not take again.",0
"This class is reall easy, and Ms. Russell makes it even easier.  Gives you all the answers to the tests on study guides.  Books aren't even necessary.  I'd recommend still going to the class and taking notes, but you could easily not go a single day and still pass the test with flying colors.",1
He was good at the beginning. Then began losing control and getting mad whenever you asked questions.,0
"heavy, heavy workload almost to the point where it's unreasonable. 4-5 assignments per week. she's helpful through emails but that was really the only positive of this class. lectures do not help with assignments either. i bought the book and we didn't even touch it once. if you're looking for an easy science credit do NOT take this class.",1
"Easy class but prepare to write a lot. Three 5-page papers, weekly discussions, quizzes & a group project. The professor is completely MIA. Does not respond to emails or questions & won't grade anything until the end of class. He took points off my first paper & I made the same mistake on all my papers because he didn't grade until class was over",0
"Great teacher, very clear.  Assignments and tests are straight forward IF you did the work.",1
"Is she a tough grader? Most definitely! However, I learned a lot about how to write a proper paper, thanks to her. Emails are like texts. You can not read the emotion in them. If you request an online meeting to talk one on one with her, she is there to help you. She will guide you without giving you the answer.",1
"Gould loves what he does, but he expects a lot from you. Only gave 3 tests and a paper, but if you only go off of lecture you're out of luck. You need to read or at least look up summaries to understand the slightest of what he is saying. He goes off topic easily because he loves to tell stories. If you have strong opinions, don't take him.",0
"Very nice and knows his stuff. A lot of people fail this class because they don't study, you study and you can pass just fine. His accent is funny, not hard to understand.",1
"absolutely horrible professor, told me to drop out of the course because he didn't agree with my opinion in my essay. Rude and sarcastic dont ever take him.",0
"He's a really nice guy and really interested in his subject. However his teaching leaves a little to be desired. He never uses the textbook, so don't even bother. He tells you he doesn't want you to just memorize but then for his test you need just that, pure memorization but his notes are so unorganized their hard to study/memorize from.",1
"Grades, ha!  He did not return assignments in a timely manner, at least a months wait.  I could have been failing and never knew it and the first assignment was not returned until after the withdrawal date!",0
"I don't find math particularly hard, but still I think she made statistics extra easy and mostly entertaining. Learn this stuff good and you will better understand and interpret information in other courses. It makes those courses easier. You learn a way of thinking which is harder to forget than pure facts. Very likable course and teacher!",1
"You teach yourself, gave stupid excuses why she can't teach via recordings. Gives you reading guides that are over 20+ pages when completed. Materials given last minute, no communication or timeline. Tests are super specific and confusing. Late or no response to emails. Disorganized, lazy. Don't ask about your grade, she'll just say it's fine.",0
"Was a very good teacher, explained things in a very broken down matter.  I had him in the summer and 2 hour classes in the morning where killer.  It seemed like he was a good teacher, but some times it just got so boring that I could no longer pay attention.  He was willing to help you a lot even on the take home exam, during offfice hours",1
"Professor Jackson was one to remember. He did a great job maintaining the students' attention, and assigning a consistent homework scedule. His grading is unique and based on points rather than percentage. A 93% can be a B which is a little odd. His homework can be challenging at times, his lectures long, but overall he is a great teacher.",1
poor explanation,0
"Prof Walsh is the probably the best teacher at SFSU. He encourages critical thinking and is very approachable. He is strict with his rules but reasonable in making them. You'll definitely get your money's worth out of his lectures. He's animated, honest, and informed on each lecture topic. Also, a great advisor to help you w/ professional goals.",1
"This class was overall really interesting, Turkel is a great woman. However you have to be prepared to read and STAY ON TOP OF IT. All of her tests (3) are extremely straight forward, she gives you study guides. Just do the reading because the questions on the test reflect the reading. Her test questions are almost identical to study guide ones too",1
"Great professor but expect homework almost everyday and 1-2 quizzes a week. Not hard if you study the day before. Allows you to make up test and quizzes in his office hours and usually responds to emails quickly. Great sense of humor, had us laughing everyday. Would recommend!",1
"This was my third course with Visentin. He is appears nervous when giving lectures. What he writes down is useful, but when he starts to talk, I stop paying attention because he tends to confuse me. Do the online problems. Additional textbook questions are useless. This particular final exam was brutal, but his others weren't.",1
"This professor is nice and helpful. For the course itself, I don't know about American students, but international students (from Eastern European countries, India and China) should consider testing it out. On point sitting in the class going over high school stuff.",1
extremely arrogant and not helpful. has no shame in putting her students down.,0
"Andre Turcotte is hands down the worst prof in the communications department. His content for SPSS is beyond advanced for our knowledge, and he does nothing to help the class understand the maze that is SPSS. In fact, he loves to leave early and leave it up to his TA's to answer 57 questions from a class of 150. Pray that you have Brady as a TA.",0
"This woman hates herself, her life, and her job. And because of this, she will make you pay. Is it fair? No. But she will literally ruin your life anyway. So I recommend you don't take her even if she's the last professor available for the class, which is always the case with her, because no one wants to take her, don't let it be you for any reason",0
"Sharp is a funny guy but he really expects you to teach yourself. He does problems on the board, but you need to do the 40 problems from the textbook to even get a grasp of the subject. Homework isn't graded, and tests are harder than they need to be. Doesn't give great feedback and tries to scare you on the idea of University chemistry classes",0
"Not as easy as I originally thought. The Professor was good and all, but the tests weren't as easy as I thought. The exams aren't easy and are more complex than the lectures.",1
"Knowledgeable, monotone, fair tests. Usually the stuff he adds during lectures isn't testable so you can just study the slides.",1
This professor is not helpful at all. All he does is just send notes and homework without explaining any concepts. Do not risk taking any class with him. Take it at your own risk :(,0
"She doesn't use or allow screens in her class, but she breaks the class up into groups and allows for study time with groups during class which really helps for understanding the material. I had a really positive experience and would recommend her in a heartbeat, but you definitely need to pay attention & take notes to pass. ",1
This course is a tough one. Sister Derby takes a very long time to grade the projects which makes it difficult to improve the next project. She's not very helpful until after the projects are turned in. Again this is frustrating when you are not aware of the many resources available to research until after the project is turned in.,1
DONT take any classes with him! He is very knowledgeable guy but he Doesn't know how to explain**** ! He Wont help you! he will repeat the same words without making it! He wont exam you based on your knowledge but on the how well can u handle stress! hell make you lose interest in course Avoid him by all means! Worst prof ever! Avoid Avoid Avoid a,0
"DO NOT take this class if you expect to learn anything. I took A&P 1 with him...Very good class if this is a repeat for u and u only need the credit. self taught students should b fine. Dont email or call him, he wont answer. He will lower ur grade for missing classes, study and memorize ur practice tests and u will ace this class.",0
I took her class online. There are a few assignments but are all pretty easy and it's obvious what she's looking for. She's a fair grader who responds to e-mails promptly. I thought the class was easy to get through and decently set up so I did learn a few things. I would recommend her for anyone needing an online class.,1
"Great professor. I've taken him for a few classes. CRM426 was very homework heavy, however it prepares you for the exam. He is very interactive, and expects you to be as well. He grades fair, but expects a lot out of assignments. The class was more in-depth than others, but it was still easy to get an A if you put forth the effort. Would recommend.",1
"Kier is a great teacher and as long as you show interest in the class, she will like you. Class discussions are great and make her happy. ",1
I really have no idea how he is the chair of the department. I still do not know any basic concepts because he does not teach well. HE does not post videos walking through the PowerPoints so you have to look at it and teach yourself the math because he does not show you how the financial calculator works. Very rude if you try to email him as well.,0
"The course was very heavy in assignments and lectures. Very demanding in time (which they warn you of). This prof was very monotone, lectures were hard to get through. Tests were fair but there exam was very hard (for me) and not enough time (only 1 hour).",0
"He is a great professor who really cares about your success in his class. His lectures are very clear and the homework directly applies what was taught in lecture that day. He is clear about what will be on his test and quizzes. If you go to lecture, do the homework and study, you will do great! Would definitely take a class from him again!",1
When I took the Course a few years ago. We only got a text from Seyhan Ege. Needless to say that i tried scouring the internet looking for practice problems. This pales in comparison to what my friends who went to UBC got. I found the course to be deficient. I think that Doctor Mars is not the best person to teaching.,0
"He's the only teacher for the Geography Lab classes offed at Dixie, but I advise you to not take that class at all.  It's a one credit class that's harder than the actual lecture.  He is not helpful or clear with any of his labs.  The tests were so hard that our entire class had to help each other to try to pass it.  Worst teacher I've had here.",0
OY VEY!,0
"Ron is an easy going guy, but Im not really sure what the school teaches him to do. The entire semester I think he only actually taught one maybe two classes and the rest of the time was spent preparing and presenting. The only thing I think I learned was to always be ""doing something"", aside from that, the semester was a blur.",0
Cant say a lot about this Professor because she is so unclear and off topic. She gives really bad feedback that makes you uncomfortable to approach her. I would tell anyone to avoid her classes. Odd lady. ,0
"Unless you are preparing for the MCAT or genuinely interested in chemistry, take someone else. Goes through material incredibly fast, writes about 6 pages of handwritten notes each class and doesn't post them later if you can't keep up. Mumbles and hardly tries to interact with the class, just so he can get through all the material",0
"yea, dr. laudan is barry's secret weapon!!.....boo ya!",1
"Prof. Murphy is not a very approachable guy. He acts like you should already know what you are supposed to do. The material is easy SAL programming at first, but once you get into MAL and TAL then it's all downhill from there...haha. His tests seemed okay to me, but man does this guy grade tough! If you slack off in his class, you wont pass.",0
"Kumar is awesome, make sure you do the homework and you're good. He even brought in his cat Gracie for the class to see. Cutest little guy around, I strongly recommend him especially if you like cats.",1
Could possibly be the worst teacher I've ever known,0
"Awesome professor, he teaches by his whole-heart support. He alway does his best to help you get knowledge and experience. You should be thinking different and extend more your lecture, if you can not or stuck, ask him. He will be really welcome to help you. and the finally you will get an unbelievable result. take him for your knowledge.",1
 I took the Hybrid class. Attending classes is recommended but not required. Usually she records her classes and posts them on You Tube. The class can be challenging however Ms. Errico is there to answer your questions whether in class or through email. She is quick to respond and is extremely helpful. I would recommend her and take her class again,1
Great teacher. If you pay attention and take notes during class text book may not be required. Very funny in my opionion. Splits sender in 3 terms 3 home work assignments 3 tests 3 quizzes 1 research paper with option to do more for extra credit. Last test is open book open note which was a relief. ,1
"Tough class, took Acct 101 and it was all on Connect, this class he didnt use it at all.  Three tests, all hand written.  First two closed book, only 3-4 problems.  Last one open book with one section take home to turn in with test.  I think he knows what he is talking about but difficult to follow as he had tendency to trail off on other stories.",1
Seriously NEVER TAKE THIS PROFESSOR unless you're amazing at math already I don't think he did his online lectures past the first 2 weeks of school he just uploaded the notes and it was basically like a GOOD LUCK type situation you teach yourself and him really he also teaches the most confusing ways to do things he confuses himself,0
"Redding is by far the best professor Ive ever had! He makes his class super interesting and he likes to hear his students options and ideas very frequently. As long as you read the textbook and do your part, youre guaranteed to get an A in the class. He also posts videos of his lectures online so if you miss a class, you can easily catch up!",1
WARNING STAY AWAY!!!,0
"He was very slow is uploading material and grading papers. This was because he was teaching too many courses at once, which he told us. He also gave extensions every time he was late uploading or grading. He is clearly a very smart guy who knows the material he is teaching. If you're like me and took it as an elective, you will learn a lot.",1
"Class wasnt too bad, i showed up often and thats where he gives participation points for. Tests I found semi difficult, 5 total including final , drops the lowest  one. Homework isn't hard which is where most points come from. Would take again",1
"Dr. Darr is probably my favorite professor on Adrian campus. He is the smartest physiology teacher I have ever had. Tests/quizzes are based of EXACTLY what he lectures on in class. If you write down all the notes taken in class, you will have all the answers to pass. Study up!",1
"To the person that said she is a hard marker. You probably never show up to class or your just an idiot. She is one of the nicest professors at York and she does not mark harshly at all. Although, her lectures may be boring, she does try her best to bring her own experience into class which is good. Her exams and lec are also textbook based/driven",1
"This class was extremely hard and a lot of students dropped the class. It was difficult to read his handwriting. Although he has an accent, I could still for the most part understand what he was saying. He does drops the five lowest homework assignments and the two lowest quizzes. I had to really work hard for my grade and put in hours of studying.",0
"The DE class had a lot of technical difficulties and the TA lost our assignments. Harris was a great help throughout and the lectures were just so funny and clear. One of the most interesting courses i've had. Unfortunately, he wasn't that nice when I met him in person.",1
As long as you take notes and read the material for homework you'll be fine,1
Here is all you need to know. He is NOT a good teacher and will not respond to emails or calls. He WILL give you the TEST as a study guide the week before. You are dumb if you don't get an A in this class.,0
"She's very sassy and says she wants us to ask questions if we don't understand. But then gives us an attitude when we do ask questions. The lectures are typical, study notes, take the tests. It's the lab that's ridiculous. Theres little to no teacher. You essentially have to figure everything out yourself. And it's not easy. ",0
"He was very disorganized, to say the least. Professor Singer jumped around to different topics and then returned to a topic later to talk about it further. He did not have a good flow. He does seem like he cares for his students though.",0
"Mrs. Thrower is the BEST math teacher I have ever had. No one has explained algebra to me in a way I could understand like Mrs. Thrower did. She would slow down if anyone was confused and made each step clear. I was able to go to her after class for clarity, she even emailed me back at 10pm when I was stuck on homework. Wonderful teacher who cares.",1
"Took Media Law online. Zero interaction with the professor all semester. Your entire grade consists of 4 tests. However, if you do the reading it's extremely easy. The only thing I studied was what each legal case was about and the lowest grade I received was a 94. Though there was no interaction, I really don't know how else to teach this class.",0
I took this class online which I was very hesitant about but I don't regret it at all!!!!! I loved the way the class was laid out and everything was very clear! Mr. Carter is very easy to get ahold of and always lets his students know when he will be out of the office. I would recommend Joe Carter to anyone!,1
"Good prof. Really easy in terms of effort, but he grades tough on the high end. If you're shooting for a C, you'll have no problem. If you're shooting for an A, good luck... Don't do the readings unless you have to write a paper on it; he talks about all the important parts in class. Take good notes and pay attention in class. Study hard for exams.",1
"She's one of the best professors in the Public Health Department. She truly cares about her students and goes over plenty of examples in class just to make sure we understand the material. Overall, she's really understanding and knows students have lives outside of class.",1
"I'm in between when it comes to Professor Guerra. He is funny, insightful, and kind. He has an arrogance about him, but what 30 year old man doesn't. His tests are difficult and you cannot find the answers in the textbook or from his powerpoint slides, so you have to write down EVERYTHING he says during lectures.",1
"A good class for those who aren't the greatest at history. There are some things to purely memorize but a lot more from understanding/analyzing. He's very enthusiastic with the material which makes it better. And don't be a butt and leave after you've signed attndance while a movie is playing, ALL of us are only taking this class because of Gen Ed",1
"Do not take him. Do EVERYTHING you can to avoid his World Civ gen ed class. His expectations are absolutely ridiculous, and his tests are impossible. I've been in a number of times to his office hours and he is NOT helpful. If its between not having enough credits, and taking his class, take the less credits. Avoid him for a gen ed class.",0
"Webassign is great. It grades your work itself, explains what you got wrong, is accessible, it won't get angry if you ask a question, and teaches with examples that aren't directly from the book. 4 out of 5 stars. It's the real teacher in math 215. And if you expect kapoor to fill that role, be prepared for disappointment.",0
"He is a smart man he just needs to stop speaking down to his students, this is not elementary school we will be fine with it being said once not three times the same thing at once.",0
"Awesome instructor with bad accounting jokes, but they help make the material memorable. You have to do the homework because the class lectures cover the assignments and tie them into the concepts covered in the chapters. Professor Hurley tries to pace the course progress off how well the class is learning the material. Highly recommend.",1
"Took him online, he is VERY, DIFFICULT. Extremely detail oriented with grammar, & proper citations. You will work very hard at writing well for a good grade in this class!BEWARE!",0
One of the worst profs at York in the psychology program. Do not take her class if doing online. She does not care about her students passing and only cares about submitting a certain class average to the department. She is very rude when students reach out to her and does not explain a MAJOR assignment. She is also a very tough grader for tests.,0
"Throws her grading power around with Essays to switch you to her point of view. Is highly opinionated and does not tolerate it if other people disagree. Favors some students over others.  A very bitter, ungrateful person who complains constantly.",0
I think that she is a wonderful person but I do not that she is a good professor. The class is three hours in class and then three hours online but the time spent in class she does not spend teaching. It makes it really hard to learn.,0
"PICK ANOTHER TEACHER FOR THIS CLASS!!! I took this my freshman year and was so overwhelmed by her lack of organization and difficult tests. I'm confused why there are mixed reviews on this teacher but I guess it goes to show how she CLEARLY picks favorites (so unprofessional). I wish I could give her a high score, but I really hated this class.",0
"Never wanted to not show up to a class more than i do with hers. Not only because i don't like coming to class, but because her negativity towards her students is just unbearable sometimes. She comes off as rude and too straight forwards with everyone and expects us to know everything asap..",0
"Ray is an amazing professor, his classes are always interesting, informative and interactive. Personally, I gained a colossal amount of knowledge in his class. It meant so much for me to have a professor like Ray!  His wealth of knowledge in, and passion for Business is commendable. Ray is highly recommended as the best for any business course.",1
"Very unclear instruction for her project. She is NOT ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS on email but talk about other stuff. What she says on the comment is totally different from what she said during the class. She is very tough for grade. If you take her class, you have to be professional to Adobe Dreamweaver, a beginner will not pass her class.",0
"He was a good professor!! I did not do well in Spanish because it was extremely hard for me to learn. I have great grades in other classes, but this class was hard for me. He tried so hard to help me. He met me after class and had great communication with me.",1
"Please do not take this teacher if you care about your education.  She teaches straight out of the book, and even refers to it when you ask her a question.  You'll learn more by reading the book on your own, and gaining your own understanding.",0
"He's an intelligent man, but a terrible teacher. His method of teaching is extremely disorganized and hard to follow.",0
Be prepared to teach urself.,0
History of Math.  A lot of work (there literally is something due every week) but no final exam!!!!!!!!  Was a very interesting course and was fair for the most part (he did kill everyone on the second midterm).  Overall a good elective and a lot of fun.  Very personable guy and easy to talk to.,1
"Make sure you get the course pack and book ASAP, otherwise you will be lost. Be sure to look at the ridiculous grading matrix in your course pack. If you get lower than I think an 82% on homework, quizzes, or participation you won't pass. This is the dumbest class i've ever taken. Be prepared to read the entire textbook as well. Good luck.",0
Pretty whack professor. Class is basically unrelated to the homework which is from the book and the book is easily as whack as the professor himself. Very unclear about everything and the exams are brutal.,0
"He's simply a rude prof who teaches quickly because he expects all students to understand things on the first try, and his exam is purely right/wrong ... so hard to do well because there are no part marks for anything.",0
Worst teacher ever. It was not the class itself I have issues with it is her. She is impossible to reach and seems to have no regard for her student.,0
I took this class online over the summer with two other studios. He expects you to put all of your time into your projects. He gave me a 0 on one of my projects because my partner didnt show up even though I submitted my work. Hes really rude and rarely says anything nice about anyones work. His expectations are way too high for a 100 lvl class,0
"Unclear lectures, not necessary to attend lecture if you just study the flash cards and research on wikipedia. Don't even bother reading the texts that are assigned; just use wikipedia where it's all summarized nicely. I fell asleep the one time i went to class. I got an A.",0
"mm not that bad.. although you really need to study if you want a decent grade.. tip: do not but the slide's yellow book, you won't need it at all.. save your money. everything is in the text book",1
"Dr. Randy Waterman replies email very fast to yall. we took so many online classes but, we never see whoever was better than Dr. Randy Waterman.",1
This dude is clearly smart but explaining math concepts cannot be for him. He does not recognize himself as a professor but rather as a freaking mathematician. The class is challenging and not your regular math class with support. The Matlab assignments are really hard since they don't teach it to you but in all fairness no one can teach Matlab.,0
"He's really helpful, he looks strict but he's actually nice.",1
"He's a total gem! Loved the class! He is super knowledgeable and passionate about American history, makes for very interesting (and detailed) lectures. There are few evaluations which makes it easy to keep track of. I'd say the class is an easy B but the extra effort should pay off easily. Highly recommend taking one of his courses!",1
Donna is a fantastic professor. You might not find her helpful if you take the online stream. Highly recommend her in-person class. She will make you feel safe and explain everything to be so simple. Hands down one of the best professors of general elective courses.,1
"I thought this class was going to be easy but IT'S NOT. If you're looking for an easy A anthropology class, do not take this one.  I studied for the tests really hard and still got C's, and tests are the only thing in the grade book. I would have honestly liked some homework just so I would be able to bring my grade up.",0
Don't take him if you are a dude.,0
Sue is one of the nicest prof's I've encountered at UWL. She gets to know students and wants you to succeed. Very helpful if you ask for it but somedays can get crabby quickly. Picky grader but tries to by fair.  I would take her again.,1
"Honestly a waste of time... This class is suppose to be a sort of a intro to engineering course, but mostly seemed pointless. Exams were based on nonsense, and home works has nothing to do with lectures. The demos are fun tho. Sucks there's no avoiding this class because it's a core requirement. Start on your project early!!",0
"Yuck, he is a worst prof ever, never prepares for his class very unfriendly and always in rush! useless in his office hours! Math is not his job! you can always see his crack...",0
"He has a strange grading scale. If you get the 16 different types of problems right sometime in the semester, you will get an A. He is extremely knowledgable and cares about his students. I wouldn't recommend him for someone who hasn't taken AP Calc since he focuses on proofs instead of examples. If you've seen Calc before, you'll be fine.",0
Freeman is an easy A for chem 105 and Ive heard that hes great for his higher up chem classes. You can use notes on exams and he drops an exam grade. Most assignments are an easy 100 and you can finish with more then a 100 if you have a basic understanding of the material.,1
"She was very rude in some of her feedback she gave in the discussion forums , she was not a very good grader she gave me poor grades because i spelled a name wrong , and she seemed like she didn't care to work with people problems that they had if they couldn't do the assignments on time. i would never take her again !",0
"GREAT class! i dont even have an ""A"" but hes really a good teacher and is quite helpful. carpe diem",1
"This class wasn't as great as I hoped. The entire first half of the class talked about genocide, which could have been covered in 2 days. It was boring at times, but in the end it wound up being enlightening. I would recommend taking this class because it opens your eyes, but don't get on Custers bad side, he can be a real jerk",0
Tim Sether was a great teacher. He was very friendly and helpful. I enjoyed the class very much and highly recommend him.,1
"I tried to give him a chance throughout the year and not be mean on this website but he is  the worst professors i have taken my entire 3 years in college...... WAY to much work, unrealistic expectations for class, and in my opinion is your students are consistently failing your test and you have to cure them by 30 plus % then something is wrong!  ",0
What good things can be said about Captain Sweatervest? NOTHING! He spent a whole class period talking about his cat and the cats crazy shannanagains. I had to teach myself calculus to get a high C in the class. Otherwise I would have joined the other 24 students in the class with a D- or lower. Avoid this professor.,0
Don't take her class!!! I mean seriously don't!!!! She is the worst professor I have ever met at pace. She treated everyone totally different. I studied sooo hard and did every project she asked for in this class. And my score are the same as those people did not even came to class. I literally felt she is mean to me. So regret why I took her class,0
"DO NOT TAKE!! If you expect to be taught the fundamentals in this intro course then do not take this class with this professor. He doesn't teach. 3/4 of my class dropped him including myself. Knowledgeable and nice person, but he is a terrible teacher.",0
"I love Dr. Augspurger. He's not particularly funny, but I enjoy his lectures overall, and he knows his stuff. I do badly overall just because there's so much math (which I am NOT good at in any sense of the word), but I really do love Chemistry as a topic, and Dr. Augspurger hasn't made me hate it. Just feel bad for not understanding. :p",1
Great course - Great Prof.  Honestly I don't understand some of the negative comments.  He always promptly answered e-mails.  Weekly quizes reinforced material.  Straightforward class.  And NO TEXTBOOK!!!  Sometimes though he speaks a little bit lowly so if you have a difficult hearing just move closer (Even still - I sat at the back and did fine),1
"The lectures were basically him going on about some news stuff that no one cares about and then when he actually got to the course content, he would either just read straight from the slides or go off on a tangent about some more boring stuff. Plus, the test questions were so incredibly unreasonable, it's ridiculous. You can't study for them.",0
"Lazy students are complaining! He is strict but a good teacher. We are at college level, no longer kindergarten or primary school. We study the materials and do the homework. You are guaranteed will pass the class with an A. Stop whining!",1
"Allan Saxe is a local Arlington legend, but I found his class underwhelming. He spends most of class time getting on a soapbox on various topics and making tacky jokes about politics. He does bring in quite a few interesting speakers and its very easy to get an A in his class if that's all you want, but I personally did not enjoy my time with him.",0
"lack of direction or actual learning but she is the kindest woman ever, classes are boring but not too too bad",1
"I really like this class. Although I only got B. I learned the drawing skills a lot and he cares students a lot. He gave you a good feedback and told you he love it. But still give B. He really focus on your skills. I dont have any skills before, so thats make sense.",1
"Makes you work hard, also hard on grading!",0
Worst prof ever! :(,0
"Amazing prof, taking my second course with him! I love how his teaching method is kind of old school and he's def a great speaker. Plus, he's just a genuinely nice person! Unfortunate that he's retiring next year.",1
"His classes are very boring. You have to copy down notes for 1.5 hours and you're rushing to keep up, which gives no time to try to understand what he's ""teaching"". He doesn't put the notes or DGD solutions online either, and the TA never has time to finish all the DGD questions. Test has nothing to do with DGD. Doesn't give enough practice numbers",0
"I honestly don't know why she's listed as a professor for this course because she doesn't teach a single thing. Everything we learn is through a program made by McgrawHill-no content is hers. Several students have emailed her struggling with some concepts this semester and rather than teaching or giving advice, she told them to drop the class.",0
"The teacher doesn't seem to have ANY experience in the field. Can't help students with not-so-trivial questions. Makes numerous mistakes while teaching. Makes huge mistakes in quizzes and exams.  If your aim is to actually learn anything, DO NOT take courses with him. Even the dumbest student can easily pass. I got A+ and I am very disappointed.",0
This class is really fun. His lectures actually teach you stuff that applies to the real world and I found it very interesting. He's a very nice and understanding professor who cares about his students' success. Go to class he tells you all of the test questions and short answer questions and the answers can all be found on quizlet.,1
"Your knowledge of coding is useless in this class.Test questions have little to do with tutorials.The prof is not bad and willing to help, but sometimes unreliable and won't post necessary things until asked to.The lectures and tutorials are useless.The whole course is just book reading.Hard to believe that such inconsistent course worth 4 units.",1
"Absolute worst. The entire class could be confused about something because he is terrible at explanations, but he will still make everyone feel as if its our fault for being incompetent. Not sure why he makes physics exams multiple choice only, but they are the worst. Math is not that bad but his conceptual questions are impossible. Avoid this man.",0
"He's absolutely terrible! This prof will not help you, and if you ask him a question he will spend 20 minutes answering it but in the end, you wont really have an answer. Also he mumbles and uses a mic and you still cant understand him",0
He's easy to talk to and not arrogant like the rest of the department.,1
"He's very monotonous, which isn't great considering that the material is very dense and hence it necessitates focus. Dude just reads off the slides. He's very smart, but he gives off the vibe that he doesn't want to be there. If you want to take this class for premed then wait until another professor is teaching it",0
A lot of jokes and usless. Do not waiste  your time.,0
"This class has an extremely heavy workload that does not enhance the concepts or themes of the class. Assignments are unclear, rubrics are useless or nonexistent. Lisa tries to help, but the workload is huge and the assignments are really just busy work to her specifications, not knowledge enhancing or helpful. This was my worst class in my field.",0
"I took two different accounting classes from him at WCC. Since he has a great background in real accounting fields, I got into the class and found myself interested. I was just taking them because of requirements at first, but Ken caught my interests and even made me think of changing majors. I am really thinking to major in Accounting now. ",1
"Great professor. Gets you to really think about ethics and leadership. Lays out expectations very clearly in the beginning, but is a very tough grader as well. Still recommend taking him though.",1
"I think it's safe to say that by the end of every class, this guy is just as confused as I am. His notes are tons of examples that never get finished. Tests are easy because he knows everyone will fail otherwise. If an amusing Polish accent and learning absolutely nothing is worth an easy B to you, then take Calc 3 with him, but expect frustration.",0
"Dr yang puts a lot of work into instruction. That being said she also makes you fill in the gaps. No dry memorizartion, you must control your learning with lectures as a guide. Tests are straightforward and lectures are dry",1
Without his well organized lectures i cant imagine how i would've handled that course,1
"This teacher has horrifically unrealistic expectations. You don't get enough time to complete tests and quizzes, mainly due to the fact that the questions are focused on seemingly unimportant and arbitrary details in the text, most of which you can't possibly know unless you literally memorized the chapters. He is also very petty on grading.",0
Took her Maymester class. I truly enjoyed her class. Very engaging. Will take for my other Comp class.,1
"Dr. Gallucci is the most unreasonable professor I have ever had. She teaches this ""non-major"" course as if we are all biology majors, teaching a demanding & irrelevant amount of info. You do all the lecture outside of class in her ""flipped"" course. She has all these specific, unreasonable guidelines and makes you feel stupid for any question asked.",0
Worst teacher I have ever had refused to help. would not excuse me when I had military obligations. overall terrible professor.,0
EXCELLENT! Best prof I've ever had.  Very clear and organized lectures.  Really wants you to learn and will go out of her way to help you do well. Top Notch!,1
"Extremely tough professor! Participation matters, attendance is taken!!! Lectures are asynchronous on your own time (pre-recorded), while the assigned class days are for discussions! Discussions are a must and even if you're not the type to speak, points will be taken! 2 midterms and 1 final exam. Be sure you know what you are doing or it's a miss",0
Don't miss class & keep up with the work and you will be fine. I enjoyed his sense of humor. Very intelligent and definitely worth taking!,1
"This was probably the most annoying class I've ever taken at UT. He takes random attendance, but being in class is the most boring and painful thing in the entire world. TA grades everything, and harshly might I add. Falola would just fwd my emails to the TA. impossible to understand b/c of accent.",0
Honestly one of the worst professors to take for an online course. There's a big group project with three parts and he is extremely unclear in his directions. Hardly replies to emails even though it's an online course and is not helpful at all. Exams are unreasonably difficult. Stay away from this professor.,0
Worst acc prof ever! She expects everyone to know everything before class so what's the point of going to her class? She will go through easy questions in class (super basic) and homework questions are completely off and takes hours to complete. exams are hard!,0
"I think I estimated by the time I'm done I will have had something like 10 semesters of classes with Ken.  I'm a photo major, but still, if it weren't for him I probably wouldn't be one.  Very laid back, easy grader(AS LONG AS YOU DO THE WORK), get to know him, he's the coolest kid in school. ;D",1
"Prof. Goldberg is really funny (dad jokes) and caring. Im a straight A student that got a C+ in his course, which is partly my fault because I didnt attend class much. He asks a lot of questions about research results on his tests, which I find useless and difficult. If you want a good mark, youre gonna have to work hard for it and memorize.",1
"He was alright. Not the best, not the worst. A bit boring at times. I was excited about the class at first but at the end, not so much. I thought it would be easy but there is not a lot of graded work to rely on. Two papers and midterm and final (really not able to study for them though).",1
"As a non-traditional student,I was concerned with the reception I would receive at CMU, however, my uneasiness was unfounded as Dr. Kinney made my first semester here incredible. He is by far the most interesting, accepting, and knowledgeable professor I have had here at CMU!!! Awesome personal stories that tie into relevant class materi al :)",1
She is HORRIBLE. She has a bundle grading system that make no sense at all. Throughout the whole class I did not learn anything. I could have received the same grade if there was no professor in classroom because she did not do anything. When doing projects she is incompetent in giving feedback. I would avoid her at all costs. STAY AWAY!,0
"Nice funny guy, but really can't keep on a clear topic for more than 5 minutes. Very confusing and class was dreaded every day. Wouldn't suggest.",0
"BEST.  Simply the best, fun and easy 4.0.  MUST TAKE.",1
"His lecture style is not for everyone, he assume you know  the material in advance which sucks because  that is what we are their  for to learn it.  His grading policy was unclear at the end. He skips and goes back and forth in the text , no powerpoints. If you are a visual learner don't take him. Overall I did not like his style. not approachable",0
Annie is a very fair marker and talks with passion which will make you want to attend every single class. If you get a chance take her courses!,1
"Professor Dougherty is one of the toughest grades I have ever had at Moravian. Yes her class only have three ""short"" papers, a final paper and an optional final. But she will grade you'll paper extremely harsh and makes you use her ""revised"" apa format that she basically makes up and will give you a C if you cite anything incorrectly.",0
I was very displeased overall with Rob's tricky questions on tests; he is not clear with explanations and his lectures are brain-numbingly boring. He instills no interest in the material whatsoever.,0
"What a great instructor to have, intelligent, friendly, helpful and fun.  We learned a lot and had a great time as well.  This was the lab portion of the class and she was most helpful when problems arose.  Could be lengthy classes, but always enjoyable.  Doesn't hurt that she is very easy on the eyes as well.  I thought very high on the hot scale.",1
Actually one of the hardest classes I've ever taken in my entire life. H is nice but he doesnt speak very loudly. His material is confusing as possible and his slides are not very helpful unless you know whats going on. Daily Clickerquizzes on reading. 3 Tests. Final  is a retake of one test. Idk if i would say avoid H but i would avoid psyc310,0
This guy was the worst professor ever.  Unclear about many things and does not teach well.  Hot-headed and full of himself.  It is a good thing I went to class because it was not clear the final was a take home and I only learned about this during the last class.,0
"Alright if you take her for Intro to Lit Studies, the class is hard anyway, and she is not very clear in explaining things. She calls you out for not doing things or if she thinks you didn't get something, which can make class suck. She should also explain her grading policy because it doesn't seem to have any reason to it. Otherwise she was nice.",0
"He's a great teacher! One of my favorite professors at MiraCosta College! I got an A in this class only because I worked really hard for it. You can't expect to get an A from a teacher if you don't study so STUDY, STUDY, STUDY! Make sure you spend your time wisely in Lab and get your work done. If you have questions, ask Matt. He will help!",1
"Awesome professor, I had him for West and World 1 and it's really easy. Everything is straightforward and his class is mostly presentation.",1
"He knows his stuff, he just doesnt know how to teach it. I learned that to pass this class you have to teach yourself through the textbook and already come to class knowing the subject or else he'll just confuse you even more. And dont ask a question if your confused because he'll just get frustrated and yell... then laugh",0
She is always late to class and somewhat out of it.  Never gives back papers or gives any feedback.  Far to emotional to be a teacher.  She cries more than she makes sense.  I honestly question her sanity.,0
"She is ok but it is an accounting class so expect a lot of homework(even though they aren't graded). Basically teach yourself in this class and read the material before class, she doesn't answer questions in class she just says to email her with any questions after class. Study for quizzes and tests because that's the only thing she grades.",0
"He is a great teacher who really cares that his students understand the material. He is really funny and always smiling. Most people would disagree that he teaches well, but that is because they do not pay attention or ask questions. MAKE SURE YOU GO TO CLASS! He doesn't always take attendance, but he has huge 50 point attendances randomly.",1
If you LOVE plants this class is a lot of fun! Krings won't learn your name but he is a walking encyclopedia and he has a quirky sense of humor that's adorable. Get ready to memorize A LOT. It is not an easy class but very interesting. He is very soft spoken and only gets loud about plants.,1
"Pennington seems to care about his students, if they are doing well. He is a great prof and provides awesome notes, but the exams are excessively hard (11 pages of synthesis in 50 minutes). Went to his office hours for advice about failing an exam... told me to q drop and retake ochem one. Only take him if you are super confident in ochem.",0
"1. She doesn't teach. I didn't learn anything 2. 7 essays. 5 at home, 2 in class. You can revise 2, that's how you get your A 3. 2 group projects/presentations 4. A number of journals. Scribbling whatever on your mind would do 5. 2 quizzes on 2 novels. True/False, fill in the blank, multiple choice. Easy 6. Many extra credit opportunities",0
"None of your exams and tests actually have reviews that correlate to the test. There is too many places where your work is such as owl, McGraw hill, and then on blackboard you have your lockdown browser tests and exams so everything is disorganized and very confusing. Overall, this was a super hard course so I withdrew, would not recommend.",0
Don't waste your time if you actually want to learn.Very unclear and does not grade assignments for a long time and no feedback whatsoever.A shame he's the only social work teacher there because people are forced to take him.,0
"If you take this class be prepared to drop it in the time allowed before the W. William  is arrogant and rude. He wishes he was at teaching at Harvard but apparently he's not THAT GOOD . His lectures were a waste of time and had nothing to do with the tests. How he still teaches at SRJC is beyond me, I guess no one else wants the job.",0
Good day Sir. We are students from the Philippines. We would like to ask for your permission for using your survey. We would like to have more in depth research about your survey. Thank you and have a nice day Sir.,1
"Mark is a terrible teacher. His marking is completely subjective and difficult projects, lectures are boring, he has unrealistic expectations and treats adult students like teenagers with loads of projects and strict marking. He is knowledgeable and teaches from real life economic situations, only good, too bad does not know how to teach!",0
Useless with any help at all,0
By far the best professor I have ever taken! He is the most caring professor and teaches this class in such an engaging format.,1
This class was one of the most disorganized classes I have ever been in.  She tells you one thing and does another or marks in another way.  I don't recomend this class to anyone.,0
He is ok but make sure you do your homework to a T he will drop your final letter grade down if you do not meet his standards,0
"he rambles on and expects us to do lab assignments and homework AND turn something in at the lecture AND gives us WAY too much pointless homework. hes never at the labs, he has is TAs do it because he is way too lazy. he doesn't grade that hard, but he still doesnt know how to teach.  he expects us to know everything already.",0
"Stay away from this dude if you can help it.  I took this class as an upper GE requirement, what a mistake.  He is unclear as to how he wants the folklore documents to look like.  Be prepared to write in the class, it should be a W class.  He tests from the READER text by E. Oring. Class average on first test was 44 percent, go figure.",0
great teacher..you must work hard but you can get an a,1
I took a course by DE. Voice wasn't that bad over the tapes and the lectures were interesting. I have no idea what he would be like in a classroom setting.,1
The most amazing man I've ever met.,1
"I was scared to take her class because of the reviews. There are lots of papers but you can pick most any topic. If you go to the writing center they can help you with grammar. I was going through a very rough time. I talked to her privately she gave me very good feedback on papers and listened to me. I would take her again, made me love english.",1
One of the worse professors I've had at Truman. She should not have taught intro levels classes because she doesn't deal with people who don't understand. She sent out an email telling people who have lower than a B in the class could not attend final review sessions b/c we would be a waste of time to the tutor. She is ridiculous and doesn't care.,0
"She is very helpful when you message her and if you are struggling she may offer you extra credit. Prepare for a lot of readings! Group work was okay . Most people in my class were failing the exams, so they became open notebook. The exams are tricky, even if you read or try to find them in the readings. Final exam is the same as the pre-test:)",1
Dr. Heggen is an amazing professor that is always there to help you out. He makes you write a few papers but will always give you comments about them and will allow you to rewrite them for a higher grade. Definitely would take again.,1
"GREAT professor, do not expect to get easy grades from him. he can tell very easy when you are working hard or not. Work hard and let him know that, even if you don't come up with the perfect design he'll reward you for your effort",0
"Great Professor, very fair and helpful.",1
"I took Activism, Participation, and Protest with Professor Alvarez and I have to say that I am not impressed. I think she lets her personal political opinions get in the way. Her ""lectures"" are confusing and there are way too many group collaborations on the readings. (There are SO many readings). She's a smart person, though, which is nice to see.",0
Perfect class for students who have minimal exposure to programming and want to learn java and c++. Could have included a bit more topics in java. C++ was a bit rushed towards the end of the semester. But anyone who has completed this class can easily expand their knowledge of java and c++ all by themselves based on what they learn in this class.,1
"Great as an advisor, horrendous as a professor.  No rhyme or reason to the grades.  He goes ""waves his hands"" and tells you to figure it out on your own.  He will help if you ask AND can find him.  Honestly he doesn't teach a thing in the lecture periods.",0
Richard is by far my favourite first year prof and the best math teacher I've ever had! He knows his stuff really well and has great explanations. Not too much homework in his class and the past midterms and finals on his website is the BEST study material! 100% would recommend taking his MAT1300 class! He's AWESOME!,1
"No need to even explain why he is a very undesirable teacher, previous comments say it all. I only had him for a lab co-ordinator and it made that class terrible.",0
"Took CMST&210 online for comm requirement. First half of the quarter  tons of homework, expect an ""assessment"" (about 2 pages) and a chapter review (5 long-answer questions) per week in addition to various other assignments. Second half is partner project and group project. I highly recommend renting the digital text from amazon if you take this.",0
"Great class and great professor. Nina is the best. Wish I could take her for every semester. Workload is very light and easy, but she is so amazing you want to do her work. ",1
"Please, Don't take her class. Even if shes the last option because of registration deadline, just wait until next semester She's truly not interested in teaching or helping you to understand the material. Unless you have a gift in the sciences or can teach yourself, you will be wasting your time and money. Please study with a professor that cares.",0
yo i get mad stoned before i go to this dudes class and that dude talking is entertaining enough for me to not leave early,1
"Lectures were very disorganized and disconnected. The prof rushed things a lot, and by the time he was moving onto a new topic, people would still be copying from 2 boards back. His notation is also very inconsistent. His assignments have very little in common with the notes, and studying for the exam involves just memorizing the solutions.",0
"At first impression he seems really serious and his class seems difficult, but you will quickly get the hang of it and he really is a nice guy. If you understand the material his quizzes are super easy. If you do not understand anything during lecture  he will answer any question and explain something multiple times if you ask. Take him if you can.",1
"Lectures are pointless but attending the small section is crucial. The weekly quizzes are tough but they somewhat prepare you for the tests. The test require a lot of preparation and even then the grades aren't pretty. Lectures are worth skipping, but small section is not. Don't slack off in this class, it's tough.",0
"Professor Anderson is a nice person, she really is. But her classes are the most incredibly tedious things I have ever been cursed with. Her tone is monotonous, she spends vast amounts of time on tangents that don't relate to the topic, and it's impossible to tell what information is important. I love this class's subject, so I'm heartbroken. ",0
"i never went to class, never read, and didn't study for tests and i got a C. i'm not complaining. so even with the slightest bit of work you can do better than me!",0
"strict grading,very strict on attendance. it's true, he does teach straight from the book, and he is a little overrated on this site. don't like him, but don't hate him. okay as a person, not necessarily as a teacher.",0
"2 in 1 class. Computer programming & whatever your really taking. You don't have a computer? To bad & you can not download vPython on school computers. I informed him nothing done. HW, never told what is needed for full credit & you will never see full credit. You get a new comment each time. Test easy question but show everything Formula & mult -1",0
"Without a doubt one of my favorite professors at the university! Class was interesting, no exams, but a lot of participation required. Not a breeze of a class, but if you put in the effort, you will do very well.",1
"Very helpful but very strict. Be on time and pay attention. Be prepared for a quiz every day or a homework check. Simply, if you take him you WILL understand the subject",1
"He is a nice guy but honestly spent money on a textbook and didn't use it at all until the final to ""study"". His course is good if you have previous knowledge with Excel and can easily catch up. The class itself should be very easy but I felt he made it harder than it should've been",1
"Tara is a nice person, don't get me wrong but her requirements are way too demanding. Each minute late to class is 10 points off the homework turned in that day and she doesn't post the lectures online if you happen to miss class. Class feels like a college level course taught by a high school teacher; I don't recommend.",0
"She def knows wut shes talking about. This is more of a reactiton/research class. She loves talking politics and pretty much just sits and chats with the class discussing topics. I def recommend. We didnt use a text book. Shes ver friendly, just dont cross her of let her catch you texting! haha",1
"Another class in which I thought I was passing with flying colors and ended up nearly failing. I personally think this course is far more difficult than it ever should be. This professor is really nice, and he cares A LOT about his students, but no amount of office meetings could've helped me. He explains things in a way that ended up confusing me",1
"Personally thought this professor needs to take it easy with all the jokes, its very annoying & the man moves to fast when hes teaching , he needs to slow down and last but not least it seems he is always trying to push tests ahead of schedule i don't think this is good for all students.",0
"If you wish to  give back the same views as teacher, then you will do fine. In talking to other students, it seems the course pols 1057 does not have any set objectives from the university. I think after the first lecture I knew what his views were.  How each student reacts to that information will be different.  Each course costs a lot, so choose.",0
good teacher 10/10,1
"I would avoid this teacher He was unclear on which book we should have, he currently has the incorrect copy. He claimed we gave him the wrong answer saying ""PEMDAS"" then went on to explain PEMDAS. Talks very quietly and writes very small. If you can't change classes I would sit up front, get a tutor and hope for the best.",0
"This professor was okay, the 2 worksheets due every week was pretty bad especially during the middle of the semester. Her lectures are interesting and participation counts more than the final paper, which I found a little confusing. Overall I think this class was okay at best!",1
"Though it can be boring, very easy class.  Dr. Kennedy is a sweet heart, very understanding and willing to help. Highly recommend her.",1
"The greatest professor I have ever had and the only history professor who did not give mean A. I respect him so much. If you can take his class don't think, just do it.",1
"She is a nice lady, and can be  very accommodating, **BUT** as a teacher, she performed VERY poorly! She doesn't set clear expectations re: learning outcomes, is awfully disorganized grading ( often failing to provide feedback on quizzes & homework in time to keep you from making the same mistakes on the next test. Worst college teacher I've had!",0
"Mrs. Elfring was my best teacher at ECC so far! She is so funny and uses a lot of TED talks in her lessons. The papers are to be expected as per an honors english class, but the feedback given makes them easy to revise.",1
"Hallet is a really solid prof, if you like the more traditional style of lectures. Lectures are very clear and easy to follow, but he doesn't post any of his notes (during COVID the exception). He posts a list of questions from the book for each topic with worked solutions which are nice. It is clear whats on tests, study that and you'll be fine.",1
"Since this class hasn't been taught in a long time, there's some trial and error to it. There are a large number of readings we're responsible for that we never get to in class. The citation style we use for class is also completely arbitrary as if she made it up, but make sure to follow her instructions clearly or you won't pass with a good grade",0
I took this class online. Soooooo much work! I mean I get it it's college but we had 2 or more quizzes every week plus an assignment on top of that. Quizzes only worth 10 points of total grade. A lot of group work too. Would not take another class of hers,0
She straight up sucks,0
"Phil Klein is the man. The first few lectures are a little dry, but once he starts talking about different countries it gets super interesting! I loved this class so much! Way more interesting than Tim Vowles class.  4 tests and maybe two short papers. If you follow his examples, the papers are super easy. Study the powerpoints for the tests.",1
Prof. Willard is an awesome professor. Hilarious in his lectures and is really motivating. He made Linear Algebra very easy to understand and explains concepts very well. I'd love to have him again for a future course.,1
"He is very knowledgeable, but I find it to be extremely difficult to sit through his lectures. You're better off not attending them, since he will just post the slides online (what he directly reads off of).",0
Very helpful Professor always available responded to my emails in 24 hrs or faster and to help with my questions he skyped to resolve issue. Gives good feedback and he is accessible outside class. Class seems intimidating with many exams but once you get started the trainings are very helpful to pass the exams. I highly recommend this class.,1
"If you enjoy listening to the same things over and over every class, and never learn a thing youll love Professor Allen. If your like me and cant stand to hear about The Coca-Cola Company or see the same profit equation on the board, then do yourself a favor and avoid this class. Hes an extremely nice guy, but horrible Professor.",0
"These labs are the most confusing, all-over-the-place, time-consuming, and overall worst thing I've had to do all of uni. Do not expect clear instructions, and if you're told the labs take 3-5 hours, expect to spend hours per day everyday for the 2 weeks to even get a decent mark. I haven't even learned anything, I always finish more confused.",0
If you're not great at math you will fail in his class. You don't learn anything because he doesn't know how to teach. All he does is examples that as much simpler than what show up on midterms or quizzes. Plus he is a hard marker and will take marks away for any tiny mistake. Avoid Bruce at all costs. ,0
very good professor if you take with him you will not regert  he teach very good,1
Actually enjoyable class.,1
"Hey I took he class last semester. This woman is an angel. She is so interesting, understanding and incrediby witty. I would recommend her to anyone, even if u dont like anth. I LOVE U WOODMAN!!!",1
"He thinks he knows everything, he kept interrupting me when I was doing my presentation. I felt embarrassed as he kept interrupting and he I ask him a question, he wont' answer it right.",0
"Michael Scott is one of those professors who you either love or hate- or both. He really makes you work for it and he is super unclear, but he is amazingly smart and know what he is talking about. He is the kind of guy you want to get to know because he can really help you out. He may anger you but he is worth your time. ",0
"I was in her class in Sept but dropped out later in the month because she was too confusing, has a thick accent, and would ramble on about irrelevant things. I felt bad for her, but she really needs to try to stay on topic and speak clearer.",0
"Lots of reading and expect a reading quiz during each class. Overall, the material isn't hard, it's just time consuming. He holds great discussions and really makes you think and discover your true beliefs. Class was never boring and he could turn the most boring literature into something fun.",1
"Professor Horn has been one of my favorite professors. She is very understanding. If you at least show effort, she helps you out tremendously. I am so glad I took her. I wish I could take her again but Psychology is not my major!",1
good class. A LOT of annoying busy work that very very very very very very very repetitive,1
"He is pretty good at teaching the material, but pretty bad at giving feed back and sometimes is disrespectful when answering questions.  Almost as if he thinks its a dumb question or is trying to be funny.  Show up to class and do as much homework as you can and you'll pass.",1
"A rude professor who does have interesting material to cover, but does a poor job doing so. He is extremely harsh if no one in the class understands a certain photograph or piece of art that he displays on the screen. His grading is extremely hard especially the papers and midterms. DO NOT TAKE HIM.",0
"He wastes his entire class period on trying to teach life lessons instead of teaching Chemistry. Classic Hokmabadi line, ""I'm not here to teach, I tell you what you need to look for in the book."" Very rude and condescending, he wants you in his office groveling to him.",0
"She gives you the opportunity to complete most of your papers during class time so you can ask her questions. She gives excellent feedback when you ask her questions and on your rough drafts. She gives you clear instructions, follow them and you will get an A!",1
"Professor O'Sullivan isn't really a bad guy, he's not a great professor. If you ask for clarification he'll give it, but whether or not it's actually clearer depends on the concept. As far as assignments and tests, I've been completely lost. You'll have to do plenty of outside work to do a decent job. He's curved some tests, which helps. Avoid.",0
"Professor Russo made the weekly assignments very organized and it was basically the same thing every week. One discussion, one quiz, one assignment and occasionally there would be 5 page case studies. Nothing too overwhelming. He made clear deadlines and provided us with rubrics so we knew what was expected of us. Would take again",1
Class is too hard. Exam questions are undoable unless you have access to the questions ahead of time. The labs/assignments are irrelevant to what you actually need. Avoid if you can.,0
"This professor is one of the worst Ive had. Professor Smith has hardly done any of the work herself and leaves it up to her Sophomore TAs without a set grading scale to grade a majority of your assignments. While its and easy A, its if she actually grades your paper in a timely manner. Im still waiting on a huge grade and its been two months.",0
"One of the worst teachers I have ever had. Never trust the study guide. If he says something won't be on a test, expect it to be on the test. ",0
total hottie,1
"Jensen can be confusing at times, but overall she is not as bad as most of the comments make her seem, especially if you get on her good side. It is a lot of work, and you will use a lot of printer balance for this class. But as long as you do the work, and talk to her, you will get a good grade. You will get through it!",1
"Prof Betterton handled the COVID situation extremely poorly. Before the switch to online classes, this course was bad. After the switch, the course was laughable. Multiple-choice exams had questions with no correct answers, the grading scale dropped test score by 20-30%, and assignments were unpredictable. My high school physics teacher was better.",0
"Whole grade based on 3 tests; most of the material is from the book, abt 30% from lecture. So yeah you have to teach yourself 70% of the test material, but it's not impossible. He does ramble on about his subjective takes on things occasionally, but the lectures aren't always boring. Tests are p straightforward if you study and think critically",1
"Pick a different sociology teacher, she makes her class way harder than it should be. Talk about feelings and discuss the entire class... makes you participate for a grade. Her tests are fill in the blank and true/false... you have to know the vocab and study her notes to do well on tests. Absolutely no phones or laptops or she will yell at you lol",0
"Be prepared to study hard, easily goes off tangent, with numerous stories of prognostication. Nice man, and can be entertaining, but do not be fooled, he will fail you. He needs to teach the basic concepts, a lot of times he delves into the more complex aspects of finance, topics which would better serve those who are advanced finance majors.",0
"This class is awful. I'm sitting here now and am debating getting up and leaving. She has NO clue how to use the online system and if you don't do the homeworks (which are graded) you WILL fail. She never lets you leave early and is so unclear, for a 101 class she speaks Spanish 90% of the time. Drop this now. ",0
If you wanna know what it was like to take college classes during the 1890s then Kasserman is your guy.,0
"He is a horrible professor. Not only does he get snarky in class and when grading but he is rude. He told us that he didn't understand why do many of us were doing do poorly when he ""explained in plain English"" how to do the problems and that we were being lazy",0
"Here's the thing - Fontenot is one of the professors that, if you're a comp sci, you'll have to take him for a few semesters. Get on his good side. Don't sleep in class or act like you already know the material. Not all TAs are super helpful, but the internet exists. Data Structures is a difficult course, but I have seen improvement in my code.",1
"Extremely easy class. All of the other professors for this class were tough graders. Schaefer students would work so much less than the others, but we would stilll get much higher grades.",1
"He really cares about his students, and he tries to help you pass. Lectures are terrible. He doesnt know how to dumb things down from his level to ours. He can be very disrespectful. Do ALL of the problems worked in class. The concepts arent important. If youre a student that wants an A: good luck. This is the first class Ive almost failed.",0
"His lectures and notes are very clear and he makes every effort to help students succeed in class. His tests are well structured and he balances short answer/essay with multiple choice and matching. Overall, seems to enjoy teaching and helps students see that studying science isn't so scary.",1
"understanding, approachable, helpful. tends to have favourites.",1
"Kaleem is a good prof. When you stay focused you get a lot from the lectures. The assignments were very hard. The first two were okay but the last two escalated a bit much. But I will say, they forced me to become a better programmer and apply myself. My biggest advice would be just to have a good support system to get through this. Its doable!!",1
"I don't know how this guy is still at Davis. He gives boring lectures mainly about proofs and his research. I havent taken his final yet but his midterm is HARD. It is ALL proofs. Barely any numbers and mostly writing. If you can, AVOID at all costs. He is simply a bad teacher. I emailed him multiple times and have never received a response.",0
"This class is pretty much an easy A. Kent rambles a lot, often off topic, and his lectures are at times hard to follow. But if you get his notes down and pay somewhat attention you will be fine. Very flexible grader, no textbook use, only three exams and a project.",1
mandatory lectures with exams that come straight from the book. tells pointless stories. makes everything super confusing. if you pull out your phone you will be kicked out of the class and failed. you basically sit there learning nothing and then you go home and teach yourself everything. avoid bijan!!! there are so many other amazing psych profs,0
Took him for the basic linux class.  Within the first couple of weeks we had already covered the entire course material the department chair taught in his class.  We then started doing heavy bash scripting and customizing our kernal with little explanation on what exactly we were doing it for.  Taught material way to advanced for a basic course.,0
"This is a great prof, she gives you all that you need to know in lecture, if you take notes in class you should to really well in the class. she is funny and is interesting, i was told not to take this class by a ton of people but she really made it pretty interesting, if you are going to take phi 101 take vandenberg for sure!",1
"I had Prof. Kondopirakis for five math courses at Cooper from 1984-1987. He is singlehandedly responsible for my thirty years of teaching Math at the college level. I try to be like him every time I teach. He is a true giant in engineering math education, and he is sorely missed. One of a kind.",1
"She was a pretty decent teacher. Most of the work was done outside of class, and we didn't meet for every class.",1
"Great professor, reads off slides but makes sure to add examples and information to add to your knowledge. Tests are not cumulative and are pretty easy since she posts a study guide on her website. The homework lecture is a drag but its easy to get through if you give yourself enough time to study it before the tests.",1
"AWESOME! GREAT GUY! HELPS ALOT! EASY B, will have to work for A!",1
Scanlon gave us a decent introduction to poetry analysis. It's hard to get accustomed to literature analysis. I recommend recording his talks so you can listen to them again and again. He is straight forward but it takes time and effort to adjust to this mode of thinking.,1
"He's an OK prof. He uses good examples to explain confusing or complex ideas. It's not his fault that the course material is very dry. However, he isn't the most approachable when you have questions. Can be quite blunt and sometimes a bit rude. If you have him, you'll learn the material pretty well but personally, I didn't like taking CS with him.",1
"There is a ton of homework, classwork, and a quiz every Friday. He never lectures, you basically teach yourself everything. He is also a very tough grader and is not clear on quizzes as to what he expects. For a beginning math class, I wish I would have had a different professor. Also handwrites his own textbook without clear explanations.",0
Professor Dudrick is my favorite professor at Colgate. He always takes the time to talk to his students outside of class and he gets excited to talk to you about philosophy and your life in general. His is so engaged in class and is really funny. You have to participate a lot and go to office hours but if he sees that you care he will work with you,1
"Perfect class to take online. Always has tests & projects graded within 24 hours of submission. Expectations are perfectly clear and assignments are super easy to follow! Tests, as long as you read the chapter you should be good to go! Great teacher and great class!",1
"She is literally the greatest! if you have a chance to have her as a professor, do it and you will not regret it!",1
"Denise is as others have stated very good at what she does.  I've had a great time in her intro to ceramics class.  Her style of teaching is very straight forward: here's the assignment, I'll help you in class, and you finish it before next class.  Most assignments can be completed in class.  She comes around and helps each person out.  Fair grader",1
"Brad is AWESOME! He is one of the most chill professors at Akron. He is extremely understanding, helpful, and actually teaches the material in a way that makes sense. Would 100% recommend!",1
"The course itself is difficult.  Starts off really easy, but by the end of it you're left confused (unless you already have a background in Visual Basic coding).  Scripps was funny and nice, class was usually pretty entertaining.  The only downside is that when you're in lab, he isn't that helpful.  He just kinda shows you what to do.",1
"If you are easily offended, don't take Paul's class. He definitely utilizes tenure! I found his essay grading a little bit harsh but overall a funny guy. Hates management students.",1
"Dave Smalls is a harsh grader. Almost the entirety of his class will fail. He will say he never curve's the course, but always does. I will never take a class with him again. He is an unnecessarily hard grader and I did not benefit from the increased rigor required to survive his class.",0
"Dr. Feige has a passion for teaching and works very hard to explain things to help us understand, not just memorize. He uses lots of pictures. This course is hard! You have to work for your grade. He even posted video presentations explaining challenging topics.",1
She's inexperienced and it shows. She doesn't know how to give a good writing assignment or run a class. Her grading process is absolutely nuts!!,0
Freaking hard and alot of reading but he will work with you and his grading scale is low so you cant fail but it will be hard to make an a,0
Very unfair grading considering it is an intro level course that is mandatory for most majors. Other students suggest that all the other profs are much more reasonable. There is an unrealistic amount of reading assigned and the final did not reflect what was taught in class. Very difficult to stay attentive due to his monotone voice.,0
Read every story and memorize every line or you wont pass the tests. Its a fun class because it's small and we don't do anything except for talk and occasionally go over what we read. I learned more from the subs than him the whole semester. class averages are around 40-60% on tests. Wouldn't recommend this class unless it's required.,0
"The absolute worst math professor ive ever had. Doesnt know how to teach whatsoever. If you have a question, dont even bother asking because it definitely wont get answered. Makes you teach yourself and if you have a question his answer is ask the person next to you. Terrible. 0/10 professor.",0
hes just rude and disrespectful,0
"What's better than a class where you get to listen to and learn about awesome music? Especially when that class is taught by the greatest professor at York? Bowman is gold. He actually makes it fun to learn, and his 3 hour lectures somehow seem to fly by. There is a lot of information to remember for exams, but it is so worth it! Best class ever!!",1
"Truly one of the worst teachers I've ever had the misfortune of learning from. Avoid his class at all costs. He grades off of 3 tests and no homework across the whole semester, and doesn't use powerpoints--rather, he uses a document camera and handwritten notes that he doesn't post online. His one good trait is posting the test bank online.",0
"JUST RUN AWAY. Wasted my hard earned money on this class. I have done 4 years of university, worked full time, volunteered, and gotten great grades. The total opposite in this class: Unfair marking, inconsistent quizzes, and way too high expectations for a first year course. Don't expect to get above C- unless you are a paid writer.",0
"Excellent teacher, makes everything seem interesting.  He is also extremely helpful if a student is confused or needs a little extra help.",1
Claims shes stressed about the same things her students should be stressed about but doesnt care about us at all. Her exams are never what she says theyll,0
Its true he often goes off topic but he is still very intresting no matter what he is talking about. However i still learned alot about the subject. he was very reasonable and an easy grader except when it came to papers. i hope you are better at gramar than i was.,1
"Nice guy, but hard to understand his teaching. He gives both online(webassign) and written homework, but only gives grade for webassign. The written homework is for practice. He goes over the written in class if you ask him to and he'll try and help you. Lectures are unorganized, and spends most of the time just going over written homework.",0
Super understanding and willing to work with any issues you may have. Really interesting lectures given in an easy to understand format. Tests are easy and a good representation of the work studied.,1
One of the best professors at CSULA hands down. Amazing lecturer and great guy all around. Very knowledgeable.,1
"While Korros offers a dynamic view of history through the lens of a Russian historian even when Russia was irrelevant to the conversation. Because of her lack in conciseness and the harshness of her criticism, I would never recommend that you take this professor.",0
At first taking this class I thought it was a little challenging but I kept with it. Throughout the class I found the work to become more difficult. The quizzes are nothing like the tests.  Very tough grader. Many people say she's a great professor but do not be deceived she has no mercy and will fail you without remorse...,0
"The only prof I've encountered who has done world-class research and still approaches teaching as though it is a top priority. If you have to take 101, make sure it's with her! Don't miss her office hours-she is a gem! Her occasional errors were encouraging as a girl who was told that girls can't do math! She patiently helped me prove them wrong!",1
"Not a professor you want if you intend to learn anything important. plays favorites, gives conflicting advice, always seems a bit unsure. Weak instructor.",0
"She's a wonderful woman, she's very caring and she makes it known that she cares about the content and the students. If you show interest in the class she shows interest in you. The topics for The Girl Child are heavy, but she makes you want to conquer the world! One of the few classes I enjoy/don't mind. Weekly readings/2 page papers aren't hard!",1
"I took this class in my first year, and loved it! A great intro to all things psych. Made lectures interesting and fun to go to. Always had many visual aids to accompany slides and video material to enhance concepts and ensure understanding. Exams are very fair! Great guy, great 1.0 elective credit for first year!",1
No need to trust everything said 100%. I generally won't listen to the people too worried about making clever statements like the difficult and depraved or useing words like Farce. Congrats for your language skills. How about some objective ratings?,1
"I don't usually do things like this, but the nightmare that is this professor must be taken seriously. Honestly, I have never seen any professor with a closer mind. the guy is truly a betrayal of all that academia stands for. Classes are incoherent, insipid, and most of all, anti-intellectual. Stay away as far as possible.",0
Horrible!!! If you can avoid her please do! She is not so helpful.. Her exams are confusing and does not require a textbook. She has you read articles of moodle. (I rather study something of the book) She gives you a option of writing a 10 page paper or join a group and present in front of 120 + students. Avoid her if you can : /,0
Avoid him at all costs. He is a funny guy but he does not care about his students and his lectures are all over the place and hard to follow. I went to his office hours every week to ask for help and he would never really answer my questions and would do the bare minimum.,0
"Très bonne enseignantes, il y a de la lecture à faire après chaque cours pour les quizs, mais les textes sont très cours... ceux-ci compte pour 18%, super facile à passer. Si vous faites les lectures, et que vous allez en classe, vous allez 100% passer le cours. Elle donne les questions à dev. en avance pour les exams.",1
"I can say that I barely learned a thing in this man's class. He talked about racism and systemic injustice for 6 classes straight and I learned more about the national news than state government. He invalidates opinions that aren't his own. If you don't want to be in an echo chamber, I'd suggest another professor.",0
"She's one of the best teachers I've ever had the pleasure of taking. I took her when she taught Film and Art Appreciation. Has amazing passion for the arts in general, I always learned something new from her. Huge nerd too for music and pop culture, I'd say get to know her if you can. Overall, she cares about her students and her classes.",1
Lacks clarity... only teaches through examples... not theory,0
"He wrote an unnecessarily difficult midterm this year, by not providing us with enough time to finish the questions (since the midterm was online). We had 40 minutes to do the midterm, instead of the usual 2 hours. The entire class was unhappy with the way he administered a midterm.",0
"Prof. Curry is such a caring person. She is inspirational and open-minded. Even though you read a lot, that doesnt really matter because you will eventually learn so much. Her feedback is also cheerful. Take her if you want to be good in poetry!",1
"The first time I went to class I was cheesed Bc of his accent but got used to it (better then most profs) I didn't buy the book, went to class when called break I cut. Assignments are soft but tests take time to study final was alright. You'll pass if you pass the assignments trust",1
"this guy has a a really heavy accent hard to understand what he is saying. He made the midterm, final and assignments INSANELY hard! And 90% of the stuff in assignments and exams was out of the textbook, not his lectures!!",0
"Eric was not a great teacher. Half of the time he had to stop and redo his examples because he didn't even know what was going on, he would even often ask us if we knew what we did wrong. Assigns lots of homework and the tests often consist of the more difficult problems with lots of steps.",0
"Weekly quizzes. Have to go to class for participation. Her way or the highway. Condescending. Stays on topic of the most time. Not awful but not great, 5/10 recommend. Schools should focus on practical application for software and not pointless (and boring) projects. Visual basic is fun to learn/use so if you can zone her out, it won't be bad.",1
"A bit of an accent but not too hard to understand. Lectures a lot. Will ask for participation. 1 group project, 2 papers, 1 presentation. 1st paper's a breeze. Group project's not too hard either. Haven't finished the other stuff. Took us to a cool library and had a fieldtrip. Had a couple of guest speakers. Interesting material. Would reccommend.",1
"Dr. Sanford taught both sections my semester, and there was a lot of worry from other students that they wouldn't do as well. Turned out to be a non-issue, Dr. Sanford is a great teacher, something like a middle ground between Johnson and Gillmore. She's super funny and likes to make jokes during lecture. The class is hard, but she teaches well.",1
Thinks she's funny,0
"A genuinely nicer guy, willing to help anyone so long as you send him an e-mail. I have taken a few of his classes and come out with A's and B's. His teaching method makes complex ideas seem elementary. If you have to choose, choose Whigham.",1
"Gives no rubrics then deducts quarter and half marks for minute formatting issues that were never addressed. VERY by the book, more concerned over her own professionalism than the learning of her students or ensuring things are clear. She makes things extremely hard to understand and really makes sure you know she has various PhD credentials. AWFUL",0
You will be with a graduate student. Extremely difficult to study the definitions word for word. Multiple quizzes every class. No final. So much work it wasn't enjoyable. ,1
"Not personally a fan of public speaking, but Professor Torres made it more enjoyable than I ever imagined it could be. She is so sweet and genuinely wants her students to succeed. Her instructions are clear, and she gives outlines of what will be on her tests. Everyone should be required to take a class with Professor Torres, she is remarkable!! ",1
Professor Hetrick lectures the entire class and not on what the topic of the assigned paper is. Very few people get an A and I consider myself a strong writer. Takes forever to grade papers and even longer to pass back for feedback. Only test is the final. Definitely would not recommend. ,0
"I am astounded by these comments. Patti is LU's finest English professor. She is consistently intelligent in lectures, and helpful in her feedback. She actively engages with students' writing on even the most mundane papers. And the comments that imply she is unduly harsh to male students are simply untrue.",1
"He is the worst professor I've had in my whole college experience. He expects you to go out of your way to see art pieces, know the proper way to critique it, and makes you write so many papers that are pointless and a waste of time. His grading is so hard, it's almost impossible to get an A anything. If you get him as a professor, GOOD LUCK!",0
"Mary is a really wonderful person, and her classes reflect this.  There are plenty of open discussions, and she really cares about everyone in the class.  I highly recommend this class, taught by Mary Power.",1
"Many group projects. Very intelligent and kind guy, but he isn't very good at interpreting what he exactly wants done. He'll tell one group what to do, but won't tell the whole class. You have to show up everyday or else you'll really have no clue what's going on. It's not hard material at all, but a lot of downloading things on your computer.",0
Dr. C is SO helpful. She will review drafts of your papers before you submit. I find her encouraging and the material is very interesting.,1
"Professor Young is an incredible instructor! His lectures will teach you so much about the music business, but most importantly, he makes you excited to learn!  If you make the most of his classes, and really take advantage of all PY has to share, you will leave his class feeling inspired every day and with a new perspective on the music industry. ",1
Test are impossible!!!!Avoid him at all cause. Worse professor I have ever had!!!,0
I liked the professor. Her class is difficult but if you attend lecture and do the study guide you should be fine. I never used my book but I know it's helpful if you are stuggleing or you miss a class. Iclicker is extra credit and every exam has an extra credit opportunity. The final was very easy if you studied.,1
"Required a weekly meeting online with the class, usually at 9pm or later. At one point, I was ""behind"" by an assignment(there was no deadline) and was told he was going to drop me from the class if I did not get it in that day. The next day, he told the class that there were no assignments for the class so people could work on the same assignment.",0
"If you do not like to talk in class, Dr. Gardner is not the professor for you. You are graded on participation heavily in any of his courses (I've had him 3 times) and it is crucial to your final grade. We wrote two papers, took three quizzes, and had one final exam. Dr. Gardner is enjoyable in class and quite funny, but he is a hard grader.",0
"He's willing to help and will stay after class. VERY long winded. Goes off on irrelevant tangents. Felt that some of his design preferences were out-of-date. I learned some interesting new techniques, but will not take another class with him again.",1
"Very easy-going teacher. You dont need to be in class, but I went anyway because he gives good lectures. Definitely recommended.",1
Very poor teacher. Expects you to know the material before the semester begins. Won't help you in or outside of class to understand what the material covers. Has a holier than thou attitude towards his students. AVOID.,0
She blew off the students questions and told us not to bother going to the tutor,0
The only way to survive this class is by having old exams. He sucks at explaining so teach yourself there is a curve on the bright side,0
Hard but awesome,1
"Great professor who understood his students and was very lenient. He empathize with the students and went the extra mile to help you out. Easy class to pass if all you do is present yourself and try on your part. Doesn't give a lot of work so he's cool. Enjoyed him at UH, wish he was still here but I'll  always remember his class.",1
"Very interesting lectures and very passionate and caring man. Although, I did find the exams to be more difficult than expected. The final was difficult and ended up bringing my grade down significantly. He does offer extra credit though so you should definitely do it all in case you don't do well on the final!",1
One of the best professors I've ever had. He is so caring and makes the subject matter so interesting. 11/10,1
No extra credit,1
"Colin is amazing.  Hands down best prof I've had at Olaf and he doesn't even teach my major.  He is extremely helpful and patient, GO to office hrs they will help.  He is very passionate about teaching and keeps class interesting with his sense of humor!  Take a class from him if you get the chance, I don't think you'll regret it!",1
"Lectures were interesting, he is always willing to help, he is very kind and accommodating. He kind of looks like Santa Claus. You should read the material but it is not always necessary as he often covers the gist in lectures. His class was pretty easy and I would definitely take another class with him again.",1
Horrible. . .worst professor I have ever had. . .Unless this class is the #1 focus of your semester and you love analyzing literature you will hate this class.,0
"If you have any prior background in physics, this class is not hard. He tells you straight up how to do well in the class and if you work hard, you'll get the grade you deserve. He isn't always clear but he does do examples and takes questions. The tests were not anything terrible if you knew your stuff. I would recommend.",1
"Dr. Lim is a disgrace to the CHE department.  He does not teach!!!  When going to office hours, he won't actually answer questions and just tells you to look in the notes.  Semester tests are easy, but the final was incredibly hard and lowered most peoples' grades by two letter grades.  The class did not prepare anyone for the insane final.",0
"Really interesting! Makes the 3 hour night class tolerable.. almost fun! Great examples, not so hard exams. Understanding and great sense of humor. Best B.Law teacher.",1
"I agree with the many commenters who say Joyce is fun & brilliant. But her instruction was awful. Her much-vaunted scientific ""pedagogical technique"" was useless, judging by my peers. >1/2 of class was student-taught (ie, a waste of time). She showed arrogance & disregard for students. She blew off class at the end of the sem. & skipped OH. Awful.",0
"ridiculous grading. Math is universal, but not for him. You not only have to learn math, but also HIS math. He wants you to copy exactly as he does it. Very discouraging as he states that not even D is guaranteed. Avoid. He says and believes that calc is hard and that most people will fail. If you want to succeed, get someone that believes you can.",0
"Prof Lay brings specific genius to this course, and generously shares it. He checks to keep the class with him, and outlined not just a history of 19th century France, but how it relates to life now. You get a sense he really cares. Every session made me laugh and think. He ought to have an endowed Chair. Great storyteller. Awesome.",1
"This class is like taking a CLEP course where you teach yourself, but for this one you pay full tuition. No reading assignments are given. No instructor notes are given to help explain the material as other instructors of other online courses had done. Very little guidance is given at all. Save your money and take the class in person if possible.",0
"A boring, Intro Class.  Somewhat vague on what he wants, and some answers were arguable.",1
Seriously one of the best math teachers.. He goes above and beyond and makes everything simple and easy to understand.,1
he will change your life..i droped his class because i dont wnat to write essays but very smart dude..and helps you out big time,1
An excellent Math Professor. Makes learning the materiel easy. A definite take. No textbook required.,1
She is indeed  a great instructor who is very passionate and knowledgeable about nursing. She works hard to ensure that we are all understanding the material and puts in extra effort to help us remember key information.,1
"One of the worst professors I've ever had. Doesn't grade his own papers and makes students do it instead. Lazy, lazy, lazy.",0
"Nicest guy you will ever meet but worst prof. Don't let his charm fool you! he has a strong social game that will make you like him and forget how bad a prof he is. Exam 100% textbook, his lecture is fun but 0% exam. Expect to work twice as hard for a grade that is half as good from a prof that does not know how to teach.  For your own good AVOID.",0
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this class! If you get the chance to take this class DO IT. So easy its not even funny and he cancels class 85% of the time.,1
Brilliant person but not really commited to teaching,0
"This woman should not be a teacher. She either drones on forever or sits in silence. She is very ignorant when it comes to offensive language and has tried to defend herself for saying the N-word when referring to a short story/film combo we were studying in class. We have a couple of papers that aren't hard, but I learned nothing about writing,",0
great class. exam is not hard.,1
"By far the worst teacher I have ever had. She was rude and told me there was nothing she could do to help me study more. The class material isn't hard, but her tests are tricky and I don't know how I just scraped by with a C. I would not recommend her. Look for someone else.",0
"Failed my first attempt, redid the course during COVID. The final was a take-home; had 50 Qs to pick from (only need to answer 20 perfectly to get full marks). A lot of answers were found online instead of his lectures on textbook. I answered 40 Qs and got a perfect score but I would have flunked without the pandemic.",0
This lady honestly SUCKS at communication. She is the most VAGUE professor I have ever had and does not communicate unless it is to send very passive aggressive emails about how none of us understand her 5 slide powerpoints from stuff she got from wikipedia. She is also VERY rude. I will never take her again.,0
This is his last semester at SJU. Were going to miss him so much.Not just because of my grades (haha) but also the kind person he was.Hes so funny in class.Teachs the material but is laid back.Good Luck Dr. Woods.,1
"Dr. Leonard might be a nice person maybe outside of school, but I feel that he does not actually teach the course material. Every class he talked about random subjects, and honestly i wasted my time attending. I showed up to class for the participation grade and it was still average. Im sorry but i would not advise you to take his class",0
"I took Dr. Exums online professionalism class and it is a walk in the park. He makes it clear at the beginning of the semester what he expects from the class (which isnt much lol). You simply go about doing the weekly modules on canvas, turn them in every Sunday, and can even work up to two weeks ahead. Overall good learning experience.",1
"Professor Lawrence is positive and encouraging. He gives constructive feedback and doesn't hesitate to praise good work. He does takes a while to grade sometimes, however.",1
Great Professor and human being!,1
"Your grade is completely dependent on 4 exams. There were a handful of people that got D's on all of them, failing the class. She also has a very heavy accent which makes it frustrating at times when you can't understand the lecture half the time. If you're not good at test taking then do not take this prof!",0
"good professor but i feel like the tests were very hard . i couldn't even find one test answer on google , google didn't even know the answer . only 1 attempt on test online",1
No need to buy the book if you attend class and just take notes on what classmates bring up. Can be very hard to follow what he says because he tends to ramble but the entire class grade is based on three papers that are fairly simple and as long as you put in effort you will get an A.,1
"not exaggerating, this prof is an absolute nightmare. I saw the ratings on this website and took her class anyway, and I regret it. I've never seen a professor with a more bizarre class arrangement (how does it make sense to do a reverse class), and I've never had a professor be so angry and petty with students with genuine questions and confusion.",0
"not the best at explaining the material, but he knows his stuff though",1
"He has a very strict grading criteria, and very restrictive essays. He doesn't  always explain what he wasn't too well, or leave room for creativity or anything that diverges from his viewpoints.",0
"Quote to class handing back an ESSAY exam: ""I am satisfied that the marks given reflect the answer key. Do not ask me to revisit your exam and the grade"". Her essay questions are subjective and not specific but still expects exact answers. Marking is not objective. Defensive and snide if you politely ask how you can improve. And she's an Educ prof?",0
"Although to many Anthropology is a pretty boring topic, Pacheco gets into his lectures and makes you want to go to class, he's funny, and sometimes sarcastic but wants you to succeed. He will always tell you what to expect on his tests and makes it known that you have to read in order to do well. I highly recommend taking any of his classes!",1
Worst class ever,0
"She is a very hard prof and doesn't seem very interested in her students. I fact one time I asked her a question and all she said was I do not understand why you don't get it, as someone else. I felt this was very rude and honestly it upset me.",0
"All I can say is he's OK. He gets through the material by following the book during lectures. Nice guy, but an average professor. Memorize symptoms, symptoms and more symptoms out of the book/wikipedia.",1
"Do not take this teacher. He is a nice guy but gives very hard tests. He does clicker questions every class and even though he says if u get 80% right he gives full credit, you will most likely not get 80%. This should be an easy A class but is no where near it. Take the other professor.",0
"Our grades were four tests, an argument, and a brief. There were also 4 extra-credit quizzes that each offered 6 extra points. All of the course content was immediately available to us at the beginning of the term, so we could complete it on our own time, which was awesome. He seems like a great prof, I wish I could've taken in person.",1
"His lecture pace can be slow at times, but that means that he rarely, if ever, goes through something you don't understand too quickly. Assignments aren't particularly easy, but he can explain complex structures in a way that you completely understand them. Plus a religion formed around worshipping him so that's cool too.",1
"Easy Class. His notes are exactly whats going to be on the test. Some of them he doesn't even change the numbers around. Entire Grade is based off 3 test 30 points each. if you just study your notes you will be fine. If your a finance major, your're not going to learn anything, so if you want to learn I would reconsider taking this class",0
He had some interesting political views. He was passionate about what he taught which was good. He is kind of a stubborn guy regarding how he teaches. I found I just could not keep up with what he was saying in the lecture so I mostly studied the book but I still earned from his lectures.,1
"Eugene was awesome. No textbook, no tests. Its just a discussion and he always comes to class so prepared. He really is the sweetest man and just wants to educate everyone. We do online postings twice a week but they aren't hard. Have fun with it, he's hilarious!",1
worst prof in my life. hardest test which was 54 avg even it was open book test. maybe he's good career man but worst at teaching.,0
"For any class he teaches, Helmreich moves very fast during class and it's easy to fall behind. He really knows his stuff though and he's a great guy. His tests aren't crazy and he's very generous with partial credit. Calc homework is all online and helpful. Don't buy the textbook! You won't use it and you get a digital version buying online access.",1
This class is a hard class in general but Amenta made it a little more bearable. If you go to her office she explains everything for you. Don't be afraid to ask for help. ,1
"took him for new realism-modernism and two senior seminars. he's by far the most knowledgeable, interesting, and capable english professor at trinity. he's very very helpful outside of class and it's really not that much work. yea he lectures alot, but only in lower division. when you go higher its much more seminaresque. TAKE HIM!",1
"Professor Kim is the most terrible professor I ever had. He is very unapproachable when you ask him questions; he usually tells the student that he/she should have already known the answer to his/her own question in middle school. Most times after doing an intricate problem on the board, he does not ask if we have any questions and simply says that",0
"Took both the Kant and Hegel classes. Really great lecturer, not always clear but very few other profs have so much depth as well as breadth of knowledge. Though the material is extremely difficult, he grades pretty easily as long as you make an effort. If you want to hear a good rant/have a laugh, ask about Nietzsche",1
This was easily one of my top three favorite professors. I learned so much in her class! The discussions really sparked deep thought and helped change perspective on different things. She was very helpful and genuinely wanted her students to succeed. Easily one of the best classes I've ever taken. I love her and her teaching style!,1
"The modules were very poorly written (and then obviously not checked for spelling and grammar mistakes). It is very interesting material, but I had to learn everything from the textbook because the modules were inadequate and provided very little information. She makes the assignment as vague as possible, and it's a gamble what mark you will get.",0
"Igo's lectures are next to useless yet her exams are difficult. I believe she resuses some test questions from past and other professors' exams (don't quote me on this, though). However, doing a bunch of practice exams helped a bunch. Nota Bene readings were only slightly helpful, and discussion was a waste of time. Anyway, avoid if possible.",0
Good professor. Lectures are long but she has good examples. Homework and tests are straightforward.,1
Prof. Nagy puts the history professors to shame,1
this course is already tough and the both profs make it not any easier. i thought martin would be better than adomait. they both know their stuff but suck at teaching,0
"professor is rude and unprofessonal. He reduced my grades becuase I infomred him about a typo on his quiz. He send too many long, rude and useless emails throughtout the course. He force you to pay for his outdated website in order to get grades in his class. His lectures are long, boring and useless. AVOID him as much as you can.",0
Don't take an 8 am with Snipes; it'll just make her class even tougher,1
"I'm a marketing major and was pretty excited to take this course. I think it would've been a very good course to take if I had taken it with someone else. It's somewhat interesting and easy to follow in the beginning, but after the first test, everything goes downhill. It gets very difficult very quickly and he doesn't care if you're behind. ",0
Professor Wellborn is a fantastic teacher. I wanted to go to class and looked forward to the way he was going to present the material. I recommend him for all types of students just because of how vast his knowledge is of history and his passion for the subject. Extremely approachable and wants to see his students succeed.,1
"To put it simply, broke my love for painting.",0
"Dr. Johnson is fantastic.  For such dry material she makes a real effort to make it entertaining.  The lectures can be long, but the power points are key to doing well.  Pay attention to the examples she uses in class. She gets your grades back VERY QUICKLY, which I love. Don't buy the book!",1
"The class is entirely built on rambling lectures. Typically, I can deal with this, but often the lectures are breathless. Taking notes feels more like working as a court reporter than a student. His ""projects"" are actually pop quizzes. Doesn't check his email. If you're not free for his office hour, good luck ever accessing him.",0
"Very helpful, and usually very nice!",1
"Nice guy, but by far he is one of the hardest markers I have had. I am a third year and for a 200 level course he marks it like a 400. If you dont mind hard marking, hes the one for you. Hes a nice guy and lecture notes are posted online.",1
"She wasnt that bad, the class was easy but her grading scale is crazy. She's not extremely helpful but for the most part a nice lady.  There's not really another option though, she's usually the only teacher for Social Theory.  Go to class every day and you'll do fine.",0
Made rude comments,0
"Almost impossible to fail this class, a class curve of B- brought my grade to an A+. There was also extra credit posting to class forumn.",1
Prof. Nofz is excellent! She spends time with students to ensure that their work is perfect. She offers office hours outside of class and responds quickly to emails. The class schedule is concise and she sticks to it. She welcomes honors students and is flexible with honors project ideas. Be sure to practice outside of class and do all homework.,1
"She doesn't lecture so much as read slides as she stares at her shoes. Despite being asked on multiple occasions by the class to use a microphone, she continued to just mumble quietly so no one could hear. Seemed to have no idea what was going on.",0
"Plusieurs vont l'adorer, mais il n'est pas pour tout le monde.  N'est pas accessible par courriel, n'est pas clair. Donne de mauvais conseils pédagogiques (ex: dit de ne jamais relire ou annoter les lectures (???) ) et est contre tout ce qui est formel, jusqu'à l'absurdité.  Est ''ouvert d'esprit'' mais judgmental. Avoir un A+ est très facile.",0
she is horrible and rude. i would never take her for another math class ever again. choose other professors if possible,0
"Professor Will, as he goes by, is a very tough professor, but this isn't a bad thing. I had to work hard for the grade I got, but I feel that my understanding of calculus is just a bit better because of it. He's extremely helpful and understanding of circumstances. You won't regret taking him as long as you're willing to put in a bit extra effort.",1
Dr. Herzog is a great professor to take if you are looking for an extra class to take. He gives a lot of extra credit so take advantage of it when you can.,1
Great Pro~easy to get high mark~usually the test r very similiar to textbook problems~n' always reply to students questions and explain it~Luv it!,1
"best possible professor anyone could ever ask for. creates such a kind atmosphere within the classroom, and truly does her best to make the class as enjoyable as possible. always has a smile on her face, and cares deeply for her students. all around a wonderful and delightful person, as well as a respectable and capable instructor. please take her.",1
"Professor Ni brings a lot of knowledge to his classes. Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism all find a place in his analysis of Western philosophy, and it's organic, not forced. Sometimes it's hard to get him to understand your difficulty with a problem, in class or outside. I suggest emailing him with questions. ",1
"Well... the only course that I never did well in. The content was poorly organized, lectures were impossible to follow, and I didn't learn a thing. The only way I survived was by cheating from quizzes given the previous year- YES! they are pretty similar",0
"Nice woman, but her art projects are really weird, take it if you're creative",1
"This class made my brain hurt. I was never exposed to philosophy before, but Law made me rethink many of my basic assumptions. I don't think my world will ever be the same. Question everything seems to be his MO. And that was just what I needed. Keep up with the book and readings.  Take notes.  And study the terms on the review guide he gives you.",1
"Please please please read ALL handouts given in class. There is no textbook for the class (well there is, but we don't read from it), so the handouts are the textbook. Write notes well and study well. This was an absolutely amazing class. He is an awesome teacher. His class was full EVERYday. I am now interested in law because of him.",1
"English is my best subject but Ian made me hate it. I considered switching majors after taking this class with him. Only graded us on attendance, participation and three essays.",0
hes so hard that i have to drop his class,0
She is very sweet but I will be honest and say I didnt learn much this semester. Everything we covered I learned in AP Psych in high school which I got credit for. She uses a lot of comics that I feel are unnecessary sometimes and doesnt go in depth about the topics. Easy GPA booster if thats what youre looking for.,0
"He is not fair. I was expecting an A and I received a B. I never felt so treated unfairly like he did to me. He does not help, does not listen. I truly hated his class. It was his fault that my GPA went down.",0
Arrogant,0
This prof is unorganized! His slides aren't labelled properly and he is horrible at explaining material in a clear and concise manner. I would not recommend this course.,0
Best math teacher by far... he makes things easy to understand and makes learning fun. He is the funniest teacher ive ever had.,1
You need to read the text to do well on the exams (3-non cumulative). He says the answers are right in front of you (multiple choice).  You have to read to know what they are though. He tries to stimulate class discussion in weird ways.  He'll know your name the minute you walk in and use you in wierd examples.,1
"Why does a prof ever wanna give students hard times like this?? The average of his midterm has been 65-ish for years (worths 35% of the total grade), and he never curves. The average grade I receive for my assignments is 70-75 (Highlight: I go to office hours to talk about the homework EVERY TIME before handing it in...) A or A- is just impossible",0
"I wouldn't take this class if you aren't interested in the topic. It is a lot of heavy reading 35-65 pages for a class period. Lectures are discussion based and not well organized. The professor is really nice and kind, but kind of boring. ",1
She is a terrible teacher and spends most of the class talking about her problems. Her attendance is mandatory so you have no choice but to spend hours listing to her talk about her mother-in-law for hours. She gives no clear guidelines for projects and just expects you to figure it out on your own.,0
"Very caring. He was a fairly tough grader, but not too bad. VERY passionate.",1
She is often unprepared for class and none of her directions are clear. She expects you to know things without telling you. She literally makes no sense.,0
"Extemely intelligent and insiteful woman.  Fantasic teacher, failed acct 1 then took her and got an A-  Makes students enjoy the subject and applies it to everyday situations.  Also, doesn't hurt that she is quite attractive :)",1
"Professor Zipf is a very nice woman, but her classes are terrible. She is a verbal teacher and there are no power-points. Her blackboard exams are really hard. A lot of the people n my class hardly passed. One good thing was, at the end of the grading period she changed around her grading % to make everyone have a higher grade.",0
She is a great instructor for a difficult class. She's there to answer any questions you have and is extremely helpful if you put in the effort. Not to mention she is pretty funny during lectures.,1
"He is very condescending towards students, asking for feedback is impossible as he just provides long-winded explanations that tell you that if you don't agree with his opinions, then you are wrong. He is rude and makes students feel small. I would not recommend taking a course with him.",0
Trina is probably one of the best professors I have taken at Pima. Don't hesitate to ask for help or go into office hours because she will sit with you until you get the material. There is a clear outline of what is expected at the beginning of the semester. Her lectures are a little heavy but she makes it all make sense if you ask questions.,1
"Professor Bruce is a nice old man, but this class is painfully boring. I took it during maymester so I had to fight myself from falling asleep for two hours every day. The material is not hard, just read the book and powerpoint slides he provides. I got an A- with minimum effort.",0
"When choosing my classes for the spring semester, I took into account reviews from this website. I read reviews of both praise and admonishment. But, after the first few classes with him I recognized that he has true passion and truly cares for his students. yes there is a lot of work but, he helps alot with conferences before an essay is due.",1
"Attendance is really important to her, and she often calls on the quiet kids. Her lectures are really boring and she's quite condescending, but I don't think it's intentional. She's a nice person, but not such a good professor.",0
Her test were way to hard and had tricky wording. Her study guides were not the best either so that was no help. Wouldn't recommend her if you have a busy schedule!,0
he acts like he cares about you and your grades but he really does not. Says he's a lenient marker and gives partial makes but that's just a lie. he will never be satisfied with your answers and will easily fail you in portions,0
"Lots of reading with an extremely high vocabulary, & are controversial & boring. Short replies that make you feel stupid for asking questions. High point quizzes that contain large essays that are due in 4 hours once opened & you can only open these ONCE. Very strict, unreasonable, & hypocritical w/ deadlines (modules taking forever to be updated).",0
"Dr. Bohanans class is lecture heavy. She doesnt allow phones out, but her lectures are far from boring. Attendance is taken through an assigned seating chart and if you show up consistently, shell bump your grade at the end of the semester. She has a few reading questions on each exam, but you could definitely get an A without reading at all.",1
"Daily homeworks and quizzes add up, but the presentations are most crucial. She is really scary, but if you just overlook it it's fine. If you ask her a question that can be answered on moodle or the syllabus, she will not answer you. loves depreciating kids when they present. Might not shower or change ever.",0
"Professor Mellema is very kind but definitely past his prime in teaching. Class is mainly lectures except for some exercises done in class but he reads directly out of the books. The three tests, (especially the final!) are generally short and weighted very heavily.",0
"Love this guy! He's really nice and offers extra credit, at least he did this semester. He also let us turn in stuff late if he forgot to remind us about an assignment. We were behind on the syllabus a lot, but nobody really minded. Tests and quizzes are heavily based off of lecture; he'll throw in a few questions from the textbook. ",1
Very analytical. Looks at history from an interesting perspective. Tests are reasonable but hes a tough essay grader. Awesome guy!,1
"Excellent prof, expérience hors du commun. Très drôle !",1
ok,0
"I think that he is a good professor.  Its true he does threaten a bit too much for my tastes and it can be stressful, but in general it seems he really cares if the students learn.  I ended up learning a lot in his class.",1
"Professor Simcoe is a fantastic professor and really challenges you to learn the fundamentals of art and its foundations. Even though his class is very difficult, it challenges you in a positive way if you are planning on becoming an artist. However, if you want an A, you will have to really work for it.",1
"History 225 is a hard class. Dr. Hardwick gives weekly discussion board questions and a 10 page paper for the midterm/final. While it was difficult at times, I really felt like benefitted from this class.",1
"Ignacio made my first semester at CSUF so much easier and enjoyable. He is truly inspirational and his smile is contagious. He truly cares about his students. If you can take him, do it. I promise you won't regret it. (He also shares a lot of pics of his cat Nims, so if you like cat pics you'll like this class.)",1
"some of the questions on the midterm are off the study guide. if you don't like history i wouldn't recommend it, boring class.",0
"Worst professor I've ever had. Stuck with him with only one quarter left before graduation. Might have to withdraw and take 5 classes my last quarter. His tests are HARD and horrible, he must always be right, he takes half a quarter before talking about BUSINESS ethics...worst class ever...DO NOT TAKE",0
Rarely in class this semester but it was still easy,1
Participation is really important. Gives you homework about stuff that you haven't even learned yet. A lot of break out rooms.,0
"INCREDIBLE! No other word to describe this man. He is very intelligent and caring, not bad on the eyes either. No textbook or tests-- 15 min assignments due every class, roll is taken, and there's a term paper. Even though there were no tests or book I learned more from this class than any other class I've taken at CSUSB. Amazing professor.",1
"Prof Maynard realizes that NSCI 300 is a capstone class and not everyone is interested in science.  With that in mind, he prepares a lecture that highlights the path technology has taken and the unforeseen consequences of scientific advancements.  The class is very easy, Idid not attend once after the midterm.  Do the extra credit.",1
"Her lectures were dry and boring . As long as you show up and hand in the work you can get a solid B or A. She is a tough grader and gives a lot of handouts, fyi.",0
"wonderful prof. dynamic, inspiring. but tough. does not accept mediocrity. will push you to do your best",1
"He teaches like we're in middle school. For some, that might be nice, but his tests are way harder than the homework or the material covered in class. He was also very disorganized and he's obsessed with making us work in groups. One of our tests was a group test. I'm a senior and this is the first time I've ever had a group test.",0
"lectures are basically just him taking about music, only covers about 50% of test material, he does not even mention exams during lecture because he doesn't even know what is on them. curves a lot and tests are taken at the testing center which is a pain to get to. there are much easier history breadths to take.",0
"His class made me change my major to Finance. He is hard to understand but just show up to earn credit (he passes attendance randomly). 5% EC offered. Homework  Chegg. He allows a cheatsheet, so take advantage! His ""study guide"" is the review questions, which are highly similar to test questions. Read the book. I did these steps and have an A.",1
"Dr. Burns presented the material for the course in a well formatted/logical way. He provides all the lecture slides, however he does add material in the lecture. He also shows a lot of clinical videos which are beneficial to understand Psychopathology. Test are not difficult if you are in class for the videos and lectures, and do some reading.",1
"This course had a very applied approach. It was based on group work and presenting solutions to real life problems. Ed offers good insights into the field of I/O Psychology, especially the I side, and this is very enriching. He is also available outside of class if you have any questions. Overall, great experience!",1
"Kimsey teaches this class like individual scom even though it is group. You get a group, but presented on your own. I literally didn't learn anything. He did not teach, so going to his class was a huge waste of my time. Expected my class to get an A on the midterm and final, but didn't teach. Grading is confusing.",0
very very good,1
"An intelligent man who has trouble conveying the material.  The overheads aren't much help and he mumbles throughout the lecture, but if you do all the homeworks and understand all the questions on the practice exams, you should do well.",1
"The content she teaches is interesting, but she has ideas about intersectionality and all the problems with that way of thinking (if you know what I mean). Go into her class with skepticism and do not allow yourself to be swayed. People are individuals, not their cultural identity. Just because she is a professor doesn't mean she absolute.",0
"I waited 3 semesters for this class to become available but regret taking it. Keyes is a subpar prof. Participation is required but she berates students if she does not agree w/ them. 2 tests w/ 10 questions, mostly on details hardly discussed in class. She became more hostile throughout semester. Dreaded going to every class.",0
"You just copy powerpoints in class. His tests are pretty much 50% class notes, 50% books. His tests are pretty easy and  if you recognize what all the terms mean, you'll do fine. Theres always curves on his tests. Go to class, take notes, pay attention and you'll be fine",1
"very vague due dates. The due dates on blackboard are outdated , so i found it a little difficult to get organized with this class, which is important for me because im doing other classes and working full time. Theres a lot of reading but i never read all of it. i only read the material that is needed for the blogs and discussions. Few tests.",0
"He is a very helpful professor. We transitioned to zoom because of corona and he has been so accessible and always loves when you participate. He doesn't really specifically teach you certain verb tenses or things like that, but encourages you to ask him about them.",1
This was the worst class I've taken at ODU. She loves the material but if you don't you will struggle with it. She is a harsh grader and gives very little clarification on why you received the grade you did. There are not many graded assignments in the course and so the Final paper ends up being 50% of the grade!,0
The textbook was one she wrote herself so she did not talk much in lectures. There are lots of group projects and they are heavily loaded (you also need to do so much individual work for the group work to count towards your grade) and her papers are worth a lot. She also uses a lot of tables in all her assignments which do not help much at all.,0
She is a awesome teacher that will help you if you need it. TAKE HER !!!!,1
"Attendance is required and as a measure of attendance she often gives, essentially, quizzes which are often far more difficult than the level of material we have covered in class.  Not a great teacher, just reads off slides.  Tests include detailed questions on topics we barely covered.",0
"Worst teacher I've ever had! Do not expect  him to be of any help to you during the course.  His ""lectures"" are nothing more than choppy random bits of info he's reading off a worksheet.  Do not take Mr. Hoagland! Seems to expect you to know everything right when you start too D:",0
Skip if possible.,0
Can't understand what he says. He speaks way too soft and lectures are incredibly boring. Also goes on long tangents and is a tough grader.,0
"Had her for 166 (Black Science Fiction) last semester and she's just amazing! She's super helpful and caring during office hours, and she taught a large amount of material/background in a clear and coherent manner that made it easy to understand. She's on the tougher end when it comes to grading papers, but it's totally fair. Favorite prof!",1
"Very sweet woman, but you are highly mistaken if you take any senior seminar with her and assume it will be about psychology. Her classes are discussion based, but all you can really discuss is how she feels about either the liberal agenda, feminism, or the environment. There are no assignments other than 4 10+ page papers, and a TON of reading.",1
Incredible teach. I have nothing but respect for this guy. I definitely recommend him.,1
"A brutally honest, cynical, and self-interested professor. This is good or bad depending on your own sense of humour. He is entertaining, but unclear enough to get a full education on the basics of psyc. Read the textbook, consult the TA's, and then rely on Herrmann for a laugh at the lectures.",0
He is very difficult grader. You need to show up to every class or you will not pass. He gives out to exams and if you do not write word for word what he says in class he will take points off. He talks way too fast. I would suggest recording his class. I would not recommend taking his class.,0
"I didn't go to class on Fridays ever and I still ended up with an A in the class. He really facilitates free discussion and wants you to get something out of the class. He doesn't grade the papers too harshly, and gives you plenty of opportunities to raise your grade. I would recommend his class to everyone.",1
"Mike is one of my favorite professors at Xavier! He cares about his students and the topic he teaches. Anatomy is somewhat difficult, not because Mike makes it hard, but because it is a detailed field of study on its own. Mike does his best to guide you to success and what all of his students to grasp the information. Great professor to take!!",1
"I really enjoyed this course. And for some it may seem like it was hard, but coming from all my Civil Eng classes it wasn't that bad. He is a pleasant and very well cultured man with lots of interesting stories/wisdom. It was my favourite elective and if you put decent effort in and take notes you will get an A.",1
"Excellent prof! Clear lectures, friendly, easy to approach, helpful during office hours. Best chemistry prof I've ever had!",1
Amazing instructor,1
Kane-McGuire is amazing!  He is a great professor and his tests cover exactly what he taught in class!  Definitely take his class if possible!!,1
"For a second year survery course, the course was way too specific.  She seemed to repeat the same points over and over.",0
"Professor McAdam is awesome. He might seem fairly daunting at first but he's a surprisingly fun guy. Lectures are for the most part entertaining at the least, even though not everyone will find them exciting. Decently hard marker, nothing crazy though. If you do your readings and attend class, the essays should be a breeze. Definitely recommended.",1
"Was a B student in French before O'Hagan and now I am barely passing. I think he makes his tests much harder than any previous teachers I have had. Same goes for his compositions, which are very difficult and marks hard on them.    50 % for a final? And at his difficulty? good bye gpa :( Avoid if you can.",0
"Took his 315 course also, good professor, he has it all set up online and makes the easy to understand. A lot of work but this is college. I would recommend his class.",1
Literally the worst professor I have ever had!!! She is not clear at all of what you are suppose to be doing. There is a research project that is the span of the class and she doesn't let you know what to do until the day before it is due and then gets mad that you didn't start it months earlier. ,0
"Very understanding, final was optional. Easy A if you put in effort, Reimer is easy to work with if you need help. Lots of opportunities for extra credit. Really great prof and a cool guy, 10/10 would take another class with him. 3 tests, short quizzes almost every week, attendance, and oral exam. Lots to keep your grade up if you miss something.",1
"I took a class with Ms Walker 36 years ago. She's an engaging lecturer, encourages discussion, is available outside of class and gives excellent feedback on assignments. All the things you expect of a prof. More importantly, she taught me how to think, to question, and to write effectively. Take her class - any class - you will not be disappointed.",1
He has a very strong accent and I have felt as though he does not want to help his students. He moves on without working with you. Terrible,0
"If you really want to learn, dont take this class. She teaches the class like if its a middle school math class. She moves on to fast and doesnt make the lessons clear and understandable. So much homework . Horrible math professor",0
Great energy and is a lot fun to have as a professor. Never a dull moment in class esp. when it is a speech day!,1
"In my opinion, it doesn't matter what teacher you take for statistics because the class is really hard and it sucks! So fair warning unless you're really smart or just like math you have a 1 in 10 chance of passing (and that's a term from stats I actually learned called probability!)",1
"Dr. DeMicco really is a professor that cares about his students. He doesn't ruin your life with meaningless work. His class is stimulating. He loves study abroad and will help any student with recommendations. If you have a problem at all, just go to him. He is eager to help students and wants you to succeed. Very reasonable and likable guy.",1
This class is not terrible but his teaching style is so dry I have to drink a large coffee to stay awake most days. I recommend taking the online course but overall it is an easy A as long as you do well on the exams,0
"She seems like a nice person, but this was the hardest class I have ever taken in my college career. She writes using chalk and in cursive, and doesn't follow the schedule she made and changes it constantly. We ended up teaching ourselves in groups in between classes or in the tutor lab bc things go so fast. Smart prof - but intimidating.",1
"Dr. Nollet is a good first year teacher, especially for Discrete. People have also said good things about his Calc 2. He is a little scatter-brained, but it isn't so bad that you can't understand him. He also enjoys teaching the class. Homework at the end of every section, but it is very manageable, and it helps you study. Quiz with each homework.",1
"Professor Dahlberg's intro-physics class became progressively more challenging as the semester went on. Nonetheless, he was very supportive in class during lecture and at his weekly problem-solving sessions. If you read the textbook before coming to class, you'll find lectures to be more meaningful. Lastly, the class curve was very generous.",1
"I may be speaking too early, as we have only had one exam, but Bull is a great professor. Although attendance isn't mandatory, I would strongly recommend going to class for at least looking at the lectures online- its free and will immensely help you on the exams.  As for the tests, just study the past exams (which he gives you) and you'll be fine!",1
He is a very good teacher that is hilarious.,1
"I took his class during the Winter session. He Gives about 6-10 hours of video lectures (boring for non-art history majors) and 90% of his class is exams. You can just use the book for lectures as they are identification, but for exams you must understand the significance of the art piece. Only take the class if you have excellent time management.",1
"Exams are around 80-100 questions and are really narrow, you need to really read and take notes on the chapters before class for when he calls on you. You can do well but you really need to devote a lot of time and effort.",0
Always rushed.  Never took the time to explain everything.  Exam harder than average.,0
"She is inconsistent, insensitive and rude.  She pretends to use the textbook even the the large majority of the course material is common sense.  She is, ironically, difficult to communicate with.  She does NOT listen during speeches and makes rude comments.  She is a terrible professor. STAY AWAY",0
Professor Cramer is a saint among men. He's very understanding when it comes to unforeseen situations sometimes plague students and late assignments. By far one of my favorite professors at Suffolk.,1
Very great professor. Greg knows his stuff. acts like a student which is why the bond between students and him are great. you could talk to him about ANYTHING. really great,1
Be prepared to have your mind blown his lectures are so interesting and infuriating how nothing is being done about the problems in the world. He is very caring and he is always making sure were good for nothing is wrong. We only had to write two essays a midterm and final and group projects.,1
"Do not take if you wanna pass , no matter how good in math you are",0
Prof is absolute genius. This class perked my interest in multiple subjects due to the nature of his lectures. Hard work but worth the effort.,1
HE is really good teacher. Highly recommended.just do your homework regularly n u will be fine...;),1
She gave 3 assignments for the whole semester. three.,0
Dry lectures for morning class. No exams but the encyclopedia is a pain since your grade depends on that. I wish I dropped this class. Get ready to take lots of notes and work hard for that A,0
"Hes awesome.  One of my favorite professors/classes of all time.  I took this as an elective and loved it.  Theres little to no homework.  The ""big"" project is a joke because he essentially does it in class for you.  Take great notes and your a lock for an A/B easy.  Grades are curved up to about an 80 (if needed).  I highly recommend.  Helpful!",1
Stick figure diagrams and sentence fragments on the board. If that isn't your learning style there is little recourse. I've always struggled to absorb a lecture and take worthwhile notes at the same time so I almost went crosseyed. For the final 15 people pooled their notes and pieced together his lectures like a lost ark. Please give note hndouts!,1
a ticking time bomb of a teacher. you never know when she's going to pick on you and embarrass you. she offers extra credit and test corrections sometimes. not a class for people who aren't good at math,0
I took Professor Sicilian for my senior econ project and learned almost nothing in his class. He has a hard time staying on topic and often jumps from tangent to tangent making it almost impossible to listen to him lecture. His grading criteria is very unclear and he grades tough. Avoid if possible!,0
Awful as a lab prof for online learning. Provides no support or detail for lab assignments. The lab exam was difficult and kinda unfair and has questions relating to in-person labs which we couldn't do.,0
"Avoid him if you can! I was scared to take his class because of everything I read here, but I did anyways because other options didn't fit into my schedule. I absolutely regret it. I should have taken it in the next semester.",1
"Seriously one of the best professors I had throughout my years here. He is busy with work outside of school, but will ALWAYS make time for his students. I was able to discuss with him literally anything that I had concerns about related to the coursework or questions in the psychology realm like grad school. Helped me out so much!",1
Took class with him in Fall 2011. He was paired up with Eileen Kelly.He taught the policing portion of the class. He was the easier of the two professors. Everything he lectured on or told you that would be on the test. Read the required materials and you'll be ok.,1
"Dr Crumpler isn't the best at explaining. He gives plenty of examples and practice but his exams are a whole other thing. He'll go over something for 5 minutes and then put it on a test. Have questions? well, better protect your pride because this man will make you feel stupid with his unnecessary commentary.",0
Every class I have taken is an Easy A show up and turn the few assignments in on time and you will be good! EXW 214/ EXW 460,1
"She's so vague and anything you hand in she rips apart with red pen. You could re do a draft a million times and she still wouldn't ""understand"" it",0
She's very unhelpful. Don't take her class and avoid her at all costs!,0
"This woman is MEAN. I worked hard and made an A, so it can be done. Terrible experience though....",0
Jeff is a great guy! He offers alot of help and I had him for PPS so the class was insanely easy to begin with. Do the work and it isnt hard my little sister could probably pass the class but Bryant has to have a intro computer course so take this guy and you'll do fine. The only thing I didn't like was it was at 8am,1
Very unhelpful. Office hours are not worth the time as he doesn't provide much help. First one to dash out of class before students. Self-centered. No courtesy or respect towards student as he makes a fool out of individuals publicly with no constructive criticisms. A waste of your time,0
"Dr. Besing is one of the best professors I've ever had. He's always willing to help you outside of class, and while his classes are a lot of work, you'll get a lot out of them if you're willing to do it. His lectures are very high value, and really worth attending. His sense of humor is unique, but he can be funny. Occasionally.",1
"He does not make us do assignments(practicals), instead of that he make us take stupid quizzes, which we cant even review. Don't take him unless you are out of options.",0
"very picky...gives natives the benifit of the doubt...picks favortites. you can't have ur own opinon, just write what he says and you'll do fine",1
Professor Dunlap is really nice and truly loves teaching. She is very helpful and understanding if you need help. Short assignments and 3 exams. The exams can be a little tricky but the assignments are graded very generously so it balances out.,1
This is the worst class I have ever taken at Marist. I can tell you the guys life story and travel itinerary and that's about it. No real culture discussed. His midterm was not fair at all and the class is based on a TV show which takes 3 hours an episode to watch by time the VPN that you pay $40 for works. WORST CLASS EVER AVOID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
Wow what an amazing class. Not! The longest most boring thing youll ever do. This course is like watching paint dry and you get just about as much information from both. Professor Thompson shouldve retired 20 years ago. He will mumble on forever reading power points that have nothing to do with the actual tests. failure in action.,0
Expect you know everything and doesnt give much help,0
"BEST PROFESSOR EVER, TAKE HIM. When I saw I was going to have to take a legal class I thought it was going to be boring as hell, but his class is far from that. I actually looked forward to going to his class. Wish he would teach more classes in business so I could take them. Easy and informative classes, show up, listen, no stress.",1
A very nice man who loves his subject.,1
"very unwilling to admit error, doesn't seem happy to see students succeed, not helpful, plays favorites, and is uncomfortable infront of large groups.  may be great one to one in a clinical setting, but she does NOT excell in passing on her knowledge.",0
"Stay away! writes on the board faster than you can write and finishes a problem before you while you are copying.  She gets aggravated when you dont grasp concepts.  Uses MathXL for all homeworks, but doesnt always teach everything that is on it.  She will make you want to cry.",0
"She is a very clear teacher that makes the subject relatively easy to learn, however you need to work hard.  She teaches off of PowerPoints that you fill in, so it's easy to follow.  Dr. Vanderzalm is always willing to help.  Highly recommend.",1
"Teaches using stock powerpoints, she's very boring and monotone, be prepared to teach yourself (as another student has stated), lots of HW. She also using this app to take attendance, it's required b/c attendance is 10% of your grade, the catch is the app costs $15! Why should I have to pay to attend when I'm already paying 100s of $ for the class?",0
I had Blackman for bio lab and she is very disorganized. Her grading criteria is not very clear and she doesn't give much feedback. Her disorganization is the reason I did so well in the class. She would get behind on grading and end up dropping assignments or giving everyone an A.,0
Great advisor and great head of the department.  Always is coming up with usefull things to make his graduates the most qualified in the entry level applicant categoies.,1
"Hey, lets put this guy in charge of the honors program so he can make the smart kids fulfill a ridiculous range of random requirements instead of concentrating on their major!",0
"Carol Roberts is many things, a good C++ professor is not one of them. After finishing COS220 and AP Java with an A, I felt unprepared for this class. Assignments are extremely vague and the TA is available for tutoring only 2 hrs a week and his room is always packed. She 'encourages' questions but ridicules you if she's already covered the topic.",0
"Deb Pharo is by far the worst teacher I have had. Her lectures are made up of questions that do not pertain to what we are learning at all. There is a ton of work to be done in her class that it leaves little time for other classes. She is extremely rude and will refuse to help by saying ""you should already know this."" DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!",0
"Very unhelpful in this class. I worked my butt off and still did not do very well. Tried talking to her on a regular basis to try and improve, and she was little to no help. She was very difficult to follow on lecture, and usually jumped around to where I couldn't follow her at all. The tests seemed to cover a lot of material not covered in class. ",0
she is a gr8 teacher,1
"Awesome professor! I am terrible at math in general and she made me understand math topics I had failed in high school. Shes very good at explaining things and will take time to make sure every student is on board and clear with what is being taught before moving on. Had her for MAT 111, take her you wont regret it!",1
My conscious counter has definitely been increased from this class ;),1
"he was a rly good french teacher but he is also a very hard marker. Though when he teaches you see that he's passionate about it. He can have some interesting stories to tell the class when he goes off topic, which is often. :)",1
"I took a two semester course with Stephanie. While the course was difficult, she did her best to make sure everyone understood. If you are confused, raise your hand! The tests are lengthy, requiring the entire class length. STUDY HARD!! I received an A both semesters, so it is possible. Overall I like her.",1
"Thoroughintetesting, and understandable lectures. Ample office hours. Gives extra advice to help you bring your grade up. Carong and concerned teacher.",1
Furlong's lectures are super unclear and he goes off on tangents.,0
"Zeb is a great professor and very solid choice for INFO 300. He is very knowledgeable on the subject at hand due to his experience at VCUHS, and he sets up his students for a career in IT. Take him.",1
"STAY AWAY!!! I have never in my five years of math had a professor this bad. I took this class as my last calc class to transfer. After all, everyone says business calc is the easiest to pass. And it is! except with this professor he makes it nearly impossible to get 100 on anything! he gave -3 on a test ques. because my work didn't show simplified",0
"He seems so nice at first but grading is very harsh, answers to the CM Exerc can be correct but if its not what he is looking for, well too bad he aint giving you a point! Class was via Zoom,he requires cameras and mics at all times for attendance. I dropped after two weeks,it was too much work. PLEASE dont take this class, there are other options!",0
"I've always struggled in math. Mr. Allen completely changed that. I went from hating math to enjoying it. He is SO helpful and patient. I took him twice, I cried tears of joy when I got a B+ in the first class, and then an A- in the second! I consistently failed math classes throughout my middle school/ high school career. He knows how to teach!",1
Doesn't answer questions. Can't expand on teaching material. Notes are incoherent. Keeps going back and forth between chapters just to fill time. Multiple choice tests are horribly made no chance of part Marks. Overall dont bother with this professor honestly.,0
I'm a second year and found this course to be better than expected. Dr. Trottier truly knows his subject of expertise and with a little reading before lectures the material is relatively easy to understand. Exams were tough but only if you didn't know the material - no guessing. Overall one of the best electives I've taken!,1
Amazing professor.  Even for his Psych 285 stats class.,1
I didn't believe the rumors I'd heard. I should have. Flee this class. You're still reading. Flee I said!,0
"Best college teacher I've ever had!! Had her for two of my courses. The first one, she replaced our professor, because she ""quit."" So, we only had her for half of the year, and I got a 98%. 2nd year I had her for another class, and got a 100%. She actually teaches and makes you want to go to class.",1
"Professor Joseph is extremely condescending and disrespectful towards students. She never makes her expectations clear, yet grades very harshly.",0
"I don't really understand the point of the class. It's called ""policies of crime in a hetergenous society"" but i don't recall actually talking about crime policies.. we talk about crime, just no policies.. unless i missed something.. otherwise, fairly easy, pretty boring, shouldnt be a 3 hour class",0
Be prepared to be disappointed. Not understanding in the slightest. Avoid this class like the plague. He doesn't care about his students AT ALL. I would rather take this class from a talking brick.,0
This was one of the most boring classes I have ever taken. Prof. Whitehead is the most disorganized prof I have ever come across. I can't believe she has been teaching for so many years. I would never have taken this class if it wasn't mandatory for my degree. The worst part: I HAVE to take ANTH 3000 as well. And she is the only prof who teaches it,0
"He is a good professor, very nice and personable. He is very approachable and is willing to help his students. The class is tough, and there is lots of homework, but he really tries to help his students.",1
"A little disorganized at times, but totally invested in French as a subject and lifestyle, as well as his students as individuals. Really laid back and very flexible. The nicest guy ever, and really funny.",1
"I am a science based student and anything having to do with history, economics, or government is usually difficult. To say the very least I usually struggle to pass, but this class was different. It was my first maymester class and I enjoyed it. Overall good class... alot of reading though :/",1
Wow that test was impossible and the grade adjustments were ridiculous.  And after the class average on the test was a 45% he had the nerve to tell us that everyone in the class just needs to study harder!,0
"Professor Maggie is such an amazing and kind prof. She genuinely cares about her students and loves to stimulate interesting discussions in class. Although time management was a bit of an issue in class, she was very generous and understanding to students.",1
"The class is very easy, do the work, study and you will get a good grade. Hands out study guides, take home quizzes. All you need to know are in the unit handouts. Fun class, would recommend this teacher and take another course from him again",1
"the absolute worst class I have ever taken! his class is horribly boring, it is almost painful to sit through class as I would rather poke my eye out with a pen. he dwells on stupid small points that have nothing to do with the issues and like to confuse it with some big words. take my advise don't take this class unless you have to.",0
Prof. McDonough is one of the best Professor I have ever had. She is very knowledgeable and extremely fun. She cares about her students and teaches with love and passion.,1
"Professor Appel is truly one of the best teachers I have ever had. I took her Math course at ASU and she explained everything, took the time back to respond to students questions, was quick in replying to e-mails, and made me feel like I could succeed in Math. Her teaching style shows that she really cares about her students. Best Professor!",1
Worst class Ive ever take online. So much work. Very hard. I thought this would be a GPA booster... nope.,0
"Super rude. Unprofessional. Will mark you down no matter how hard you work and put effort into an assignment. Will accuse his students of invalid stuff. Do yourself a favor and avoid. Just like COVID, keep distance from him.",0
"Love this teacher, really funny and sarcastic. Always willing to lend a helping hand! Def. take this class!",1
"Smith is a GREAT professor. His lectures are interesting with good side notes, and he can be quite humorous. He gets a bit sidetracked, but sometimes it actually enhances his teaching. Make sure you do the readings because the class discussions will be hard to get through if you don't. He is a really caring man who cares about all his students!",1
"Prof. Stewart is the BEST! She is well-educated about the topics she discusses, and can relate to many of the real world issues she teaches on. She is funny and quick-witted, and her class was always enjoyable to attend. The workload is light, with a few quizzes and weekly discussion boards, and overall very doable!",1
"This professor showed no interest in teaching and has no respect for others. His comments about religions, races, and women are very offensive. The University of Ottawa should find a more competent professor to teach a graduate level. Is is why we pay to go to grad school?",0
She was horrible from beginning to end. Told us we would use txt book but she did not teach from it at all. Didnt follow syllabis or anything. Very smart smart. Treated the class like high school students. Gave take home test on material not covered in class but was found in text book.,0
"Dull. Doesn't realize this is a Calculus course and seems to think he's in physics or electrical engineering instead. If you look at previous terms and textbook, it explains things 100000x better. Please just teach the course.",0
Grades papers quite hard for a math prof.  Doesn't really teach.  Kind of leaves discussions up to students and sits back and listens.  Pretty boring class but super easy.  Only a couple small papers.,0
Great professor with years of experience in law...I have never seen a professor so eager to teach like this one!!!! If you are still deciding on what you are going to be for the rest of your life he is great to talk to...Good luck,1
"info in class is easy, expect alot of reading, but easy grading, and he's got cute bright red floppy hair.",1
Professor Ladan was amazing and I probably learned the most from her class,1
"Laid back, small class (15 students). two blue book exams (the first is pretty easy and the final is take-home). Didn't use a book so exams were based just off powerpoints. Tends to go through them fast sometimes so it's hard to copy down everything. Gives you a big syllabus including terms and questions that the exams will cover.",1
"Hes an amazing guy and gets you excited about leadership! However, he expects a lot from you and is a tough grader on written assignments. Participation matters and it is a big portion of the grade so make sure you talk in class a lot. Also, he offers extra credit  and make sure you do it because that will help your grade a lot!",1
"Her and her husband teach this class together, which is a cool perspective because they have a lot of differing opinions so it leads to a lot of debates! My main problem is that the amount of reading expected was insane- easily 100 pages a week, sometimes more. Expected too much work for a 4 credit, intro history class.",1
Worst intro to chemistry teacher ever. Pretty sure he usually teachers upper level chems and was forced to teach this. His lectures were so confusing. You have to attend or you'll loose points. He assumes the kids know what's going on when we clearly don't according to clicker questions. Only pro is he throws chocolates at kids who answer ?'s ,0
"He is very unclear about what he expects from his students, his checklists given to study for the exams do NOT help whatsoever. Participation exercises almost every discussion period. Participation, homework, and lab is what saved my grade. This class was very hard & he did not make it any easier for the students to do well.",0
"I would not take this professor again if my only other teaching option were a dead dog. This guy constantly states the wrong things in his lectures, has his phone going off, door bell ringing, and animals in the background. But god forbid you look at your pet during an exam. Its Feb 2021 and he's using the same lectures from JUNE.",0
"This is a very difficult class. I managed to get an A, however, it was NOT easy. You must know the material like the back of your hand, or you're doomed. I highly suggest to make a study guide for every test (you are not given any info. about what is on them). Stick with it though, and you will leave knowing a LOT more than when you came in.",1
he is the man!,1
"This one separates the wheat from the chaff. If there ever was a professor/course combo that gave you an idea of what electrical engineering is all about, its this. Extremely difficult, but if you manage to learn it you will be a god. He understands this fact and decides to hit you hard and force you to learn rather then give you a rubber stamp.",1
"Anton is a very eccentric teacher, but he's passionate about the subject. If you show up to class, read and actually ask questions and everyone contributes you will do fine. Be prepared for pop quizzes.",1
"He really knows nothing about what he is teaching, go back and get an accounting or marketing degree.",0
The Best BIO 131 teacher EVER!!!,1
"This guy is awesome!  Know C like the back of hand.  But he will expect you to know it like the back of his hand too.  Very responsive to good questions, very critical of bad ones. You will be encouraged to try to answer your own questions before asking.",1
"Sweet man. Records all his lectures, so you dont have to attend. Tends to go on and on about a topic, so sometimes loses sense of time. Otherwise gives good examples and is pretty clear in lectures. 4 multiple choice tests, absolutely no assignments.",1
"Professor Lindahl is easily one of CMU's best. Plenty of extra credit opportunities, and attendance is not taken, although there are weekly ""quizzes"" that you can use notes on. You have to attend 2 concerts outside of class and write a review about them but it isn't as bad as it sounds. This is a very easy class, and Susan only helps to prove it",1
"James Walsh is a funny and great professor. We only met once a week since POLS1150 for him is a hybrid course (half online/half in person). You only get graded for the exams, CA assignments, and quizzes but if you pay attention to the book, you can easily get good grades for it. Professor Walsh also randomly give out extra credit.",1
Really great professor. He is always available to help his students and genuinely cares about helping us and making sure we do well. The class can get confusing at times so tutorials are extremely helpful. He is a very caring and genuine guy and I would take any class with him in a heartbeat. Do your work and pay attention and you'll do well.,1
"Dr. Curtis is a nice lady but her lectures are all over the place. She does not go over much in class and she makes her test extremely hard. Their are only 3 test, which is basically your whole grade, so if you do bad on one test you are screwed for the rest of the semester. I would not recommend.",0
easy A just watch the lecture videos,0
Dr. Weber is my adviser and my teacher for composition lessons. He is a really awesome guy and helps me learn about cool new compositional techniques.,1
"If you're looking for a Human Values in Art Class, this class is not for you. The class felt way too focused on world history. The class had tons of reading and hours of assigned videos per week. On top of that, every week she assigned 5 writing assignments that were graded solely on number of words written. The class was boring overall.",0
Dr. Koperski is a good teacher with a reasonable grading scale. You can tell he really enjoys what he does and is passionate about the material. Loves when students ask questions. Good professor.,1
"He knows his stuff, but he can't teach it clearly.  He's never around if you need him and his tests are completely confusing.  Don't take his class if you are not a music major.",0
Trying to stay awake in this class is painful...,0
Very strong accent but wants to see her students do well!,1
"I hated this class. Never comprehended a thing he said from the first day of class on. Crams in as many words as possible during the class and writes notes on the board that are hard to keep up with and interpret, at least for me. Save yourself the trouble - skip this class and just read the book, you'll learn more",0
"Richard seems like a smart prof, but I did not learn anything from him. I need practice questions to learn, not just someone who talks and gets off track. No mark free questions were given to practice. I am learning online through zoom and he does not answer the chat questions. If you like learning by yourself and on your own terms, he is for you.",0
"Honestly, the lectures were off-topic and unclear, grading didn't seem logical to me, and attending class was overall redundant. Bottom line, in an educative point of view, I wouldn't take this teacher a second time because I didn't learn how to improve nor was I even able understand my own mistakes.",0
"She provides lots of readings but they're all SO useful. It's heavy on moodle discussions and writing assignments, but it helps big time with helping you understand course material. Her lectures are clear and concise. I've taken her courses multiple times and have never been disappointed by her and her passion for teaching!",1
He is genuinely the best math teacher I have ever had in my life. I had him my first semester in college and I go to him when I need help even if he isn't teaching my class because he is so good at explaining.  I never felt anxiety when I knew a test was coming up. Didn't need studying if you did your homework. I love the guy.,1
"Professor Johnson is very dry in his lectures. He is willing to answer all questions, but he is not engaging at all (it's hard to stay awake!). His TAs are tough graders and all the tests are all written response and almost solely about memorization which means you forget what you learned very quickly (which is too bad!). Flashcards are a must.",0
He is a very nice teacher and his class is easy to understand. There is no homework and the class is based off test that you take.His test are very confusing because he does not really clairify what he wants you to write on the test.,0
"Prof gave no guidance on the final paper, my TA made me change my topic 2 weeks before it was due, and both my TA and professor were horrible about answering emails and communicating. Really good class structure, but absolutely abysmal communication about expectations. Made me want to pull my hair out. Lai if you're reading this: COMMUNICATE!!!!!!!",0
"As nice as this woman is, she makes it almost impossible to get a 4.0. It's a 94% and above to 4.0 which is insane. She is super nice and passionate about what she teaches but if you hate reading and extensive writing DO NOT take this class.",1
Hes an amazing professor. His exams are based on his slideshows as theres no textbook so study all slideshows posted. His exams are based on them and each class he gives accurate hints to exam questions and quiz questions (theres only one easy quiz). Group project was marked very easily. Overall hes a easy professor who cares about his students,1
"this was my favourite course I've taken, Dr. Day is an amazing lecturer! definitely requires a lot of work to do well though",1
"Okay so this class was high key boring but it was pretty light. Only three tests, no finals. I studied the day of or the day before and got A's. Read to textbooks tho, he tests you on those. 1-2 graded clicker questions per class so go. He sends out about 10 homework aka extra credit assignments, each worth 1 extra point on the last test.",1
Fuyez pauvre fou,0
"Conspired with his cohort Tenti to teach the worst Calculus course on earth.  Came in every day, heaved a huge sigh, and just wrote and wrote and wrote.  Pointless examples.  Berated us when we all wanted our midterms remarked.  Part of it was a bad course, part of it was a bad prof.",0
"Not her biggest fan.  Boring class although there were some interesting books.  Didn't get alot out of the class, which may have been partially my fault.",0
"Howard Lay is one of the best professors at Michigan. He is truly passionate about his field and even though I am not an Art History major, I genuinely enjoy going to his lectures because every time I come out of it with an appreciation for the topic. The class is not intensive but your entire grade is through essays and GSIs do all the grading.",1
You must spend a lot of time reading not just the required textbook but readings he provides as well. This is the first semester of the online course due to covid. Each test was only worth 15% but it was as if you were studying for a test worth 40%. His exam paper is worth 45% with not much directions. This class should not be in 3000 range.,0
blah,0
"Want a professor that grades your assignments before the last week of classes? Well, if you do, don't take Barton. Most grades (all but 3 or 4) were NOT uploaded until the day he submitted grades to the university. Have questions about an assignment? Too bad. He will not respond to emails. Steer clear of this professor if you care about your grades",0
"He's drags on his lectures no doubt - But they hold true meaning and definitely write em down to add in your essays. I choose him beacause he talks about topics related to life, our society now, taught me alot i am grateful to learn. and not just whats in the text book ( thought it was interesting) , im not a reader but i liked the textbook. ",1
"one of the worst profs i ever met he is soo boring staying awake in his lecture is impossible ,the starting material is not bad then it gets hard his midterm was really easy but the FINAL WAS SOOOO HARD  i have no idea where he got it from .AVOID AT ALL COSTS",0
"Kenna is a fireball. She is boisterous and high energy. She definitly knows her stuff. Any student, regardless of their speaking ability can succeed in that class if they are willing to put forth the effort to listen to her and take her advice. She's always willing to help in and out of class. Great class.",1
Her lectures drag on and she is very hard to follow. I got more done reading the textbook at home than sitting in her hour and a half lecture. Although she is available for help it's a struggle for her to actually help you and she's not always understanding of situations. She does take attendance the first couple lectures. ,0
She is fabulous.  She's makes marketing interesting and she knows what she is talking about.  The material is tough but she makes it managable.  She's got a great sense of humor and makes it worth going to class.,1
"90% of the course is common sense, so if you can understand the power points he posts online you do fine. Lectures are usually a waste if you understand everything but he gives good practice problems to test you (not marked). However, he asks random fact questions @ the end of class for bonus marks so if you'd like an extra boost go to the lectures",0
"VERY boring lectures, but test = class notes.",1
She is great one on one!,1
He's a great teacher and tells you exactly whats going to be on the test. Lectures are tied in with the book and his real life experiences and encourages the class to discuss about the lecture. You must attend his classes to pass his test because he will pretty much tell you exactly whats going to be on the exam.,1
"One of the easiest and most pointless classes I've ever taken. Didn't learn anything valuable but it's required. Take Lee and not Kraas if you want a good grade. Show up, do projects and online quizzes and you will pass for sure. No need to read textbook, just used it for a few quizzes.",1
"Prof. Heldenbrand is a very good teacher. He knows his stuff and gives you a good amount of material to study and has good clear lectures. The only downfall is how much info he gives you, he jam packs the lectures and tests with stuff I'm not sure we need to know. Not a lot of homework, but a lot of material to study for the test.",1
"He doesn't help you track your grade like other profs do. LOTS AND LOTS OF HW! If you take this class with him be prepared to live, eat, and breathe Spanish! I would def NOT take him again. He's also very rude and arrogant.",0
terrible ! never take his class!,0
"Is confusing when he speaks. Seems to speak in code. Teaches the language like a science, he really likes to break apart every part of the sentence and ask questions about it. He calls on you to answer his questions even if you dont want to. I would avoid him if you have the choice. Kind of ruined my interest in the french language.",0
He doesnt teach you he basically expects you to watch most of the lectures and test are basically your only grade with averages around 40/124 on all of them. He also says he doesnt curve bit if he didnt no one would pass his class.,0
I took photography online. His description of major projects were photos and title for the projects other than the first one. He didn't seem to be open to creativity. He would never explain projects to the fullest then tell you you did it WRONG. With out explaining the project in the first place.,0
Best teacher ever!!,1
Overrated! She doesn't know her stuff. She makes mistakes. She talks non stop and offends you if u say ur opinion. Lectures are long and with no interest. If u wanna learn u ll have to read urself. However she makes jokes and she is an easy grader! Study her notes and do a good term paper and u ll get an A,0
"Her exams are extremely hard.  The homework she assigns covers the previous exam so you technically don't study for future but past exams. Worst teacher ever, even worst then prof. Richards who teaches solids.",0
"His lectures are very clear and concise. The quizzes and exams are based off of the homework, which I could usually knock out in a few hours every week. Get a study group.",1
"Clearly more interested in being Union President than teaching students a thing. Often late or absent from class without warning. You will waste time showing up to campus to find out that he is not coming on more than one occasion. Read your text and feed him some philosophical **** or wear a Led Zeppelin t-shirt, either way you will get a B.",0
"Professor Wong's class consists of 5 tests, and this semester we had no final. Half of the questions on the test are from the textbook and half are from lecture, so make sure to attend those. She has an a great sense of humor and always wears a smile on her face. She is kind and compassionate towards her students.",1
This man is the most inspirational person I have met - his lectures changed my life,1
Professor Pantaleon is a very chaotic and messy teacher that cannot explain the easiest aspects of the subject. His lectures don’t cover test materials and his grading system is unclear. Don’t count on his help after evening class because he rarely has time for his students since he has to make it to the train station on time. .,0
unreal prof. adam is by far the best teacher i have ever had. every class he made everything very clear and always made me laugh. TAKE IF CAN!,1
The course material is tough but what makes everyone get high mark is all his midterms are from the previouses,1
Doesn't show you how to use the financial calculator. So you have to hand solve every problem. I know majority of the finance professors post videos showing how. Do not take.,0
"Very hard, lots of reading. Lectures are really boring...he tends he go off on tangents alot. Thought I was in a history class, not an english class half the time. Very critical when grading essays. Take another teacher if you can.",0
"I loved this professor!!! Cool projects in a cool class. The book is confusing as hell but you only use it once and while, just go to class introduce yourself to Pap and you're golden. He is very helpful, throw him a bone and act like this is your world and he will literally pass you on participation and not quality. Great CMU class!",1
"Completely ruined any interest I had in Psychology, the test were very difficult and she expects you to do hours of prepping for the test. Even the study guide takes a couple days to get done.  Be ready to work if you're planning on taking this course.",0
"It is not an easy class, but if you work hard and study you will do fine. Some people are not  fans of Karl, but some are. He is scary at first, but if you talk to him during his office hours he is not as scary as people may think.",1
"Dr. Saunders is very helpful and personable. He will work with you to make sure you understand the material. Tests are relatively easy if you have came to class and done the homework. Doing the homework is critical to passing this class. Dr. Saunders can sometimes move pretty fast, but will slow down and make sure everyone is on the same page.",1
I think this guy is the most underrated in the entire school. First the material he teaches is very abstract and not many people have the imagination to comprehend that level of abstraction. And for this dry material he was managing cracking jokes. That was pretty fascinating and for me personally is a sign of his deep understanding of the material,1
"Not that bad, to be honest. The course material itself was pretty interesting, but you definitely have to work for your grade. His teaching style was a mix of lecturing and writing random things down on the chalkboard. There's no recording or slideshow posted online for notes, so make sure you GO TO CLASS and pay attention. Use the TA for help.",1
"Nice person, but very mediocre teaching.  Picked a terrible textbook and based the entire class on it.  Meandering lectures appealed to the lowest denominator.  The seminar was a joke.",0
no intellectual bullying..i liked this,1
"Seton Hall has a handful of professors that are truly worth their weight in gold, Tony is on this list.  Presents the material in a clear and concise fashion that brings the subject to a level that even the non-finance individuals can understand.  He is always available and eager to help.  Kudo's to T.L., it's all about the Beta.",1
"Knowledgeable professor who makes his classes interesting although a bit boring sometimes. Has many extra credit opportunities so his students can succeed. No tests or homework just 3 essay questions, one research paper, and presentation. Feedback on your papers are helpful as well. Recommend taking a class with him.",1
Dr. Tremblay is an incredible professor! He is very helpful and a fair marker. He's very organized and his lectures are very structured...there are no surprises. He's definitely one of the best at STU:),1
"Often went on tangents about random things at time. This made it hard to determine what we were actually going to be tested on. Got boring and dry at times, but tries his best to make the class enjoyable. Going to study sessions helped, and are pretty much required if you want an A because just going of what is talked about in class gets confusing.",0
"Covers the powerpoints very well, doesn't do much beyond that. The homework assignments do not match up to the chapter material. The test material doesn't match up to the homework at all. I would not recommend him as a prof. His idea of learning to program is ""just do it"" thats very difficult to do when you are still learning new concepts.",0
"Anyone I have ever met who likes his teaching is oblivious to how badly he treats his students. Unless you treat him like a superior, he does NOT care about you. It is a lot more telling of a professor to see how he helps those who are confused and he blames students for not understanding. Worst teacher I have ever had.",0
Couldn't ask for a better instructor. Wish she could find time to teach more classes like micro;),1
"He's so funny and he really knows everything to know about statistics but he is the hardest teacher I have ever had. Everyone in his class is struggling (even if they have a good grade) and online learning from him is kinda impossible. He is so smart, he just expects us to be the same which wasnt the case. This is the first class I have ever failed",0
"Hansen is the best professorinstructorteacheretc. I've absolutely ever had. I've taken three classes with him (ENGL 301 and ENGL 455 twice with varying material) and I've loved all of them and hope to take more before I graduate next semester. He's a genius, he's quick-witted, funny, and a really quality professor. Take him every chance you get.",1
Dr. connolly is a super sweet professor! if you just take notes and study for her 3 tests youll be fine! all you have are the 3 tests (which one can get dropped) and a final. Youll get an A no problem if you just take notes! TAKE HER!,1
"I took his intro to stats and social psych class. He has you spend hundreds of dollars on class materials instead of teaching. I have taught myself every chapter of both classes. He often doesn't respond to my emails when I am looking for help... which I need... because im teaching myself!!!!! The material isn't too hard, but still! So annoying!!!",0
"Contrary to his own beliefs, he is a bad poet AND a horrible teacher. One of the worst college experiences I've ever had! A complete waste of time and my parents' money!",0
I took this class with Tom my last fall semester at OU and after four years here this was my favorite class. He is so down to earth that even though attendance is not mandatory he makes you want to come. Always has great examples for every topic and doesn't force anyone to participate that doesn't want to. He is great. ,1
"Absolutly horrible. Moves way to fast, does not cover material in an understanding way. Pop quizes with no notice.",0
"EC111 grade is made up of 10 quizzes, 10 homeworks, and the final. All quizzes and homeworks are due at the end of the semester. The lowest two quiz and homework grades are dropped. He lectures, but if you pay attention and ask questions, you will understand the concepts. Probably won't take another class with him because he is VERY lecture heavy.",1
She tested the class on her syllabus and counted it in our grades - need I say more?,1
"So far throughout my academic career this is by far the worst professor I've EVER had. DO NOT TAKE HIM! He targets students who slightly question him in class. When you ask about your grade in the class he won't tell you how you're doing, he doesn't lecture clearly in class, he's petty. This isn't a challenge, its impossible. Don't waste your time.",0
"Jim's dry at first, but for being a class I started out dreading going to, I loved the experience by the time it was done. Learned a lot about the scientific method/why science works (not regular bio at all) and finished the class two weeks before classes ended. cumulative grade point system that's clear, tricky but easy tests, and a p easy A.",1
DO. NOT. TAKE. The assignments are given with short notice and it is near impossible to catch up if you ever fall behind. He will not accept any feedback on the difficulty of the class and argues with students who state their opinions. Easily the worst professor I have ever had.,0
"He is a pretty great professor. I got an A on every paper, and you have to do a book review for the class. I read the book the day before the paper was due, wrote the paper in less than an hour, and still got an A+. He goes over everything from the book in class so honestly don't bother buying it.",1
He has a big problem of standing infront of whatever he has just written on the board. Almost impossible to understand.,0
"He's special. I can understand why so many people like him, but that didn't do it too well for me. I find he force-feeds his ideologies too much down his students' minds. At the end, if you don't agree with what he has brought forward in class, you end up with a mediocre mark, because you don't have a chance to get back to him.",1
"One of the worst teachers I've encountered at WSU. Her level of energy is distracting and annoying, and the homework she assigns (online and written) are completely different from what she goes over in class. The whole class on average is doing very poorly, but she can't see that the problem is her teaching ability. never take a course from her.",0
"Takes forever to turn in grades. Very stringent grader. Beyond that, his feedback is very rude and not at all helpful. I did well in his class grade-wise but was upset and off-put by his feedback process. The phrasing and language he used when turning back essays were not professional. Straight up mean. I do NOT recommend him as a psych professor.",0
She is overall a good professor but is very confusing. When she gives out assignments you have ask a million questions to know how to actually to do it. She is a very knowledgable professor. When it comes to grading you won't know your grade until final grades are due she's terrible at posting grades.,0
Was a horrible professor. He did not care one ounce for his students and was unprofessional and petty during class. Made passive agressive comments to people. Class attendance was mandatory and he was not flexible at all to students needs. Instead of helping them he made the other students take care of it.,0
"If you would like to learn anything, don't take this class.  She is rude and tries to make students look dumb. She plagiarizes test and won't be able to answer your questions without Google. Her answers to tests are wrong and won't fix them. Didn't pass any test. She shouldn't be a professor. 90% of class failed. Didn't use online access at all.",0
"He is great for BA 370 but NOT MIS 300. I am very positive towards learning, but I can honestly say, in this class I learned maybe the same amount I could have read on my own in two hours, & I'm avg. at comps. He uses the same tests of the professor who wrote the course. Easy 'A', but if you care to learn, doesn't teach well like he does in BA 370.",0
"Reading previous reviews, Dr. Karnick I believe are fairly unwarranted. Yes, she does grade to a level one would come to except from a 300 level course, but the feedback she provides is helpful in the sense of what she is looking for. She also made accommodations for me to take a quiz in person when I would have otherwise been out of internet.",1
"HORRIBLE TEACHER, SNARKY AND RUDE! Take anyone else. No textbook, she just posts crazy long articles that are longer than a chapter in a textbook would be. She hardly even taught the class, she just wants to have class discussions, and she doesn't even contribute, just says, ""ok"" to what people say! Really tough grader, thinks she teaches english",0
A Horribly dull class with an absolutely incompetent professor. The textbook is written by Natvig and is horribly organized. Use the library's reserve room copies to save on cash. The TAs are just as incompetent and are clueless. Avoid this class at all costs. You might lower your GPA as this class will not motivate you. It's not worth the credits.,0
"This class was extremely hard to keep up with, her lectures are all over the place. I suggest going to the study sessions before the exams, she will answer all your questions. The problem with this class it that not everyone is going into Geology, and she made it really hard for those of us that aren't. She is a very nice lady though!",0
"Dr. Rich's class has a very heavy workload, but it is an upper level English class. Contribute often and remember the online discussions, so you hit 25 pages. Be prepared to work but enjoy the readings.",1
"Gross may be a little intimidating, but she is actually a decent person and does do a great job of explaining the material. This class is not all that it is cracked up to be. Go to class, don't procrastinate on your pre-labs, and do a little studying. If you stay ahead of the game and put in a little extra work, the class is actually easy.",1
"By far the worst teacher and human being I have ever had the displeasure of meeting. Genuinely does not care about his students and will make sure you don't pass. Dan singer summed up: 40 min to explain one question, messes up then yells at you for not catching his mistake. He will try the same question next class and still mess up.",0
"She is terrible. Does not offer any help or assistance and just doesn't care about students.  RUN, if you can!(I really hope that she reads these comments and learns from them).",0
"Can't use computers during class, very hard grader on papers. Lectures teach you nothing so you'll learn the final material on your own",0
Ever have that teacher that thought that they were an english major even though they literally knew nothing? Ever have a teacher that tries to make a class that is completely useless seem important? Well this is exhibit A. ,0
Unreasonable strict on grammar. More strict than my English professor.  It doesn't like a planning class more like an art class. Lots of reports  and analysis. Too much details to lose your mark. I would drop his class if it wasn't mandatory.,0
"Don't do it yourself if you don't have to. I did not like his class, and he doesn't grade fairly. He tries to grade you on how well you write with a 12 page paper, instead of worrying about the subject he teaches.",0
"She did a video presentation at the beginning of each week, but did not really explain anything just read off the instructions that we can do, not really going into depth. Also, didn't really answer the questions on the discussion boards, I learned the answers to things from other students in the class. It was not clear what her expectations were.",0
"Since it was an online class I didn't have a chance to listen to lectures and don't know her lecture style. However, the course has weekly assignments and got somewhat annoying as there was no break from learning econ when I already have a full engineering course load. Doing the weekly assignments will definitely allow you to do well in this class.",1
Dr. Harkness' classes are always entertaining. He goes out of his way to make sure everyone understands the material.,1
"I took him for Honors Biology II, and I was disappointed.  If you haven't taken statistics, heaven help you.  The lab was wretchedly boring. Three months on duckweed. Yay. His tests are a compilation of obscure test bank questions that do not at all represent evenly the mountain of material assigned. I would not recommend his class at all.",0
"Very helpful, very good teacher. She may come off as crazy or strange at first, but trust me, she knows exactly what she is doing and is very good at it. She likes to do a lot of games that are both fun and surprisingly helpful. A few big papers and a lot of reflections, but she allows you a lot of control over your papers and projects.",1
"If you want someone who is clear, this will not be the class for you. Don't bother asking for help or clarifying questions, he refuses or tells you to do extra library research. The exams are basically how much research and work you do on your own. One of the worst ""teachers"" I have had at University of Portland. AVOID if you can.",0
"Honestly, I was very excited to start this course, but after the first few weeks, I realized it wasn't manageable with my other courses. It's like taking 2 classes in one. 2+ hour lecturettes, Extra readings, Textbook reading every week 60+ pages normally, along with group discussions and group work. A lot of work..",0
most caring professor ive ever had. she became a teacher later in life so she's realistic about the amount of hw she assigns and she is there for you if you have a bad week and need an extra day or two. don't take her generosity for granted but know she's more concerned about you than the deadline of an assignment. how all teachers should be!,1
He would have us read every chapter from his book and had quizzes each week which was over the book but you had no clue what the questions were going to be. His questions were hard to understand bc you wouldn't know what he would want out of it (like statements). More you spend the better your grade! He is a hard grader. STAY AWAY.,0
he's the reason I passed college algebra.,1
He is the best professor at Smith hands down.,1
"O'Connor was an awesome teacher, my main advice would be to listen in class, review at home and you'll do great. He has assignments due weekly, a midterm, and the final.",1
His knowledge and ability to relate what would otherwise be convoluted Philosophical arguments into our current world and explain them very clearly while making humorous references/bodily actions are great. The exams are hard (it's Philosophy after all) and the essays need to be detailed but just stop by his office and he will clarify everything.,1
This guy can teach.  He definately found his calling in life.  If you have a chance to take his class do it.  He is something else!,1
"She appears interested, but her lectures are hard to understand, and not just due to the accent.  She tends to write random notes all over the board.  Maybe the best prof in a class with three poor teachers.",0
A great teacher. Knows alot about material .,1
Dan was by far one of the hardest teachers ive ever had. he is not helpful and does not care about his students. he doesnt teach the class very well and doesnt make sure the class is understanding what he is saying. dont take him!!!!,0
"How this woman teaches is beyond me. Knows the material but is completely useless attempting to convey the knowledge to students. Reads off slides (info directly from book; created by TA) entire class. Takes attendance. Homework is meaningless so long as you make an attempt as she doesn't check it. Do the HW, know review sheet, get a good grade.",0
"Professor never lectured, just posted videos. His exams were nothing like the homework, it was as if the professor was trying to trick the students rather than test their knowledge. Worst professor I've had at OU so far, he just didn't seem to care about his students at all.",0
Very passionate about Jackie Robinson. Beautiful course. Highly recommend.,1
"he does not give study guides for Mt & finals, those are worth 20 points each, one paper/present, he take away 40 points if is late. pop quizzes worth 5 points. if u miss u don't pass, the class I took 8-8:45am everything he has in the board write it down does are your notes for ur future test he picks on people to read and answers questions",0
"Boring lectures, attendace not mandatory. 1 page paper on fringe benefits. 1 midterm and final. No homework. Curves heavy. Skipped a lot of classes, never read the book and got a C. Will review a lot for midterm and final. Not a bad professor, but VERY boring lectures.",0
"This Professor is a devil in human form. She is very rude, with great accent. When you ask questions she laughs as if students don't know anything. She thinks that she knows it all but i am not surprise that she is not married and don't have kids. No one can live with a difficult, rude and heartless person like 'Subadra'.",0
"I am not sure this professor takes any criticism of herself or her methods of teaching very seriously. She incessantly does not make projects clear, is not clear about due dates, favors students arbitrarily, has a weird attitude about certain topics. Gives you a sarcastic smile when she disapproves of your work, which is pretty silly, it is art.",0
Harder then Adomait,0
This professor did the bare minimum with teaching this class. No lecture videos and barely any powerpoints/notes to supplement the reading guides she gives. Exams are way harder than what they need to be. Ignored many students emails when asking for help with the course when a majority of students are struggling in the class.,0
"Nice guy but the worst professor I had in my entire life, I mean the worst.  The weekly homework is extremely  and you need to attend every single office hour for ""hint"". If you have to take him then make sure you spend endless hours on his class and hope for a passing grade. Respect him as a researcher but avoid him as a professor at all cost!!!!",0
I don't understand why everyone is raving about her. It's like she wanted to see her students fail. She was not helpful at all when I went to her for help and was very prudish with her replies. Her lectures were mind-numbing and horrible. I really did not enjoy her and she has made me seriously rethink my major.,1
"This class had really interesting course content which was very useful to learn as a CJPP major. However, the professor was very unhelpful when it came to answering questions. The exams were very specific, and nit picky (which was very stressful considering the final was 50% of grade). Would not recommend to other students.",0
It's one thing to know the world of philosophy and it's another to know pop culture and think it's the path to understanding. Gentry is as shallow and unoriginal as I've ever taken. Very disappointed and wish I could get my money refunded.,0
"He's nice I guess, but sooo boring and he speaks way too quietly. Sit in the first few rows or you can't hear him. The material is somewhat interesting but his lectures are terribly boring because he's so quiet and monotone. Tests are averagely easy, but go to every class because they're based 100% off his lectures and the book you have to read.",0
"Not a recommended teacher. Lectures contained too much content to cover in a single class or menial, repetitive exercises for the entire time block. Attendence is recorded by clicker. If you're looking for an easy A, this'll get the job done, but there are other much better classes for the same purpose.",0
"It is absurd how hard he made this class to be. You have to take notes, but be aware he gives so much information that the material he wants you to remember gets lost in the mess. His reviews are not helpful. I do not recommend him as a professor. ",0
The only and WORST option for ochem lab. Instructions seem organized but way off in detail. Info a lot different from her pre-lab video. I got to know every lab has issues like changing the solvent and not using the equipment in the videos. Even she's rude to students. I'm sure she doesn't know the difference btw being rude and being strict.,0
She has a weekly homework assignment and tons of group work. She is constantly reviewing herself as a teacher and she did that a lot. Her directions are very clear and she gives great feedback,1
"This is the single worst class I've attended at JHU, virtually or otherwise. Here is everything you need to know. In response to COVID, the professors chose to make this class asynchronous. This is useful for reviewing material. However, the problem that arises when you have an asynchronous class with no grades other than exams, is that students",0
Monday morning stats is the worst....although I'm sure he has no control over that.  I found the midterms were very diffacult and cramped into a small room made things uncomfortable.,0
Dr. Collins is an amazing teacher and hilarious guy. Old tests are the key to his class! Very tricky but worth it.,1
"Yeah, the class material challenging, and you have to be able to write, read and think to do well in the class. Not a thrilling lecturer, but the guy knows his stuff. It really does make you think. This is what you went to college for. Don't be a wimp.",1
"Bj rye will say a test is based on chapters in txtb. But 75% of the test is her poorly constructed, messy slides. Poor communication!! Bj's slides are messy, hard to follow, poorly labelled and organized. Where do her lessons begin and end? Bj Rye does not use proper rubrics, but grades harshly; making the grades feel subjective to her opinion.��",0
"Fairly easy class, but her replies to forum posts were confusing and seemed off-topic. Projects and forums were easy to complete.",1
"Taken her class during the pandemic online classes. Her class is fairly easy, just do discussions and write 3 papers. However, I do notice that this class is more on self-learning. She doesn't teach you anything. She will have group discussions every video lecture and just nods and agrees to student's feedback. Doesn't grade easy with papers.",1
"I took 3 classes with Freedman -- I'd take any class he teaches.  This is why I ended up with a minor in Anthropology.  The reading and work was not overwhelming, but very interesting and I got all A's.",1
He is very demeaning and can make you feel stupid. He can also be very harsh.,0
Do not take his class only about 10 people pass this class on average!!,0
"Very nice, cares about students but lectures are SO boring. Assignments, quizzes and tests are all manageable.",1
"Nora was hands down the nicest professor I've ever had. She is always ready to help you with your lab or direct you in the right way. This class is all lab, 2 exams and a report so make sure you come to class and turn in the homework! Find a table you can work with and split up the group work and you'll be fine! Great class! Worth it!",1
"Very bad at teaching, makes so many mistakes during lectures and so many errors in the review package. nice guy and tries to help but takes too long to teach, does not spend his time wisely and we didn't even finish the course but it was still on the final (worth 50%).",0
"He is ridiculous. This class was such a waste of time. His favorite teaching method is screaming into students ears. He canceled almost half of the classes and was such a waste of time. He hardly taught us anything so we all used the guessing method on the exams. Avoid this class, it ruined my semester!",0
"Exams were a nightmare, but you should be well-prepared if you attend class, do the readings, and DO THE EXERCISES.  Gillon is approachable if you're having trouble with the material, but generally refuses to acknowledge his own mistakes (of which there can be many).",0
"I took Professor Palma's class during my first semester at SCCC. It was merged with Professor Ferrigno's class, and I have to say this was the best math class I have ever taken. One professor teaches while the other gives extra help, and they both genuinely care about their students. Math was never my strong suit, and I got an A. Highly recommend.",1
"He is slightly enjoyable and lively speaker in class. In an individual level he is very harsh though, and is not at all willing to answer questions or help. You miss more than 4 classes, you fail. No exceptions.",0
"You have a lot of options for Calc 3, just avoid Gaffney, and you will be fine!",0
"Not a fan. The class does not encourage engagement and you don't get much from it. You can study 2 hours before test without any other work through the semester for your A. Frustrating, as even if you do want to self teach, the provided resources are hard to navigate and hard to understand. Don't take physics at MCTC.",0
"Definitely accurate on all the positive comments: good sense of humor, passionate about his class. But he's a tough grader FOR SURE and if you don't come to class? It's over. Important to TAKE TIME TO READ!!! Fiction and poetry unit are currently killing me... Stay involved and I'm sure you'll make it through.",1
"I took his summer class, first of all it's not an easy class.. the midterm was abit easier than the final. 10 short answers and 2 essay for 150 each. regaler classes get one essay and 1 term paper instead.Doesn't give a study guide, talks about different things in class that are not related to the material. Fun but ahard class.",1
"He was a good professor for SCI 225. I would recommend him. He occasionally lectured too much, but usually you do group work. There is no textbook but I recommend printing out all of the powerpoints to take notes on. Make sure you start you concept map early! They take a very long time to finish. His tests are reasonable, not too hard or easy.",1
"Do not ever take this class with him, lousy professor.",0
DONT TAKE THIS CLASS. for a freshman seminar class she grades extremely hard and unless you simply regurgitate her ideas back to her you won't do well. She has certain ideas about papers and if yours dont match you won't do well. Again- take another class.,0
"such an easy class. absolutely pointless to go to class though. when she tells you to write a journal you can literally write about your day for almost every one and get full credit. i don't recommend her because shes spacey, confusing and realllyy annoying, but it IS really easy to get an A...",0
"I took Swift's hybrid class, and it was one of my favorites. She may seem intimidating at first, but Swift is an awesome professor who knows what she's teaching. Don't procrastinate the work until before class, and if you don't know the material, don't try to pretend you do. I learned so much from her that I'll be able to apply to my career.",1
"This class has beyond prepared me to accomplish literally any tough obstacle in college. Do not get me wrong, if you are not a mathematical genius this class is brutal. However, if you put in the required time to study the material and participate in everything offered you will succeed. I have yet to feel more proud of a grade!",1
"He never gave us any feedback from our speeches, so you didn't know what you should improve on. He relied on online quizzes way to much, and the text book/quizzes had nothing to do with the course. He never got in front of the class and taught anything to us. He also canceled class a lot.",0
Worst professor i had; calculus class was horrible and could not teach a thing.,0
Makes lecture interesting and fun. Easy to get along with. Tests aren't super easy and you cant look up every question because of the time limit.,1
Great professor. Helps out if you need it. Workload not bad. Attend class and put in a little time and a decent grade is no problem,1
Ben has a knack for his subject and a great way of teaching it. He'll always make time to help you as well. Absolutely recommend!,1
"Worst professor i've had in my 2 years at York. He doesn't teach, he rants. His teaching style is horrid and isn't clear at all. All he wants is people to memorize stuff to the tee. And yet the course has the word APPLICATIONS in it... not a math course that should be taught by him.",0
"I dreaded going to this class.  This teacher can ramble on for hours, and it is never clear what he wants  the the students to learn.  Stay away from this teacher.  He also talked trash about his other classes, how stupid they were and how he looked into there history to find out why they were stupid.  Very unethical!!",0
"She is tough and very picky, but she is making strong teachers. I learned so much in her class through assignments. Be on time to class, submit your work on time, pay attention when she explains, ask a lot of questions, schedule appointments with her if you need more help, participate in class, and you will do well. Expect INSANE AMOUNT OF WORK!",1
"Well, come the final, half the class is failing, and Kari made a whole spreadsheet about it, while instead, she could be using her time to try and make her students be successful in the class. Yes of course some of the students are failing because they are slacking, but, if half the class is failing, maybe the teacher could do something different",0
"Joe is a tough grader at least towards me. I know he didn't like me; he made that very clear. All projects are difficult. Took off points because mine were ""simple"" but they were actually very hard and took so much time to do. Almost feels like lab and lecture are two completely different classes. I hate that he's the only teacher for this class.",0
"Very enthusiastic prof and very helpful with students. The best math prof I've ever had. 
 
 However his midterms and exams are rather tough.",1
Kim is the best! I took her accounting course online and she was extremely helpful and friendly. I wish she could be my instructor for every class!,1
THE BEST PROFESSOR EVER. Professor O'Quinn makes class interesting and engaging. He teaches in a way that forces original thought from you and makes you a much better writer/thinker. Get ready to work hard but it is SO worth it!! The man is a genius.,1
She gives no clear explanation on what is expected. If you arent an English major you arent going to enjoy her class at all. I took this as a winter term so I knew it was going to be a heavy work load but she didnt clarify what was wrong about a paper and you basically had to guess what her prompt was asking for.,0
"I really liked Professor Lowell. Class is basically mandatory if you want to pass, but I looked forward to it. He gives a pretty routine schedule each week, with a few projects thrown in here and there. He is super nice and makes class enjoyable. The only downside is that he's a tough grader and some projects/assignments were not explained well.",1
"Tests are written including the most minute details of up to one hour videos; some include information that was not in any materials provided. Email him about fixing points. No HW, but participation point questions for every class are based off chapters in the book. He seemed somewhat interested, but this is his definately his side job. ",0
"A great undergrad professor really only needs to do three things with each lecture or lesson: 1) Present the idea 2) Guide students along a conceptual path with lecture, examples, and worked problems for that idea, concept, technology. 3) Summarize the path and test knowledge. Jim Helm skips step 2. Lectures are just him reading slides.",0
"Viator is harsh. The very first day he kicked a guy out of class for being less than a minute late. He walks in and calls a name on the first day too to start asking questions. He is very approachable outside of class but in class, don't bother. DO NOT GO TO CLASS UNPREPARED WITHOUT GIVING A PASS SLIP. HE WILL CRUCIFY YOU. Pure socratic.",0
"Nice guy, smart, somewhat text book driven, but does encourage students to seek external knowledge.  A newer prof and his teaching style reflects that (bell curve) yet his tone and steps allow you to follow the course material.  Letures are helpful but not mandetory to succeed in the class.",1
Crazy teacher but cool. Although he could never get any electronics going. If so he let us out early. Def. take him again,1
"This class so so so hard.  She not help me at all.  She think she know everything but don't know nothing.  If you know everything why not help people but since you pretend you do why don't you.  God Says: The righteous care about justice for the poor, but the wicked have no such concern...",0
"To pass this class is like finding a needle in a haystack. You really have to concentrate! The material is difficult to grasp, and there is no easy way around it. You have to work for your grade. No HW, but 4 exams (includes final) determines your fate. You must apply yourself and take the initiative to study and do problems on your own. Good luck.",0
"He can be quite confusing at times and makes a few mistakes in his notes but his summaries are amazing! His midterms are super straightforward, much easier than the questions in the book he assigns.. He told us that when he was learning about thermodynamics, he failed his own midterm, so I figure part of this easiness is due to empathy! Love Bryan!",1
"Difficult course. Great professor and if you work at it, you can earn a good grade. His quiz and test questions are tricky, watch for the wording on them and you'll be fine. Also, the questions contain many parts. Overall, great teacher, quizzes and exams are curved so the course is fair.",1
Dr Scoville is one of my favorite professors because how much he wants his students to succeed. He genuinely cares about each of his students and will work personally with each one to ensure they succeed. Someone who finds joy in teaching others and is excited by the material which makes taking his class interesting and useful.,1
"Funniest, coolest, craziest Prof. Ever  he is a hero",1
Iam taking 280right now. Solid reading experience. The book is not horrible to read though. Discussion due Thursday and grades are returned usually the next day. Quizzes on werkends. Fits my schedule. I am not sure about the rrsearch project or long paper assignment mentioned in other reviews. Not in this class. Oh and I like the movie!,1
"Kathie is one of the nicest people I have ever met. She really enjoys talking to you unlike some other professors. Her class really got me thinking about not only my rights as an American Citizen, but also about the responsibilities that I have as well. It was a really good journey.",1
"A very good professor.  Attendance is not mandatory and he emails notes from class.  There is a midterm and a final, with the final being two thirds of the grade.  This was an easy A class and it allowed me to focus a lot on my other classes, which were a lot tougher.",1
Horrible instructor. Super specific requirements on assignments that you will not know unless you read every little millimeter of the syllabus. Crazy strict grading. Doesn't respond to emails. Do yourself a favor and do not take her class.,0
Cancels a lot of classes,1
"You will have 1 daily oral question to answer. Get ready to get negative points. Questions on the books picture boxes show you what on my subject understanding? You'll have 3 exam with 100 questions. We had more than 10 people to drop the class on 1st exam. Dont bother on extra credit. He is rude, stupidly strict & stubborn. DONT TAKE HIM.",0
"Great prof. I like the fact that he gives an economic facet to Sociology. The book he chose for this class is a very good one (again, very preoccupied with economics). His comments are well thought-out and doesn't go too overboard when taking a side on a particular issue. Great prof, too bad he's retiring.",1
"Dr. Silverman is the best professor that I have ever had. He made history a fun experience for me. He is available outside of class whenever he is needed, and responds to email in a timely manner.",1
"Prof Merdian is not funny or caring. He screams and mocks students in front of the whole class. Some students (yes, plural) dropped his class due to the anxiety he was giving them. He surely knows his stuff, but teaching is not his forte. Very disorganized and we never used the book or lab manual. Be ready to lean a lot on your own...",0
"6-week course. Frequently goes off-topic in his lectures to talk about events or his own rants. If you are a girl, expect to be called up to the board or computer frequently to write stuff he's teaching. Lectures are usually him reading directly from slides, doesn't expand on material. Didn't follow the syllabus. I feel unprepared for CSC202.",0
"He is such a sweetheart! Hilarious, engaging, and assignments are meaningful and help learning. Truly cares about his students and makes sure they know all of the opportunities available to them at Alma. My favorite professor so far!",1
"She seems nice and like a good professor throughout the semester, but she will GRILL you for the final project. You can work as hard as possible and still be lucky to get a C. You're graded on several exams, two presentations, and participation (including showing up to class).",0
"He is a funny guy and knows his stuff.  But there were some things I really didn't like.  He wasn't very clear on some of the assignments.  He's really into the abstract.  Other times I thought he was plain rude.  You can't just tell a student that ""it wasn't a good drawing.""  If you do, at least motivate them to do better.",0
Not very good ,0
"She teaches not by getting her students to memorize, but making them know about the logical behind every math problems. Here comes the technical part of online instructions, and her incompetence shows. I got grades I do not deserve twice! Dont be late even if its her fault. If your quiz submitted on its own before due, its your fault and problem",0
"He trys to make his subject hard and difficult to understand. He insults students on their exams, but then face to face he like a mouse. Worst Class Ever",0
"Hardest professor at Oneonta. Too bad you HAVE  to take him if you are an EDUC major. His tests are VERY difficult, I went to his office hours and he always got off track and discussed his personal life. I made the effort he did not. Oneonta needs to re-evaluate this teacher.",0
"She is disconnected from students. Doesn't seem to want to teach at at all. Didn't hear from her for weeks in an online class. Emails take days to get a response and it's the only way to reach her as she doesn't work on campus.  Terrible instructor, not recommended.",0
His grading curve is essential. But what does it tell you about learning anything when a fail turns into a B?,0
"She was generally nice but gave means looks all the time. This was a Communications class yet, she had a hard time ""communicating"" and whenever you'd ask her a question she'd tell you to look at the syllabus instead of answering the question. Also, she demands a perfect outline and speech but won't give feedback on what you did wrong.",0
Anver is a fun and intelligent prof who definitely knows his material and is able to convey it with a great sense of humor.,1
"I once emailed him a question about a concept, and he emailed me back with his understanding of it, as well as journal articles and recent magazine article to help answer my question. On top of that, he brought up my question the beginning of next class to share with everyone.Gets asked lots of tough questions in class, and can answer most of them!",1
"Dr. Bob has a clear love for his job, you can see it during every lecture. His voice is very monotone, though, so for people who have trouble focusing, take another professor. Tests are tricky and frustrating, as some of the information he asks for is obscure, and even with a cheat sheet and the tests being open book, some is hard to find.",1
"It baffles me that this man has been able to hold down any job, ever. I'm not sure if he knows which way is up, and which way is down. His slide deck looks like complete garbage, he is unprofessional, and doesn't dress like a Kelley professor should. Half the class is answering clicker questions so he doesn't have to teach the whole time.",0
I survived it.,0
"Professor Melis is probably your best bet for an accounting prof at Marquette. I will say, this class is probably the hardest class I've ever taken. It was fully online and we were allowed to watch the prerecorded lecture videos on our own time. She provides ""self-imposed"" schedules and I would recommend following it or you'll struggle big time.",1
"Nofz is incredible. I haven't taken Spanish in a couple of years and taking her was perfect. She makes everything very clear. She lectures entirely in Spanish (which is great listening practice) and her exams are very clear cut. You will need the textbook and the online code, both are used frequently.",1
She goes way too fast during her lectures and is extremely hard to understand. She doesnt properly explain one point and rushes to move onto the next. Would seriously recommend not taking her.,0
Honestly this was an easy class to get by in without doing much although my grade only came out with about a C.  Only work done in class is a 300 word journal summary of the week's lecture and a midterm and final done online but he gives you the questions done ahead of time. He is kind of a tough grader and this class is so boring!!!,1
She was not clear with her lectures. Skimmed over a lot of the material and was not very thorough.,0
"How does he have 4.7? This guy gave me major headaches. The workload is too much looking at the fact that we take other courses too. He expects too much, please stop. Huge papers (10-20) pages due each week. He is telling us to get jobs, how do you expect us to do this with the workload you give us? Currently crying. Also show off and ranter.",0
My FAVORITE TEACHER EVER!! Very approachable. I would never have graduated without his help.,1
"This class WILL hurt your GPA if you aren't already extremely savvy on Philosophy. Not worth it if you are looking for a Breadth A requirement. Go with THEA instead. He will not ""mark up"" your test so you have NO idea HOW you got the grade you did. He just circles a #. That said, the lectures were interesting and going to class was always fun.",0
"If you're stuck with this prof , attend every single class but bring your book and read the entire time. His slides and lectures are pointless. Memorize the book word for word and maybe you'll get a C. I AM AN A/B STUDENT! But now i have to look forward to my first D thanks to this NON teacher. Who hires these teachers?",0
"Easy class. She posts notes on blackboard beforehand. The only downside is that she gets off topic easily, but we would have conversations on current issues in society that would last the whole period. 2 papers, while the midterm and final were open notes. Also, you get to watch eye-opening movies in class.",1
"He's an absolute terrible teacher. The tests are so hard and confusing for no reason, even if you study lot. Your grade is only based on tests and nothing else. That would mean attendance wouldn't matter right? No, he takes attendance every class, but no grade. DONT TAKE HIM",0
Classes involve a lot of history and it is all lectures. No discussions. Not a very engaging class but can be fascinating if you are interested in history and literature. Attendance is not mandatory and he explains all the readings in class so you don't need to do any reading to attempt the tests. Easy A if you put in the effort with the papers.,1
"This class was VERY hard, but learned so much. Make sure your grammar is on point for the essays. Lots of people have old tests of his.. mostly sorority girls, BUT beware he changes them up (as he should you cheaters) overall, he really is great!",1
Amazing! Best class ever. Be prepared to read...A LOT. However the readings are very interesting and are needed for the exam,1
"I have had many online IT classes with professor Murthy, he is very knowldegeable,he does expect you to work for teh grade however, he is pretty fare.  he does respond to questions.  he gives alot of labs and if you follow the examples you will do fine.  overall a very good professor.",1
"She's quick to respond and grade, and gives detailed feedback on project. Quizzes/discussions are simple, but tests are hard. She is vague/inconsistent on project so clarify any questions you have prior to turning in or you may lose points. The final is extremely hard and is 20% of your grade - many who had A's dropped to a B due to the final.",0
"Straker's fantastic. His lectures are energetic and engaging. Good sense of humour. He's very approachable, but making an appointment is your best bet if you need help. Dude's a well of information. He weights assignments fairly, and his exams are also really fair. He's been wearing the same vest since about 1999, but whatever. It's all good.",1
"Adter taking his molecular biology of development class i can now speak in front of EVERYONE!  Hes funny, and actually very smart.  I dont think the classes he teach really pertain to what he is good at (plantphysiology).  Greta teacher though!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"She is very helpful, and she does great work, but her accent is not clear, and you have hard times understanding her.",1
"I love Blue!! You get a ton of perks in his class like movie screening tickets and merchandise! It's basically a midterm, final, final project and participation. Make sure to get a good group for the project. His tests are super to-the-point and there's no BS ever. If you study you'll be fine. I learned a lot from him.",1
"Anne lectures well and is very helpful, but the course was the most disorganized I've seen.  The majority of the course material was covered in the final week extending into the exam period, so beware.",1
"It is an unofficial writing-intensive course. The instructor requires you to write a 50-100 page encyclopedia. The name of the course is ""History of Anthropology."" You literally have to write the history of the anthropology A-Z. Do not take it unless you are an anthropology major. Take ANTH 238 or ANTH 279 instead, if you want easy electives.",0
She is a nice lady but her class requires a lot of work which is graded harshly. I received a zero on an in class assignment that I had an excused absence for (email from health center was sent to her) but she wouldnt let me make it up and it hurt my grade by a letter grade.,0
Worst teacher to ever take a class with. Wants his students to fail. He needs retire asap,0
"Professor gives lectures, but in a weird way. In the first part of the semester, there was nothing display for me to take notes and by the end of the semester, he starts doing that. Not only that, but he also goes off track on his lectures and got me lost multiple times. He also mentions that many people FAILED HIS CLASS!!! Look for someone else",0
"Nice lady but doesnt do any teaching whatsoever, students present every class and explain the chapter. Shes just there to guide the discussion, honestly not sure why they pay her to be a professor when the students do all the work.",0
The class is pretty straight-forward. Homeworks are reallyyyy easy and she drops one exam! I would just go to lectures and take good notes (ESPECIALLY examples) and definitely use the study guides that she posts.,1
"He is a nice professor overall, but he is not a great teacher. He is hard to understand and his tests are very difficult. I believe that the average grade for tests was a D.",0
"Unfortunately, I had to take her classes for the major. She is a very catty prof and only willing to help those in her posse (consisting of the naturally high achieving students and males). If you have the unfortunate circumstance of being in her class for the major, be willing to find other resources b/c she is not helpful during office hours.",0
"Does not teach anything in terms of applied control theory. He is jumbled in his descriptions and explanations. Gets a start hard on from failing people, and talks about it years after. I've learned more watching IIT Lectures on youtube than attending his classes. I fully expect material we did not cover to be on the final. Avoid if you can.",0
"gives alot of quizzes although they are really easy. gives alot of homework so make sure you do it. READ THE CHAPTER before the class. participation is HUGE. i got a 60 on the midterm which was pretty hard, although i got a B in the class.",0
It is crucial to do the webassigns for this class since all his quizzes and tests come from it. Trubatch isnt the best lecturer but he is very helpful if you ask for help one on one. Just work for the grade you want and you'll do fine :),1
Worst professor I have ever had. She sent a document into the Dean saying I plagerized my final paper just because I used larger words than she must be used to. Also everything she talks about is her opinion no one elses.,0
Cocky guy. Lectures always go to the time limit. Participate in class and take down the notes he puts up.,1
"Class is way more stressful than it needs to be. He has the most unclear grading criteria I've ever experienced in a college class, and assigns lengthy papers that he doesn't even take the time to grade. Wrote a 20 page case study to end the term and received a C in the class with no feedback whatsoever. I will never take a class with him again.",0
"Grade consists of 3 tests, the final, and 3 excel assignments. Tests are tough, however she does give partial credit if you show your work. Excel assignments are also tough at times. Palocsay knows what shes talking about, but her lectures are you watching her do practice problems. Find a study group because youll have to teach yourselves.",0
"Doesn't really teach the material. Assignments, labs, and notes have been the same since 2009 (they are all dated for 2009). Easy to do well in the class but test and assignment questions seem like they are randomly selected. Gives everyone an extra 10% on the midterm as well. The class is a joke.",0
dooooooooooooooooooooooont ever take him... how could cuny hire a high school teacher for college level english... i hope i never have to take him again,0
"Prof. Keeling is a good teacher, and I found his course material really interesting and engaging. I would have liked the course better if he were more respectful. He tends to be very passive aggressive to his students and even complained about several of them to me in office hours once. Recommended as a professor, but not as a human being",0
"All play and no work! He doesnt teach anything but tests you on anyways. If you have him for CS630, Good Luck!",0
Would not recommend taking her. i took trig online w her and was lost the entire time. only does examples very fast in lecture and never explains concepts ever. when someone asks her to explain something she does it in a very confusing way and struggles sometimes. take someone else if you can,0
"DO NOT TAKE HIS PHILOSOPHY CLASS! Mr. Rydman is AWFUL at lecture. He says maybe 10 minutes worth of useful information in a 2 hour time span. His quizzes are off the reading assignments, but only on the unimportant information. He rambles about trump, movies, and other things he thinks students will find interesting. IT'S NOT.",0
"Explain the material well, but the exam is really tough. You have to pay attention to his class since he sometimes would tell you what things will be appear in the exam.",1
"Terrible. Dry, mind numbing lectures yet brutal and inconsistent grading. He is an incredibly picky marker and only seems to accept arguments that are constructed the same as his own. His examples are very weak, yet he expects a lot. Avoid him, but if you are stuck with him, try giving him exactly what you think he wants to hear.",0
"Mrs. Wright barely taught us anything & barely communicated with us (in-person or through email). Lots of group assignments and quizzes on TB chapters (which you don't have to read). No lecture material. She is not very accommodating or approachable. She does not reply to emails for weeks. The class was an easy A, it was just frustrating",0
"Absolutely horrible. Worst Eco 146 Professor. AVOID THIS WOMAN. She is harsh, mean, rude, and unkind. Tests are moderately difficult, but in general she is awful!! I would rather gouge out my eyes then listen to another one of her lectures.",0
Blair is an excellent professor! He is very helpful and knowledgeable about many topics. Be prepared to read and listen in a very traditional lecture setting. This class is great for political science majors but could be difficult as a core class.,1
She is the worst,0
Great teacher!  Really wants his students to succeed and loves history.  Very well informed and is an interesting lecturer.  If you take American History with him you have to read the book for quizzes but the quizzes and tests are easy as long as you study for a few hours. Easy and informative A.,1
"David teaches a history of Chicago course that I took because it sounded interesting. He gives wonderful lectures and will go out of his way if you participate! This class is simple to succeed in if you do the textbook readings and take notes during the lectures. For a history transfer credit, this class was perfect.",1
She was by far the best chem teacher I had. She actually teaches step by step with plenty of examples from her survival guide. If you have a difficult time understanding chem. Take her course!,1
"Dr. Shirley is genuinely one of the nicest professors at UT. He cares about his students and is easy to reach. He has strict attendance rules; however, this shouldn't be an issue as class isn't long. Fairly easy to get a good grade as long as you put in the effort. Class is online hw and quizzes, 3 exams, a presentation, and 2 group projects.",1
"Good teacher, bad class. The field placements are ridiculous. They are twice a week, 6 hours per week in Wilmington. No tests, the entire class grade is based on participation except for the final project. The final project is graded VERY hard!!",0
"Dr. Stoffey was a really good stats professor. He was helpful, knew what he was talking about, and overall tried to do whatever he could to run the course smoothly. With Statistics being known not to be an easy subject by many people, Dr. Stoffey really made it seem a lot easier then what most think of when it comes to stats.",1
"A Dutch theologian well versed in classical apologetics, higher criticism and their merits and dangers. Amazing Bible scholar, and wants to get to the point about Christ in all. Be patient, it's not that he's disorganized, it's that he is filled with a wealth of knowledge, and you are the one who needs to keep up.",1
"Horrible... dont take her course she is money hungry, makes you watch listen to her pointless pod cast in order to pass the exam that are all 45 minutes long... the dark side of Guelph is held inside this class",0
"Compared to other professors, she is expremely organized and amazing. She provides great lectures in-person and online and she also recommends watching other online lectures from other professors, which really helps to understand the material. She is the type of professor to want you to learn rather than fail. I 1,000% recommend taking her class.",1
"Do not take this class if you are not a dance major!  He will kick you out on the first day.  It is difficult to understand if you are not in the dance field but if you are, you will love it",1
"He is a tough grader. Harkins doesn't except late classworkhomework. If you need help, you won't be getting it from him, so you might as well ask a classmate. I stopped going after he kept failing my papers i would right.",0
"prof. Jalalvand is a very kind professor. He cares about all the students. You won't understand alot from him, but if you want to pass with B make sure to go to the class and participate. One more thing, he likes students to come to his office hours",1
He is probably the rudest professor I had this semester. I do not recommend him unless you love history and are ready to read a bunch of books about it. He is not very nice or approachable. He gets irritated easily.,1
"Nice Prof, easy to do well if you go to class and regurgitate stuff from lecture and textbook. TAs mark fairly and provide good direction in feedback.",1
He does not appreciate questions and is very condescending. He promises extra credit but he does not actually put it in the grade book. He does not like enthusiasm for the material so its best to just show up and lay low.,0
Only a few weeks long so you can't miss any classes. Learn how to write cover letters and resumes so it is useful. She gets you set up with a linkedIn account which can be useful.,1
"Brian is awesome. I had a real tough go at ear training my first two semesters at Berklee, and I've never had an easier time than taking class with him. He's not the kind of easy where you don't learn though, he's the kind of easy that prepares you really well for quizzes/tests and wants you to succeed and improve. Very low pressure environment.",1
Mr. Tyson carries an extremely boring classroom. His prezies are not helpful at all. You need to be ready to put in effort outside of class by reading the textbook and interpreting it. Tests are tough and the questions are weirdly worded. Probably the hardest course I have taken at Missouri State.,0
"I took her pstat10 online. Lab attendance are mandatory, twice a week. Final is 50% of overall grade. Lectures will be deleted every Sunday. Her lectures are not very clear, and syllabus is always changing.",0
He's a good prof and wants you to do well in the course. A lot of the test material is solely what is found on the slides. There are a lot of labs for this course and the lab component is definitely what will take up all of your time.,1
"Professor Zimmerman is Goated, coming from someone who took him online. No lectures and few assignments. All the assignments are short email writings. Youll finish with a research paper on a topic of your choice. He responds to emails in no time and genuinely enjoys communicating and helping his students. EASY CLASS!",1
"I can't say enough nice things about this man. Ranks as one of the best teachers I've ever had. EXTREMELY helpful. Will make himself available during office hours and is very patient and understanding. Don't underestimate him though. Will most definitely try to avoid giving bad grades, but at the end of the day you get what you earn. TAKE HIM",1
"As long as your turn everything in on time, you basically get full credit. Easy A. Definitely a great class to take online. Midterm and final are 3 short answer essays of 400 words. Discussion question for each chapter. Easy chapter quiz based on chapter reading.",1
Lot's of extra credit available. Go to review sessions and read over the packets given and you'll be good. Also don't wait until the last minute to do the lab journals. They are easy just take time.,1
"Prof Leslie is pretty fun. Very knowledgable in a hyper way. Although, God forbid you do your biliography wrong.",1
Billett is a very nice guy. He does take attendance but has no assignments. There are online exams that are extremely easy. Gets you certified and an easy A.,1
Thinks she's too important!  Get a real teacher!,0
"3 exams, and a map quiz. Theres an app you have to purchase about $25 where you do you're homework and where she takes attendance on she also does mini quizzes during lecture so don't miss class. Her lectures are heavy and will put you to sleep. She does seem passionate about history though and theres extra credit.",0
"Rodger is literally the best prof ever. He is so laid back and approachable, and his explanations of things are extremely clear. He also answers emails super fast and seems to really care about his students. I would 100% take another course with him!!!!",1
"""I might not be pretty, but at least I'm done with Don McGuire's World Civ"" -overheard in Baldy walkway; accurate af",1
"If you take any of Professor O'Quinn's classes, make it the one class that you show up to consistently and LISTEN. Seriously. Listen to what he has to say. He's one of the most brilliant English profs I've ever had and can make even the driest subjects mind-blowing. If you show up with enthusiasm and pay attention, you will learn so much from him.",1
Would not recommend. Old fashioned- does everything through email (no Urcourses). Horrible marking- everything has to match word for word what he has on his marking guide or else you get a zero. Ruthless when marking. Horrible feedback that tears down confidence. Do not take a class from him.,0
"I've taken every Russian history course at uOttawa because Professor Gaudin is truly fantastic. I didn't find her to be a hard marker after the first course I had with her, and even then I still got a B+. You figure out what she wants pretty quickly: Just a good academic essay. She and Heather Murray are the BEST in the history faculty.",1
Cool Professor,1
Great class. Ann is makes it fun and easy to learn tons. She's awesome. Puts all the images on moodle and makes it easy to do well if you go to class. My fav art history prof by far!,1
"This professor is very knowledgable about what she is teaching, however, she is rude and insulting. I don't like how she yells at students and criticizes everything we do. Would not recommend her because I've cried enough!",0
"She was very confusing, but the lab itself was pretty easy.  She's a nice person, but I do not recommend her.",0
"Definitely not a professor that I would recommend. She is not very nice, and is extremely unorganized. Everything is online, even the book. She does not respond to emails often, and when she does she is very passive aggressive. She should not be a professor. I have not learned a thing from her class.",0
he teaches math in a computer lab (like seriously?!). He writes on a computer (which wastes so much time). Uses apps (e.g maple) in class to solve his questions. I tried my best to learn from what he teaches but the fact is that he doesn't teach anything. I have an A in pre-cal and cal 1 and I am most likely failing this class. DON'T TAKE HIM!!!!!,0
"Très long et plate, en plus de ça il n'est pas claire!",0
"She is by far the worse teacher I have ever She is hard to understand & tries to hard to engage the class in conversation. She'll ask a question that she intends to be open ended but its not so she forces more out. No structure! Class was a free for all, very annoying! She also has each student read like its middle school... ",0
Prof. Shine is really a sweetheart! He really cares about his students and how they are doing rather than just pushing work on you. His work expectations were clear and grading is fair. The only downside of his class was that his voice is so soothing it is easy to doze off while he is reading.,1
"She really knows her stuff. Do the assignments correctly, & she's a fair grader. Just a little too much busy work (IIPs). A little dull during lectures, but she really just wants you to get the most from class. Very helpful & approachable. Nice lady.",1
"Really good teacher.  Talks about a lot of unrelated things, but at least it keeps the 2 hour long class interesting.  She is really good when it comes to translations. Highly recommend her.",1
"Easy A class, but there's interesting material! You won't have to show up to lectures for an A, and the exams are pretty simple. Super nice guy, and you won't regret taking the class :)",1
"terrible professor ever. Vague criteria, thinks shes a good professor, and ignore students. Let me just say this, DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS. YOU WILL REGRET JUST LIKE ME.",0
"pretty good professor. for a lab there was a lot of homework, two quizzes per class and usually a graph or two, but she was very nice, helpful, and seemed to want to help students pass",1
If you miss anything she asks for a doctors note.  She marked hard.,0
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS, EVEN IF YOU ARE HALFWAY THROUGH THE YEAR DROP OUT NOW!!! I worked my butt off in this class all year, and now if I pass the exam I pass the class, fail I fail it. It is not worth the hard work. I have lost sleep over this class. Not. Worth. It.",0
"Uncle Bijan is a JMU institution. This class was difficult but in the best way; his material is very informative and actually relevant to your life. Exams are hard but there is always a generous curve, and your ""savings account"" points will boost your grade. I respect him so much and it was a gift to experience his lectures. Please take him!",1
"If you take this class expect to work. There are constant discussion boards and quizzes, and all of his exams are short essay. He talks so fast in lecture so they are not helpful. It's finals week next week. I have 5 discussion boards to do, 5 quizzes, and a lab practical to do within the week. Then his lecture exam. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HIM",0
Lectures are useless,0
"Dr. Truchil was not a good professor at all. His ""Lectures"" consisted of him rambling on about his liberal opinions. I barely learned anything about sociology from him, and was forced to learn directly from the book. His grading system consists of 3 grades, a midterm, a paper, and a final.",0
"Tests were straight from the practice exams. Class was so boring, didn't learn anything just memorized the practice exams. She gave 4 opportunities for extra credit and they were hard but do them! So many points received from the extra credit. Lectures pointless but she takes attendance and if you miss more than 2 you don't get the curve at the end",0
"she is wonderful. intelligent, witty, clear, eloquent, personable, and just a truly truly nice person. do the readings, you'll really get a lot out of it, lectures are very important so go to class, go for outside help, not an easy A but very reasonable and very doable.",1
"Loved watching his lectures, it's easy to see he enjoys the subject. Be careful not to fall behind on lectures because there's a lot of material to cover. He does curve the lectures, which is really helpful. The discussion material is always interesting, real life applications of the current topic which was nice. Loved the class, great prof.",1
Fantastic professor. Made accounting easy and gave lots of real world examples for application for accounting basics. We had a lot of schedule changes but he was consistent and understanding. Quizzes and HW are once a week and he gave extra credit for every test. I enjoyed the class greatly.,1
"I enjoyed the coursework very much, but Conee is a boring lecturer with dogmatic interpretations.  I did poorly on the midterms because the answers I tried to express my own interpretations of the text, and Conee clearly didn't appreciate it.",0
Very capable of teaching with enthusiasm and he is truly knowledgeable.,1
Great professor but can see a power trip.. easy if you try.,0
"I do not recommend taking this class online. There's a practice assignment, essay, and exam weekly (summer school). Be sure to be very specific in your essays or he might deduct points. His feedback sometimes are questions and I already had answered them in my essay. This is also a self taught class, no meetings. Tests can really affect your grade.",1
Probably the worst teacher I have ever had.  He is incredibly boring (he only uses powerpoint) during class and the readings he picks are painful.  He is also a very unfair grader and grades based on favoritism.  He also assigns an insane amount of work for an intro class.  He is also very unclear and unwilling to help students.,0
"Let's put it this way; the first two days of class she told us about her trip to OBX and showed a powerpoint of the wildlife. Then another couple of days she decided to bring in her violin, play it and sing. She gives you VERY hard tests that are graduate level because she is a graduate level professor. She should not be teaching HIST 1050 at all.",0
"His lectures are great, but you really have to work for your mark in exams and papers. ",1
"He is brilliant! Take his classes whenever you can. You may never be as smart as him, but perhaps his genius could rub off on you.",1
"Truly the worst professor I have ever had, and the best part? good luck complaining as she is the department chair. Awful at teaching, horribly disrespectful to her students, and grades like her salary is determined by how many students she can crush. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASSES",0
"Such a rude lab coordinator. In my 1st year I received an F on a lab I thought I did good in (she said because my partners ""bad"" evaluation of me) which was a lie. She wouldn't give me the time of day to prove I wrote most of the lab and she just told me to suck it up and that one F wouldn't ruin me. LSS: I proved that I was right and got an A+ <3",0
very intelligent teacher,1
"Calculus 1 was difficult for me to understand on my first go, and Euler definitely didn't do much to alleviate any confusion I had. If you're an Academy student, get tutoring as soon as you can and do all of the homework.",1
"If you want to learn about economics take him, he's extremely smart! If you want an easy A don't take him!",1
"Gina wants everybody to do well in her class and goes above and beyond to make that happen. There are no tests in this class which is awesome. She has a great relationship with all of her students. By far the best teacher I have had at Chico so far. Show up to class, try your best and you will get a good grade.",1
Katie is an amazing professor! She made the class super interesting and I loved hearing all of her stories. She definitely made having an 8 am class bearable.,1
"Not gonna sugar coat it; lectures are not mandatory. Wish I noticed this sooner so I wouldn't of wasted my time. Read the textbook, ace the course. Out of the entire course, 8 questions (out of 200 total questions over 3 exams) came from lecture. Otherwise, textbook. Doesn't feel rewarding at all. Otherwise, decent lectures for useless material.",0
An absolute sweetheart. I would take her class again in a heart beat. I had the online class and it was super simple and had MANY extra credit opportunities theres no reason you wouldnt pass. Genuinely cares about her students.,1
"Not a bad professor to take, but no one in the class ever knew what assignments were due or when they were due. The class isn't too hard, but you do have to endure story after story of Adam's success in the business world. ",0
"Dr. Kellman is very passionate about this course. Although she appears to be more of a researcher than a teacher, she made sure her course material was well organized and easy to understand. Her tests are very simple and she clearly wants everyone to do well. Definitely an interesting and relevant course, and a grade booster!!",1
"This Professor loves her students, she will make sure you get the most out of her class even if it means answering all your questions until you understand. The only thing with her is that YOU will have to let her know what your problems and I know she will explain it. AWESOME PROFESSSOR!!!!!",1
The worst prof I've ever seen.,0
easier than the other acct. classes...but she isnt a good teacher.,0
"Absolutely awful experience. She gives Webwork assignments, easily 8 hours to complete, if you can even finish. Lectures are long and not useful. 20 minutes of algebraic manipulation of formulas, which she seems to love, and then 2-3 minutes of concrete examples. Uses ""intuitively"" a lot but I don't think she knows what that means. 4 exams + Final.",0
"Hard to hear, her slides don't make sense half the time because she doesn't proof read them. If you ask her something she'll tell you that's too advanced for the class and won't answer.",0
"I will never again take this teacher again. Yes he sounds positive and I can tell he has passion for his teachings. BUT he canceled his class TWICE!!! YES TWICE!! (One for a whole week, and did I tell you? This was on a mid term week.) This professor has the audacity to go to JAPAN on our mid term week. I wish to God i have more characters to writ",0
"Although this is the easiest class ever, I dread every second of it...and because she takes attendance, you have to go. She's so particular about everything, but she doesn't seem to have much of a clue about what shes doing. And don't try to make any compromises with her...its not gonna happen.",0
One of them most quirky and bizarre profs I've had. He shows up late and lets you out early but is a nice guy. He'll let you have extensions on essays if you just tell him you need more time.,1
You get distracted by looking at him,1
"Gives interesting lectures and knows his material inside out. He's a fair marker, though be warned he can take a while to return grades, and can also take a while to respond to emails. He's laid back, funny, and knowledgeable.",1
Does not care about your grade.,0
"He has many in class assignments that go towards your attendance and final grade. In addition to in class assignments, you have quizzes once a week, which are fairly easy if you skim the textbook. Exams are easy in the beginning but become more lecture heavy with the last 2. In general, his lectures aren't helpful.",1
"Dr. Berg is the worst and hardest professor I've ever encountered. His assignments are confusing and if you don't email him with the appropriate subject line you won't get an answer. He is the toughest grader, provides feedback after the fact and will not let you fix your mistakes until the next assignment, but the next one has even more feedback.",0
"Worst English professor at the jc. Unorganized, not clear when giving directions. His essay prompts are nonexistent. ",0
"Overall my favorite professor at AU. His classes are tough but its because he genuinely wants you to know the material. He cares about his students and wants them to do the best they possibly can but wont give out easy As. Hes funny, quirky and an extremely intelligent lecturer with years of experience and storys to go along with it.",1
DON'T TAKE HER!!! Shes rude when you have a question and doesn't really answer you. Accounting is already hard and she just makes it even harder. she doesn't explain anything. Yes you have to work its accounting but i worked all year and i'm barely gonna pass,0
Blah. This class held so much promise yet it was totally uncaptivating and I hardly got anything out of it. I think 99.9% of the class was asleep at any given time. So many examples were presented for a single concept it was hard to keep them all straight. The seminar saved this class; it was a fair amount of work and useful.,0
"A LOT of hw and classwork, test was open note and project was over the course of a couple of months. If you can keep up for the first month the rest of the class will be a breeze. However, Morris is perhaps one of the most vanilla boring lecturers I've had. Bring earbuds to class.",0
"Dr. Yongo is very difficult to understand, is dry and boring, and doesn't take the time to learn your name. All material he covers is on his powerpoints, which he posts to blackboard, and attendance is mandatory. Avoid his class if at all possible.",0
"winnik is a very lively prof. he makes sure you understand the things you need to understand. sometimes he would throw in random facts and stories for fun, but it keeps the class awake. one of the best profs so far.",1
"I have no talent going into this class and so I expected to learn HOW to do things, as it turns out I just paid hundreds of dollars to PRACTICE drawing in class. I understand that practice is important but I could just as easily practice drawing at home and save money.  He was less than clear most of the time and I hardly learned to draw better.",0
"This is by far the worst professor I've ever had. She is clearly disorganized and doesn't know what she's doing. She constantly lost my classmates and my papers. She doesn't give you grades back until the end of the semester, so you have no idea how you're doing in the class. I even had to contact the head of the department to complain about her.",0
"I take it back. Avoid this professor at all costs. She does not give good feedback and her advice is so vague that you're better off not asking. Seriously, NO DO TAKE.",0
"The good reviews for her are mainly because of the fact that she was kinda nice. Her exams were a different story. She does a review before the test but you're better off studying the whole manual. The exams are misleading, even when you study everything she says to. She also grades harshly and these exams can make or break your final bio grade.",0
Best prof I had first semester offered to help with papers and classes I was in always available for office hours and also would give plenty of feedback to allow for better grades in future not as tough a grader as many make him out to be,1
"In this class you will have papers due every week; not the usual one pagers but heavy duty papers. In class he will just talk the entire time but provide no value to the course. He does give a lot of good advice for the real world, but that is not what is going to help you pass the extremely difficult exams.",1
"Fantastic prof, and always willing to help. Wish he taught other classes besides cis120!",1
Has to understand that all of our University career does not only revolve around her ethics class.she requires way too much time our of our schedules for her class.The class participation marking is poorly designed.Not all students can always attend.,0
"HORRIBLE LECTURER. Cazenave is the worst teacher that I have had at UCONN. He is not only unprofessional but also seems to be ill-prepared for class and essentially goes off topic very frequently. Even though some of his points are quite interesting, the way he presents them cannot be in a worse manner.Do not do the projects/presentation (useless)",0
He was very rude and rarely showed up on time. His lectures were offensive and very cruel towards students. He used the class as more of an experiment rather than a learning experience. Don't take his class unless you enjoy being teased and picked on repeatedly.,0
"He is a pretty great professor. He very clearly knows what he is teaching and very rarely looks at his notes. However, he won't use power points and occasionally uses a whiteboard, though that isn't always clear to read. The class will be easy if you already have knowledge of the US Gov't. Write the paper, it's one of the few grades you will have.",1
"Angelica is the most helpful, caring, and thorough math teacher I've ever had. If you get to know her, she is awesome! Math is based off of the basic skills learned in pre algebra, and yes, Angelica assumes that you know that... Unless you speak up!!! Lowest 3 quizzes are dropped and notes can be used on them. I am following her to future courses.",1
"I had high hopes for this class, but Maria is a really strange professor. She assigns papers that she ""sort of hates,"" and we can't figure her out. I desperately want to like her, but her abrasive attitude and how she treats anyone with a question like they're stupid is quite off-putting. Easy A; not-so-great professor.",0
"Great professor. She's entertaining and makes class interesting, even if you are discussing boring texts. Assignments can be tough but are not bad because she explains everything very clearly. I definitely recommend her!",1
"Hilarious teacher, funny, makes you want to go to class.",1
"Sometimes kind of dry, but actually found some lecture pretty interesting. He is a stickler for attendance. Also, only one online final at the end. Would take him again",1
"An intense class, but I learned a lot about writing.  She really knows what she's talking about, and is very helpful.",1
UUGGGGGHHHHHHH!!!,0
Spread the word! This class must be taken down...take global chem or physical universe..whatever you do stay away from astronomy-stars with otway!,0
"This prof is tough but is really passionate about the subject and gives good, interesting lectures. I think I learned the most from his Strategy class than any other class and also formed some great bonds with people from the intense group work we had to do!!",1
"Great class. Always looked forward to attending. Very understanding when a situation (homework, attendance) arose and I had to miss class. Assignments were challenging and open-ended. Could choose topic of personal interest for most essays. Exams were 2-page essays, graded pass/fail. He's intelligent and creative. Knows history extremely well.",1
"He is a good professor with clear grading criteria. He is willing to answer all questions in class and outside of class, not a very tough grader, I would say the class difficulty is 2.5/5, you just need to pay attention in class and do not slack off too much, because he only tests what was already taught in class.",1
"For online classes he really won't pay attention to you if you're not on top of everything. He mostly goes over examples in his lectures, which hes done a million times. If you still don't understand something he will not take the time to walk you through anything during his office hours. He gives 2 hw assignments weekly and quiz every 2 weeks.",0
Awesome Prof! Funny guy who teaches well and get along with the class well :),1
"One of the worst professors at PCC. Teaching style is terrible and his notes dont correlate to the homework, quizzes, or tests. From using the equations he has taught us I have figured out that he is a poo poo teacher and that is the only equation I was able to figure out while taking his class. Dont take this class/professor if you want a future",0
"For the love of god, don't take her. She uses her classes to shove her ""learning strategies"" down your throat, and you won't even TOUCH the subject matter. Literally, we haven't even discussed death and dying, just 20 class periods of learning to be ""better readers"". Save yourself the agony, trust me.",0
this is a history of psych course. had to listen to AT LEAST 3 hours podcast each week sudden additional materials (5 extra pieces of readings) 4 days before the class. exam was tough: gave us 64 terms to prepare and test on 8 on the final. expect us to self learn instead of teaching. off topic discussion everylesson,0
not the best professor especially in the Media production field. does grade harsh and has no academic honesty in his syllabus and isn't a people person. He can tend to not care at all in class,0
"I have never hated a professor as bad as I hate him.  He doesn't teach but publishes a study guide and you have to just ask questions about what you want to know.  No generic questions, specific only.  His tests are impossible! It's hard to ask questions about stuff you don't know to ask about and then be tested on it!",0
"Dr. Vutha is a professor that genuinely cares about each and every one of his students, and wants everyone to succeed. His lectures are very easy to understand, and he is a very clever and witty person. I would absolutely recommend him for this class.",1
Amazing Professor. Is extremely well read about roman history. 3 papers in total. Papers are graded fairly and gives you chance to redo them. 10/10 would recommend.,1
i just RETOOK finance with pawar and got an A... because i failed it with this guy. this class is supposed to be INTRO to finance and he acted like we were getting a masters degree. horrible.. not helpful.. i dont even think he teaches here anymore but if he does dont ever take him unless you want to fail.,0
"This was a capstone class online. No test given as majority of your grade is based from the business simulation program. You will work in groups/teams for the simulation and had members that did absolutely nothing, and he will not hold them accountable for getting a free grade from the rest of the group participating which was extremely frustrating",0
I don't know if it is the class or the teacher but this was the most boring class I have ever taken. He did not have any material to teach us so instead he would make us do weekly reading responses then we would spend 2 HOURS going over them in class. Biggest waste of time.,0
Bad prof (1) lectures with overheads (2) does not post material online (3) does not open discussion boards online (4) lectures are hard to follow (5) lectures often dont coincide with the course outline (6) lectures dont coincide with assigned readings (7) mandatory readings on course reserves at DP with one book for a class size of over 100..(,0
"Good teacher, if you ask him a question he explains it to you. Test are hard, if you don't understand the material you won't do well. Lab reports are hard. You definitely have to work for an A. SI sessions are a good idea because he gives bonus points on your tests for going. Quizzes are easy points.",1
he talks a lot with topics that not related to the lecture.,0
"Get ready to read 60+ pages a week. Her lectures are boring and she has a horrible turn around for grading. She grades the papers easy, but she waits until after you have taken the final to grade your homework assignments, so if you weren't doing well on them you would have no idea and would be given no opportunity to improve. Don't take her.",0
Class is only made up of 2 midterms and a final so mess up one and you basically are screwed. The exams were really hard but marked fairly as he gives part marks where possible. His lectures are disorganized and hard to follow.,0
"Office hours are minimal and she is hard to find, even when she is supposed to be in her office, she many times isn't. Beware of standing up to her about online homework that is uploaded before it is taught, she does not like being wrong and will be hard on you. She will single you out and give you a hard time if you ask anything she doesn't like.",0
Overall a very good teacher. She will explain things 100x if needed and never gets mad. She gives a lot of tests but that's the only thing you have to do in this class. So no hw or assignments. You are required to get the textbook but you don't have to use it because she gives all the same info in her powerpoints.,1
Notes are horrendous. Very disorganized. Arts and Crafts in a third year class. Does she even know what she is talking about? No. She does not.,0
I liked him while he was here,1
"He's got cold and distant person but otherwise a solid professor. This is a very concept heavy course, so you'll have to do a lot of reading and preparation if you want to succeed. Homeworks are ridiculously long and labs take a lot of brainpower but do yourself a favor and invest yourself in these areas and the exams will no problem",1
I have never read so much and learned so little.,0
"Is she easy? Certainly not. But she's an absolutely fantastic teacher. I'll be honest, I was absolutely terrified of her after my first day, but now I really love her. She is probably the best professor I have had in terms of natural ability to explain material. Next semester is her last at Clemson, but if you have her, you'll learn a lot.",1
"One of the top professors I have had at Covenant. Made CHOW II exceptional. Funny, funny man. I will continue to take him for whatever I can.",1
"Dr. Chalk gives a ton of work constantly, and doesn't give you a single day off. She is under the impression that her class is the only class you are taking, and it is the most important. She gives random reading quizzes and picks awful books. She talks for 55 minutes about the books while you sit in boredom.",0
"No trouble for a while, but is horrible on respect for students. Lectures and textbook use were ok and could understand the material, but not to his liking. Not willing to help students better understand wrongdoings and was not respectful to student confusion. Great professor for content, but not by any means for respect and working with you",0
"Prof. Zbeida was one of my all time favorite college professors. I always got amazing feedback that was critical but never rude. She helped me improve my writing skills greatly. 10/10 would reccomend her course. There are many reserach papers and lots of quizzes, but every topic is interesting and the quizzes are very helpful.",1
"Lauren is very rude and whenever you ask a question and will make you sound like an idiot. On the exams, she says everything is testable material but never goes over the textbook certain chapters in class and bases the exams largely off of those chapters. Moreover, refuses to answer questions directly and refers you to the syllabus or textbook",0
"I would not recommend Char to any BIO 120 student. She does not explain the labs well and you are left to figure it out amongst yourselves. Not approachable. SUPER tough grader on graphs and reports. She does not respond to emails, if she does, they are confusing and/or one-worded. Search for another lab professor!",0
All lectures and boring teacher,0
"Very disorganized. Lost my final test. Took over my lab time after he'd approved it weeks in advance. Bright, scatterbrained. Difficult to predict what he will test over. Hate him a decade later.",0
The material is irrelevant & idiotic.  It's basically a basic Excel class w a scoop of Access on top.  Pure fluff. Tests are poorly worded & will include examples from class.  Quizzes are copied from text; her time limits guarantee that you have to skim the chapters beforehand.  Project was easy w extra credit.  Tossed book in trash. ,0
"Loves to hear himself talk!! He's a brilliant man, but most times i have no idea what he is talking about. If you don't have a background in poetry i do not recommend taking his class, it will be over your head. His lectures are usually long but assignments are not terribly hard",0
"Not a bad prof, great power point slides!! He seems to like what he does so it makes the course more enjoyable.",1
Jesse is a great professor. For those who are serious about art and becoming professional artists he is a great resource.,1
"I would recommend Professor Anbinder to anyone who wants to take a history class and really learn. You do have to put the work in if you want the grade, but it isn't too bad. If you don't read, you won't do good on the tests. Attending lecture REALLY helps! If you have any questions, go to his office hours and he'll help you! A very enjoyable class",1
"Ryan Romero is as subjective as they come. If you have to have him and are not some creative guru, just do your best and try not to be upset when he grades you really harsh. He is a cool guy and pretty understanding, but I wouldn't recommend to take this particular course from him. Unless you are outrageously talented, don't expect to make an A.",0
"Dr. Manchester definitely falls in the tough but fair category. But that shouldn't scare you off. She's very engaging and helpful and knows so much about the subjects she teaches. Most of her classes are discussion based, so show up and do your best to participate.",1
"As a teacher, he is adequate and you do learn enough to have gained experience taking this course.  As an Undergraduate advisor, he is unhelpful in providing guidance to any student who he deems unworthy.  He doesn't show it, but when you don't get a response from him after numerous attempts to contact him, you feel left in the dust.",0
"The way he grades things makes no sense, he needs to be more specific with what he wants. The class average for our first exam was 67 and the highest grade was an 85 but he still didn't curve the grade. His lectures take the entirety of the class period and he goes on a lot of unnecessary tangents. It is so difficult to stay focused in that class.",0
"Dr.Vineyard is very hard to talk to, and I never felt very comfortable asking questions, making this class very difficult. He expects most student to already understand some concepts even though it is a CS 101 class.",0
Excellent prof! Always demonstrate her knowledge by getting into the topic. She answers every student's question that were asked in class. Always remember to take good notes for the project and final exam. She gives a lot of in class time for the major assignment discussion.,1
"Never posted the grades onto canvas, always went off topic in lecture and was unclear with instructions. And the class was only exam based grading.",0
fun guy with a great sense of humor,1
"He is a little old man, you should respect him but if you cannot advocate for yourself you will not pass this class. He talks about stuff not related to the class. The reports are difficult because they are not explained well enough and he grades by writing words like ""hard and soft"" that do not make since. Test and quizzes are open book/note.",0
"I tooked the 115 and 125 class with Mrs,Wells. Very good teacher be prepare to do lots of homework. you want an ""A"" she will make you work for it. Her lectures are very clear she is very passionate about her job and helping her students.I would take her for all my math classes if I could.",1
"Pressured me into being in the ensemble, but since I've been in, it has been great!  Good short, little, round, bald man, take his classes!",1
"He was visiting Canterbury Uni for a semester. He taught us nothing, relied on the textbook and Youtube tutorials, and simply provided TopHat quizzes in class to check if we had read the book. The questions were specific to the book, rather than the topic area. He calls this 'peer instruction' but doesn't augment it with actual lectures.",0
Extremely fair and understanding. Would reccomend.,1
Mrs. Gilmore is a fantastic teacher who will give you every bit of information you need as long as you pay attention in class and ask questions if you're uncertain.,1
Exam questions are ridiculously specific,0
Very energetic and cares about his students.,1
BP is awesome. He's extremely intelligent and makes sincere comments on all of the work you hand in. Don't be afraid to say what you truly think!,1
"She was assigned to my lab portion of Biology class. She never interacted with us outside of a welcome message. The labs are all online and are ""do-it-yourself"" point and click in style, then a quiz on each lab set. If you aren't a science person, the labs are kind of boring because they aren't hands-on. But, it fulfilled my lab requirement.",1
"I didn't mind her. Had her my first semester, I did just fine. She lets you use a whole front and back notes on every test and 3 whole front and back notes on exam. How can you not pass, just use her study guide to make your notes with examples. She wasn't the best teacher, slow, not good time management, but examples she did were based on your Qs",1
"1st, I hate economics!  2nd, this prof took a subject I hate & made it interesting!  Great prof. class is part lecture part discussion.  He makes the lesson relatable to reality & current situations.  If you must take Econ, take him, you won't regret it.  3 tests & 1 paper.  You will always know where you stand with him, & he's a pretty funny guy.",1
"I don't think this professor is arrogant-he is proud of his accomplishments. He does talk about what he's done, but usually to explain something. He is extremely helpful and knolwedgeable. The class is demanding, but so is the world of p.r. If you can't handle a demanding class, you won't like working in p.r. Take him if you want to learn.",1
"Professor Barnum is a great teacher, he is helpful and really cares about your art and how youre doing in the class. If you skip you will fall behind and lose points. He is helpful during class and easy to email, he is willing to open the studio outside of normal class hours for you to have extra time to work.",1
"He has an accent, so he can be hard to understand sometimes. The lecture slides (from the course website) are unorganized and havent been updated since 2002. He does NOT use Blackboard and doesnt hand back marked labs (so you wont know if you did them correctly or not). He also doesnt post ANY grades until just before the last drop date.",0
"If you don't attend lecture, you won't pass because the tests are straight memorizing the lectures. He's respectful when talking about controversial topics. Tests are composed of 4 full page responses about certain philosophical topics. Be prepared to study 2 hours for each test if you want to pass. He offers extra credit: 1pt per essay page: yikes",1
I was so excited about taking physics until I met this guy. His lectures didn't make any sense. He liked making people look stupid. He used the sample problems from the book for the in class problems. I ended up dropping the course because I couldn't get it. I didn't take the first test but talked to some classmates and most of then got 20-30%!!!,0
"This is by far the most frustrating class I've taken in my first year here at WMU. Dane uses lectures and slides that haven't been updated since the 90's. There is no textbook, just the NPS website and he tells you how to take your notes and then grades you on them with no feedback. I put more work into this class than any other class I've taken.",0
"If you go to Pace, you must take her class.  It's like going to Paris and seeing the Eiffel Tower.  You may like or dislike its peculiar architecture, but you have to see it, and memories of the experience will last a lifetime.  Privet from the turn of the century.  Your old students may be out of touch, but are not forgetting you, Nancy.",1
"Kornfeld was actually really nice. I hate history and I ended up with an A in the class. It's easy, and she offers a lot of extra credit opportunities, so take advantage of those. She grades papers and essays pretty easily, so just make it seem like you know what you're talking about.",1
This teacher is very kind and willing to help you but he is an EXTREMELY harsh grader. It is almost impossible to do well on any of the papers and he expects so much out of students. Great guy but too harsh of a class to take especially considering that it is a GenEd class. Tests seem somewhat easy and straight to the point but his grades are not.,1
"Ghis is, in my experienced opinion, the best professor in the Biochem program at UNB.  His courses are phenomenally interesting, and his teaching style is second to none.  Although his midterms are a little on the tough side, I always found them easy because I absorbed everything he said in class.  An awesomely friendly guy, and a phenomenal teache",1
She's very unclear and doesn't give specific instructions. You have to beg her for help. ,0
"Dr. K was a really great professor & I liked her a lot for explaining things so you actually understood it & how the building blocks of chemistry works. The only thing I didnt like is that no matter how hard you try, she wont scale or curve. Her practice problems & exams were kinda different/harder from what you see in lecture too",1
Potvin is a great teacher! His class is a modeling class so it is not a normal lecture nor a normal lab. If you're not comfortable with engaging with other students I do not recommend this class for you. He also doesn't give you a straight answer in the middle of discussions so that's a warning. You will constantly be changing who you work with!,1
"Simha is great. He expects lots of class participation, but that makes class interesting and fosters learning. Check BB for your participation grades and talk to him if you believe you should be getting better because it's somewhat subjective. I felt like my input was valued and respected. I highly recommend this professor.",1
"The class is pretty boring and her notes are pretty scattered as she draws hundreds of web diagrams on the board, and tries to connect ideas.  I wouldn't recommend this class or the professor.",0
"love her!  i read some of the other comments..who cares about her attire? to say that she has a ""liberal agenda"" implies that she chooses texts that don't pertain to the class..untrue! as long as you complete the assignments and show effort in class you will be fine.  she's not going to hand you an A, but she won't make it hard for you to earn one.",1
"This professor gave me an extremely hard time. I have a great GPA and am very serious when it comes to my school work; however, this professor discouraged me with his sly comments, anger issues, and condescending attitude. He literally told us ""you don't know anything until I teach you"". He gave me a D after all the work I've done in his class. ",0
I took this prof for a second time because I thought he was so good.  He does seem more committed to the class this time.  It seems like he is getting harder for the specialization HR classes.,1
"Great teacher, like many extremely intelligent professors he is sometimes distracted by ""shiny things"", but he has a lot of important and educational things to say. His comments are quite useful no matter your degree. I reccomend him, but be a good reader, be able to read for critical details and quickly too!",1
"She is unclear & unorganized. My grade has been the same for the past 3 months. She grades almost nothing, & what she does grade is graded poorly with no explanation or feedback. We are basically done with this semester & I literally have no idea whether I will finish with a 95% in the class, or with a 25%. The only thing I can say to you is RUN!",0
"Super enseignante, elle est drole et intéressante. Par contre, elle ne permet pas les notes par ordinateur et passe rapidement les slides. Au moins, tout l'information se trouve dans son livre. J'ai apprécié mon cours avec elle c'est certain.",0
VERY HARD CLASS IF YOUR NOT A FINANCE MAJOR!!.....overall he's pretty cool guy but he teaches all on powerpoint  which makes it really hard to understand how to workout the problems..I took him in the summer and there were 3 tests and  like 10 quizzes and he dropped the lowest one..Take anyone but this guy trust me,0
"Scooter is a chill teacher. Definitely just show up every day, do the assignments on time, and you'll be fine. Never took any notes. Maybe scan through the powerpoints before tests, but I made A's on 3/4 of them without studying a bit.",1
"Hes hilarious, does homework during class, lets you out early, and let us choose the types of problems on the final. I think the TA sessions are pretty critical for extra practice.",1
professor sandweiss is a really hard teacher that gives a lot of readings for weekly discussions. hes a really hard grader too and its hard to keep up with class if youre initially not that involved in politics. his lectures are boring and incredibly long.,0
Excellent professor. I didn't think I could love marching band and symphonic band so much!,1
"Very knowledgeable, will always take the time to give you an answer for even the dumbest questions. Only issue is that we had to write out code with pen and paper for tests, and lectures can be a little week.",1
"I was very interested in philosophy, until I took this class. Gould was a horrible teacher. He was very unorganized, he would rant about tons of random things (I think I learned more about his life than about any philosophy topic). Gives the answers to test questions before test. If you want to learn philosophy, don't take him. Easy, but bad.",0
This class was pretty easy.  Definately went by way too fast.  Hasse is so great and funny.  Every one has a secret crush on him!,1
"I had professor Kuehn for his Italian Renaissance class. His jokes and cynicism kept the class interesting and helped to hold my attention for the majority of class time. Only grades came from 5-6 page papers, which I didn't mind.",1
"He uploads lectures that aren't his and whenever you ask a question his response is either ""review lecture"" ""review textbook"" or ""that's not my responsibility"" he tries to do everything but teach. ODU didn't give me the most recent textbook so I just didn't have a whole chapter and he goes ""try your best""",0
if you're planning on taking this class i'd suggest you find someone else. Ridiculous amount of homework with unrealistic due dates. His lectures are you filling in the blanks and not helpful you're left with more questions than answers. if you ask for help he tells you to go back and read again. take someone else!!!,0
Props to Princeton - this prof is smart and he knows it. He's pretty damn arrogant. Often pontificates in monotone -- you can tell when he's not talking to you anymore. Nice smile but a heartbreaker.,1
"I took this class in lecture and came out of it with a 45 average, took it online and came out with a 80 with a whole lot less work/trouble. TAKE HIM ONLINE",0
"Sheri is an exceptionally kind and intelligent teacher. She really cares about her students and wants them to succeed. She makes sure her tests are fair and goes the extra mile to make sure everyone understands the material. The class was good to go to, even though the material is inherently dry. Easy A if you're determined and decently intelligent",1
"I wanna clear the air real quick - YES Kovarik is a talker, but he is also a listener - which is what you need in a major like media studies. Still cool wit me, BIll - even thought I still haven't gotten that reccomendation letter back from you!",1
Should stick to math I have him more english,0
"No one should graduate college without having read Chaucer. Dr. Driver gives you the opportunity to do just that in the original Middle English. She gives various assignments, including Discussion Board postings, but is flexible on due dates.  She will work with you to improve your papers and will make you a better writer. Highly recommend!",1
good teacher. will help,1
"Professor Cohen has always been the one person i can go talk to whenever ii have concerns. II see some people say he is picky here, let me tell you from someone who has suffered from little things, he does this because he wants to to be prepared for the future, no boss is going to bother with you if you cant nail a paper. He plays favorites? HA no.",1
"Although I was not in her college class at ECC, I was participating in her college level Calculus course at Bartlett High School. Her class is very difficult and it may take months to get A's on her tests. As far as flexibility for help, she is usually avalaible.",1
"Professor Holslin has been extremely accommodating and helpful during the pandemic. She gives great feedback so you know how to fix your work to get a good grade. Despite her instructions being confusing at times, she is willing to help and answer questions. If you put in the effort, you will get a B or better.",1
"Dr. Boghosian is maybe the best professor to walk this Earth. I signed up for his course not for sure what to expect, but to my surprise, I learned more than I could have imagined in 8 weeks. If you are looking for a class to take this is definitely the one. You will love Dr. Boghosian and the material he teaches.",1
"My advice?  Don't take this class. The professor is unkind to students who need help.  He isn't involved in helping anyone.  He comes to teach lectures and that is it.  He doesn't care about anything else.  The TAs don't grade based on any rubric so nothing is graded consistently or fairly.  For a general class, too much is expected for the tests.",0
"Great prof. She seems a bit unapproachable due to her eye contact (or lack thereof), but she's really, really kind and always willing to answer questions. Her lectures are very well organized. Only complaint is student presentations. The good ones are GOOD, but the bad ones are a waste of 15 mins that could be better used by Kathryn herself.",1
Took Issues in Contemporary Art w/ her. Syllabus and blackboard assignments do not match up. She will not correct these even when told. Lecture based class. Make sure not to miss any or you may fall behind because she tends to add on to the already Very difficult grader and will call you out in front of everyone. Would not recommend her classes,0
"Explain stuffs well, very helpful and approachable too.",1
"Dr. Hollist is a very nice man and is genuinely a funny guy. Yet, he is an extremely hard grader and does not make any assignments clear. There are three main papers and two big presentations. Do not take him.",0
I wouldn't take this professor again if your looking for an easy A. Also the material is bizarre and can freak you out. Would not recommend.,0
"He is very clear about everything you need to know for tests. He post last years tests, holds optional Q&A sessions, and even allows note cards on tests. Homework problems are the same as on the slides (which he posts) just with different numbers, and same with tests. You don't have to understand the problems, you just have to practice the steps.",1
"The only reason students take Dr. Jones for genetics is because she is the only one who teaches genetics (most of the times). Nobody I have ever met has anything good to say for her at all. Her arrogance is all over her face, the way she talks, and the way she answers your questions. Why do I need to buy Tophat when I just spent $250 buying books?",0
"Madame Reisinger is a kind and wonderful lady, but she will make you work for your grade! She gives difficult quizzes, multiple difficult and time-intensive projects, and lots of readings. If you can manage the workload, the class is very good and will definitely improve your French.",1
"Noble as a professor is fine, but the class is very stressful and you have to figure out most of it on your own. If you don't do well on one test, it is very hard to get your grade up. Since there are so many students, you can't ask many questions. It felt like a very impersonal learning experience and you definitely will have to teach yourself.",0
"Barely teaches, isnt responsive to student feedback, has a monotone droning voice, cant stay on schedule with course material, spends at least 10 minutes ever class asking the class trivial math problems like what is 2 plus 5 and refuses to move on until somebody answers and then rants about how easy math is",0
Great professor...so nice and clear.,1
awesome teacher he can help with any kind of English defiantly over qualified to teach what he teaches,1
does not seem very educated and very bigoted. One thing I did learn in his class is that: Children have disabilities as punishment for their ancestors sins.,0
bad teacher,0
"I had a family issue that caused me to miss a few assignments. Not only was she more than understanding to the matter she also let me make up my work at a later date without taking points. She also cares about her students, as more than students. If your new to college or have a huge load one semester and need this class, She's the best!",1
NOT fair at all. Don't think he likes women or anyone that isn't a computer nerd like him,0
"Worst professor I have experienced. He is knowledgeable, but he is not able to relay that knowledge clearly to students. The syllabus and class is unorganized, and many of the lectures are repeated. He gives papers out late, with very little time to turn it in. The textbooks were only helpful to do the essays. Avoid, if possible.",0
"One of the best classes I've ever taken at UNT! I was in the accelerated 2040/2050 course and myself, professora and all the other students became like a big happy family, that worked really hard!! You must study, read, go to every class, get involved and work very hard. If you do all of these things, you will do very well. I already miss everyone!",1
"Easygoing, down-to-earth, and just overall a nice guy. Actually learned a few tricks here and there about word, excel and powerpoint Probably the easiest 'A' I have ever gotten. He tries hard to teach things to students, almost as hard as he tries to give you an 'A'.  Do your work  A I don't see how anyone can fail this class.",1
"Overall, he really cares about his students. You can tell he is extremely passionate about what he does. I found the tests to be difficult even with studying the objectives over a week in advance. Its defiantly doable but getting an A is a challenge. The class is extremely heavy on tests which are 400 points and 30 for one paper.",1
"Halaka truly cares about your understanding of the material. Her lectures are meticulously organized and she teaches abstract mathematical concepts in easy to understand ways. Best of all, she is accessible and more than happy to go over difficult material beyond class hours. She is tiny, sweet, and brilliant - a true gem indeed.",1
DOC IS SO COOL!,1
"Would not recommend. Makes the material extremely dull and boring. Do not take this class with her. Often she is rude and condescending in class. Tests are hard, but manageable. ",0
"An enthusiastic professor.  When he is lecturing on topic, it is so insightful that it makes up for when he is on a rabbit trail or story (which is good, because that happens a lot).  Beware his explosive laugh and flying lollypops and tootsie rolls. Loves student participation. You hear Van Til every day, and yet never figure out who he is : )",1
BORING!!!! Don't take this class at 9:00am he'll put you to sleep!!,0
worst prof i've ever had at york. her quiz had missing questions & spelling mistakes. she's unorganized and switched the group project around at the last minute. i avoid all classes that she teaches.,0
"She's friendly, but confusing and irritating. The questions she uses for homework are inconsistent with the ones on the tests. She told my class there would be no calculations on our final, and 40% of our test was calculations. I usually got nothing out of her lectures. Wish I would have dropped.",0
Amazing teacher. Very nice. ENG131 was only graded on 3 papers on books we've read and attendance. I feel bad I haven't read any of the books but I got a B and A- on the first two papers so far. Really easy grader and gives solid feedback. Def would take again.,1
"This profesor is not good, she cant teach at all! When ever she lectures we have to correct her on everything. You pretty much have to teach yourself. Also you cant even understand her hand writing! The worst thing is that the exams contain nothing that she teaches us! Dont recommend!",0
"Horrible class. Terrible lecture. Easy lab but not worth many points and tests are the bulk of the grade besides pop up quizzes. The class is not easy, especially for someone who does not like science. Alice only gave one extra credit option this semester and for those who struggle frequently it does nothing for you.",0
"terrible with teaching, not accessible outside of class, basically had to teach myself",0
"I really enjoyed English and even considered a double major. This class and Dr. Hart killed that passion. The in-class discussions rarely have anything to do with English, expectations are unclear. The average for the 1st paper in this class was a C-. Participation is mandatory and worth 15% of your grade. $200 in textbooks too.",0
"This teacher is awful.  He is old and slow and has the most boring lectures ever.  I would never take him again, his class consists of 3 essay tests, and he teaches you absolutely nothing.  The book is terrible, I would STRONGLY reccomend never taking this old man.",0
"monotone voice, id rather die than attend that class ever again",0
"She's kind of crazy, but she's a nice lady.",0
"Prof. Ludwig is such a great professor, he loves his job and it definitely shows. He actually learns all of his students' names. His power points and labs are great and filled with tons of information. He is the best Prof to have in the Psychology Department!",1
"Definitely not the best teacher. Constant math errors during the lecture as he ""wings it"". Hard to understand. Tests are often diff the examples. He does allow the use of ""cheat sheets"". There was no way I had better than a 45 in the class and lab yet he curved so heavily I received a C? Not a good teacher to take.",0
"Great teacher. His class is a blast so a lot of kids dont take him seriously.  But work is #1 on his list. Do everything to the best of your ability grades are serious, but he ha sooo much fun.",1
Stay away.  I will retake genetics at MCC over the summer. Newman is not a good teacher and I heard she does education research. She should research herself.,0
"Martin does a great job relating law to everyday life. I have learned so  much from our discussion post, and he will even respond back to your thoughts. However, almost every answer on the online tests is from quizlet's website. Lots of hw and stuff to do but it is mostly opinionated and participation points.  Required to log on 3 times a week. ",1
"One of the nicest lab instructors I've had. However, she's VERY harsh with marking. I studied like crazy and still managed to only get a B+ in the lab portion for this course. Despite her harsh marking, she provides crystal clear explanations and instructions in class, is very approachable, and is very respectful towards students.",1
"I took Comm and Improv the first semester that it was provided and it was so much fun! It sounded like a daunting acting-heavy class, but instead it was just a bunch of fun (and hilarious) games that improved my comm skills a ton! I have never laughed more in a class I swear. It was the highlight of my week, especially during the COVID times. 10/10",1
I learned so much from Dr. Downing and I thought her class was really interesting. She also teaches some film and advertising courses so you'll see a lot of those similar topics in her class. She is a harsh grader though and rather eccentrically loud and likes her students to speak their mind. Her class won't kill your GPA But be prepared to work.,1
He makes you write many different types of small papers on top of the essays due in class.  there is a lot of reading to do.  If you think you can handle an 8am and do the work then go for it.  but personally i did not enjoy being there.  plus he's a difficult grader!. don't recommend taking his class.,0
"Brother Lenhart knows a lot, but is very disorganized and distracted. Class is completely all over the place. I never knew what was going on or what was due when. TANGENTS GALORE. Class never EVER ends or starts on time. Honestly worst class/prof I've ever had. Only good thing is tests are take home... that saved me!",0
The best professor De Anza has to offer. Changed my major to history because of Kline.,1
The most boring class and very essay filled. She goes essay crazy. And too much reading,0
"I really love this guy. he is funny and very helpful.  When it comes to grades, he makes sure you know where you are and what you need to do to succeed.  he is the best:)",1
She is smart and knows her stuff. No doubt about that and she is a good person at heart but I wish she could at least see how it is for first time learners when it comes to micro. We don't have a PhD in that field and need more time then what was given to UNDERSTAND. I took anatomy and so much other required classes for nursing major. I couldn't de,0
"Professor Castelao-Lawless was a very nice lady and certainly tried to make class bearable, but wasn't a very good teacher. She's hard to follow in her lectures. Her handwriting is also atrocious and thats how all notes are taken. Only two tests and the final go into the grade book, so if you're not a good test taker then don't take her course.",0
"Dumbest class I've ever taken doesn't have any marking scheme and gives good marks to whatever he thinks looks nice. Also doesn't explain how we are marked, as he told us at the beginning of the term 20% would be marked on tutorial attendance. Went to every class and still finished with only 75% of the tutorial mark without any explanation",0
"Professor Corbett is a well respected man in his field. He tell stories that is related to the class subject, the HW is so easy but requires the textbook. Midterm, final, and a term paper.  Both exams have a test review.",1
This professor enjoyed making instructions and class discussions unclear for the students. It was difficult to know how to succeed in his class because he did not explain expectations or requirements. It never felt like we accomplished or learned anything with class discussions. Overall I thought the class was very discouraging.,0
"Frankly, his lectures suck. I did appreciate his information, and it was cool to see the applications of what we're learning, but a 300 person lecture is not the time or place for off-topic factoids. Homework is quite difficult and graded harshly, the same for exams. Don't take for 145.",0
I took him for genetics lecture and lab and also had him for environmental biology lab. He is a very difficult teacher. He will rip your papers apart. I would not recommend taking him if you can avoid it.,0
"He's absolutely the stereotypical absent-minded professor, but he's a good teacher and a very nice guy. Side note: he calls powerpoints 'powerpuffs.' Still not sure if he's kidding or not.",1
"First let me say: sweet lady. Really loves and cares for her students. Can't teach to save her life. Her lectures are practically nonsense they're so scattered. They're extremely boring and always confusing. Even the most basic, simple scientific concepts she somehow turns into brain sludge. Sweet lady. Awful teacher.",0
i called him professor fidel nicastro all semester.  the online homework is terrible.  a lot of memorization cause he doesnt give you the equations you actually need.  huge curve at the end becuase everyone fails.  he gets really pissed off if the class doesnt answer questions so just hope theres someone who knows what they are doing.,0
"The ASL class had a pleasant and quiet atmosphere. We didn't speak and really immersed ourselves in the language. The way she went about teaching without speaking wasn't hard to follow at all, like you may think. I would take the next ASL class with her again if I had the opportunity to do so.",1
"Shortridge isn't as bad as he appears to be, his tests are much easier than Hutson's and he is willing to give curves. Also, if you read his slides you will do well on his tests.",0
"VERY INSIGHTFUL. You must look at the class a different way. Not your typical lecture. It's not ""heres the problem, and heres how to do it"". It is more 'these simple problems effect everything in exsistence, learn to love it'.",1
ROCKS! He is the best & most engaging teacher i've at this University.  Every teacher should be made to teach like him. He is tuff but you learn a lot from real world examples. I read the chapters and attended lectures and got an A. He is friendly but believes in making you accountable for your work. I like that.,1
"He is a funny guy, a little strange but that's what keeps you interested. He made geography very intriguing for me. His tests included EVERYTHING though, from other peer presentations to little side comments during notes. So study everything! but LOTS of extra credit!  Very understanding as well.",1
"Dawes is very clear, passionate about what he teaches, and gives great lectures. Tests are a great change of pace from other classes.",1
"Dr. Brown is hilarious, so listening to his lectures was never a challenge. The class was extremely easy, although he was a very slow grader and our grades were a bit unclear. If you ask for individual help, he's very nice and takes the extra time out to speak with students one on one. I could tell he was passionate about what he was teaching.",1
"Monotone, boring. Went way too fast through the course for me to make any sense of it.",1
SHE IS THE BEST. I seriously almost considered switching my major after taking her class. Her lectures are so awesome and fun and she makes everything really easy to understand! The only problem is that it is kind of hard to get an A in her class. Doesn't have a lot of opportunities to get an A. Her study guide really helps for each test!,1
"Danny is a really nice guy. There are 10 small assignments and then a final research paper. He was slow to get back grades and hard to reach outside of class but was willing to offer help and answer questions in class. He likes to have discussions in class and he made research methods, a class I was dreading, somewhat enjoyable.",1
"Ie njoy history, and humanities but I feel like Pabel ruined early modern Europe for me forever. Extremely hard marker on papers and quizzes. Closed minded to new views or concepts, used extremely snobby elitist oxford texts. He obviously is a smart man and has a deep interest in the subject, but your views better be EXACTLY the same as his.",0
Worst teacher I have ever had. The only reason why people love him is because hes an easy A if you can tolerate him and just show up. He barely teaches from the text he assigns so dont even bother wasting your money. He only talks about his personal research and opinions on topics not directly related to the course material. Just want an A? Take,0
"I withdrew  from the class, as well as many others! We started with maybe 15 or more, by the time I dropped there were 6.  She did not teach the subject where the student could understand and retain the information! If you ask for help during class, her response is always ""Well..., I don't understand why you don't understand"".",0
"Her note taking style is impossible to follow, she doesn't accept outside perspectives for the most part, and is a harsh grader who gives minimal feedback.",0
"Works very hard to make things clear. Grading was quick and fair. No textbook and slides were intentionally not helpful. Makes studying hard, forces you to go to lectures. Attendance not mandatory, but don't show up, don't pass. Great prof if you could keep him in a lantern like a genie.",1
"Professor Stone is very passionate about his subject, and the class is great for art history majors. I would not recommend this class to non-majors who just want to fill a breadth requirement. The class is graded entirely on exam grades, and the exams are not easy. Don't skip the lectures or you will not do well on the exams!",1
"She takes the time and is very straight forward, most professors beat around the bush and make you learn techniques in a very difficult way. Kathlyn was so nice and straight forward, her lectures were engaging and non intimidating. I took Managerial Accounting 1 for the Fall of 2019 and that class was terrifying and not a safe place to learn.",1
I kept taking dr.barclay over and over again.  I even sat in on lectures that I wasn't scheduled for.  Three hour lectures (w/ a question period) were never boring.  I loved this Prof. for enlightening me on so many things.  I graduated in 1987.  I still,1
He is a great professor!  Follow his readings and attend class and you will learn everything you need to plus more.  I will take him over and over again.,1
She is a really tough grader and oftentimes her feedback isn't that helpful. Shouldn't be teaching freshman.,1
omg... i did not have a good experience withthis professor. She failed me on a paper but never gives an explanation why. i only saw her once a week and i dreaded everytime i went. i did however make a b in her class suprisingly.,0
Traci is difficult to follow and her expectations are inconsistent among students even within the same class. For her part in 1130 the test was wildly inconsistent with the teaching provided.,0
A really fun guy that will not hold you back at all. He's very happy to help you out if you ask him and gives out a good amount of extra credit. A pretty good professor from the classes that I've had with him. He knows the material pretty well and you can go up to him with questions if you have them.,1
"took both american romanticism and New orleans in lit with her and Dr. Watts is AMAZING!!!!! she's super smart, really interested in what her students think, and strongly encourages independent thought. entire grade is based on essays, and she's a pretty easy grader. passionate writing gets As. TAKE HER!!!!",1
Terrible professor. She is very rude. Does not use D2L and is very unclear about what she wants.,0
"PROFESSOR FARHAT IS TRULY THE BEST PROFESSOR YOU CAN EVER HAVE AT BERGEN! She is so understanding and tries to help you out in any way that she can! Not one lecture is boring, she makes them really fun actually, and her stories are really funny. You can relate to her so much, she is HILARIOUS! I recommend her 100% take her, you won't regret it!",1
Would not take again. Very unorganized !,0
"She is a great person and she is great with all of the theatre stuff here, but I don't know if teaching is really her thing. She goes a lot by the book. Our classes are always a lot of fun though.",1
"Get out the way of him for your mental health. He is a mental test for deciding your patience level. He doesnt mind students needs just focus on own speech. Only talks normal with female students. If he doesnt like you for some reason, even if you dont have a idea why, he never talks with you if it is not mandatory. Easy grader but teach less.",0
Did not enjoy this class at all. Her lectures are really boring and she doesn't clarify much... She is a really hard marker. ,0
He is the best.  He rocks.  I could honestly listen to him talk for hours.  I wish all profs were like him.,1
Profesora Rodríguez is the bomb! She is so great to talk to. Sometimes it is hard to understand her directions but you can always feel welcome to talk to her after class. She helped me to add my Spanish major to my special ed. major and is now my advisor. Seriously the best Spanish prof ever!,1
Writes extremely unclear and bad assignments and exam questions. Explanations of concepts and ordering of material is mediocre at best. Only good quality is that he talks obscenely slow and so you can watch lecture recordings at 2x,0
He doesn't make it mandatory attendance for regular days only for presentation days. his class is an easy day. i never used the book,1
He is so smart that he forgot what it's like to be a dumb college student therefore lectures are dense and fast! Entire grade 3 tests that are about 30-35 Qs (inappropriately short to gauge student knowledge). This class blocks students from PT school when they are smart enough to get in anyways. WARNING: Take elsewhere!! Studying is NOT enough...,1
"extremely intelligent and knowledgable, but can seem to be extremely arrogant and cynical. dont let my personal feelings put you off however, cos he's a great professor.",1
"With this online class you just watch videos and go through the content online, there isn't much need for the hard copy work book. Ragan seems uncaring and inflexible when it comes to working with online students with busy circumstances. You can pass and get an A, but you have to put in a lot of time and work.",0
"Don't show up to lectures or get the book. Tbh, theyre both long and boring. Conte's a nice guy, but the subject material is kind of stale. Theres 3 tests (each worth 25% of grade), and a 7ish page paper (also worth 25%). The exams are definition based, just study his powerpoints and find good quizlets on the material and you can get an A cramming",1
"Heard many great things about this professor and was excited to take her, but the class is completely different online than it was in person. She made the tests harder and gave us old practice tests to study off but was not helpful. I understood the material from her teaching but if you do bad on the exams you will not pass the class.",0
"He's a little disorganized, and material on the assignments is unexpected at times. But at least you have time to work on it. The midterms and final followed from the assignments in a way that made sense.",1
"German is a super nice guy and the class is very easy, but he is very unorganized and is very hard to follow. He constantly jumps around from topic to topic and gives very vague answers to your questions. You never know what is expected of you and you always feel like you're missing something.",0
"Awesome teacher when she actually makes it to class. Constantly canceled class, but is very helpful. She takes forever to get material back to you. Don't buy the book. She doesn't have firm deadlines, so it was hard for me to be motivated to get work done.",1
Below average teacher,0
"Professor Klimchuk is one of the most enthusiastic professors you'll ever meet. He talks pretty fast sometimes, but it's because he loves philosophy too much to stop. The essay topics were interesting, and it was easy to improve. Attending lectures was necessary to understanding topics and will give you specific information to improve essays.",1
"she's an okay professor. She's not the best, but she's very nice.",0
hes not a bad guy but his lectures are a bit messy and not based on 1 chapter but like 3 in one and from random chapters too. tests are based on textbook &10% from lecture. LOTS to read. i studied 2weeks in advance for using on one chapter for two days (for 6 chapters) & i still got a 65% and im an 8GPA. idk really try hard. first test is hardest,0
"Appears unapproachable but he's an easy person to talk to. If you need any help, ask him questions and he'll help you.",1
"I took her online class and I let her know what my problems were and even came to an in class class to do the work but she was kinda mean, and had an I don't care attitude.  I'm taking it again in class and I'm sure I'll do fine but I won't like to have her as a teacher.",0
Amazing teacher. Kit keeps his class relaxed but remains engaging due to his humor and passion.,1
"Professor doesn't seem to care about his lectures that much, disorganised course, doesn't post notes, but at least the tests were the same as last years.",0
I'm in her class now and I must say she is passionate and helpful. I absolutely love her. She's easy to talk... Except homework and a lot of writing but if you apply yourself and seek help she's totally there for you. I would recommend her in a heart beat.   Might I had she's beautiful! ,1
"His lectures were organized, he was easy to follow and clear. Broke up the lectures with videos. Funny guy too. Lecture slides are in-depth, so if you mainly focus on knowing and understanding lecture slides and go over textbook readings you will do well! Lectures a little boring to follow along at times. His tests are very reasonable.",1
Tony is super caring and willing to help you if you put the effort forward to seeking his assistance. I took this as my first film class and he was more than willing to work with me and catch me up to speed on things I was behind on.,1
She physically and mentally cannot stay on topic for more than 1 minute. SO difficult to understand what is going on.,0
The online quizzes have nothing to do with the topic at all. Be prepared with Google to look up the answers. She is scatterbrained and can never finish a lecture on time. Her lectures are super boring. You NEED a clicker for attendance and participation points. She coughs a lot too which is annoying af.,0
"Very boring class and subject, we take 2 minutes before every class as down time right before she hits you with phonetics and phonology, one of the most complicated subjects to learn at GV. Grades every assignment as if its a final exam. Extremely picky about how to format the heading of your assignment, not just essays, literally assignment.",0
"I'll be lucky to get a C in his class. Mahaffey is the worst grader I've ever had, and practically insults your intelligence when giving back case studies in his stupid feedback comments. Loves to pick favorites, and gets pissed off when students don't understand something from the textbook. Avoid!!",1
"She's such a sweetheart! The class is fun and enjoyable. She gives reviews before the test, but it's not thorough so read the book, you'll need it. PAY ATTENTION to the lectures if you dont have the book. THe projects are fun, she's very chill and has a nice sense of humor.",1
"Attendance is not mandatory, but highly recommended. Prof has lame sense of humor, but at least she tries. I normally HATE math/anything math related, but I easily followed her lectures and found the subject matter interesting. She is very easy to understand and VERY helpful if you have questions, etc. Full PP lect notes available online.",1
"Very good professor, makes everything clear, and goes out of his way to ensure you understand the material.  Says class attendance is mandatory but not enforced but you'll miss critical material 3 tests, 3 HW assignments, no quizzes, possible to cram in the last week w/out reading, only if you attend all in all, best Econ professor, take this class",1
Great teacher! easy tests..  tough grader on assignments and mock trial i would recommend taking  her,1
"I feel he did a decent job teaching everything but opamps, which are very important.  I think he calculates final grades on a big curve bc my test grades were a 42, 89, and a 56 and ended up with a B+. He does teach very clear and it is easy to tell he enjoys this stuff, I would recommend him",1
Dr. Morgan is super nice and laid-back...you'll feel comfortable asking him absolutely anything and he will definately help you learn..his lectures are clear and he writes notes on the board...6 quizzes that are super easy if u just skim the lab b4hand and he drops one...the tests are more difficult but just study and u can definately get an A,1
"He overexplains simple concepts to the point of confusion, and is so high energy it gets tedious. Everything he says starts to blur together, and I found myself nodding off in almost every class. Math is hardly ever difficult for me, and I already knew the concepts from this class from high school, but I struggled with this teacher.",0
"Lets you work at your own pace as its pretty much a learn on your own class. You teach yourself. If you have questions, just ask other students as she doesn't really know how to use any of the programs. Pretty easy though if you already have a pretty good idea how to use the programs. But should get another teacher if you don't.",0
"Doesn't care much for students teacher does not help those in need only the ""teachers pets"" wouldn't recommend taking ANY classes from her",0
I had tate for modern architecture and history of design. Best professor i've ever had. He changes the way you see and think of things all around you. Has the best stories so that makes class enjoyable.  A lot of work to keep up with so make sure you don't get behind. Definitely take him if you can!!,1
"I came in late, turned in work late, you didn't have to do all the assignments only submit for the final like the ones you've scored your best and that was it, pretty easy. She had some easy homework and then when was close t finishing it all she told the class we didn't have to do it anymore. She showed us videos,let us leave early,was nice,fed us",1
"How well the class goes almost entirely depends on you. Dr. Flint is a gem & she has knowledge to share but she wants her students to engage in conversation. Thats why we go to college, right? She's perfect. 2 historiography pprs, article rdngs + summaries, 2 presentations. I enjoyed her assignments. Participate, give a darn, try, you'll do well.",1
"Very good, takes info for tests right from the slides",1
"She speaks with a Spanish accent which was hard for me to get over at first. I think she is a very kind and smart women but she may be too smart. She often says ""That's just the way it is"" rather then trying to help us understand better. She speaks only in Spanish in class which makes it harder to understand a new concept.",0
"I like Tom as a person; he's a great guy.  However, I did not learn as much in this class as I would have liked to.  He explains things by telling personal stories, which is entertaining but not helpful.  His tests are completely invalid, as they dont measure what youve learned.  True, you can do the EC but spending $ on this class isnt recommended",0
"Professor Johnson was great! She has very specific grading criteria and is firm but fair when grading. I think what I most appreciated was that she gave firm, but honest feedback. If you're looking for a teacher to boost your self esteem, look elsewhere. If you're looking to learn and improve your writing abilities, take Karen's class!",1
"Oh boy, this was not what I expected when I signed up for his class. I barely passed this class. Its true, he didnt teach and he didnt prepare us for the longest and worst exam of of life. Pure hell with him. At the end he let us retake exams and that helped me pass but I wouldnt ever take this again. F ++++ for his teaching! Worst professor!",0
She definitely understands her subject but she very hard to understand. I think she is from Bangladesh originally. Due to the boring nature of the subject and her accent you will probably find yourself drifting off in her class. Her tests are hard but the quizzes are easy because they aren't proctored.,0
"Professor Evarts definitely isn't an easy professor. While I did not do most of the reading myself, the class is possible to pass without doing so. Taking notes on literally everything he says will be your saving grace and with the open note/book tests, you'll really need to. I had an A in the class until I stopped going due to how boring he is.",0
good lectures and fair grader,1
Research=yes; Teaching=NO!,0
"Dr. D knows what she's talkin about. But she is rude and talks down to students. Always 10 min late and complains about her busy life. Never available to help, cuz she's ""so busy"" and doesn't like any opinon unless it agrees with hers.  Too much reading (100 pages on the first day)and no exageration,there's about 60 pages of writing all semester.",0
Worst teacher in my opinion.,0
"Even if you give all your answers in verbatim(as he wants it to be) he will still be confused by what you wrote. Take the extra credit he offers you, you WILL need it. Don't go to his class? Get ready to fail.",0
"Hands down, the worst professor I've ever taken at JMU. ""Lectures"" are all over the place, and he just puts a bunch of random words in a word document and rambles on. Before the quizzes, you have to read all the scenarios in a book, and he asks 12 T or F questions that are impossible to remember in the reading because the reading is like 100 pages.",0
Absolutely terrible at explaining things and talks too low to be heard unless you're in the front row. Lectures are very rambly. Didn't seem very confident about anything he was teaching. Would not take again.,0
The guy is very knowledgeable and has a lot of practical experience and is into management.  Always helps when asked.,1
"I loved this class! Dr. Honts is a renowned polygrapher and expert witness.  His lectures are great- lots of first hand experience.  Tests are tough- they're on BlackBoard, but you have to take them at the testing center, so no open notes/ book.  Put the time in, and you'll get a good grade.  No tricks.",1
She is awesome! Is concerned about students & their understanding of the material. For a college level class it is on the easy side but is a great trasition for a freshman student. TAKE HER CLASS you wont regret it!,1
"Dr. Mike is the best professors I have ever had here at the University of Michigan. I had never really encountered physics before, so I was terrified going into this class. He made it a class that I was able to get an excellent grade in. He goes above and beyond for his students. Dr. Mike is amazing. ",1
"This has been one of the best classes I have ever taken at school. Brother Goodwin is inspirational and really gets you motivated to learn! His class will take a lot of time with his tests, but he gives you all of the resources necessary to pass the class.",1
"Uses old lectures, talks to much about his personal life that no one cares about and less time on the course material needed to succeed in weekly quizzes. Lecture videos are not very helpful to succeeding in class.",0
"This was one of the worst classes I've ever taken.  This was topic in films coen bros, and we never talked about anything other than the film's genre. The quizzes were trivia questions, one of the questions was actually ""what is this character's favorite band"" The analysis in this class would feel shallow to a 9th grader.  This is a joke of a class",0
worst professor. easy grader.,0
"Initially took this class with a different prof and had to drop it due to the difficulty. Alaca made this class a lot easier to grasp, and I ended up with an 'A' when I took it with her. If you can, take this course with her instead of IB, I went from D to A after switching sections.",1
"my favorite part of her class was that she would stop & just talk with us- either examples or just random stuff- & let people share their own stories :)  she posted all her notes & pretty much stuck to them, so its pretty hard to fall behind.",1
"Stanbury is an excellent prof, she is extremely intelligent and choose uncommon, diverse readings for class.  People who don't do well in her class just aren't working and are making excuses for themselves.",1
"Ganesh is a fairly nice guy and wants to help you, but is not successful in doing so. He is a very unorganized prof and difficult to follow in lectures. His tests and quizzes are not based on material learned in class or the textbook, and he tries to trick everyone. ",0
"You need to buy SIMnet for this class ($90) cause thats where all your assignments are. Its an easy class, its just a lot of work online with Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc. Also, the text book will help you with your tests so you should buy it!",1
The discussion TA's are heavenly I learned more from them then Igo. My TA was a God send and I'm only passing the class because of her. You will mostly be depending on them so if you get a bad TA then RIP. Lectures are useless and you wont learn anything because she doesn't teach anything. I would say skip but she has graded clicker questions.,0
"Tests and exam questions were very similar to the ones in the textbook. Mandatory online Lyryx assignments every week (which is an extra $40) but the practice helped a lot. Getting through his accent may take a few lectures, but otherwise he's a very good prof.",1
"I took his class as my first programming class in college. I consider myself fairly good at picking up new information and concepts. As a new programmer, I am here to tell you that Professor Teng is NOT a good professor when it comes to explaining things at the bottom level. If you have a good base in programming, you will be fine. If not, buckleup",0
Dr. Gates has made me the person I am both professionaly and personaly.  He is one of greatest mentors I have had in my life and there haven't been many.  He is always there for his students and is one of the most intellegent and professional men I've met.,1
"Dr. Ford is the second best prof I have ever encountered so far. He is knowledgable and enthusiastic. You can tell he loves what he is doing. The course was very heavy and the plant collection assignment was extremely time-consuming, just take your time and you will be fine.",1
He is one of the best professor in NYU Poly . I took his CM1014 class also. I would give him ten stars if  I can.,1
"Outside of class, Renee is a great women. Inside, she will rip your project apart if you don't like. It was difficult to come up with ideas that she could approve of. And if there is one flaw in your work she will take it off and make you do the whole thing over.",0
"Do the assigned homework problems and you will ace quizes because they are the exact same. Tests are most of the class grade though, and those were really hard. Lectures were boring. I advise to not take the summer class as I did because it is so much information crammed into 6 weeks.",0
"The guy's old school, but don't mistake that for his ignorance of the basics of photography. He knows what he's talking about.",1
Not a very good teacher. Class is very dry and boring. One important factor is however the practice tests and homework problems. I barely passed with a C,0
"She assigns an insane amount of work. If you have a life, skip taking her class.  She is also a complete Nazi when it comes to using blackboard. Some teachers don't provide enough communication, this one provides WAY TOO MUCH & all the information gets confusing.",0
"This is how to write a paper for this guy: ?Class is used in the service of the status quo,? says Lacan. A number of narratives concerning not theory per se, but subtheory may be discovered. .."" It's all meaningless, just like his course content. He's got his favorites who spout back the same drivel that he teaches. Unless you want to become anothe",0
"Randomly jumps years,religions,people,topics. ",0
"There are 2 midterms and 1 final. He did curve one of the midterms because the class did pretty badly. He also offers 3% extra credit. His explanations were a bit unclear, but as long as you follow his steps and practice before the exams, you should be good. Attendance is not mandatory, however I would HIGHLY recommend going to class for examples.",1
Ashcraft is a great teacher. He is very fair and understanding. Hes a funny guy and keeps class interesting.,1
BORING!!! The tests are hard! You don't have to go to class if you have notes from someone else. This man has taught the same stuff since he popped out of the womb it sounds like. TAs help a lot so use them!!,0
"Have him for circuits at UM-Flint. Terrible professor. Dry, boring, hard to understand. At least one main example in each class period is done wrong. We have to correct him all the time. Overall, I'll try my hardest to never have him as a prof again.",0
"he is not helpful at all,",0
Professor Woodman made lectures enjoyable which made up for the fact that she enforced attendance. She responds to emails quickly and is always very nice and helpful. All homework and quizzes are online and you can work as far ahead as you want; midterm and final were really easy.,1
"THOUGHT THIS CLASS WAS GONNA BE GOOD BECAUSE HE WAS SUCH A NICE AND LAID BACK TEACHER. HE DOESNT RESPOND TO EMAILS AND HE TALKS TOO MUCH DURING LECTURES, MAKING IT UNCLEAR ON WHAT TO STUDY FOR THE CLASS. VERY CONCEITED, TESTS ARE HARD. ITS NOT WORTH THE GEN ED.",0
Really helpful...lots of extra credit and study sessions. Fair...patient...helpful.,1
"The class consisted of good discussions and some fun films, but there are some films that are agonizing to sit through. Discussions can sometimes drag on for too long, but they are essential for taking tests. In addition, tests are very hard and mostly subjective, hence going to discussions is important.",1
"This was the WORST class I have taken EVER in history of my 4 yrs in college.  The professor was not clear about what was being tested on.  TESTS were HARD and never consistent. He seemed to get joy out of failing people.  I dropped the class in the last week, so I didn't mess up my GPA.  HORRIBLE class unless you are a Physics major.",0
Absolutely great professor. Essays were graded harshly but not unfairly and grammar is SUPER important. I took his Gladiators and Roman Spectacles class and was actually surprised how -not difficult- it was. I definitely didn't get an A because of my essay scores but there only a few assignments and the readings were enjoyable.,1
She is hands down one of the best teachers I have ever had. She can come off as intimidating but many of grew to see her as a mother figure. The writing assignments can be a little hard but if you can find a topic you are passionate about it all comes easy. Show effort! She will quickly get to know you. She cares about you and wants you to succeed.,1
"Had him for PRJ566, and it was quite a mess. His expectation of us throughout the course was pretty unclear. Often he leaves in the middle of class and disappears for a long while. Doesn't seem to care all too much for the students. I would avoid him.",0
"Good teacher, bad grader.",0
"I ended up dropping out of his class because of how upsetting his class is. He formats his class without clear expectations and refuses to curve his exams. He doesn't even use canvas, instead of using google classroom. Just don't take him, you'll be much happier.",0
"Definitely the best prof I've ever had! He knows his stuff, he's entertaining, he's happy to help, and he's good to look at. Really. The. Best.",1
The grading scheme was very unforgiving. We were graded by 19 minute weekly quizzes that were worth 70% of our total grade and the rest was by projects. Jarek is an okay lecturer. He held no office hours and only held a live class once a week. The material done in class did not prepare us well for the quizzes. Avoid online classes with him!,0
"I would not recommend taking any classes with this professor. He is very knowledgeable but his lectures are boring and hard to understand. He takes attendance every day and never cancels class. He is an older guy and rarely sends emails out, nothing is online. If you have a question you will get a better answer from his TA than you will from him.",0
"This professor does not care about the success of his students. If you take this professor, you will be stressed to an unhealthy level the whole semester. He requires a research paper worth 40% of your grade that is insanely hard, and he refused to answer questions on the paper the final three weeks before it was due. DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR.",0
Loved this prof! Had him for 2 years and enjoyed this class immensely both years. Made learning extremely fun and interesting. Highly recommended class and prof!,1
"He is an awesome teacher. He really knows what hes talking about and he generally cares about what his students think. The exams are timed writings and pretty hard. As long as you go to class and take good notes you shouldn't have a problem. He is super funny and said the weirdest things sometimes too, which makes that class even better.",1
She is a tough grader and not very considerate. This is considering she was not able to come to a lot of our classes (which students pay for) because she was too sick to come to class. Going to lectures are also useless since she basically just reads her slides the entire class.,0
A very nice person but she cannot teach.,0
"So much wrong with this professor and her class. Couldnt catch up, wasnt very understanding, even though were literally in the heat of a pandemic.",0
Mrs. S is an absolute sweetheart! she is beyond dedicated to her students and works around the clock to help you achieve your goals. I never had a professor that was so caring to her students and truly helps you in whatever you need. As long as you work hard and follow directions you will be successful in her class! She has a great sense of humor!,1
Terrible prof.,0
"You need to be prepared to teach yourself. She offers lectures for the online class once in a while, but these lectures are boring and unclear.",0
Oh and I forgot to mention that she also gives corrections which really helped..I wish we had more teachers like that,1
"She can be extremely hard, rude, and she'll force you to be meticulous. She only GUIDES you through the course material and will NOT break it down to an easily understandable level. With that being said, Lutz has been the greatest contribution to my engineering education. Although you will hate life in her classes, she'll make you a great engineer.",1
"Tomi is wonderful! Very fun to listen to as well! Alabma Stories, Woohoo! Your education at UTM is not complete until you have Tomi! You should hear her sing Sweet Home Alabama.",1
"He is cute and really nice. He puts all the notes online and has a good review powerpoint which tells everything on his tests. There are random pop quizzes about once a week, and a few online discussions. Easy class, good and nice prof. I would def take another class by him",1
"Extremely tough grader and not an understanding person. The class was laid out in a strange way and didn't really take anything useful from it. Doesn't allow more than two absences or you will lose final grades points, even though going to class was unnecessary.",0
"He's nice, but this was a stupid course they make us take....he doesn't seem sincere....runs hot and cold---sometimes friendly, especially when a parent is around or he's being observed....he's a bit of a ""put-on.""",0
"Dr. McDonald is a great and funny professor. You will not regret taking your required investigative lab with him. A 5 hour lecture one day a week seems like a lot, but this way you do most of your work (and even outside work) during class time. He puts in a lot of effort to help you and the class is EXTREMELY easygoing just like him.",1
He is a great professor!! I highly recommend taking him again.,1
"Dr. Brown is an amazing physics professor. He's very passionate about what he does and loves teaching physics. His lectures can lose people at times but he gives tons of materials that will help you understand. Daily lecture checkpoints, homework, and exam reviews are all very useful. The chaos theory part of the class is very interesting as well.",1
"Beware of this guy. His presentations in class are ""okay"", but if you get to an assignment and you can't figure it out, well tough luck. He also takes off grades if you do not show your explanation for questions (even if they are simple math questions).",0
"His classes are very very easy. You hardly have to do anything to achieve a high grade in his classes. He does provide extremely interesting readings. In the end you can get an A, but it is up to you to determine whether you actually learn anything. He is very outspoken, so be prepared to have your beliefs challenged.",1
"Besides being one of the most pompous professors at StFX, his lectures are phenomenal. Something about the way he speaks just gauges automatic interest and attention. He does a really good job of clarifying ideas and concepts. He is also very helpful when you ask for help.",1
"This professor assigns massive loads of work, is extremely vague, and pretends to know more than she does. I learned nothing of value from taking this class.",0
"The class is generally easy.  It's ok to miss class a few times and even when you're in class, it's a common tendency to doze off.  Papers aren't bad- he gives you a grade with a few marks on the paper and then gives you a chance to correct your paper for full credit.  Good grades, nice guy, so I suggest him if you don't mind a few boring classes",1
"Resourceful, connected, and respected. His lectures are very practical and taking his class helped me focus my future career prospects. Available for feedback and pays attention to student needs and questions.",1
"The first half of the 3 hour class, he has a discussion on various current topics that he ties into stats.  The second half  he goes thru the text book. You need to do the questions at the end of each chapter to succeed on exams. Group tutorial is offered and helps alot. As stats is mandatory, this is least painful of them all.",1
Awesome prof. Very helpful and very handsome.,1
Heidi is SO GREAT. She really loves what she teaches and she teaches it well. Tests can be tricky if you don't pay attention or do the readings. But I highly highly recommend her as a teacher!,1
rude. rude. rude. he gives 10 point quizzes every week that make no sense. he's awful and miserable. do not recommend. I thought it was easy and I paid a lot of attention.. wrong. don't bother buying textbook. ,0
"A lovely professor! For a subject that may not be exciting to some, Antoni definitely makes it interesting. Very approachable and knowledgeable. Do the weekly quizzes since an average of 85% or over in every one of them means you don't have to write the final. A lot of material is covered in this course, so this method is highly recommended!",1
"As hard as this class is, he's the perfect prof to teach it. His lectures are so eye-opening and engaging. Every class you leave with your mind blown. Easily my favorite prof at GV.",1
"There was lots of homework for me because I took this class as a flex. I previously sucked at math and this class helped me be above average in solving algebra problems. I usually got C letter grades in math and thanks to the caring teaching the professor had with all her students, I passed with a high A and am ready for more math!",1
"The structure for Packy's Online classes include: watch hours of video content linked from other universities, some hard to understand, fill in multiple 60 page documents, then take a test that is usually timed around four hours and has 300 questions. If this is your type of class go for it, although I expect more from an institution like RMU.",0
"5 tests that are all take home. All the answers from the tests he will describe in detail in lecture multiple times so as long as you're in class and taking notes, you should be fine.",1
"I can see why people don't like him but I did and, But a long as you show up he helps, easy on labs and assignment and knows what he talks about also almost always available for online help to a ridiculous degree.",1
"Dr. Liang can be summed up by his own bitter words: ""I realized something depressing; my colleagues get to upgrade the programming languages, and  I have to upgrade to programmers.""  If belittling millennials  were part of the curriculum, perhaps the class would have received higher grades.  This is a man is not fit to be a teacher. Research it is.",0
"This prof is awesome at teaching philosophy. Its not my choice in subject personally, but I retained so much information because of his style of teaching. He is extremely entertaining and uses interesting stories to teach. Dont hesitate to take his class!",1
"He ""teaches"" by reading straight off of the power point but his lessons rely heavily on the assumption that the student not only read the chapters before hand but, also fully comprehended the material on their own. You have to teach yourself the material in order to pass, otherwise you will do poorly and be completely lost in the classroom.",0
useless and never wants to help.,0
The way how he distributes marking is ridiculous. I lost 20% because i did not properly wrap my lines even if the code would work fine. i would have been ok with 5% or 10% at most. Prof sucks,0
"Toom him during corona.... no lectures and posts really bad powerpoint slides which leave out most of the details. Gives impossible quizzes worth 40% of your grade (only 4 of them) and you only have 30 mins to complete it and if you submit 1 second over, you lose 10%.",0
"Would not recommend!! Hard to follow, lectures about the notes he posts online for the entire class, super boring and quick to lose interest.",0
"I love Mr. Ariail!!! I took his capstone class for my Associates Degree. Great way to finish off the semesters at TCC. He offers a great business simulation that is really fun. He, himself, is very fun and comfortable. I took his class Saturday mornings for 3 hours and looked forward to each one!",1
Win is a great dude...funny and a throw back to the 70's.  You have to study for the tests but they aren't that bad.,1
he is awesome,1
She is really disorganized so the syllabus is mostly useless. No one ever knows what the assignments are or their requirements or when they're due. A lot of class time is wasted and she doesn't usually seem prepared or to know what's going on. She also never answers email. However some of the activities are fun and she is a pretty fair grader.,0
Overall not a good class. Basically you have to teach your self as there is no class and everything is online. I would not recommend her online class.,0
McKinney is the best proff i've ever had at Tx state. She taught me so much and the class was so welcome to the sharing of thoughts. The class doesn't have mandatory attendance but you will regret the juicy stuff you miss when you don't come. Everyone no matter the major should take her!,1
"Professor Keeling is just simply not a good Professor.. not really sure how else to put it. His lectures are dry and boring, and he crams about 5-6 chapters of material into one test (not to mention the test questions are 27 questions). If you don't pass the tests, you're not going to pass.",0
The worst professor I've ever had. She is awful and does not take feedback from students at all. Tough grader and is very unclear about all of her instructions. Do not take her,0
"He is definitely weird, funny and very awkward  Quiz are not easy but you get what he's looking for after the first 1 don't have to attend the lectures you can watch the movies on your own can't pass the quizzes if you don't watch the movies Easy grader Quizzes, Midterm, Final, One long final paper comparing two films you saw in Class No text",1
"Great teacher! Went to Harvard, has been on national tv, loves what he does and has high expectations for each student. Definitely useful for learning math and science in a creative way.",1
"Be prepared for a quiz every week on the new chapters of the book. 4 questions sink or swim. Usually he made things clearer, but frequently he didn't seem to have the answers to his own questions. His grading of the quizzes makes no sense. You'll get out early a lot in a 3 hour class. Liked him, but it's a lot of reading and studying terms.",0
This class is easy but is usually at 8 am which makes attendance low which he realizes so he does not take attendance. Going to class helps a lot and makes the tests easier.,1
"Dr. Mike is the best professor I've had so far. I had someone else for BIOL 1105 and struggled. Dr. Mike goes very in depth in comparison to other professors, but you learn a lot more and it helps you to put the whole concept together. I went from barely getting 70s on my exams in 1105 to getting 90s in Dr. Mike's class. Go to his office hours!",1
"Do not take notes when she is speaking or else she will verbally, emotionally and mentally shame you. Agree with her on all issues and even comment that she looks beautiful with glasses on, fall to your knees and worship her and MAYBE you might have a chance of getting a B in her class. The human brain is flawed when it comes to her exams.",1
"Dr. Wingender is very fun! He is like everyone's grandfather. He has the best intentions, and teaches you things for the real world! He does call on you at random, so you must be focused. The tests are like the practice tests and come from information in the lectures, so you have to go to class. You will learn a lot for outside of college!",1
Refused to round my grade up from a 69 to a 70 so I failed the class. The worst kind of professor.,0
"She is not as bad as people make her sound, but she is indeed disorganized and does not test on material she emphasizes in class. You have to know tiny details hidden in the power points to do well on her exams. Make sure to listen to her podcasts and start studying early.",1
"Dr. Stephens is a great professor. An A in her class is definitely rare. As with a number of teachers, you would have to read outside of the text in addition to the text to get those few extra points. That being said, if you have read all the material in class and took good notes you can definitely get a B out of her class.",1
"The entire MATH136 online experience is awful. Maybe it's better in person but online, the professors are rude and unhelpful, TA's rarely respond and the profs do nothing about it. They would rather spend time looking for cheaters on chegg than make proper useful learning tools.",0
"Scanlon is great.  He is really dedicated to the program and his students.  The outcome system is great and is meant for you to learn the material, which is the point isnt it?  Because if this teacher I've switched my major to Chemistry.  He is tough on his students, but only the ones he believes in and only because he wants you to do well.",1
"Awesome guy! This class is so fun, and he gets everyone talking. He makes the material very interesting, and opens up your mind. I don't need anymore electives and I'm considering taking a different course of his that he encourages us to join. Take this Professor!",1
"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE. Unclear, doesn't even know what she is talking about.  Worst prof. ever. If taking Quant (222) take it with Miller.",0
"Dr. Blaustein is quite entertaining despite being the ""2nd worst scientist in the world."" However, he puts forth an average effort as a professor. In turn students put forth an average effort on studying for his exam. As a result they get an average grade and give him an average rating.",0
"One if the best teachers I've ever had! I learned so much! She teaches it in a way that is understandable, she also uses power points and study guides so you know what to focus on.",1
"This class wasn't the worst, the quizzes were hard but the in class assignments were easy. You work with your group on everything which can be annoying. Some assignments were often confusing. Field placement is fun & eye opening. Projects are easy too as long as you follow rubric. I would take her again, she cares about her students.",1
He is very arrogant and condescending. He is not clear in his lectures and often go on tangents... He has low tolerance of other points of view and puts students down...,0
"You have to be ready to participate in Dr. Duque's class. He will call on you at random. He gives everyone the same grades for compositions, but he steadily increases your grade throughout the semester. You have quizzes after every class and a weekly discussion board. Both exams were take-home and you have a 10 minute presentation with a partner.",1
"I would not recommend this teacher to anyone looking to fulfill the credit that this class gives. She takes a long time to respond to emails and requires attendance. She also uses the entire class time  each class session. If you take her, you will never be dismissed early.",0
Extremely well-prepared for class. Organized lectures. High degree of enthusiasm in lecture and lab. Inspires you to be a better student.,1
"Chip is a nice guy, but he is an unfair grader. He expects the students to be at the same level as him when he is grading the exams. He also gives out F- which is not a real grade. The only reason my gpa wasn't wrecked is because he had to give out a crazy curve for the exams.",0
I do not know how old she is but she is HOOOT,1
"God awful teacher, can't be clear or straightforward in her lectures.  Goes off on tangents and ends up having you take notes on things not even part of sociology.  Her attitude is way out of date for today's students and can hardly understand simple questions or explanations.  Acts like it's still the 1970's and belittles her students when she can",0
He has a lot to say but it's usually pretty insightful. He does go off on rants but they're usually cool stories. His tests are pretty straight forward except the first 20 questions are typically true and false. I've had him for 4 classes and found his final projects to be good round-ups of the class. Not hard to get a good grade.,1
Took this class online and the subject matter was extremely hard to comprehend. His layout of the course was simple. HW that took me basically a whole day to complete due every week and quizzes every week also. Gives 5 attempts for the quizzes. Test weren't too long. Didn't have any communication with him so don't know how helpful he is.,1
not nice person during online education!,0
"Mark is SUPER NICE, CLEAR, HELPFUL, always willing to answer q's! Econ was never my thing but his lectures made the material more interesting & easier to understand. Very clear lecture notes (super helpful for exam). No calculations on exams, only based on application of theories. Weekly assignments are kinda difficult and time-consuming, however.",1
Do not take Paszek for PSY364 unless you can stand to sit through super boring lectures. He lectures out of the book and writes maybe 5 words on the board all of class so you have to be listening to what he says. Also the exams are pretty hard and does not even cover what he lectures. Also can be pretty rude.,0
"Professor Jinn's sense of humor takes a bit of getting used to, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. He covers everything in class, so as long as you go and take notes, the book isn't necessary. All his tests are open note, and the final is non-cumulative. He's not the most exciting professor, but as long as you put in some effort it's an easy A.",1
"He is the most rude, inconsiderate, boring professor I have ever experienced. DO NOT TAKE HIM. He will continuously tell you how you should have learned the previous material in ""elementary algebra"" if you don't remember how to do something. And if you answer something wrong, he basically calls you stupid. Avoid him at all costs. I had to drop him.",0
One of the worst at NCC Nursing. Her class averages are consistently the lowest by alot(and she doesn't care). She is constantly unprepared for class. Constantly gives work at the last minute. Gives tons of worthless busy work. Be prepared to teach yourself the material. She uses lab for everything but lab activities. Stay away from her!!!,0
"His lectures can be boring but he likes to spice it up a ****e started a fire in our class) Just a midterm, paper, and a final that you need to do good on. Go to class, take notes, and keep up with the reading and you'll be fine",1
Not a fan of how this professor handled online classes this semester. He was very unclear about what he was looking for and was difficult to communicate with. I expected more from my capstone professor.,0
"Great professor! Kind, caring, understanding. Wants you to succeed.",1
"Obnoxious how excited she is about anthropology. She grades hard, as if everyone in the class is an anthropology major or loves the subject as she does. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HER.",0
Great prof. Sorry to see him go.. I was in his last class when he passed away.. Still think about him to this day.. My condolences.,1
She honestly gives pointless busy work that is unnecessary. Worst part is she doesn't grade a single thing until the semester is over. The class is boring and the curriculum and her words repeat over and over. Defiantly do not recommend.,0
Prof. Nelson is by far the best teacher at SCU. He will challenge everything you say and make you defend it for at least ten minutes. He is incredible and passionate about the subject. If you do the reading and challenge him in class you will get an A.,1
Dr. Nicholson is a very caring and nice professor. You may not always get to her through email but she always responds to texts and calls. There is a lot of hw but she grades fairly. Overall its an easy class if you keep up with the work and get it done.,1
"Professor Bernstock is a wonderful teacher, enthusiastic and knowledgeable. I graduated some years ago, but I still remember and talk to people about what I learned in her art history class. She is truly inspiring, plus she is friendly and down to earth--very willing to meet with students.",1
"LOVE PROFESSOR OAKLEY OMG. Literally the nicest professor at UD, she's just like a mom. She understands most students who take her class are not GEO majors. She has power points which she explains well & also puts online. Her exams are online but the essays are written. There's no homework besides these models u can do for extra credit. TAKE HER!",1
"Does NOT care about the students. When I had a question or was struggling with something she would tell me to go see the tutor. Horrible at explaining things, lectures too fast, barely anytime to learn content before jumping to the next thing, rude, will NOT be taking this class again or any class taught by her for that matter. Awful proffesor",0
"Dr. Murphy is hands down one of my favorite professors. He is incredibly knowledgeable and he gives very interesting lectures. He is a hard grader, however most professors in upper level history classes are. He makes up for his hard grading criteria by being flexible and accessible. You will leave the class having learned a lot!",1
"Dr. Hunt was the lab coordinator and did not personally teach me, but from the various communications I had with him via email, he came across as extremely rude and unhelpful. Seems knowledgeable about the material, but do not expect to get any clarification from him. Talk to your TA, another professor or legit anyone else first.",0
She is a good lecturer and explains the concepts in enough detail for you to understand. Tough if you've never programmed before because the pace is pretty quick.,1
Might be the best professor i have ever had!!!  He has worked out econometrics to a T.  Hes got it all planned out so well that every lecture and assignment he pushes you one step closer.  His exams are long.  Im talking 10-12 pages.  But by the end of it you know your stuff!  I am really looking forward to econ423 with him next semester.  A++ Prof,1
I've done very well in Spanish in the past and I didn't pass this class. Tests were massive and very specific she takes points off like mad. You have daily homework and the quizzes are with a big chunk of the grade. She moved super quickly through the material. Do not recommend,0
"It's a struggle trying to understand this teacher, he is very incoherent, does not answer questions and doesn't seem to know his subject very well.. And of course you will get distracted by the number of times he says ""okay"" he says in each sentence, quite impressive INTERNET AND THE BOOK ARE A MUST TO PASS THIS CLASS",0
Do NOT take this class from Prof Ahmad. He is NOT accessible outside of class. He is NOT clear in lectures (wastes your time). Class does NOT prepare you for homework. Homework does NOT prepare you for quizzes. Quizzes do NOT prepare you for exams. If you are not good at self studying avoid him at any costs.,0
"Dr. Mark is very passionate about her class, so take her seriously. Quiz information is in the textbook but exam questions are a little difficult. She grades pretty hard on the group project so you need to be as thorough as possible. She will call you out in class for participation so be ready for that. Don't use your phone, she takes off points.",1
"Great teacher, great guy...looking forward to having him again next term",1
"EVERYONE SEEMS TO HAVE SOMETHING NEGATIVE TO SAY ABOUT PROF. MINGUS, BUT I THOUGHT HER CLASS WAS REALLY EASY AND THAT EVERYTHING SHE WENT OVER IN HER P.POINTS WAS ON THE EXAMS. SHE DOES LIKE GROUP ESSAYS AND QUESTIONS TO REALLY NICE LADY AND PASSIONATE ABOUT ART. I GOT AN A, AND SO DID MANY OTHERS IN MY CLASS. JUST STUDY AND YOU WILL BE FINE",1
Wonderful Professor. He really cares about his students.,1
"Easy Class, Easy A. Will not learn that much. Grade your own tests. Does review before tests.",1
Lectures were off topic and did not prepare you for upcoming tests. The only reason I ended with an A in his class was because I did all of the extra credit he offered.,0
"this man lectures in class for 50 straight minutes on stuff that does not appear on the tests at all. he takes attendance every single day, cant work technology, and tests come straight from the textbook. he is absolutely the worst professor ive had at west chester. if youre taking him be aware you NEED the textbook.",0
"This teacher is William ""Bill"" Cue. DO NOT take this class unless you want to teach yourself and take impossible to pass tests. He only spent maybe 3 days actually teaching and the rest was read your online book and do the quizes. PASS ON THIS TEACHER!!!",0
"Anyone that has given her a good score is barking mad. I accidentally signed up (2003) as a first semester freshman, something that wasn't  allowed, from what I understood.   Irony of Death and Dying, I had a family member die and the woman lied to me and said I'd get a ""W"". NOPE, she failed me.   Merlyn ruined my whole perspective on college.",0
"Bill is a great professor to have. He interacts with the students in the class. His lectures can be long and confusing, but he offers a lot of extra credit. Make sure to do the work in the class and you will be fine. If you want a A in his class, dont skip class!",1
"I would avoid this prof if I had the opportunity to take this course again. He rushes through many topics and expects students to understand all of them. His tests very hard and assignments are also hard. If you care about your gpa, do not take any course with him",0
"I love Mrs.krafcik best teacher I ever had for a subject so dread full,but she made it interesting and simple to understand ""Commas"" her favorite;in addition, to complete thought.",1
"This professor spews his personal political beliefs and shuts down any students who has a differing opinion. By the end of the term no one would participate in class discussions because he made people feel their opinions were wrong and called them racists, and HIS opinions got more and more strident in favor of nationalism.",0
"Doesn't care about the students, good for business instead of teaching,  doesn't facilitate learning at all, He is not good for teaching this course at all.",0
"She is very knowledgeable but she is VERY disorganized and could improve with her presentation skills. She speaks in a monotone manner and is not very engaging, which is really bad because the classes are for three hours. However, she is a generous marker and goes above and beyond to help you improve and understand the material.",0
Professeur très passioné et très compétent. Sa matière est très organisée et le travail attendu de la part de l'étudiant est lcair et précis depuis le premier jour. Fortement recommandé.,1
He goes to fast and it's hard to follow. He seems more like an honors math teacher than remedial. Only take him if you are good at math.  He gets really intense when he is working on problems on the board. Nice guy ,0
"Pretty lively professor. won't email back about questions on projects until the night before it was due. work load is a lot, and he is very specific for no real reason because the other bus com teachers weren't super specific and they ended up doing better in the consulting cup. Overall good teacher and passionate, but it's his way or the highway..",1
he seemed like a cool professor at first but the exams seemed to be based off the most random facts that were just in his head. the exams varied in difficulty but were generally unpredictable. he played movies most days instead of actually teaching. don't buy the books.,0
"Good professor is your a rocket scientist. Gives more visual perceptions about religious art, but very hard class. Very strict about grades. Opinions are wrong, only his opinions are the ""right"" answers.",0
"Professor Blacker was nice and funny but I can't say much about him because I really did not enjoy EDUC240. The exams were very hard for me because I do not have a perfect memory and you must memorize the details, verdict, and noticeable dissents of numerous court cases for each exam. If you take the class, GO TO THE REVIEW SESSIONS.",1
"Hard to understand what she talked in the lecture, but exams are very easy, basic",0
"Made an accounting class an easy A by telling excessive stories about his various businesses, assigning hardly any homework, and giving tests that were definition based.",0
"I took Spanish for 2 years in high school and passed with A's and B's. So when I had to take a language for my degree requirement, I thought Spanish would be a breeze. Boy was I WRONG! Even with my prior knowledge I was confused and he moves very quickly. SO MANY ONLINE ASSIGNMENTS. He takes points off if you don't show up (even when you are sick)",0
"A 20-point curve is added to each assignment. The highest test average was a 60, and all other tests had an average below 60. He is extremely hateful when a question is asked- regardless of the question. As a student who has succeeded in every aspect of college, this man lowered my self-esteem.",0
"Not the clearest or most interesting lecturer, however made an effort to hold attention and had clear expectations. Either attending or thoroughly reading textbook is sufficient, class is good for additional examples and discussing points of dispute. This is however a course that if logic is not your strong suite, be prepared to study.",1
She is the best spanish teacher ever,1
You should do the labs and projects. It would definitely help to look at tutorials on Youtube. Professor Hsu is nice and willing to help.,1
"Great prof, dry sense of humor is good for the tough course. He's a genius programmer, if you need help, ask him! He will explain it. Some people think he makes students feel dumb for asking questions, but he doesn't, he cares about questions, so he will answer them the best he can.",1
"First class leaves a terrible impression that professor Glass would be terrible on lectures. Talks very slowly and repeats herself in untimely matters. Lectures would be a nightmare, look for someone else now.",0
"do not take this professor if possible. expect having to teach yourself the material on your own time. feedback is unhelpful, marks down correct answers because you didn't do it ""his"" way.  class average on exams are well below 50%, but that's obviously our fault, right?",0
"Great teacher. Going to class is fun because he tells wild stories about climbing and his life in suburbia. Always a small written assignment due for almost every class. Lots of reading, sometimes hard to keep up with the pace. Grades are based on whether your papers improved by the end of the course.",1
"Literally just reads the slides word for word in a monotone voice, only broken by his smokers cough. Don't bother going to class. Hard tests when he doesnt use a test bank. Doesnt always know what hes talking about. I took ITEC 1000 and ITEC 1010 with him. 1010 is the only class Ive ever dropped in uni, and I did it while I was in his lecture.",0
"Not an easy class or Professor. She requires 8 books but you only need 2 of the novels. She talks fast and everything you're tested on is based on notes (I usually got 5-7 pages/class). Because she talks so much and gets off topic, the amount of things you need to study for exams is insane. She'll do everything in her power to not give you an A.",0
"Just passed the FAR section of the CPA exam, one year out of college. Couldn't have done it without the building blocks learned through Dave's 301 stories/lectures. The guy can teach, and he's comfortable in his own skin. If you want to LEARN the subject, take this class. However, if you plan on going to his office hours, bring a hazmat suit...",1
"Dr. Gilmour is an amazing professor. He loves what he teaches and does not make his lectures boring. He is always willing to help! For class, make sure to take good notes during lecture and study the test review! There are 3 mandatory tests, 1 optional test, 1 required essay, and a cumulative final, so keep old tests reviews to help study for it.",1
"This Linear Algebra professor is all over the place.  He can be condescending even though he masks it by always being happy and he makes so many mistakes on the chalkboard, which he laughs about.  I stopped taking notes partway through the course because he would always backtrack and write way too much.  He doesn't even use Sakai, a lot of homework",0
"Conflict in Family Relationships.  I took this class online, and I really liked the format.  The workload was reasonable, and Renate was super supportive and helpful.  I loved the class, the materials and the professor!",1
Cool guy hard to pass  if u dont like jazz get graded on the 5 exams and participation If ur not going to take time to listen to music posted on bb dont even bother to take class  save ur gpa,0
"Don't take this class if you have the choice. You have to go to every class or you won't pass. Incredibly boring, hard clicker questions, randomly calls on you. Best part was that instead of having actual exams, the midterm and final are just essays. READ THE BOOK and review lectures before class. All of his clicker quizzes are based off of them.",0
"at first the class was okay and she was nice. the first part of the quarter consisted of mainly reading the 2nd half of the quarter, the course consisted of more writing and less reading. i got a B+ in the class but i did put in a lot of time and effort in the class. and she was very picky in writing styles she is enthusiastic but the class was ok",1
"She is a very interesting person. She is very passionate about what she teaches. She wrote her own book, which we read in class but it doesn't really apply to sociology. She has a great personality but sometimes she's all over the place which is confusing. Overall its an easy class, 3 exams which are the majority of your grade and she curves them.",1
"Exceptionally easy to understand, and learn from. The class's easiness is due largely in part to Mr. Moinian's clarity and knowledge of his topic. I would recommend this professor to ANYONE in ANY major.",1
"Yates is a really really good professor. The class is deemed ""hard"" because you got people who think social psych is ""hard."" Abnormal was a really fun and interesting class. She is an amazing lecturer and the exams were easy if you put in the time to study.",1
"Lectures are good - not the most entertaining, but I was never very bored. He explains things well and is clear about expectations.",1
*,1
You have to read everything in Mendible's class and also make sure you don't miss class or you'll be lost. Has a tendency to digress often and assigns long homework assignments. Only take if you are willing to work hard and be active in class.,1
This dude rambles and is far left,0
QUIZES every morning for attendance. Doesnt look at online homework and she will tell you to not study certain thing and wont teach it but the online hw requires it,0
"He is THE hardest grader, his exams are borderline torture and no matter how much you study or read the material its never enough. Honestly just looking to pass the class so I can never take it again. He holds office hours but also does't answer questions you have so theres no point in even going. DONT TAKE CLINICAL NUTRITION WITH HIM.",0
"Extremely unprofessional, rude, and frankly, not very bright, and arrogant, yet she does not have anything to back up her arrogance, she is coasting in he job until she can retire. Beware potential MA students, the faculty disrespect Pub Desgn students and only care about the MFA students, go somewhere else.",0
"Prus is my boy. Just do the work and you will be fine. His lectures are future explanation of the text and courseware. Make sure you read the text before attending class, because the lectures are a further explaination of the text. You can get through the course without attending the lectures.",1
Don't take this prof. DON'T DO IT! Even if it's the perfect fit for your schedule. The damage to your GPA is not worth it. Profesor Howard is extremely confusing and a tough grader. Get ready to read five long books and never hear them discussed in class. Get ready to write ridiculous papers on n material never discussed in class either.,0
The professor is racist she defiantly made that class so hard for no reason. I have this class for a better grade because its sad getting less than an A in a class that simple. I retook it with a 20 times much better and easier professor she was loving and caring but not like Susan.,0
"He makes you work for your grade but I quickly found out that talking to him and making yourself stand out by asking questions really helps. He can come off as being cold at first but he is a really nice guy and appreciates hard work, and showing interest in his topics. I would recommend all of his courses if you are a psych major.",1
You wont learn anything and score low on the exams because of it. Hes so rude and not responsive via email fast. The whole transition to online was horrible and he didn't really care of any personal issue due to the pandemic. Do your self a favor and take another professor. No curve btw.,0
"Prof was terribly boring during lecture.  Work given to do was absolutly way too much.  Examples given in class were the easiest ones he could find.  Terrible organized.  Class is required for engineering.  Way to go MSU, not like your hurting for money.",0
"Worst prof here ever. Hes extremely rude and will make you feel stupid during office hours unless you talk back. He non stop talks about boring stuff for an hour and a half and does not answer emails. Weekly quizzes are easy, however I do not recommend him. Class isn't as easy as I thought.",0
mass confusion at its finest hour,0
"Rarely shows up to lectures but will send in student instructors (Seniors in college) to administer exams or ""review"" chapters that he didn't even teach.. One of the worst professors I've had. He doesn't teach the material so be ready to teach yourself everything from youtube. Would not recommend.",0
"He is very hard to follow and claims to be open to new opinions, but he rarely listens to others.",0
"Very easy class. Most of the material is from Mechanics of Solids. Very little new material. Overall, exams are not bad. In class he just does examples from the book, but it's still worth it to go.",1
she is a great teacher!!! i loved her class!,1
Most awful degrading teacher. Fails students at all opportunities. extremely unclear grading criteria. often does not show up to her own lectures. picks on students for incorrect answers. if you don't participate in class discussions she will call you out on it. clicks her teeth constantly.,0
"He is a very nice and understanding guy, and he's incredibly smart -- but I found this to be a weakness because he was not able to bring it down a notch to your level, or at least my level . The readings were okay, not Incredibly difficult but not easy either. He is inspiring, got me to do some readings on Marx which I found enriching. Tough grader",1
Weekly HW assignments take about an hour + each week. 2 timed take home tests and 2 timed on-campus tests. The content from the tests are from the weekly HW assignments.,1
LOVE HER. She clearly explains how to do write the 5 speeches you present in class (one being a group speech). She makes the class super easy and she makes you feel comfortable. I used to hate public speaking but this class made me love it! She really cares about making the class connected so you end up making friends in class!,1
NOTE BOOK PROJECT IS A JOKE. IT ONLY TAKES TIME AWAY FROM DOING IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE STUDIO WORK OR CATCHING UP TO OTHER COURSE WORK. ITS NOT FAIR THAT YOU HAVE ONE OPTION TO TAKE 4 SEMESTER OF AN OPPRESSIVE PROFESSOR. NOT FAIR SPECIALLY WHEN I AM PAYING TUITION TO GET EDUCATION INSTEAD GETTING SASSED AT. MALAKA,0
Great professor.  Very interesting class.,1
"I took two classes from him and both got A grade. On the first class i thought he was kind of boring, but then i realized he has abundant knowledge of his field. Very intelligent professor. Even some students are not showing enough respect to him, but he is still nice enough to take it. He could throw lots of work to you, but i also learned many.",0
"Very good professor. Homework is graded. Although attendance is not mandatory, he does use it on borderline grade cases. Get an old text book for reference and additional problem solving. Take good notes in class, review all his handouts (tests are similar to them) & go to his office hours. He wants you to understand the process not just the answer",1
"A great prof in lecture, but very unhelpful in lab. Test material is straight from lecture. Expects you to already know exactly what to do in lab despite being a STUDENT. He's overall a nice, funny guy but I'm glad I won't have to take another course with him. Like I said, thumbs up for lecture, thumbs down for lab.",1
"I had Darius for a summer studio, and I really learned a lot.  He's very knowledgable, caring and quite easy going.  He's one of those professors that when he walks past you in the halls, he'll stop and say hello (well, at least for me he did...  I must have made some impression!).  If you can, definitely take Darius' classes.",1
"She's a sweet lady, but very quirky. She has a very specific way of grading assignments, and if you don't follow it exactly she'll take off points. It's easy criteria, she's just super picky about it. I didn't feel like I had the freedom to really get better as a public speaker because she forced us to use such a plain mold for speeches.",0
"The material for this class is relatively hard, and his course notes don't make it any easier. Hard to understand in class (accent, yeouch!), but does go through the notes and explains concepts thoroughly on the board. Just don't skip class. Exams aren't exactly easy either.",1
It's tough to rate Manrique. He's a very friendly and helpful person but I found his explanations confused things more than they helped. I loved the material but the questions he asked were loosely related at best. Overall his helpful attitude and friendly nature outweigh the confusion he sometimes causes and as a result I would recommend him.,1
"Literally such a boring class, you only have two grades which is a midterm and final both are essays, which you get points taken off for incorrect spelling and grammar. The class is based only on lectures, and he doesn't put information on slides for you to visually see what's being said. Not allowed to use laptop for notes, can only write by hand.",0
"This is the easiest class in history of classes. He does nothing but ramble. Attended class once, passed with an A. quizzes on blackboard every week from readings, literally word for word.",0
avoid,0
"Professor Martin really cares about his students, encouraging students to participate. This is especially important for an upper level foreign language course. His homework is graded by completion, and the quizzes and two exams are easy as long as you do the work he assigns and attends class. I definitley recommend.",1
Dr. Greenberg is a nice man. He truly cares about his students and is passionate about the course material. Make sure you understand the readings and prepare for the discussions because these are basically reviews for the exams. The lectures can be a bit long but most of the time there is interesting stuff being spoken about. Overall nice professor,1
The best prof. at BU!!  He's passionate about what he teaches and is fair.  I'll take any poli. sci. course as long as he's teaching it!  What a guy!!!,1
"Makes Econ unnecessarily hard. I had an A in AP Microeconomics in high school, this had the same content but the Gateman's exams test how well you understand the question rather than how well you understand the concept itself. I will NEVER take his class again because of the sheer lack of engagement and unenthusiasm. Self-study and you will pass.",0
Nice Prof. - Lectures Are Powerpoint and Out of class work only a reflection due on exam days and a 2 person team project (both easy grades.) Exams are medium difficulty - definitely look over key notes in the book. Overall I think she's great.,1
"The only grade's that you will get for this class are test grades, so make sure you're a good test taker. Also, she often goes off-topic and expects you to remember things that she has said only once.",0
Need to talk loundly,0
His lectures are dull and unimportant. Just study the things he gives you on the paper for the test and you're good to go.,1
"Went completely off the course schedule and scheduled tests and assignments so they were only available on weekends. While her courses were well scripted, she could or would not answer questions. Classes quickly dissolved into tech issues (zoom era, I hope this is over when you're reading this) and into arguments with students.",0
He knows his material and does not mind to extend on subject matter during office hours. He genuinely loves to teach. He does not mind accommodating students in need as long as advanced notice is provided. A little old school when it comes to technology but he gets around that by hosting more discussion-based classes.,1
"I've always been great at English classes, especially when it comes to a class like this where you write easily over 10 papers over the course of the semester. However, Professor Shannon was a pushover who wouldn't discipline anyone who talked over her or refused to pay attention to her lectures. She has such a quiet voice that is easily ignored.",1
He can barely speak english!. You spend most of the class trying to figure out what he is saying by peicing together words. Blames the class for poor performance because he fails to realize he's a HORRIBLE prof.,0
"Do not take Dr. Crockett unless you are white, male, and straight.  He WILL grade you down on written assignments if you have a different opinion.",0
he was not helpful at all. his exams had very little to do with what was in the book and on the lectures. i would NOT take a course taught by him again,0
"She is not a horrible person but I do not recommend her to serious Christians and patriots. After taking her TWICE,it is obvious that her hatred for Christianity and America has become pure indoctrination in her courses. She doesn't make you think b/c she doesn't encourage different point of views. Her view is the only one that is correct.",0
"Julie is very laid back and cares very much about her students. She brought lots of real-world experience to teaching my section of GPS which I appreciated. She's accessible outside of class, and even if it's not office hours she's always welcoming if you just drop by her office for a chat. Super nice person, very understanding and caring!",1
Bad attitude towards students. She thinks of us like we're a bunch of crap. She comes up with the most ridiculous assignments. A total failure.,0
Good professor. Have to put some work in to get a good grade. Didn't go to any classes and studied for the tests and passed. Just go to class and listen to his lectures. He explains everything and always looks to help the students improve their grade. Is very fair and gives extra credit.,1
"I seriously hope I never have to take a class with him again. I recommend someone else!! He is very rude and inconsiderate. I think his jokes are dumb and sometimes inappropriate. He does not have a filter. The class is extremely boring. Also, the online exams every week vary from 300-600 points. So ridiculous. Take someone else!!",0
"She is not in tune to what her students need in terms of learning. She didn't understand that some are less experienced than others when it comes to drawing which made it very difficult for a lot of students who are very self conscious about their drawing abilities. She is however, a genuinely nice person if you ever get a chance to speak to her.",0
"A very good teacher, won't give away answers but points you in the right direction. I had him for programming and I had no problem with the course!",1
"condescending man... if you have another option, don't take real analysis.  chances are you don't though... so good luck.",0
"He was not good at explaining stuff. His lectures were immensely boring compared to the other sections'. His slides were very sloppy as well compared to the other sections'. He somehow seemed to me that he wanted to show off his uniqueness, so he had a completely different course content delivery schedule, which was not very good either.",0
Looks at the board the whole time while giving the lecture and doesn't explain anything well. One of the most monotone people I've met in my entire life too.,0
A hippy stuck in the 60's. A real easy A!,1
"Great professor. Very knowledgeable. He has an MTax, MAcc, MBA. He teaches and works at a local accounting firm. He knows what it is like to be busy and is willing to work with you if you need extra help or start to fall behind. His classes are fun and informative. I hope to take many more classes from him, especially if Dixie gets an MTax program.",1
"I absolutely regretted signing up for his class. My cumulative GPA, as a senior at UT, is 3.88. Needless to say, I am neither unintelligent nor a slacker, but this class was just miserable.",0
"Nice and smart guy, but he doesn't understand how to teach economics to people who are just learning it. Beware tests.",0
Very tough grader. Very rude. A lot of homework. Points are taken off if you misspell one word out of the whole assignment. Horrible experience.,0
"I love how Prof. Scott taught class! Caring, engaging and gives plenty of examples from material. Offers easy extra credit. Pretty simple to get a good grade. Lots of homework but it's very simple! Participation is mandatory and very important to be in class, especially during the covid lockdown. Use the bathroom before class!",1
"A wonderful lecturer, though class was big and impersonal.",1
Not the best. Lectures tend to be very disorganized and speaks at a very fast rate so it's impossible to write complete notes. Great person overall and is very funny but very little feedback is provided.,0
"Even though I have never met her in person, I can tell this professor truly cares about the success of all of her students. She provides tons of materials to help you in the class and in life. This is a super easy A.",1
"A nice enough guy, but definitely take Leitch or Ross instead, if possible. I had to waste a lot of time taking notes on articles I didn't understand and sitting through class was painful at times. The guy can't lead a discussion to save his life. You will watch some good movies, though.",0
"I would skip his class. Honestly one of the most boring professors I've ever had at CSUF. He just goes on and on about the books we read in class. Some of the books were interesting but some I didn't even bother to open. I would recommend to find another English class/professor, if you can.",1
"He can try and be the funniest, most entertaining professor at the University all he wants. Don't let if fool you. He's completely disorganized. He frequently puts things on quizzestests that he said wouldn't be on there. At the end of the day, he's just an unfair, disorganized, and unprofessional comedian masquerading as a college professor. ",0
Only prof that teaches this course at Ryerson.... so um... Goodluck!,0
"LAURIE IS SUCH A SWEET HEART. She is THE BEST. She will do anything and everything to help you succeed in her class. Tons of real world examples for the restaurant industry. She even had a guest speaker, a Kent County Health Inspector come in to aid our lessons about food safety. She is awesome!",1
I took this class for an easy A and I got a C... I studied more for this class than I did Biology and I made a B in that class... NOT A GOOD CLASS TO TAKE! He takes attendance everyday and going to class is pointless because it dosnt help... DONT TAKE!!!,0
"Dr. Teekell is hilarious and cares a lot about her students. She treats us as equals and cares to hear what we have to say. Most of the readings are really fun, even if some of them can be a little long. I would have gotten a much better grade had I turned in my last paper on time, but I definitely hope to take her again for another class!",1
"One of my favorite teachers yet at North! Very knowledgeable and passionate about his field. Engaging lectures and funny jokes throughout. The tests were quite difficult, but he does his best to set you up for success with study guides and clear lectures on what will be covered in the test.",1
Shes a great teacher. She teacher very good and grade pretty fair and gives you a lot of feed back. Very professional as well.,1
"Dr. Hayden-Roy is one of the best professors of History you will ever find. He always makes class interesting and finds a way to connect you to the history you are learning, he's hilarious too. You will have to write a lot in his class, but it will definitely help you in the long run.",1
The best math professor to walk this planet.  He is a really cool guy too.,1
Me. Nelson was really nice and he was very respected by students. He understands you're situation if you're late and his class lectures are interesting. It was a pretty easy class and I would definitely take his class again,1
Overall good teacher,1
"Professor Morgan quickly noticed I wasnt striving to be the best I could be. This man never gave up on me. Encouraged me to work on passions. Remembered things about me, learned how I learn, and utilized this to our advantage. He made me go from failure to an Engineer at multiple Fortune 100 Companies. Cant say enough good! He doesnt give up! <3",1
"Maggie is a nice prof who is relatively lenient with deadlines, and asks for student feedback. Her lectures were a bit long-winded and repetitive at times and although she makes positive comments, sometimes her marking does not reflect that.",1
"Learned a lot in his inorganic course. Very knowledgeable, will meet with you to discuss questions in office. The class is somewhat hard, but definitely manageable if you are really serious about getting your chem degree. Otherwise don't cry.",1
"this guy is so rude and not helpful. his lectures aren't engaging at all and he literally just copies from the textbook which you can read yourself! doesn't explain anything well, is not coherent, and is so rude when you ask questions. don't know why he even bothers teaching",0
shes the nicest professor on campus. she goes out of her way to make sure everyone understands everything clearly and does everything she can to make sure everyone gets an A. she is undeserving of any bad ratings.,1
"Prof Glaser is one of my favorite professors on campus. I took calc 2 as a requirement and I could not believe how easy she made it. She explains everything clearly, makes herself available. and gets to know her students. All around amazing teacher. I wish she taught more of my classes. Highly recommend her classes.",1
"This is the worst Professor I have ever taken a class from. There is a quiz almost every single day and they are waited heavily in the class. The concepts he teaches are fairly easy concepts to understand, but then tests and quizzes are very challenging. The class averages on all the tests were around 15/30. Great guy, terrible professor.",0
"This is one of those classes that's kind of a joke. I think Braker is a nice person, but she's all over the place and often late. The TA, Bryce, did all of the work essentially. I recommend this class to get the math/science requirement out of the way, but it will feel like a waste of time. On the bright side, it's not work heavy.",0
Dr. Kang got 7-10 on his own quiz.,0
I love mrs mingus but.....her teaching style is confusing as heck. She has her bad days its hilarious! !!!!!! FYI: if you want a good grade on group projects make sure you wow her. Thats where your grade will matter. Those tests matter but I think she grades you on how creative you are honestly.,0
"Knowledgeable, ill give him that much.  Presents materials in sometimes (more then some) in a questionable fashion.  test reflects book, not what he says in class.  cite sources and you will 90% of the time pass his papers.  wouldnt reccomend him for a history GER.",0
"Worst grad class I've taken. Some interesting discussions, but her syllabus nor rubrics matched our class. First class I didn't get an A in. No feedback until final grades. I got nothing out of the class.",0
Very tricky questions on the test and they are super confusing. Tests are not supposed to be like that.,0
Professor leska is always there for you. Yes lectures are long but if you take good notes and study you will do good. ALWAYS do the extra credit she gives.,1
"Great professor, very helpful and always available for help.  His mild-mannered attitude really makes you feel comfortable even with difficult material.  He reallyu cares.",1
"Great teacher, hard tests and the 4 exams make up your entire grade. So it is very difficult.",1
Stunning & electrifying lectures.,1
Amira is hands down one of the most caring teachers at the university and I would take her again for Arabic. She is very approachable and is willing to work with you outside of class if you need help. She makes Arabic a fun language to learn and I recommend her to any people I know wanting to learn Arabic. 10/10 would recommend.,1
"MacMillan was an amazing prof, great lecture style that gave you the background and research process behind all the material rather than just throwing information at you. If you listen in class and understand the logic behind the research, then learning the material is easy. Final exam was very straightforward, literally pay attention.",1
"Great professor. Really patient and tries to make class interesting with meaningless bonus points that are awarded for answering random questions, correcting minor mistakes and making comments of your own.  Homework is a little more than average but it will help you understand the material.  Review sheets given before most tests  You try, you pass.",1
"He makes tons of mistakes in his lectures and things can get pretty confusing. His labs are a joke and have very little to do with the actual class material. If you have the choice, don't take his class.",0
"altho lectures can be a bit dry, he makes the course a lot easier to follow as important points and concepts are reiterated over and again.  is very clear about how the grading for his course is structured:  no papers or projects, just make sure to study!",1
"Has a quirky sense of humor, but has pretty high expectations from everyone. The mark is just a couple essay, group projects and participation. He picks on people that don't participate. Make sure you can read at least 200+ pages within half a week as he has pop quizzes. If you're not an English person and only taking it for credits, switch profs",1
Needs to assign less and explain more,0
He wasn't a good lecturer. He loves to nitpick marks on midterms/finals. If you ask for a remark you will never get it. Avoid!,0
"absolutely horrible teacher if you need a good grade.  Is not helpful or understanding.  Endless amounts of homework & the tests are near to impossible.  There is a lot of extra credit built in but rare to achieve a high enough grade for it, even if you have a tutor it's still hard.  The toughest grader i have EVER had.",0
"I thought that this class would be hard, but it is a joke. Gray is a decent teacher, but the material isnt hard. He gives 2 points on your average for not missing more than 1 class, he gives partial credit on some problems on exams, and if you go to class, pay attention, and do the homework, you will get an A.",1
very good professor. knows his stuff,1
"Denise Preston is a really nice and caring person. She kinda goes over the basics in class that I knew in high school and builds upon them. If you thought you were a good writer, think again. Denise Preston will take the time to look at your paper and give good feedback on how to revive it.",1
"the midterms were ridiculously easy but the final exam was hell because all the calc profs write it together.  so I guess it's a win, loss situation taking visentin.  I would still recommend him because calculus felt like a slack class all semester until the final",0
He is truly amazing! You will be doing short quizzes weekly. They are helpful for th e midterm and final. Make sure to study those well and understand the labs as they help with the final exam. he really knows what he's doing and makes the materials fun and understandable. Take him if you can!!,1
An art class but do not expect to get any of your projects even close to done in class. The class is confusing to understand. I did not even understand the main concept of the course until the last week of class and so didn't my classmates. I would never take this class if you are not an art major. Terrible choice for a gen ed art class .,0
First off she's an extremely nice lady and loves being around and helping her students.  Most of the labs weren't too bad except a couple that ran the whole time and a couple with long calculations.  For midterms make sure you go over loncapa questions and go over all of the labs in detail as that's were most of the questions come from.,1
"I love this guy. Ledford's mastery of what he teaches is clear, and his lectures are always interesting. He makes jokes about terrible events in history, which helps lighten the mood when it gets dark. You have to read 5 books though (and actually read them. It's hard work, but it pays off when you see how much you've learned in a semester.",1
AVOID THIS CLASS. Tests are impossible and short answer tests.,0
There is one blackboard post a night and there are no exams. Only one group project and a final project. This class is a joke. You don't need to show up and if you do just sit on your laptop. No note taking needed.,0
"Plain terrible. She's very knowledgeable about the topic but is next to terrible at explaining the material. She talks about her personal life way too much and goes on tangents about her life, rather than the topics we need to learn. Expects way too much out of a level 100 class.",0
"It is my second time as his student. He is an amazing professor, but he is also a tough grader. I had him for residential and I loved, his lecture is fun, easy to memorize. However, for this course I think he is kind of intimidating, and I am shy, so it wasnt a good combination. Even if my grade is not that good, I learned a lot with him",1
"All these reviews are from in person classes so it could be different. Online in COVID-19 which is already such a hard time for students, JP Pretti goes out of his way to make students feel bad and is rude in office hours. Does not know how to speak properly to students and literally made me cry in his office hours. Do not recommend going 2 him.",0
he's best prof out there he is so helpful,1
"Great teacher, I went to the actual lecture one time and passed with an A. As long as you attend the lab you are sure to pass. I used the app Socratic to pass each test. All the tests are online and he lets you take a week to do them.",1
"Prof. Sinha is an ""alright"" lecturer. The lectures were confusing at times, but she made it clear what you needed to know from them in her study guide. Her test questions were very specific, so make sure you memorize everything, even if you think you won't need to; she put some small details on the test. Make sure to study all diagrams as well.",1
"I definitely learned a lot from that class. He is a great prof, not always clear however. Expect a good amount of homework (especially for Spring Break) and be ready to pay attention and to attend every class or you will fail. For sure. ",1
"Eric Landrum is an academic advisor. I do not know what I did to upset him. He was hostile towards me from the moment I started our zoom meeting. He accused me of lying. I was not lying but was left totally speechless. Do I argue? I just stared at him in disbelief. If I had interacted with him before starting at BSU, I would've gone elsewher",0
Oh lord... She is very monotone and rambles on about random stories that do not really matter.... She does allow an index card but I still only managed to receive a B... She will only read the powerpoints which I could do myself but she counts attendance so you basically have to go.,0
"This prof is probably the most unreasonable prof i've ever had. he has open book exams, but you have a lockdown browser on. I take notes on an ipad and he doesn't allow devices during the exam so you just have to print out all the notes you've made. I dunno why this guy is still teaching with this boomer style but if you care about you marks, leave",0
"Tom is an awesome professor! I took his class online and there is a bit more work than one would expect from an online class (seeing live shows and completing 20 service hours) but they are very much worth it. His class is very well laid out and easy to follow in BB. Do the work, stay on top of it, and the class will be a breeze.",1
"This is a passionate teacher, but it's hard dealing with an online class where the professor expects a lot from you.  She responds to questions quickly, but can be confusing about her answers.  She can take time returning papers and her comments on rough drafts are too vague, but  providing good comments on papers online can be difficult. ",0
The man is a legend.,1
"If you want an easy A, take this class. There are 3 tests and the final all of which are online. He takes attendance randomly 5 times during the semester. Get ready to be bored as he reads verbatim to the slides that he does post online. You definitely do not need the textbook, so don't waste your money. Easy A, decent professor, no homework.",1
"Make sure you sit in front and you talk, you will be given an A.",0
"Mr. Wisla is a very educated man and knows what he is talking about but he should stick to working and not teaching students. His classes are dreadful and awkward, he does not teach enough in the time span of the class, he just says one thing and calls on half of the class to provide their opinion. It is not a class anyone looks forward to.",0
Usually lets you get out of class early almost everyday. She doesn't like to help the stunedts. she is always busy and ignore to the students. i don't recomend this teacher if you really want to learn. she has faviorites who get A's,0
"The best teacher for this subject. TAKE HER! This class is easy if you show up, take notes and do the work on time.",1
"He's not a difficult prof. but he sucks at teaching and likes to hear himself talk. He'll go off on tangents that have no real importance to the subjects and its unfortunate he's the only surveying lecture prof. I don't know what he's like in labs, but be prepared to deal with a lot of nonsense in his lectures",0
"Dr. Liu is an AMAZING professor. If you're taking COMM3353 with her, you won't regret it. Each assignment has step-by-step video instructions. She gives you feedback and if you correct, you get FULL credit. Assignments are lengthy in time so you do need to set aside time for them. Overall, love this class and appreciate Dr. Liu a lot.",1
Very funny guy and interesting class. Exam material is straight from lecture so this isn't a class you can skip (much!).,1
"Susan Groh is as good as you can hope for from an introductory chemistry course. She gives such a good overview of the material that you'll need for the next years, and it's a joy if you enjoy chemistry. Terribly hard, but you can work for it and pass.",1
"This the worst professor I have had, if you can avoid taking him please do it. His lectures are incoherent half of the time as he will talk about half of the class failing for 30 mins at a time while spouting meaningless metaphors. He will not show how to implement the material, but will require you do it his specific way, but give wrong info.",0
"Easiest English class I have taken in my life. The class is basically this: you have a few assignments, 4 essays (matter a lot), you read 3 books. Lectures are actually pretty enjoyable. She offers a lot of extra credit. The essays are basically graded on grammar, and as long as you pass them, you should pass easily.",1
"Does not give back lab reports.  It is almost the end of the semester and he has handed back 3 lab reports.  We have done 9.  Other than that, he is pretty clear.  Study for the tests!",1
"He purposely leaves out content in the slides so that you have to go to class. No participation grades. Interesting subject, uninteresting professor.",0
"The assignments were quizzes/exams (mult. choice) & short written assignments. The quizzes/exams came from an online textbook from connectforeducation. Though it was a late-start class, the workload was very manageable. Nothing's proctored, so take notes before quizzes/exams. Not much interacting w/ classmates/professor, so self-motivation is key.",1
"Dr. Childs was great!  She knows her stuff.  I would read the text and be confused and then go to class and she would make everything clear.  While I didn't like the Aplia homework, her tests were way better!",1
Makes mistakes on a regular basis.  Doesn't prepare well for lessons.  Starts class extremely late.  Avoid as much as possible.,0
"I don't know what class most of these people went to, but the class I was in was horrible. I completely agree with person before me. He was so boreing (monotone voice), made fun of people who gave wrong answers, his tests sucked. And it wasn't just me everyone in the class hated him.",0
Great Business law class. Highly recommend this professor,1
Dr. Sutton is extremely unapproachable. During class she would tell people not to ask questions in the chat and you couldn't ask out loud either. Very boring to listen to and got mad often. The class isn't hard but would recommend taking a different prof if you can,0
"Abeh was pretty easy, if he knew your name you you were golden!  Take good notes for test prep.  If you take him for Aviat. Leg. he will tell you all sorts of irrelevant crazy info, like how to get out of a speeding ticket!",0
"Very good person but very hard to understand. He is all over the place, coming in and out of the textbook, sometimes using it but then crafting his own thought as well. Never gave any homework only quizzes. No tests or final.",0
"you cover 3 easy chapters in the first 8 weeks of class and then 5 hard chapters in the second 8 weeks of the class. Honestly this guy is a joke, when asked why something is the way it is he just says it is the way it is. 5% of your grade is automatically gone when you start the class because your ""participation"" grade which will be 0% at the end.",0
Awful professor doesn't teach what he puts on the tests. Spends most of the course mumbling about details on the powerpoints instead of showing us how to solve the problems. Don't take him!!,0
"Mr. Holt is a very knowledgeable instructor. He definitely know his stuff and will help you if you ask for it. However, his lectures are virtually useless. He is easily distracted by questions and goes off on long tangents. It's really hard not to like the guy as a person, but i would avoid him as an instructor. READ THE TEXT.",0
"He was relatively clear about what he wanted, but seems to expect far more information in the discussion than is humanly possible to fit. He seems like a very pleasant man, it is really unfortunate that his grading is so harsh, this lab component will likely SEVERELY drop your grade.",0
"Mr. Davis is a really fair and enjoyable teacher. He is thankfully not the typical ""watch a slide-show full of notes and copy it down"" teacher. He gives real life examples and has a good personality about it. His tests are fair and if you spend a couple good nights studying you will be fine. Also he is a very easy grader. Enjoyed this class",1
"Terrible professor.  Lazy, doesn't care about her class at all, lucky if she shows.  Doesn't know subject matter or business well.  Professors like this make UT look bad.  Up side, it's easy to get a good grade.",0
"Teacher was kinda annoying. Lectures felt really rehearsed (and not in a good way) and he seemed really into himself. Took this class in high school but didn't take the AP exam so I already knew most of this so if you're not an absolute beginner, don't take this class. There are extra credit opportunities (3) and tests were easy (3). No final.",1
"I took this class as a GenEd and wish now that I didn't. Debrot is a nice guy and you can tell he's very passionate about philosophy. However, he's an extremely tough grader, goes on screaming rants that make no sense, and has 0 office hours. There are no assignments only 3 tests that he grades extremely tough. Take someone else.",0
"1. Be ready to teach yourself. He doesn't explain & always runs out of time/skips past major topics. 2. I don't think he even knows how to grade. Two people with the same answer, one would get it wrong, one would be right??? This was common. 3. I think I'll have a crick in my neck for a year after looking straight up at his lectures all semester. ",0
"The most unhelpful professor for the hardest class. Ive asked her a total of three questions before or after class and twice I was insulted and given no answer and once she just replied, do you own the book?. Organic Chemistry is hard as it is and she seems to try her best to make it harder. Be prepared to learn everything on your own/youtube.",0
"Dont belive the ones at the bottom. I took this course thinking he was concise and open to talk. Nope! He just asks if this makes sense an bolsters on. Doesnt care if 10 ppl are late, qont accept H.w. even if its same day. Shoulda dropped when I had the chance but now I'm stuck. Thank Goodness for the online tutoring course otherwise I'd be done 4",0
How long before MC does something about poor teaching?  They are losing a great professor and keeping ones like this in the department.,0
Dr. Brown is my favorite professor. Tests are hard but he is a great guy and very approachable.,1
"I agree with all the postings here.  On a related front, my room mate is a history major and the majors are NOT permitted to take her (I guess this is something of an unwritten rule).  Translation: she is not solid enough for majors, so the general population has to tolerate her.  Do NOT take her if you care about your education.",0
"fantastic professor! i would recommend him to anyone. very clear and knowledable. teaches his american politics class without bias, which is very difficult to do. little use of textbook; as long as you know the powerpoints and do the online readings you'll do fine. attendence taken in discussion frequently but attendence at lecture is taken rarely",1
"Not only does he teach bad coding practice and style, Price will verbally berate those who speak up in class. I've had several classmates answer a question correctly and get insulted by Price only for Price to phrase the students answer slightly differently and claim it was some sort of revelation. Avoid if you can.",0
"Drain is the best teacher I ever had. The other comments don't do justice. He explains everything in detail, and constantly helps when there is a need. This other person doesn't know what their talking about.",1
"Very soft spoken and sweet man. Difficult grader, but fair. He is extremely understanding if you are sick and have to miss a class and will work with you. Sweet man, I don't recommend taking this class if you aren't extremely interested in English",1
"She is a nice person but I found her ineffective as a prof. Very confusing, as she seems to go in circles with her explanations and will never give you a straight forward answer. I highly recommend the textbook as that is the only way I learnt anything, I taught myself the entire lecture. She was defensive when I voiced my confusion. Unapproachable",0
"amazing woman, wish she was my grandma.",1
"Very nice woman, very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about what she teaches.",1
"An alright professor, sarcastic, and funny at times.  A good professor all around.",1
"He definitely makes you work hard for your grade, but he is incredibly understanding. If you use his office hours and show him that you are trying, you will pass the class just fine. Get to know him, he is very resourceful!!",1
"I got a C+ (3.6 gpa student) in her class, but barely, and from the help of others not her. She is literally the most unhelpful teacher I have ever had. The TA may have been worse, not sure though. No feedback is given, so you have to wait until after the final is taken to understand if you've been doing things correctly. FIU needs to look into her",0
"If you watch the videos on blackboard and read the chapters, it's not hard at all. Tests are pretty straight forward. Just make sure you understand the exercises she does in class and you'll be fine. I think she is very knowledgeable about the subject.",1
"if you take him for online, you want to switch to a different professor. just posts slides/recordings of him talking and expects you to remember everything , and on the test will ask weirdly specific questions to see if you were paying attention to his rants (ex, there was a question asking if you remembered the names of the people used in a slide",0
"All of the lectures are in person, he does not upload any of them to the online page. There's only homework and exams. The homework has nothing to do with the exams. You can get 100% on the hw and still not pass the exams. Would not recommend to anyone really trying to learn advertising",0
"He is a good guy but not a very good teacher, he makes up his lectures on the spot and his exams are really difficult.",1
Doesn't get students involved. The already super abstract material is made a lot harder to understand by her messy/unclear lectures.,0
"Professor Ladon has a lot of knowledge about what she teaches but she teaches the 121 class as if it is a 131 or higher level course. She is belittling when students ask questions and expects students to do numerous hours of studying, whether it be from the textbook or practice problems. She drops the lowest quiz and homework grade.",0
great stuff,1
Dr. Hubbard is a very dedicated professor.  She is available and accessible to her students.  Her classes require work (lots of reading and make sure you take good notes).  My only complaint is the grading criteria for her exams.  She gives a point values to certain parts of the question(s) that seems a bit arbitrary.,1
"I thought she was fair and you got the grade with what you put into it. The project is important. Easy to understand course. You do have to understand the syllabus though well and don't turn in the assignments late. There is a lot of reading, she does have videos posted for the first five chapters of the course.",1
"Dr. Davis is a hard professor, but he is hilarious, unpretentious, and approachable. Get to know him, and show interest in the content being taught. Participate in class.",1
"I took Formicola with every intent on doing well. I came to class, did the readings, completed my 15pg paper on time, had a great presentation and met with her outside of class to understand the material....F..this was CORE....she shows no compassion and no understand. Do not take unless you are a political science major or you have a death wish.",0
"If you have a family emergency and don't notify her ahead of time, (you know, because those things are under ""your control""), she'll lower your grade 22%. She changes the syllabus a lot, gives a lot of articles to read, briefly discusses articles, puts mostly videos in class, and her class meetings are unpredictable for a hybrid class.",0
"Unorganized, unprofessional, hypocritical, and unclear begin to describe Dr. Morrison.  He changes assignment instructions last minute, they are not clear to being with, and his clarifications do not help. He will meet with you, but is not helpful.  Huge group project (like 8-14 people on a team.) Lots of busy work. Some people like him, I do not.",0
"You have got to be kidding me! Ridiculously boring lectures, all class, every class (this is a liberal arts college!), difficult to understand, and a horrible grader. Expects very much from students taking a 100 level course.",0
Unfortunately he is not at all a good professor. he has numerous war stories that dont pertain. Also he will send you emails but will never respond to your emails. Also do the papers that are assigned in the Syllabus. He will not mention a word about them until the last second & not give you the criteria for them until the day theyâ??re due.,0
Literally the nicest and more understanding professor ever. Will extend due dates if you aren't understanding the material and has so many opportunities to meet with her outside of class. 11/10 would recommend this professor for PSY400 and any other class she teaches,1
"His lectures are very dull and he seems so uninterested. No clarity on exams, and no study guides. 1 Page cheat sheet and allows ppts to be used during exams. His lectures do not seem to be similar to the exams or even the hw. Super dry professor. Takes a long time to give grades. 2 midterm, final, project, and hw/ quiz points on cengage",0
"Holly is fabulous! Four exam including final (which isn't cumulative) and gives study guides. Really nice to be around, you can tell she really loves the field she's in. Don't bother with the book, just go to class. My class made a Facebook group and that was really helpful. I wish I could have Holly for all of my Special Education classes!!!",1
"Avoid this professor at all costs. Deb is terrible with making sure her students are successful, which is ironic for being a professor for a Writing for Academic Success class. She will not help you with your work but will belittle your writing as much as possible. If you like getting all your negatives with no feedback, you should take Debs class",0
Mr. Vega is an excellent teacher and advisor.  He cares about people.  He's honest maybe that's why some people gave him a low rating.,1
"She's a good prof, posts the powerpoints, clear criteria for papers and tests, is accessible after class, is always ready to help her students, really nice to listen to, makes the class do discussions to solidify the information.",1
"If you have little to no other classes or work then it maybe it is easy to keep up with Dr wilsons classes,as I'm taking 2 of them concurrently but there is an unreasonable amount of work and information to absorb that makes passing his classes almost unrealistic,he is very knowledgable,but the way he teaches concepts seems unneseccarily difficult.",0
I have a strong suspicion that this dude is Chinese Yoda but the force is not strong in this one.,0
The man is very high on himself. Very pretentious and thinks he's funny when he's not.,0
Elle a complètement détruit tout désir que j'avais d'étudier la politique.,0
"Nice lady, not very good at instructing. Sat through her class just staring at the clock a couple times. I highly suggest literally near yelling out in class that you do not understand what is going on and then telling her you actually need examples. Because generally she speaks about concepts and skips examples, making exams extremely difficult.",0
"Horrible prof Expects students to already know what he is teaching. lecture just gets you more confused than you were before class. if you ask a question he rambles on about how easy it should be and never stops to show you how to do anything. labs are a hard and involve way more office work than actual electronics work. Ferris, GET RID OF THIS GUY",0
"I love this professor. His teaching style is amazing and he is so kind. I wish all professors were like him. Easy A, if you do all necessary work even if it is ""voluntary"". He is not out to make you fail, and definitely wants to give all A's if possible.",1
She is a very nice and understanding professor but her class was so boring. It was so hard to get through but she uses tophat and asks questions for participation so you have to go to class. We had no exams just a lot of quizzes that were difficult. I am not interested in the topic but her lectures just dragged on and you also have to take a lab.,0
"He speaks above the class and will make it impossible to understand the subject unless you have prior knowledge. He makes mistakes, and won't fix them while doing example problems, often saying ""Oh, that's wrong. Well, you know what I mean."" When you ask him for help he is very cocky and rude.",0
One of my favorite teachers so far.  Always available to help and I can't believe that he actually tries to learn everyone's name.  Really friendly guy - great teacher!,1
Explains everything in the most complicated way possible.,0
"If confusion and depression could be rolled up into a person, it would be Greg Kitzmiller. His questions are ridiculous and he blatantly acknowledges he's out to befuddle you with the way he words and structures questions. Only reason i passed this class was because I cut all ties from the outside world. One of my least favorite teachers so far.",0
She is an amazing professor! She makes class fun and is easy going. As long as you do the work you will get an easy A. I totally recommend taking her.,1
She gives ok lectures however  she  is very picky.  Expect  to read a lot!  Also explains hw last min.  No wiggle room with her.,1
"Dr. Haque is one of the best teachers around. neiu is lucky to have him. He teaches on a higher level than most teachers. his exams are hard but good if you want to learn programming. fair grader, i got B, and i would take him again and agian",1
I took Queen for the Writing 39C & English 11 combo. He is hands down the most caring and understanding professor I have ever taken a course under. He really goes out his way to meet up with every student severals time throughout the quarter to get to know them and address any concerns. 10/10 would recommend. Easy A as long as you do all the work.,1
"Balistreri is caring, and tries very hard to be a successful instructor, but unfortunately is not. Balistreri simply does not teach; she makes a powerpoint by copying and pasting from other sources, her powerpoints often contradict the textbooks, and reads us the powerpoints in a room for 3 hours. No interactivity. Lots of talk about nothing.",0
"Your grade strictly depends on how you do on the exam. He provides no notes, no powerpoints. Only provides a five page outline and does not explain the concepts. The exams were very hard even if you some how got all the information down for the concepts. Do not take this gen ed from this professor.",0
"Stubborn and initially wanted to make online exam only 1 hour long instead of the regular 2 hours. Makes jokes during class but his boring, mind-numbing readings and his socio-cultural section of the course was the worst out of the 3 sections in my opinion. Even learning about corn was more interesting. Respectively, his rants made no sense",0
"She is very humble, smart, accommodating, and willing to help her students academically succeed - but you have to earn it.",0
Very amusing.  (Also a dork.)  More than happy to engage in discussion and answer questions in class.  Not sure where he pulled the questions on our test though.  A lot of obscure things.  Gave a nice curve though. :-)  Look forward to taking another of his classes.,1
I dreaded this class every day I had to go. I hated Mondays and Wednesdays because I knew I would have to sit in this class. DONT TAKE HER. im warning you. skip one class you will fail. She talks about stupid things just so time will pass and it will make you want to rip your hair out. Assignments are a waste of time and useless and so much work.,0
His lectures are so boring and he reciets the text book and thinks everyone is as interested as he is when most people aren't. He takes off tons of points for little things on tests so grades are bad. He has math lab once a week that is hard and usless. He's a nice person but avoid the class.,0
Hawks is the platform used to teach math from module 1 till 11. This class is COMPLETELY self taught. The test grades very precise so if you dont answer the question in the format they want you 2 you will get the entire question wrong. Prof Hunter was great. He is willing to help if you need that extra push. But you have to put in your OWN WORK.,1
Difficult to understand. Cumulative essay exam,0
Really great prof. Very helpful outside of class and willing to reconsider essays.,1
"I think you can really benefit from going to her lectures if you read the notes before going into them. But going into a lecture without reading anything is suicidal. She's willing to put in hours into explaining a concept to you after class. I think she might be underrated, but hey, that's just my opinion.",1
"Taught us both Thermodynamics and Heat and Mass Transfer and was by far one of the best profs we've had.  It always amazed me that he didn't use any notes in class.  No textbook wasn't a big deal because his notes and examples were so well done.  The finals were a bit rough because it was multiple choice, just make sure you know your stuff!",1
"Prof. Feng definitely knows what he's talking about. Some of the films are boring, but the discussions after help clarify. Attendance is mandatory and you have some quizzes on book readings, so it's important to finish those on time. The 3 papers aren't too bad, and he'll help you if you have any trouble. Overall the class was fun and interesting!",1
This teacher is a very challenging teacher. Although he starts speaking Italian on the first day. This is very hard to follow if you have no prior knowledge of Italian. I would try to steer in a different direction from this teacher.,0
"Her syllabus was great. It's meant to answer all your questions, so you don't bother her. I texted her 1x, and it's all it took to never email her again. I was in for the ride. Her test had nothing to do with her guides to study. Though I would read the entire chapters, I still failed every single test. She's tricky and her test weight is 60%!!",0
"I've taken multiple classes with this prof, he's awesome. Very helpful and knows tons of info. Always willing to talk to his students. You gotta read the text and keep up with work, but that's college. If you want a slacker professor, look elsewhere. If you want to learn, this is your man.",1
"Dr. Elaydi is a really smart guy, but he is not an effective teacher. If you have not taken calculus in high school, DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS. He assumes that you know a lot of things that are not taught in precalculus for the most part. He is also judgmental when you ask him questions. Sometimes he even ridicules you if you don't understand somethin",0
"An incredibly caring and effective BC professor when it comes to preparing slide decks and speeches for the consulting cup. Seems weirdly unorganized at times, but will typically respond quickly and make time for you. Grades exactly as the rubric implies, so stick to it.",1
SHE IS TERRRRIBLE!!!!!I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND TAKING HER FOR ENGLISH..EVER!,0
"What a joke. It's time to update your stale, century old, homework and exam questions.",0
he is very hard; i would not recommand him at all !,0
Professor Schwab is such a boring professor. He is super straight-face. He makes me want to fall asleep every class. There are clicker questions to grade your participation in the class. He's not very good with examples.,0
"A really passionate and animated professor.  However, if you answer a question incorrectly in class he'll ask you to elaborate and then tell you five minutes later you were wrong.  We had reaction papers every two weeks, a midterm, and a final.  Lots of discussions so be sure to read the book!",1
"Shoutout to mah boy Baruch! He is seriously the best professor at Pace. Clear in his lectures, cares about the students and you just cannot hate him. Absolutely take him if you can!",1
"This class is an absolute mess. I missed almost half of the listening assignments because he was not clear how to access them. A nice enough guy, but also very unreliable for extra help outside of class, due to his position in the philharmonic. This is the first ever music class where I will likely not do well, and I've been taking music for years.",0
He is a very good teacher. His lectures are clearly to understand.,1
"Dr. Kelley is one of the great professors in PCC. If you need to take nutrition for your major or just for Gen. Ed., take her class. She is nice. If you have questions she will answer right away. She also is very considerate. She gives a lot of chances to do the work better. Also, she gives a lot of extra credits.",1
"On exams, he expects you to know specific things that he has said maybe even in passing, and will test you on it. Many of the test answers are trick questions (he loves those) and potentially even something he hasn't covered in class. Slides are useless and so is the textbook. Would not recommend.",0
"WORST class I have ever taken. The discussion class is misnamed, the tests are impossible to study completely for and the paper outlines are apparently written with the expressed purpose of tricking students. Needs to learn to control the volume of her voice- BADLY.",0
"I took Borst for the Study abroad trip to Ireland. The trip was a great experience, skip class you wont pass, would take her again in the future",1
"3 individual papers, 3 group papers/presentations, 2 memorization tests, group and individual online business simulation.  Professor creates an uncomfortable learning environment.  Half of the class didn't say a word the whole course.",0
"If you are looking to get out of your comfort zone and work for your grades, take her class. She sets high standards for her students and will call names out if nobody is participating. Follow her guidelines I would suggest going above and beyond to meet with her. She is never on time with anything, but her classes are genuinely interesting.",0
"To me, he seemed overly confident in the material and didn't always allow for good discussion in class. However, the reading was helpful. If you read and do the extra credit work, you'll be fine. He's not a hard grader.",1
"Quam is a awesome professor, offers so much extra credit to help being you grades up. If you show up to class you will pass. Although to get a A or B you have to do the work. There are two presentations and homework but he gives you the online textbook for free and all the homework questions are on there.",1
"Definitely not an easy prof. He is so smart on the subject and you really will learn a lot from him. He is entertaining and class was a blast. Still, he wants a lot of memorization and there are 8 papers throughout the semester, plus a midterm and the final. He grades on improvement, whatever that means. He goes through the material pretty quick.",1
"I cant follow his lectures at all, he strays away from the material and relies heavily on your background knowledge of the course material. From the first day, he focused heavily on assuring my class that we know nothing compared to him. This class overall sucks!",0
"Very easy to follow, perfect amount of work for a winter semester.",1
"He is probably the only professor that was able to teach. He teaches everything that you need to know for the exams. If you do not get the grade you want, that is on you cause he gives all the study material needed for his exams. Also, participate and make an impression, it really helps.",1
"Grade is composed of 1 midterm (35%), 1 quiz (10%), and final (55%). Professor is hard to reach via email and the posted optional hw is ridden with mistakes, making learning the concepts difficult. Midterm had a 57% average, but he decided to take it easier on us for the quiz and the midterm. GO TO OFFICE HOURS if you want to do well.",0
Keval is a decent/mediocre professor. It should have been a fairly easy course but somehow she made it very difficult when it came to grading.,1
Miracle was a terrible lecturer. He would basically write up examples straight from the textbook and would switch the type of problem he was showing without warning or purpose. He also didn't take a single question in lecture all semester. Discussion and great TAs are what got me through this class. Tests are very reflective of hw and worksheets.,0
"You must go to class to pass this course. Greg does not upload any of his ""slides"" because he just writes on the whiteboard in class. Tests should be easy, but he puts trick questions on them. He is a knowledgeable guy, but he did not know how to teach the material well at all.",0
"The critical thinking in psychology class is self explanatory.  While it is easy to pass without reading the book, you miss out on an amazing piece of work.  The class attempts to assist in critical analysis of claims, and the books have and interesting way of conveying that.  Pretty funny and a great professor",1
"She is a bit of a hard person, very strong opinions and shares them freely. Her classes are very easy, attendance is mandatory and assignments are simple (but assigned very regularly). Overall an average teacher.",1
Professor Ruskai is a great Professor. Her grading system is clear and easy for students to understand where they stand in her class. She explains the course work very well. She treats her students with respect. I loved the course because I had a great professor who knows how to teach students.,1
"Boring, boring, boring!!  Him, the class, it's all boring.  His voice is also hard to comprehend",0
"Super condescending guy. We missed 5 weeks of his class because he went on vacation for 2 weeks in the middle of the semester, and then he cancelled 3 other classes. But he'll still expect you to know the material inside and out, with no leniency. His general mentality is 'you need to know the material, whether I teach it to you or not.'",0
"I ended up dropping this course. I would do every homework assignment, quiz/test & try extremely hard on them and still couldn't get up to a passing grade. I would spend hours working on labs/homeworks & still couldn't get above a 40 in the class, instead of offering help, she suggested I drop the course because I was not going to be able to pass.",0
"Professor Hasegawa was my first professor in College. She is such a caring teacher. History is my least favorite subject however, she makes it really interesting and engaging. There's a lot of reading and papers but it is doable as long as you keep up with the assignments. She is caring and definitely a real gem.",1
"He is hands down one of the worst teachers I've ever had. He's a good person but he's a terrible terrible teacher. Bad lectures, too much homework and overly difficult tests. When the average for a Calc 1 class is 40 - 50% and you have to curve, then you're definitely doing something wrong. Avoid unless you're naturally good at math.",0
I took Professor Allen for a summer class for credit and I failed literally everything and still ended up with a C. I think he realized everything he gave was impossible and bailed us out but still DO NOT TAKE HIM.,0
"Honestly the worst teacher I've ever had. Completely unclear on when things are due, or what. Instructions on canvas rarely make sense. Grades a basics class like we should all have a master's degree and 15 years experience in drafting. And just awkward and not enjoyable teacher. Would highly recommend not taking a class from him.",0
This professor made me want to give University another try! I was on the fence about the sham that is education when I first took her class and she restored my faith in teachers.I thank Goddess that she was my prof when I reentered the post secondary school system!,1
"Ms. Hickman is an amazing teacher. She is no nonsense, but will help you out no matter what. I have learned so much from this class. Take her if you can!!!",1
"I look for three of my class. Programming II, Operating System and Assembly Language. I wish I could have taken more classes with him. He is the only good professor in NEIU. Its not easy to get A in his courses. But, if you want to learn a subject. He is the professor you should be taking courses with. PEACE!!",1
"The course is originally a full year course, but the course is now only one semester long. Instead of cutting the content in half, he teaches 3/4 of the original content. This is why it is so much info. First time I took the course, 40% of students dropped it (we were 400). I had to retake it during COVID and did well cause the final was at home.",0
"Very unavailable outside classroom. Does not seem to have any enthusiasm for the material, too many years of teaching same into courses? Not sure. Just be prepared, not very helpful.",0
"He knows his stuff; but expects you to know just as well, which is down to the last detail. His tests are extremely hard and there is alot of homework (which is randomly and rarely graded.)",1
"the easiest prof for the easiest class. He does abide the attendance policy so dont skip more than a few times or youll fail. Other than that, his lecture is cool so you do do other hw in the back of the room. He gives all answers to the midterm and final so easy 100s. only 2 concert reports which are easy 100 also",0
Horrible Horrible teacher! Puts things in test that are never covered in class or even mentioned! Take at own risk!! I don't know how this teacher got 1 good review.,0
"Don't take him. Not a good teacher at all. Unclear, unorganized, can't hear half of what he says. Then he seems to think it's the entire class thats the problem instead of him.",0
"Reader is awesome! Theater History can be kind of hard but he explains everything and he makes sure to review, you do presentations which are on topics you choose and there are three tests including the final, I enjoyed his class!",1
"Why as a Psych major I needed to take this class, I will never know. But her lectures are the most confusing thing ever, and she always makes mistakes, leaving your notes in a hot mess. She expects you to get the answer her way, and her way only. Even if you get the same answer, if you use a different method, she'll fail you. Would not recommend!!!",0
"I'm 53 and will never forget Dr. Arlin.  She was the most difficult, frightening aspect of my freshman year in 1974  Yet I came away inspired and adoring her for her teaching excellence and incredible personality.  I learned more than there is room for here and will always be grateful for my experiences with her.",1
Seems like he has no interest in teaching. One of the worst profs.,0
Not even enough time to finish the final... First year course as well,0
"This professor did not care for his students. Considering it was a DE course, he took longer than usual to answer emails. He marks pretty toughly and when students asked him to re-weigh assessments due to COVID impacting us, he said he won't which seems lazy.",0
"grading makes no sense, has favorites, tardy policy",0
"Excellent professor. Knows his stuff, generally personable, and a fair instructor/grader. A bit dry and sometimes monotonous to sit through, but he is all round a good professor.",1
Give too much work and expects it to be done in a day or two.,0
She does absolutely nothing for her class or her students and shes supposed to teach how to tend to exceptional learners but doesnt practice it herself . Oxymoron of a professor if you ask me,0
"He's ok. Lectures are as fun as waiting at the Secretary of State, but they're always clear. No mandatory homework, but I recommend you do the assignments; they will help you understand the material. Keep your phone on silent, because if he hears it make a sound, he will put you to shame. No surprises on exams and has a review the lecture before.",1
"Probably the worst professor I've ever had the pleasure of having for a lab. This is the type of teacher that will make people HATE the subject if they never took it. Labs are incredibly frustrating, with excessive amount of work both on and off lab times, and the plethora of typos in the worksheets doesn't help either. Do yourself a favor and SKIP",0
"Fun teacher does goes off topic a lot but makes class less boring, pretty straight forward just read the book and go over the power point and you'll get a good grade.",1
"I took Andys History of Rock n Roll class my freshman year back in 2013 so it should speak volumes about his personality that I still miss his lectures to this day. Witty and passionate guy who keeps it real, grading wise. Since hes been in and around the music scene he offers amazing insight on subject topics. 10/10 would recommend.",1
"I had this class and absolutely loved it. I hate science, and I got a very good grade. Just show him that you're trying, do all the labs, and take every quiz. It will boost up your grade a lot. He's very nice",1
"She is very passionate about ASL, stresses that you have to participate in order to learn. You definitely need to pay attention and realize that this is another language not a breeze through easy class.  Practice is KEY!",1
"Kim's an alright teacher, but she's a tough grader and she isn't super clear on what she wants from an assignment. I probably missed at least one point on every assignment for something small. She also doesn't care if your group isn't helping you out, I complained a lot about my group and she just docked me points from my group review assignment.",0
This class is not as much test heavy as it is quiz heavy. Everything we learn we have to teach ourselves since she teaches lessons during lecture after they were already due on Hawkes. She is bad with emailing and her reviews are NOTHING like the test/quizzes. I do not recommend her at all as a teacher for this course.,0
"DO NOT, (I repeat), DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! This is truly the hardest class I have ever taken and I am an A-B student. I'm in my 4th year of college and decided to wait to take my Chemistry.  She reads exactly from power points, there is almost no point in going to class, and exams are the heaviest part of the grade. Impossible to learn.",0
She is an awful teacher. Its her way or else you fail.,0
Best professor at Assumption College. Always keeps discussions entertaining and insightful.  Also he is the most knowledgable person I have ever met,1
"This is a great teacher, you have to do some work, but if you do you cannot fail. Probably one of the best teachers at this school",1
"Betty expects a lot from her students. The amount of tedious homework, reading, and composition assignments is ridiculous, but the exposure to the language is what matters. If you are not prepared for class, it will be obvious. Overall she's a very knowledgeable professor. No patience for people who don't put forth the effort.",1
"Dr. Tripp is one of the best professors I've had here so far. He teaches purely based off of examples, and if you don't understand it, he is always willing to try and help. He never makes you feel bad about not understanding or answering incorrectly. Overall, he's an awesome guy.",1
"Doesn't have the best attitude and appears as if he favors certain students over others.  Presentation, a couple papers, and a final...though he said sometimes he doesn't do finals and just does an enormous paper instead.  You can only have one absence or you lose one letter grade, but it was okay for him to miss multiple classes at his convenience",0
"Thermo is definitely the hardest class I've ever taken, but Dr. Buttrey does a great job of explaining the material. If you have questions, just ask right away otherwise your confusion will just build until you can't do anything about it. Definitely the smartest man I've ever met. 20 hours of homework per week. Good luck.",1
"LoL... This class was too easy. I felt guilty for not trying and getting an A. A couple papers, a presentation, and online discussion boards = final grade. I probably spent 1/10 of the time on doing work for this class compared to my other ones. Take it for an EASY A+ if you need it for a GE! That's what I did :-D",0
Will interrupt a student if she disagrees with them. You dont have to do the readings if you attend class because she will go over them extensively. Exams are okay but she will dock marks if you dont give her the exact answer she is looking for. Expects you to have everything memorized.,0
"Dr. Tavss is one of  the most inspirational people that I have ever come across. His lectures have helped me develop into the person I am today. After taking this class, however, I feel as though I will never experience the sense of ecstasy and glee that I felt when I heard Edward Jacob Tavss speak. Dr. Tavss has become a lifelong mentor and friend",1
"Awesome teacher!He made Perspectives on Gender was  interesting. IDK what the other person is talking about...he's not a ""piece of work"" but very passionate and it shows! Loved the class!",1
Boring lecture. Don't take when this guy's teaching Astr323.,0
"Don't take her. Her tests are incredibly difficult and there are many questions that she never taught how to solve in class. No study guides, brutal grader, never gave enough time on exams, you can't see your grade unless you set an appt with her. Averages for exams were around 55%. She is very knowledgable on the subject, but she can't TEACH.",0
It's a decent class. You'll learn a lot. McHardy is very kind and approachable. The people who say he isn't have no idea what they're talking about.,0
"Really bad proof. Was instructor for first year project power supply. Never helps you. Always asks about ur lab book. Even though u show ur lab book and your schematic, he denies to help you. Lot of times burn diodes and the rotating Potentiometerwhile showing the demo to class.",0
"An incredible professor who genuinely cares about her students and gives the BEST feedback. For HIST 3378, the syllabus was long and overwhelming, but the work load wasnt.",1
"I took this professor a year ago, but felt the urge to inform incoming students because of how terrible this professor is. I ended up dropping his course after 2 exams because I was failing and he would not help me if I had questions. I ended up taking Chem 1 and passed with an A, yet intro is supposed to introduce you to chem. TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!",0
"I like Prof. Morris' grading system, which is somewhat skewed but helps in the long run. Tests are somewhat vague yet specific at the same time. MUST ATTEND lectures to know stuff on the test - it isn't a ""I'll read the textbook and be fine on the test"" class, many ""we discussed ____ in class, what was it?"" questions on tests. Nice professor.",1
"Compared to other math professors, Graham is pretty good. His lectures are pretty easy to follow, and he explains things better than most. He does not grade on a curve however, and will be pretty tough on grading. He does 4 exams, a final and 10 quizzes for credit. Quizzes can be done as a group. He also assigns homework, but it's optional.",1
Dr. Brown is the best!! She really gives a lot of great content for when you become a teacher!,1
"a great iconic man, quizlet got me through it, HEAVY true false- almost half of questions are true false usually on the tests",1
"Only have had this professor for a month and I already hate this class. Extremely rude. Yelled at us the second week of class when only 4 of us had purchased HIS textbook (which at the time was sold out). Also received the ""taxpayers pay for you to come here make the most of it"" speech. Boring lectures. Acts like his class is the only class we take",0
"After 60 hours worth of classes, she is by far the worst professor I've ever had. I took the summer session A&P course and it was the most sporadic and unorganized class ever. She would loose our graded papers,  biased when it came to essay questions, and overall rude to students. She would make you feel unreasonably incompetent if you asked a ?.",0
"A very unhelpful statistics professor. Spent no time elaborating on or explaining the material. Did a poor job of answering conceptual questions.  Contradicts herself and the textbook. Insists on the importance of programs like SPSS and Excel, but fails to teach you how to use them. There are much better professors here.",0
"Really wants to see students succeed. Definitley should go to class, but he posts notes day before exam opens so if you miss a couple classes youre fine",1
"He is a good guy, he tries hard to teach his students. But he is not a good teacher. He has a degree in theoretical physics and expects his students to know everything from Algebra I. He is impatient and will not answer questions well. However, he posts sample tests online and gives easy MAPLE worksheet you can't fail for 20% of your grade.",0
I had the pleasure of having Dr. Haynes in graduate school for his Age of Jackson course.  This professor is without question one of the most outstanding historians and professors I have ever had the pleasure to take a class from.  Excellent professor,1
"Great guy! Really funny and knows material really well. Only 2 tests and a final, so you have to do well on every one. Don't miss a lecture or a single note, he doesn't post the powerpoints and those are the tests. Would take him again!",1
Professor Lee thinks everyone is an expert. The reading in the class is insane. I eventually began skimming and my grades showed it. They seem useless until the test hits. He doesn't provide a powerpoint just an outline that he writes on the wall. You need to take good notes to pass. Pretty much write as much as you can down. Use EC opportunity!,0
He lectures very well so take lots of notes! He provides clear lecture points and study guides. He is very firm but fair and transparent in what he expects. I would definitely recommend him as an instructor.,1
"Shes really nice if youre on her good side. I like her but if youre not willing to put in effort, shes not the professor for you. Requires all 3 books to be counted as present for attendance",1
"His lectures are so long and he basically just rants the entire time about things that do not pertain with the class. Truthfully, I'm not learning anything. Plus the way he grades quizzes and tests is a complete joke, and not fair.",0
"She assigns SOOOO many things throughout the semester, doesn't explain how she wants it done, and then takes points off when you do it wrong, even if it's just the ""draft."" I've never had a professor give this many assignments. I really can't stand her class and can't wait for the semester to be over. If you can avoid taking her, then do so.",0
Super unclear about what he expects in your papers. Pretty much rips your paper a part. Nice guy but if you're looking for an A he is not your best bet. ,0
"I absolutely loved Dr. C! I had him for lab, and he explained the material better than what I learned in lecture. His assignments are very straightforward (and some were done in class). He really knows his material, and he wants the best for his students. He is super caring and is lenient on deadlines. Take him whenever you have the chance!",1
Professor Bazil was a ghost. He never responded to anybody's emails. The assignments weren't too difficult but then again he ended up cutting our class short because of COVID. I wasn't mad at it since I had a good grade but I can't imagine being someone who had a bad grade b/c all the other assignments had been cancelled. I would've been upset.,0
"The crazy russian is a great prof.  If you need to take cs101 as a EE corse req, take him.  Beware of his accent, but its not that hard to understand.  If he yells, its not at a student, he is just getting excited.",1
"The change from high school english to the university level is much harder than expected and in my opinion, she did not do a good job with the preparations. Boring, hard to listen to sometimes, somewhat opinionated. She is a good person at heart though, and you will see that very quickly in the class. Does give help if asked. Do not call after 10. ",0
"Disorganized, but one of the more tolerable professors in the faculty. Be warned: with Von Flotow, it's ""my way or the highway""",0
One of the best professors I encountered during my studies. Had an open door policy and was always willing to clarify any questions I had. Also made attempts to assists students with connections in industry.,1
"The good times are over, folks. It's now high disappointment and low grades (as opposed to both being high). Velk's a hard teacher now, with all strings attached. Don't do it.",0
Listen to lectures carefully because the pop quizzes are very hard. He is very helpful when it comes to questions.,1
as others have said. i came to school and i didn't hate anything more than math. Jack made me actually love it. He is the best prof at Guelph (not sure if better than Anthony Vannelli though) but definitely one of the best instructors i have met in my life.,1
"She is my favorite! I have taken AP1 lab and micro lab and I feel like I learned a lot from her. Her tests are hard, but that only forced me to study harder and learn more.",1
"No extra credit opportunities. Cant really ask questions coz she gives attitude. When you email her, she responds only to what she feels like responding to. Old reviews says she allows little formula cards/notes for tests. Well In 2020, she doesnt. If youre an A seeker or youre a foreigner, find someone else. Got an A so Im not bitter betty.",1
"No very helpful. Your grade is tests and a final, so it's pretty much a pass/fail class. He does easy problems in class, but will put more complex problems on the test which he never showed how to do. He has good intentions, but unless you're a math genius and can teach yourself you're most likely gonna struggle.",0
"Servos is a great guy who really knows what he's doing, which is more than can be said for a lot of other profs. The material of the courses he teaches is typically quite difficult, but he (typically) explains it quite well. Tests are fair, but be warned that 10-15% of the questions on tests are from textbook material, and are not in the lectures.",1
"Mary is a very nice lady and is very brilliant and accomplished. However, she was maybe not the best teacher ever for Intro Enviro Geo. It often felt like we weren't actually learning anything, and we were assigned a Lot of reading that was actually never relevant ever. But she is nice and probably good for upper-level geo from what I hear.",0
"Maureen is part of the reason that I decided to change my career path. Debate was one of the most eye-opening experiences I've had in my whole college experience.  Professor Louis loves her students like her own children. Anyone who dislikes her teaching probably isn't there to learn in the first place. As Maureen would say, LET'S CLAP FOR THAT.",1
Awesome prof.  It doesn't get much better than Strickler.,1
"Ms. Cindy is the most amazing lady ever. Every class she brought us snacks and made the classroom a home away from home. She really cares about her students and will let you redo quizzes until you get a 100%. Take her, she is the absolute best.",1
Absolute worst professor at uc davis. avoid this prof at all costs. He does not care at all about teaching. heavy acccent and illegible notes.,0
DACEY IS A GENIOUS!!!  this guy knows what he is talking about and makes learning the material applicable to everyday life!!! He along with scott metlen (another IBC wells fargo Prof.)are by far the coolest profs out there,1
"I do not understand how any person who took a class with Tremblay could honestly give him a decent review. I have never felt so targetted and despised by a professor before. I have a 4.0 grade point average and never had problems with profs before, but here we are. He was unwilling to meet outside of class, and quite rude about it too.",0
"He really isn't that bad but class can be uninteresting. Only two papers. He doesn't take attendance. All the hw is online, but it's easy. Just post your opinions on topics and he will just read peoples during class. It isn't formal presentations or in front of the class. Easy Class!",1
Don't take her!! Three are so many other good profs. If you cannot get into their class just drop the course and take it next term. It is better than wasting your time taking a class that will make you hate CS!!,0
"Wow, just wow! This man is an amazing professor, and he is the reason why I decided to have a major in NMC. His lectures are so engaging, and you can really tell that he is passionate about the subject he teaches. I appreciate that he actually cares about his students, and he clarifies any doubts you have. Such a fun prof, definitely reccomend him.",1
"Heavy workload, challenging course, and tough grader. But Prof Orwin is EXTREMELY knowledgeable, approachable, and a fair grader. He is a traditional lecturer, so you will have to take good notes. I was worried because I saw students flaming him, but honestly, if you do what is assigned, this is the most intellectually stimulating course I ever had",1
"Professor Wilson should do a much better job of telling students what he expects in an answer. Before the test he'll mention a couple of vague things but during the test review he'll talk about very specific details he expected in the answer. Very confusing, avoid him if you can. I only ever get A+ or A in law courses but in his class I got a B+.",0
"Awful teacher. Rambled. Too emotional. Tried to go to her office hours, but she did not show up a number of times.",0
Dr. Thomas is a wonderful professor!! I had her during her first semester at Tech. She makes anatomy easy and interesting. She also enjoys helping her students in any way she can.,1
This class is extremely difficult. I was never able to meet the standards she presented because she expects so much detail. There are always so many assignments due and many of them take you at least 2 hours. She gives a lot of feedback but rarely gives positive feedback and makes teaching feel more like a grade than something actually enjoyable.,0
"WORST PROFESSOR EVER. This teacher uses many unnecessary vocabulary words to throw her students off during exams. Her tests make absolutely NO sense, but make up the bulk of the grade. It's almost like someone is using google translator to write these exams. Discussion boards are graded RIDICULOUSLY TOUGH for writing our own opinion. STAY AWAY",0
"There is so much reading required for this class, but it ends up not counting for much.  You write two essays that are not necessarily related to what we learn in class, and you take two tests.  The tests are too simple after all the analysis you do in class and discussion.  The professor is very unclear and hard to understand.  Frustrating class.",0
"Terrible course structure, so disorganized, still shaping the course so prepare for challenges. Nice guy but poor lecturer, EXTREMELY UNCLEAR, treats students like we're writing our PhD thesis, tons of work for small 2-5% grades, 5 blog posts/3 papers/2 presentations/2 reports, the list goes on.... lectures are a waste of time'",0
best and most knowledgable professor i have ever had.,1
"I took his class because I had no other option. This professor does not help you at all and expects you to do things by yourself. He does not teach any programming expects how to calculate sum of two numbers and basic stuff. He makes alot of mistakes and says, "" I am not like other profs whk prepare their lectures at home. I do everyrhing here.""",0
"If shes the only option for microbiology, dont get too discouraged right away. Reading a lot of these ratings can definitely discourage you because it definitely happened to me when I read these before taking the course. Yes she is a very hard teacher and honestly doesnt teach well, but just put attention to lectures and you should be okay",0
"The man, everything is done using excel, 2 test and a final. No homework due but should try the problems every now and then. Definitely take him for 200, doing it by hand is much harder.",1
"I had a three hour class with him, and he did NOT lecture at all. He'd ask questions, tell us we were wrong, then tell us exactly what we just said...? What? He lectured TWICE in the semester and it was great, but he totally left you alone with the book. He quizzed us on things that DID happen in the Civil War, problem is... it wasn't in the book.",0
"Worst professor ever, reads verbatim from the textbook slides.  His project wanted you to do one thing but he had his TA grade to a totally different set of guidelines.  Out of a class of 40 students (undergrads + grads) usually only a dozen or so would show up for class and if that only half of them would stay the whole class.",0
"Excellent professor, great person.  Show up on-time and do all assignments and you'll do very well.",1
"The Dark Souls of profs right here. Too many problems to list in 350 characters. Things to look forward to: Kneecapping your GPA Spending a mandatory $25 on Tophat, a weekly in class quiz program Getting told how worthless everyones study habits are when the class avg is 50% Narcissism in action IMPOSSIBLE exams Being looked down on",0
"Schlicker WILL make you work hard for your grade, but he is there for every question you could possibly have.",1
"wonderful lecturer! recommend going to see him for essay help. yes the memorization of terms is a little ridiculous, but its only worth 10% so keep working on that 40%essay!",1
"Dr. Matson comes across as a wonderful man. He is smart, funny, caring, and gives a new take on the world. I learned so much personally about myself, my relationship, and the people around me. Lectures are engaging and fun to be apart of, never boring. It's important to read and reread all sections in book plus take extra notes lecture. Great class",1
"Well lets put it this way. I got an A in the class. I didnt buy the book. I listened to her lectures and took some notes and thats about it. Just do the projects and put some effort into it. I never studied for tests but dont be fooled by that, just take notes during her lectures and you should be fine. Easy B/A :) Good teacher. Chill class, I advi",1
"Professor Tang is a godsend! Funny, brilliant, and caring. Loved her class.",1
"I hated how he taught. Due to covid, we used zoom and he never has the chat or talking button on. It was impossible to ask questions during lectures. The test is worth 70% so if you failed then you are done. When I asked for extra credit, I received a rude comment back. Only test and quizzes are graded. I won't waste my money on him, he don't care.",0
Lectures were informative but MacKay was a bit disorganized and her lectures were not always in order. There's a weekly online quiz that is worth doing since it's easy marks. Gave lots of extra assignments to get grade up if needed.,1
"Class is nothing but a PowerPoint slide narrated in a dry fashion. You can tell that he's been doing this for years, and not in a good way. Seems like a nice enough guy, but I haven't really enjoyed this class.",0
"I had Tom for CHEM 2510 and CHEM 3580 in the same semester. He teaches the material very clearly, but sometimes digresses to tell you about his latest trip to Paris or tell you a joke about his mom. However, I think he does that to keep your attention. He will test you on conceptual knowledge and not memorization. Overall, he was a great professor.",1
Horrible. Not about the subject it was supposed to be on. Rambled on and on about nothing in particular. Gone for 3 weeks of an 8 week class to visit her husband.,0
"I took ICS45c during COVID-19 when we shifted to online learning and it was a lot easier because exams were replaced by weekly exercise sets. You still learn though! He prerecords lots of lecture videos, provides detailed online notes, and uses live lecture times as office hours. Very responsive on Piazza and tutors/TAs are helpful.",1
What is my grade? Who knows! we have not gotten our case studies back nor will he reply to an email about getting a grade update. I am reporting him to his superiors due to his lack of response when we try to contact him.  He is just so distracted/all over the place during lecture/ makes him difficult to follow  will never take his classes again!,0
"Mr. thistle's class , whether intentional or not, really likes to stand on the height of theory, and bombards student with confusing concepts. However, once you get pass that, you will find that you can apply the theory with great clarity. For the exams, Mr. thistle plays quite fairly, almost no trick question and always in orders.",1
"She is a very nice person, but she is a very poor teacher. She definitely knows what she is talking about, but she does not know how to deliver it effectively. However, she is very approachable and wants you to pass. A lot of her exams are graded on a curve, and she tries to give you as many extra points as she can. Good luck.",0
Lectures are very confusing and work can be hard to follow. I'd recommend taking Differential Equations with someone else.,0
Dr. (the great) Huss (AKA the giver) is a super charismatic and funny professor. He does genuinely care about each student that walks through his door. He is strict in what he expects of each student but he is extremely accommodating if you just communicate with him.,1
If he can turn the projector on in the first 10minutes you are off to a good start!,0
"DROP THE CLASS AND RUN. choose another professor if you must. even the highest achieving students will not pass, due to her strict grading on tests. DO YOUR HOMEWORK AND STUDY!!",0
Lots of Homework. Takes me About 3-5hours per week. Tough grader for lab report and no helpful comments.,0
Lectures are hard to follow and she sidetracks a lot. Very unclear grading criteria on assignments. Prepare to read upfront!,0
Don't take this if you don't have to! Don't be afraid to reach out to him - great at responding to emails. Go to review sessions!!! Always bring your clicker in case of pop quizzes (but they're usually just for attendance so don't stress). Good luck!,0
"I am thoroughly unsatisfied with instructor. If you do not attend you will not pass, and I mean she will make your life super difficult to learn or even attend her lectures. The classes are usually entertaining but I find I do not always learn what I need to in the time given due to long periods of non-related topics.",0
"Very good, kind teacher.  The class was super easy, 5 or 6 papers throughout term, hybrid course.  Hardest thing was research paper, but relatively easy if you put your mind to it.  Would recommend her highly and take her again.",1
"Hard class, but you should be capable to pass.  If you can avoid taking him, do it.  His accent is thick and hard to understand, especially in the beginning.  I thankfully had the opportunity to take the class taught by 2 different instructors, and definitely learned and retained more from the other instructor.",0
"There is a lot of work to be completed for this class, but I believe that it has made me a MUCH better academic writer. Other than that, Tom is an incredibly caring and intelligent person. To be in his class was a blessing and a pleasure.",1
275 and 277 go through him. What's taught in his lectures is what to expect on the midterm and final. Organized material remarkably well for such a loaded course. Had all 4 blocks trying to get into his lectures at one point in the semester. Don't let the midterm lull you into a false sense of security; his finals are brutal.,1
"I really enjoyed taking an online course from Professor Evans! She responds to your messages in a timely matter and is always there to help. There are discussions, journals, blogs, quizzes, tests, a research paper, and a final. Everything is so organized and easy to find. I would love to take a class in person with her! Great experience:)",1
Sherry is horrible. She gives you zero information and wants her class to do bad. She gives a ridiculous amount of questions for an hour exam and then gets mad at the class for doing bad. She is very non understanding and seems to not care about how bad they are doing. I hope one day she realizes we are doing bad due to her unrealistic expectations,0
" Class was useless. All we did was define diversity topics, not explain how to fix them. MLP is extremely confusing. Ask questions early or you won't know what to do. USE PEER GRADERS! Do not let him grade your final project. Tough grader, which is ridiculous because the project has no rubric and no one knows what theyre doing. ",0
"Dr. Schneider was probably the best accounting professor I've had thus far at ECU. His lectures and notes are very organized (don't need to buy the book) and he teaches the material extremely well. You still have to study but he always tests you on things you should have studied, no tricks. He is a funny guy but in the dry and nonchalant way. Take.",1
"Pat is wonderful.  He says a C is a good grade, but if you want an A, he is VERY willing to work with you. If you do the work, and go to class, you'll get at least a B, and if you put in a little extra, you can totally get an A.  You would have to TRY to get below a B.",1
DO NOT TAKE!! Failed to communicate - took 3 weeks to answer questions regarding mid-term. Mid-term and final are essay formats. He is not organized and doesn't seem to be engaged or knowledgeable. Do yourself a favor and choose another professor.,0
"Very difficult course, but Patricia is probably the best prof at UNB to be taught this course. She can't help the difficult content, but she does make it a bit easier.",1
"Dropped, do not recommend. You will not learn anything from this prof. How he became a prof is beyond me.",0
"Pretty slow pacing in class, but the content of 230 and 334 is interesting and stroud is great at explaining things, and is clearly extremely passionate about her work. Almost all of the readings for 334 are extremely interesting and rewarding, although they're quite hard",1
"I was expecting a lot more from this class. Serpell was a brilliant prof. but her lectures were usually too broad thematically while at the same time incorp. theory & a TON of new terms that we're responsible for on the final. Way too much work (2 papers, 2 rather pointless ass., a final, + graded attendance & weekly quizzes) for the little back.",1
"the best professor I've ever met in my northwest life. He is very clear and concise, right to the point, in means of almost everything: grading criteria, lecturing, providing helps, homeworks... etc. If you put an adequate amount of work to this class, A is not a hard grade to get. A lot of help is provided to you, and you just have to be active",1
"The material itself was fair in difficulty, but it was the lecture style that made it difficult.  Steve goes over concepts in very vague ways, although the few examples can be found on quizzes.  Learned everything via book, which isn't bad except the book has a crappy soln manual.  Tests are hwquizrecitation problems and some concepts.  ",0
I didn't have the book but the all Multiple choice tests weren't too hard if you looked at the slides he posted. My main problem was that he never said anything that wasnt on the slides unless it was to go on a a useless rant about the faults of the democratic party or some irrelevant anecdote. Made class hard to sit through.,0
The best acting teacher ever!,1
"Johannes is one of the best teachers I have ever met.  He is clear, patient, encouraging and helpful.  He is also very knowledgeable about (you name it) and interesting, passionate and funny.  No textbook, but everything is on handouts. Take his classes, you won't regret it!",1
"Very tough assignments with very little time to complete them. Quizzes throughout the semester, final is cumulative and  the only test of the semester (and no specifics about the test are given. Basically just says to know everything from the readings, homeworks, quizzes, projects, and lectures). ",0
Great course really informative and easy,1
"His lectures are very effective. At first it may be hard to adjust to his teaching style, but overtime, I found the way he teaches concepts very interesting and enjoyable. He explains new concepts thoroughly and starts with the basics. One of my favourite profs so far!!",1
"I took Dr. Combs for both INTL Law and Terrorism, and she is great! The class is only hard if you do not pay attention or care. She is extremely helpful, and obviously knows her stuff. Take every class from her you can!",1
"LOTS of readings on court cases for people who dont study law or arent used to reading a lot. A better way to study the material is to just look up youtube videos on the court cases. One small, super casual, presentation worth like 10pts. Three exams with about 40 multiple choice questions. Professor is chill but the class was not for me.",1
"she is the worst for calc, she makes way to many mistakes and confuses us and also speeds through problems with incoherent explanation. the way the homework is setup up is the dumbest thing ever, I personally hate her with a passion and it is only week two",0
"Jessica teaches with enthusiasm which engages the students. Also, I enjoy that she always comes to class with a positive attitude and ready to teach--for some reason this makes me forget about the outside world while lecture is being delivered. Finally, she's good with conflict resolution, so don't be afraid to talk to her if you have an issue.",1
She's a complete fool.  If your interested in the new eugenics movement or evolutionary Psychology I guess you'll like her. Avoid her classes if you can.    She's worthless.,0
"While obviously brillant by any standards, Nelson should not be teaching freshman composition. Lectures were not helpful and he was never clear about what he wanted in a paper, although he likes classical litterature more then modern stuff. The class was the bane of my existence this year.",0
"A nice guy and always willing to help those struggling in the class. The content of the course is not difficult but if you have any questions, he's willing to answer them. If you're struggling with the workload or directions for an assignment, he's willing to work with you to ensure everything gets done. Participation is key for his course.",1
"I LOVE SCHWAB. Yeah he's a little boring and weird but he totally owns up to it. Makes micro concepts super clear, if you can't get at least a B in this class there is something up. He also has his own little weird sense of humor and he'll occasionally make some pretty funny jokes during lecture. SCHWAB IS THE BEST",1
"The exams are fairly easy to do provided you read the textbook and understand it. The lectures are pretty boring to attend, and you're probably better off just reading the textbook on your own.",1
Test are straight out of the lectures. I had a hybrid course and it was in class for one day and online for another. he couldnt figure out how to use the online lecture half the time so we just ended up not having class. he records the online lecturers when they do work and posts them. study those and you will pass. rarely use the books,0
"Not very motived. Unavailable for help, doesn't update mistakes in his materials, expects students to put huge amounts of time into the class and doesn't really seem to put any time in himself. Unorganized. Disrespectful.",0
"Never have I taken a bio class that didn't allow any sort of index card w notes,  you are covering 36 different  different powerpoint ""lectures"" in 8 weeks that is insane. Studying nightly & wkends doesn't seem to help. Its all memorization and she clearly tricks u on the tests, which the computer grades you on. what exactly does she do to teach?",0
"Professor Sokchea is a very nice guy and knows a lot about economics. But this class was very difficult, his test were very hard and he wasn't very good at preparing us for the test. Also DO NOT forget to do a homework, you'll need those points.",0
"She is the best Prof!!!. Her class is so clear, she gives good notes, and the bonus is she is such a nice person!!!!",1
The course is doable with a different prof. He makes the course 1000 times unbearable and that's not an exaggeration. His handwriting is difficult to read. Two textbooks were made available and yet not enough. He includes so many proofs in midterms and final that he hardly goes over in class. I think he intentionally wants students to fail.,0
"Wane is unorganized, unclear in both her lectures and grading criteria, and overall the worst professor I have had. Her lectures had no structure, and everything she said was overtly opinionated. While opinions are fine, objectivity is needed when describing literary schools. I got an A, so I'm not just complaining because I flunked. She's horrible",0
Dr. Rosenthal is very nice and shows passion for her subject but she requires us to know a lot about the reading material. We had 1 paper due a week min. 250 words on each story we read. Our discussions in class were boring and time went by slow- it's all lecture. She grades VERY hard and gives you no info on what the midterm or final is.,1
"Absolutely terrible. Gives little help on the massive amount of daily homework. Little explanation over topics expected to know without prior discussion. When he does answer a question is extremely condescending. On more than one occasion said ""If you don't understand this then drop the class."" Has knowledge of Spanish but doesn't wish to share it.",0
"He is NOT a hard professor. Every test comes directly from the notes. If you look over your notes at least once, you are going to get an A. He also is more than willing to repeat himself or further explain a slide if it is unclear to you. I highly recommend him.",1
"Prof Murphy is my fave teacher! She expects a lot from you, but if you study, come to class, do not plagiarize, and do your work and you will do great! If you need help, she is there for you! She lectures but has lots of hands-on fun stuff! Big hint; dont text in her class! I mean really dont do it!!",1
"Mark is very laid back, can be a little difficult to follow because once he has established a topic, he will assume that you remember it. It's possible to do well, but you need to attend and pay attention in class, work to actually answer the practice problem/test prep handouts, and stay on top of online homework. Put his notes into your own words.",1
Class was mandatory but it worked for me. Great topics and we had to be engaged or we missed out. Wish there were more live classes though - that would be great. I asked for a few private sessions and she was happy to meet up over skype and go over my concerns. Lots of help.,1
"Compared to her intro level ITS course, higher level courses with Anne Matheus are way better. You can see she definitely knows her stuff and she doesn't baby the class (ok, just a little). You'll learn a lot from her class and you'll enjoy it too. Homeworks are dead easy and tests are not bad either - fill-in with a word bank and multiple choice.",1
"Love Jasper!! He truly wants you to do well and is always there to answer questions. Don't mess around in his class and don't use your phone, he's really big on respect. Although I never had that issue, because he actually made math class fun. I wish I took him for my first two semesters of math!",1
"She takes attendance daily, which sucks because her class is a complete waste of time. All she does is go on and on about her family and pets, making the material confusing; wasting time. I did the readings on my own and it was so much easier and simpler. Take the class because it's interesting, but be ready to bring your computer and ignore her.",0
Mark is an amazing teacher. I purposely chose multiple classes with him because of how understanding and hilarious of a professor he is. He focuses 100% on his students and pushes them to create their best but in a fun environment. He makes class exciting- especially on those long Tuesday/Thursday classes. HIGHLY recommend.,1
"Absolute favorite prof at American. Took her classes throughout my tenure at AU and was always amazed at the engaging, energetic, and artistic teaching style. Learned more than anywhere else. Personally, one of the most approachable people I have ever met; one hell of a teacher. Highly recommend.",1
"He doesn't really explain the lessons well and all he does is write examples on the board. However, the quizzes aren't too bad because if you study the examples he did during classes before, you'll be fine. There is a lot of online homework that somewhat doesn't really correlate with the stuff he does in class. If you study you should be fine.",0
Pennell is great once you get to know her! Class can be very boring and difficult at times but she is very understanding with attendance if you email her. There is a lot to do in this class and she will not wait for you to catch up.,1
"She gives WAY to much work for an online class. She clearly does not understand using technology to make life easier as well as she should considering she is teaching an online class. She is an extremely tough grader and will add comments that are not helpful, but rather rude at times. DO NOT take this class.",0
"Professor Wo is one of the most wonderful professors I have taken here at SSU. There are a lot of comments on here about not being able to understand her accent, and that's really sad. I think if you take her you'll see that's ridiculous. These are just students who aren't willing to put the absolutely minimal effort in to listen.",1
You have online homework over every section but he is willing to help you during office hours and devotes about 30 minutes of every class to helping students with it. He curved every test so if you did well enough you end up getting extra credit. I thought the class was boring because it was so easy.,1
The worst professor so far. Unprepared lectures. No feedback whatsoever. Half the lectures were wasted on presentations for which he didnt provide any feedback and just sat there so he doesnt have to prepare and teach the class. Grading is based on how much he likes you.,0
"Dr. Lindsay is great! He really tries to get to students to understand the material, not just know enough to pass the test.  He does give quite a bit of work, but if you start early its not hard, just time consuming. He is always willing to go over something or help in anyway he can.",1
horrible coure.just the structure.if you did all the work without doing bonus labs your max is 75%.she didn't tell us that at the beginning. I attended all classes..worked hard and failed. I asked her to go over her marking and she found 2 assignments that she marked but FORGOT to put in my final mark.other friends had better english teachers!!,0
"Many childish group projects. Not terribly clear with projects or essays. Made the class do ****work for her neighborhood ISP which didn't apply to the class. Very sweet, though.",1
"I wouldn't recommend signing up for this challenging course unless you're willing to put hardworking efforts to stay up longer hours every week typing on the computer and reading plenty of information from your textbook, therefore watch out for attendance and tardiness policies on syllabus contract otherwise stated then turn in homework ON TIME.",0
"He seems to be a very nice man outside of the classroom, but once in class he is incredibly condescending. He does not listen to his students needs. His comments on papers often left students feeling embarrassed and upset. I went to office hours with him but left feeling worse about my paper. Honestly one of my worst experiences with a professor.",0
"Boring lectures. Was fun to watch movies in his class, though. Test was easy.",0
"He kept the class very interesting with his personal accounts of trips he has taken, relevant music and cultural discussions, and was very funny and knowledgable all around.  He even brought in Pre-Columbian chocolate for us to try.  Go to class, participate, do your work, and you will probably get an A. He really is a great professor.",1
While he's not speaking in broken un-understandable English he's teaching from slides that can only be described as confusing and scattered. If I was in his position I would be embarrassed to post my slides and would probably quit teaching. Its not fair to accept money from the university and then do such a bad job. He should quit.,0
"Raudenbush is a tough professor for sure. Psych 115 is sort of a right of passage into the program at Jesuit, and should not be taken lightly. If you are a natural at math and SPSS, you will breeze by. If you struggle, Dr. Raudenbush isn't the most approachable guy to talk to. You can not avoid the class if you are a Psych Major, so be ready.",0
"To sum up Dr. Gray: great person, awful professor. His online classes don't follow the course times you signed up for (ex. signed up for Monday classes, lectures are uploaded on Thursdays and tests are on the weekends.) Recycles his material (powerpoints, recorded lectures, musings, etc) and relies heavily on Connect - so lazy.",0
"He only gives 30 minutes to do assignments in class, and he grades them harshly. Do not take this professor unless you're auditing his class.",0
One word sums it up: horrible,0
She made the tests too hard,1
"He was very hard to understand sometimes and was always yelling. He shouts a lot and if no one in class answers (which is usually the case) he will continue to ask again and again until someone does. He is a nice person, but even going to his office didn't help me and I have taken micro-econ before. Very difficult grader.",0
"He teaches with no structure , expecting you to remember what he says word for word. There is literally nothing to study off of. No textbook, no slides, just the words that come out of his mouth. The man is a genius, but incredibly lazy.",0
this had to be one of my worst teachers. she doesnt help and expects you to know everything. she makes a simple subject very difficult. i would never recommend her,0
"Great teacher would recommend, best class I have ever taken. He really knows what he is doing, very nice guy too.",1
"Dr. Punja is a great prof. The notes are easy to understand along with his explanations and he makes the lecture videos very enjoyable as he cracks some jokes here and there. If you ever have the chance, take bisc 101 with him!",1
Thought he was a great prof until this year when he screwed the whole class over because he was lazy. Not a bad teacher but should retire if he can't have the energy to follow the course syllabus.,0
"For the love of god, transfer from her class if you are scheduled for it.  In high school, I got A's in math - in her class, I barely pulled a B and had to teach myself -everything- I learned nothing from class other than she takes attendance.",0
"She tries very hard and puts a lot of effort into her teaching style, it just doesn't work. There's usually at least 3 things due a week because there are so many little assignments and quizzes worth like 1%. She does little to know actual teaching and expects students to learn it all outside of class which just doesn't work.",0
The most interesting individual I have ever met in college! Intelligent and charismatic in every way possible. The best professor I have ever taken at USC oR anywhere. Hes intimidating but loves his students.,1
Mr. Ball is a former police officer and knows everything you need to know about criminal justice. Take his class and you won't regret it. Not very difficult but you must read the textbook and pay attention to the details. Be sure to be active in your discussion posts; as this is what gives you points!,1
I loved this class and I have already signed up for several more classes with her. She was funny and always made lectures interesting though her lecture tangents were never test questions so attendance was optional. The homework is time consuming but really easy and the tests were very straight forward and in the order the material was taught.,1
"not a great teacher. there are no discussions he just reads off the powerpoint word for word. ALOT of reading, you can tell he doesnt care about the students only his paychecks.",0
"best prof! so funny. Great teacher and sooo not boring, keeps you interested.",1
"If you wanna learn more than the course guideline this is the guy. On 2nd week he will be talking about stuff from the 7th week. Read notes/watch videos at least 2 weeks prior to his classes. He will mark you on based on his lectures, dont expect to get a good mark even if you master the official notes. Hard but you will get out learning much mor",1
"He had a good sense of humor which kept the class time moving quicker. He did complete reviews of his exams before the exam. What I did not like was that he races to finish his scheduled work and doesn't have time for your questions if you don't understand. He also rushed the ""final"" pig dissection and I would say his teaching is very disorganized.",1
"really easy class. 6 to 8 2-and-a-half page papers. as many rewrites as you want. fun class to go to, pretty funny guy. lets class out early if you ask sometimes. if english wasn't your thing in high school take this class for sure! english-loving people may feel gypped.",1
Very unorganized and doesn't care about any students. Simply does not respond to emails. She covers some stuff 100 times and other stuff 0 times. DO NOT TAKE,0
"Professor Bonca is a must have for English majors at CSUF. I had him for 2 courses so far and will soon have him for a third. You don't always have to be up to date with the readings because he lectures passionately for almost the entire class period on the material. Class consists of essays and written exams, easy grader, gives great feedback",1
If at all possible DO NOT take her class. She is the worst teacher ever. Gives people 10 out of 50 on papers our class average for tests has never been above 62% and she wont curve. This class is impossible to pass and the teacher is impossible to please. No joke 1/2 of my class is failing. SHe doesnt want students to pass and is the WORST TEACHER,0
He thinks he is the best. And that makes him the worst.,0
"This man in very nice but the material is quite difficult. I am taking the intro class that is required by all students and it is difficult because he teaches very fast and does not got over the problems more than one or two times in most cases. Take if you are very good at math but if not I would try and avoid. As Franko would say, ""Aight!""",1
"This is probably one of the worst professors I've ever had the displeasure of learning from. He's the only one who teaches 2 classes in 4th year and you have no choice but to stick it out with him. Attendance counts, tests are easy and have nothing to do with what he teaches, use the textbooks and pray for the patience to deal with him.",0
Chang does not teach.  His power points are unclear and do not explain the material.  Homework is no help in preparing you for the his impossible quizzes and tests.  Expect to spend a lot of time with a stat textbook if you want to pass the course.,0
"An ideal instructor for those scared of math, jumping back into math, or just needing some time to finally get comfortable with your skills.  He keeps the class moving along, but is right there to help if you get stuck.  He is a stickler for detail, but is very clear about expectations.  Highly recommended.",1
"Professor Shatah is tough and intimidating, but one of the best in the dept. It's not hard to remember something when you know he might call on you and ask you to recite it off the top of your head. He is actually very nice and willing to help. If you want any sort of proper training to become a mathematician, definitely take him. LOTS of homework.",1
She was very nice but did not explain the material that well. At least one person in our class would end up crying out of frustration. I would not take her again.,0
"worst professor ever, thick accent, no methodology, lots of mistakes, no idea flow, complete waste of time, major deception. He thinks that giving high grades will change his  students opinions. No",0
It's a hard class because he makes it hard. The questions on the exams are designed  to ensure that you learned every little detail from the textbook instead of focusing on the major points. 10% of the grade is participation. I wouldn't recommend this professor.,0
Great teacher. Sadly he does not work at FSW anymore.,1
"EXTREMELY USELESS. Doesn't get to the point at all. Skips through 10 slides at a time and speaks only about how iPads and iPods are revolutionizing the world. If you get her, SWITCH TO ALEC CRAM. He's much better!",0
"Your grade is based on one exam, weekly quizzes, recitations, and homework. The professor flies through lecture slides, but lecture recordings are posted. She makes a lot of mistakes in class and can be rude to students. We had to fight for extra credit that was in the syllabus. If you have the option, you might want to choose someone else.",0
"I took Calc 1 in high school, and because of this Barry's class was very easy. Fair amount of homework, and lectures get boring but it's math...how exciting can you get. His dry humor is funny but he is not very helpful in office hours. I recommend you don't take him if you have never had calc. if you have, it's a straight review and easy A.",1
"This man might be the single most useless, disrespectful, mentally draining, awful human being and professor I have ever come across in my entire schooling career. He grades more aggressively than possibly any other human on earth and provides no rubrics, comments, or notes on why and how you received said grades.",0
"He was really, really good at giving practical and helpful lectures. Prepare to read lots though. Quizzes were highly easy, Midterms were a little difficult but doable to get A's consistently if you don't slack off.",1
"So many ppl failed the midterm. It was killer. Unfortunately b/c the large group of ppl who are way smarter than B avg students bring the avg up and create a very positively skewed distribution which masks a big part of the class (the ""normal"" students). Tips: Read textbook and do the end of chapter q's (pretty much same as lec slides),do lon capa.",0
"While not the most riveting class (ENGL 398 is required of all engineers), Dr. Parker seems to genuinely care about his students and their time. He has provided ample extensions given our schedules--and he realizes that although required, this class is not the first priority for us.",1
"she literally will not teach you anything, if you are a comp sci major, i hope you already know how to use java, if you are taking it for credits don't even think about taking this excuse for a professor. you will fail. If you think you did all the homework right which you probably did, she will still give you 0/30",0
Not impressed st all,0
"Raquel is nice, but she makes this class way harder than it has to be. I don't hate going to class, or dislike her, but she really makes our quizzes/exams MUCH harder than they have to be, I understand she wants us to know the material but she makes it too hard. She is nice, but if you have better options take them over Raquel. Speeches aren't bad.",1
"Drop the course if you have him. He's very unorganized and can't remember who students are (which effects your participation mark). Very old school, does not appreciate critical thinking or new ideas. Asking for help was useless as you end up more confused. VERY hard marker. The course was a waste of time and money.",0
He doesn't write stuff down on the boards so you have to be pay attention and writing down notes. He assigns a whole lot of reading and if you read you might understand a lot of the time the readings are so long and boring. He genuinely knows what he's talking about but if you have him you actually have to try to pass. Curved the midterm+ final.,1
"Terrible professor, I took her for the Math 099/101 combo. I would never take her again I had to withdraw because she did not teach. She rushed all the material and did not make it easy to ask questions or learn. do not take!",0
"Have a question? Youtube it... I don't write reviews often but I felt it was essential this time for my fellow students. The subject material is difficult, and him being who he is just makes it even more difficult to understand. Either stay FAR away, or find a tutor asap, because you'll need one. don't take -- GPA killer...",0
"Profesor Bamford loves Philosophy, and wants her students to learn something. Two papers (opinion-based), a midterm and final. For both tests, you can bring a 'cheat sheet'. Incredibly kind and understanding. Assigns lots of readings for class, but does not check if you've read them or not. Class usually consists of powerpoints and group work.",1
good teacher and not bad on the eyes,1
Good professor. Make sure to show up. Not to tough. A good class to take to complete MACRAO. I would recommend this prof. She knows her stuff and is helpful. The class is also easy. It teaches a lot about how humans communicate.,1
"Bill's sections of 481 were enjoyable. His group projects were fun, if your group was too. Homework could be tedious, but it was very interesting. Good sense of humor; I was never bored during the hour and a half classes. He graded reasonably and did not give anyone a hard time. I hope I have him again at some point.",1
"He is a wonderful human being and a brilliant professor, but DO NOT take his Research Methods 121A class. If you want to actually learn anything from him take his Social Psyc or other classes he teaches. You're on your own for 121A and he's just the grader. His instructions are unclear and he didn't seem to care about teaching this class at all.",0
She expects her students to excel by their own efforts. Does not waste time with excuses and shoddy work. You will learn in her class if you show up and do your work. She does not play favorites and is an experienced professional. One of the few gems at Columbia College.,1
What can I say about Blandino? She is the sweetest most caring professor on campus. She is always trying to help her students pass the class. She recognizes when students are putting in genuine effort and has a good relationship with all students. Her grading is very fair and pushes her students to study like no other. She is basically mom!!!,1
Sports in lit. is one of the funnest classes I've ever had because I get to read books about sports and listen to all of his hilarious stories. It also is great because he loves baseball as do I. We even get to watch movies lol,1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. when you are confused she tells you not to worry about it you will get it the next class. She goes really fast while she is teaching. quizzes every day for attendance. pre-quizzes every Sunday, and homework every single day. Highly do not recommend it. 1/10 and that is being generous.",0
very knowledgeable. excellent use of class time. very helpful,1
"Patrick was great I thought. I wasn't by any means one of the best or most talented students in his class and we both knew it. He frequently teased me publicly when I messed up, but it wasn't in a mean way and I found it funny. I got an A in the class even though I struggled with most of the dance routine. If you try you'll make it no prob.",1
Great guy...A must take for 253 or any other classes he teaches. Just go to class and fill out your course book that goes right along with his lectures. never once opened my text book and got an A...,1
"Easily the worst class I have taken here so far. The class is college level difficulty, but it's structured like a high school course. You're left completely in the dark about what your grade is the whole way through. Acts like her class is the only class worth worrying about. Group project is long and somewhat hard. Strange attendance system. Bad!",0
"Stott is kind and tries his best, but the class is super disorganized. Each week is 1 lecture/1 reading discussion. he grades easily and tells you exactly what will be on tests so you can very easily prepare. He has you read a lot but you can get away with skipping most readings if you're good at Bs-ing a comment or 2 during each discussion.",1
"I don't think he is that good. He never really gets through his outline, instead he wastes more than half the class on one question of a quiz or he goes on a tangent in other parts of history and ""introduces"" them, even though they're 80 years in the future. he gives trivia instead of teaching you what's really on the test. I got good grades though",0
"Sharon London makes her acting class a lot of fun and everyone in your class will become close with each other. Warning: you have to be willing to make a complete fool of yourself and not care what anyone thinks. If you engage completely in every activity, you'll do fine and the time will pass by quickly. ",1
"Absolutely horrid teacher. Received the exact same grade on every single assignment in the class, and her comments didn't even match with the topic at hand. Obviously didn't read any papers, and took FOREVER to grade them. Always blew off meetings or questions, and said to ""ask a classmate"" when I had problems. Would NEVER take her again.",0
"Very poor teacher. Difficult to understand, likes trick questions, will not explain or provide additional examples.  If you have him drop the class now!!",0
She is very understanding! Don't take her online class if you have procrastination though,1
"Avoid Sandy Hanson at all costs. Im not joking when I say she makes her students MISERABLE. Shes a horrible teacher I have no idea how she has a job to be honest. Shes completely inconsiderate, doesnt give a crap about her students. Not even a little bit. She basically talks to herself during class because nobody can stand to listen to her crap",0
Just the worst prof I have ever had. DO NOT TAKE HIM IF U HAVE NOT TAKEN CALC. He takes points off for the most ridiculous things. HE MAKES DERIVATIVES SEEM HARD. The way he teaches makes me want to just cry.,0
"For your own good, do not take McCormick's Principles of Christian Morality.  Teaching and readings inconsistent).  We never actually learned about principles of Xtn Morality, and so we could never apply criteria to the ""case studies"" we jumped into.  Non-specific readings with undefined New Age language -- not helpful for learning any Principles.",0
"Very knowledgeable on art history, not very passionate/interested in transmitting that knowledge. Easy grader as long as you get on his good side by doing the easy work he assigns. Overall a fair teacher",1
"Nice guy, but is unclear about what will be covered on tests and quizzes. Tends to go on tangents.",1
"He was way to smart to be teaching this class. Lectures are hard to follow, grading is scattered. He is really helpful one on one, but it isn't enough. No extra credit or curving, and really test heavy. Personally did not like him as a professor",0
"Cannot complain, tons of extra credit added to exam scores. As long as you print the lectures, annotate them in class, write down everything he says, memorize it, you will be good. I studied one day before for each test by just memorizing the notes and I got an A. Very kind and passionate professor. Questions on the test are straight to the point.",1
she barely explains stuff in class and once she starts talking on something particular the lecture would end and nothing would be clear. She uses her own website which is not at all organized and causes a lot of confusion.,0
Too smart for her own good and terrible at projecting it. Expect a class where you're expected to fully explain multiple topics on the war in Vietnam without her telling you what shes looking for criteria wise. Would avoid at all costs.,0
Not as bad as prior comments make her seem. Its a hard class and i DO NOT recommend skipping lecture. If allowed to make not cards keep up on them and organize. Keep with it and she usually gives a little extra credit towards the end if in lecture. I got a B so if i can get a decent grade most people who at least try can too.,0
"Great Prof!  One of the best, easy to understand, engages the students with good examples.  Fair exams",1
Gave a lot of extra credit assignments but is a tough grader. Don't take it if you want a decent grade to enhance your GPA. Makes statistics a lot harder with his R thingy,0
"Kevin Borg is a really interesting guy that makes History somewhat fun. If you don't mind a liberal bias, I would take him. He does expect you to read A LOT. You will be expected to read for online quizzes and the discussion section. Also, Borg makes weird noises during lectures, so if that's distracting for you, I would take someone else.",1
"Wonderful, Funny, Amazing, Caring, Considerate, Charismatic,",0
"Great professor.  Makes challenging subjects interesting, and is always happy to help her students.  Good sense of humor, and very laid back.",1
"This was online.  I also wrote over 150 pgs for a ten wk summer course. He would grade his materials without a rubric, so you guessed on the requirements and could never do exactly what he wanted. He lost half of my assignments multiple times. He lost one of them after grading it & then gave me a lower score. He would only change this by one point.",0
Geraldine is one of a kind. Really wonderful.,1
Excellent professor. You'll learn a lot. He's just a nice guy and throws in a lot of pop culture and sports references in class to help keep you awake. His tests are fair and gives extra credit to help boost your grade. Definitely recommend him.,1
Do not take her speech class! She is a really hard grader! You have to dress up for the final and it has to be 13-15mins long or you will fail.  Avoid her at all costs! I passed with a C.,0
"She is not very understanding and she likes to think she knows everyone's life story, when it comes to personal issues. you are on your own. School wise she has no regard for people who are a bit slower and she often has a ""oh well that's too bad"" kind of attitude towards your issues.",0
"he is very humorous and he explains things fully, and has a good rapport with his students. i just didnt like the class material we did in this specific class.",1
"This is the worst class I have ever taken. The only available Comm 230 section was a 180 student lecture with Cindy White. Worst professor. Attendance is pointless because she goes so off topic and the Powerpoints do not help! Your grade is based off only 3 tests, not leaving you any room for mistakes. All she does it babble.",0
"Professor Stewart truly cares about his students, if youre struggling just ask him for help he wants you to learn. Theres a lot of homework and assignments and such but it all helps you learn the material.",1
This guy just loves himself. An interesting topic but all he wanted was to hear himself talk about leading the field. How does someone make a fascinating topic the worst? When its all about him. Exams were ok but lectures were torture. ,0
"Professor Stevenson, in my opinion, is one of the best professors at QU. She is so nice and very easy to schedule a meeting with if the information is unclear. Definitely take her if you get the chance!",1
I love this class!! You take a great deal of notes and exericise every class but it is worth it. I've lost weight and several inches of my waist already. Totally recommend this class for anyone that wants to be fit for life!!!,1
She is such a sweet person. Her class was pretty easy and she offers extra credit. She explains everything and stays after class for students who need help.,1
"He's really picky with what he's looking for especially with the map quizzes, but he still makes sure students get the help that's needed. His tests are open note and open book, but he tests you on the smallest details possible. As long as you put a little effort into studying, you should be fine.",1
"His lectures are boring. He tends to be behind schedule. But, he's friendly and fair with his deadlines.",0
plays favourites,0
"Richard seems like a smart guy, but his lectures are quite useless. You are better off learning everything by yourself and during the lab. He is all over the place, often just doing whatever is on the top of his head. Quizzes / midterms are not too hard if you practice the questions. Dont take this prof if you can",0
"Took his DLD class last spring, I stopped going to the lectures about halfway through the semester. Be prepared to teach yourself the subject matter, and use the old tests that he provides. Tests were about 60-65% of the final grade. The book the homework is out of has a free PDF online, but he gives you most of the HW answers anyways.",0
"This guy is absolutly terrible. The tests are not like the reviews, get ready for plenty of surprises!",0
"I took 202 and 241W with Gamm and he's truly a professor who deeply values his students' points of view. Though he assigns a lot of reading and is a tough grader, you will become a better writer for it. Utilize his office hours and don't be afraid to speak up.",1
"Good conductor, but he is very confusing at times. He s not interested to teach anybody that is outside of his little club, watch for that. In many instances he is acting very unprofessional.",0
Mrs. Brott was a very poor choice for a math professor. Never responded to any emails and was very hard to understand.,0
"Okay, so she may have been all of the good things people are saying about her at one point, but not anymore.  She does NOT give study guides, we do NOT work in groups, and everything is done with a new online software so she doesn't have to grade.  And we have at the very least, 3 homework assignments a week. Don't do it to yourself. Fair warning.",0
"Intensive content. You will definitely learn a lot provided that you read his note and reflect his lectures very carefully by doing homework problems. Though it is of great difficulty, at least his course does not waste your money on some materials that you probably have learned.",1
A very friendly and approachable teacher. This class for some reason made me fall asleep cause it was mostly common sense discussion about diplomacy. Exams are easy as he gives you a choice to pick 2/3 out of 7 questions. It's basically one question from each week of the semester. Just study three of the topics really thoroughly and you got an A.,1
Hard class. Grade compesed of many random assignments. Claims to use elearning but never grades work in time. I still do know 1/2 of my grades. Nice but not a easy class,0
Mental breakdown simulator. Except it's real.,0
Studied a lot but his tests are impossible to do well one. The tests ask little pointless facts. Everyone seems to do poorly on the exams. He gives no assignments other than exams. His lectures are extremely boring!,0
Very knowledgable teacher.  She has traveled all over the world so she speaks from experience and provides up to date information on what's happening in each part of the world in addition to how it will affect us.,1
"""Orderly"" is the right word for her.  She is an amazing personality, kindest person I know, and very witty.  The Oceanography class is interesting and she knows what she is talking about.  Pay attention and you'll learn something new and suceeed on the tests.",1
"Dr. Woods, we will miss you. Great guy, sense of humor, fun class...Nothing but good things to say. Good Luck with everything and enjoy retirement professor.",1
"Covered to much to fast, lacked substance",0
"Never gave a feedback, never clarify the assignment, never explain the assignment, reads way too much in class, the topic are outdated.",0
"She is very enthusiastic when it comes to giving her lectures. The problem is that she doesn't put ANY of her lectures online in colour, but has them in colour when presenting. It is very confusing when she mentions a colour slide and I am unable to see it. She doesn't finish her thoughts, and her slides are sometimes incomplete thoughts as well. ",0
"he has no idea what he's doing. i learned everything he knew about the subject, which was absolutely nothing. we received no grades throughout the entire semester, and i had no idea where i stood until the end. extensive homework assignments, suprise papers, in other words...don't take a class with this professor if you don't have to.",0
"Pretty interesting guy, though  he is very irritable if you don't know your stuff. Hard to understand in his lectures and teaches more abstractly than the other calc 2 profs, but his tests are not impossible. Personally, if you truly want to understand linear algebra, take him, if you want a quick A, take Morley.",1
"I dropped his class twice but I had to prove that I could endure it. When I walked out of his class I did not think I had learned something; I knew it! It was the best educational experience of my life. He is gone now, it has been a year but this is one teacher that helped prepare me for corporate America. I cried, I ate junk food but I made it!",1
"Good professor and nice guy. Do all the extra credit possible, it will save your grade. Show up to every class and participate. Class is not too difficult but has a lot of busy work. I would recommend taking Lead100 with a different professor if possible.",1
"Lots of folks don't like her, I can't understand why (perhaps they just don't like math or they don't try. I really enjoyed Dr. Menzel's demeanor and she was very willing to help.",1
"Dr. Schwartz is a great professor. He is tough, but he truly cares about the material. He has review sessions, responds to emails quickly and will help you if you need it. Put in the effort and you will do well. His test care challenging but so Anatomy is a hard class. Be prepared to study a lot.",1
Sweet Man but he speaks in Monotone and tends to steer off the subject often! Dont take him unless you are pretty good at Algebra !,0
"Dr. Reeder is amazing! She is personable, funny, and you can tell how she loves to come to class. The assignments and tests are fair. Take her!! You won't regret it ",1
Laura does not care about her students even though she pretends to. She needs to learn how to structure her course so that children are not being penalized for simply taking it. You are not only working to understand course content but fighting against the disorganization of the course. Please do better. Also stop talking about enactus.,0
It is unfortunate that the tests and quizzes ask about the smallest details in the readings. Almost every test and quiz we have written this semester has had to have questions omitted because he was testing on the wrong content. Midterm had 1/3 omitted and quizzes have had a few omitted / quiz. You can get an A if you are willing to study hard.,1
you will fail if you listen to her lectures and do the labs becuse 90%of the content comes from sources she tells you not to look at,0
"""More and more people, less and less land"". That's his motto throughout the semester. I absolutely love Mr. Pierce as a professor, take his class if you want to opt out of bio or chem. Also be prepared for a lot of stories, and to ""be behind"" in class. Best professor i had all semester, 10/10 would definitely recommend.",1
big ego thinks he knows all about music not VERY HELPFUL DOES NOT XPLAIN THINGS GOOD THINKS EVERYONE IS A MUSIC MAJOR AVOID HIS CLASS,0
Gave assignments with no direction and everything was subjective grading. You will probably be fine if he likes you but his style is ridiculous and i would never take him again. Was not an understanding guy and it was always his way or the highway.,0
"Machala is awesome -- very interested in students' opinions and opinionated himself. will go on hilarious rants and the accent only makes them better.overall clear, interesting, and a pretty easy grader.",1
"He really make algorithm very unclear. It is hard for you to study from his lectures. Please go to other materials, learn from greeks for greeks and other platforms. The lecture slides can then guide you the list of thing you need to know. But do not try to just rely on slides, you can not understand without very clear explanation.",0
"Very uninterested in his students learning and achievement, very interested in pushing his ideals onto students. Layout all over the place, marks seem to be given arbitrarily.",0
"Yue Laoshi is one of the best professors that I have had at RPI. She genuinely cares about her students and you can tell that she absolutely loves teaching. The class is not hard, per se, but very homework intensive. You have to study a lot and put a bit of time in to the course. If you think this will be an easy A, don't take a class with her.",1
Amazing teacher. Cares a lot about the class and wants everyone to pass. Also try to make the class interesting with some jokes. It's such an easy class if you go.,1
"Very respectful and easy professor. His lectures are very long, but the way he went about them I for sure take a class of his again.",1
Mrs. Young is so sweet and overall a great professor. Do the practice tests to help prepare for the real tests. If you do the homework youre probably going to pass.,1
"Great teacher, very clear and very helpful to students (you can email him at any time and he'll send you a response right away)",1
"I really liked him when I first had his class, but over the semester, I started to dislike his class. He knows what's he's talking about, but even in a class of 10 ppl, we still had a hard time hearing him. He graded very easily in the beginning and then graded really hard towards the end. He was nice, but I'm glad he was my last English professor.",1
"Kemp is a really good choice if you have to take an English class or even if you don't.      As for the reading, you do not have to read any of the books, Just try to read what he tells you to read and the specific excerpts he goes over in class. Funny dude and just a great professor.",1
"Out of all the sections Jeffs is the hardest, if you want to work and want to learn take Jeff otherwise, you are not going to have a good time and avoid.  The ones who want to listen to jazz this is for you.",1
"Professor Freed is a really nice person, but her grading is unbelievably hard. Assignments were unclear and difficult. I liked her as a person but I wouldn't recommend her class! Expected more on the papers than what she mentions on the assignment paper itself and in class.",1
"It's almost impossible to receive a reply to your email, even the quickest time will be more than 10 days! Also, the lecture is really unorganized, he will post the lecture for half a month on the last day of the term!",0
The best professor ever. I love this man. He really cares about student success and learning.,1
"Yes, you will need to work hard to succeed in her class, but she WILL make you a better writer if you don't sulk over your first few bad grades. She is odd sometimes, but she is so knowledgeable and does do a great job conveying her knowledge to students if you pay attention and do the reading before class.",1
Hard and boring professor. But teaches you nice.,1
Do not take this class or any classes where Cara Shelley teaches it. She is an unnecessarily tough grader and will fail you on your assignments without hesitation. There are only four grades that decide your overall grade and there is an essay that she will pick apart how terrible it is no matter how god you think you did. I do not recommend.,0
"Like the last IA rating, I am also preparing for law school because of this class. You can not miss these classes and the assignments are designed to make life easier when comparative papers come about. Very well organized! Very enthusiastic on the subject! The material can be difficult at times but is well worth it!",1
"Spontak's interests are purely in research, not in teaching.   He offered up a few in-appropriate comments on how 'this would pass here, but not at Berkley'...Nice guy, but he should be in an IBM lab somewhere",0
"This man is actively trying to discourage people from pursuing STEM fields. He's a terrible teacher, doesn't care about his students, and goes incredibly fast and gives us so much info to learn in so little time. You know it's bad when a Bio prof. makes Chemistry look easy. I don't think he cares about his job. Avoid taking his class if you can.",0
"I took Dr. Yang's class for Social Methods 1 aka Statistics for Sociology. She is a strict professor and I would recommend two things 1. sit in one of the front two rows 2. attend every class!!!! She is not tech-savvy and has a strong accent, keep all papers and info and bring a calculator! Go to her for help, she will not come to you!!!",1
"Decent teacher, but he was not understanding at all when I had a severe case of the flu and had to go to the ER on the day of a test. A doctors note from the ER was not enough for him to allow me to retake this exam. I spoke with the dean on this matter and applied for a grade appeal. I highly advise everyone against taking this class with Knox.",0
"I love English, I spend my free time writing and have always prided myself on my writing skills.  She made me hate this class. Her attitude towards her students is similar to 1st graders.  Her 101 class is pathetic and she only helps students that are basically failing instead of those that put fourth effort.  I don't recommend this to ANYONE!",0
One of the best professors I have ever had. I never liked math but she made it tolerable. Very caring and goes out of her way to help students.,1
"This is without a doubt the hardest class I've had yet. The amount of information he wants you to understand is astounding. Especially when you're taking it online and you are in an exccelerated class. Watched the lectures, read the text and gone over the slides. I wish this class was not required. Even people I know in the industry already laugh.",0
She is really nice and always willing to help!,1
He is SO BORING! His jokes are funny but it takes 2 hours for them to set in because you have to recover from the sleep zombie-like state that his lectures produce. He also doesn't finish sentences which makes his lectures difficult to follow,0
"Tries to make the material harder than what it really is. Gives absolutely no guidance on what material we should concentrate on, especially for physio lab. My advice: take Cognition lab!",0
"I could care less for Zevi. He knowingly keeps you in class past the end time. He doesn't grade or collect homework, but he expects you to do it. The book is outrageously expensive. His handwriting is a really bad, so its hard to read his feedback from exams/quizzes. For some reason he thinks calc 2 & 3 are prerequisites. Class was a waste of time",0
wost teacher i have ever had. he does not teach instead he shows videos every single day. ,0
"Not just an amazing teacher, but an amazing person too. She actually cares about the students. No problem is too big or too small for her. What a sincere and kind woman. Thankyou Judy!",1
"This class was extremely easy. As long as you do the work on time and follow the instructions you will get an A. Professor Lane is not my favorite professor, but he is not a bad professor by any means. His quizzes are super easy, the questions and answers come right out of the textbook.",1
"16mm 2 is time consuming, as you work on two movies out of the three that the class produces. Be nice to your peers and do what you can on set, it counts towards 30 percent of your final grade.",1
It's impossible to not understand what she is saying. She is plain awesome.,1
"Was worried about the class originally because it does not seem to be that exciting. He makes it well worth your time. You can see the passion he has for teaching, every time you enter the room. Highly recommend. He's so funny.",1
He is not a good teacher at all.  His lectures are terrible.  He talks rapidly and hardly ever restates important info.  Not to mention that his voice is a bit high pitched and gets annoying to listen to. Tests are usually over 6-8 chapters. He gives you study questions but that hardly narrows it down. Avoid getting him as a teacher.,0
"While I'd concede that she has a passion for it, she is at times irrational and ****y, and has on more than one occassion given her students rude glares.   My cumulative average should have come to an B+, but she gave me a B.   She grades unfairly, has an overpowering personality, and other teachers could achieve the same results with less sarcasm",0
Took for Calc 3.  Awful like a few other math professors.  I have a strong math background but he will still make you regret taking the course.,0
I'm not typically one to write bad reviews but this class was awful. I went to class everyday and did all the homework and still didn't do well. Test are very hard and are your only grades. Prof Morgan was not helpful or willing to accommodate struggling students. Class average for tests were between 30%-60%.,0
"I had Dr. Tiwari for Physics and Alg./Trig. This guy is probably the coolest professor on the campus. Last summer (2004), he protested in Charlotte about the war in Iraq, and was on the news for it! That's the kind of guy he is. You can literally go up to",1
If you need anything he is there for you. He loves his job and it shows. He wants people to succeed. I would take him again. There is no assigned homework in the class. ,1
"Dr. Crawford makes this class harder than it needs to be. While I ended up with a B in the course, I certainly had to work hard to earn it. Reading the text everyday, attending every lecture, and doing tons of practice problems help. His little quizzes aren't many questions so they can KILL your grade quickly.",0
"He really knows his stuff, but taking notes in class is really hard because of the handouts.  Its impossible to study from the notes in class, and the text isnt much help. Best way to study is do the practice problems on the website. Office hours were overcrowded and the TA's didnt have enough time to be particularly helpful to anyone.",1
Not impressed by this course. Only gave a 2 point curve and I needed 6. The tests were nearly impossible to study for. The curve is determined based on all sections which is unfair because different TAs teach different sections and they make the tests.,0
"great professor, you definitely learn a lot. I usually hate history classes but I loved this class. Definitely take him! I'm taking him for World History II later on.",1
"I highly respect her. Lecture was something I didn't want to miss, I enjoyed it a lot. Tests are the true test of your abilities, quite hard. Frequent and sometimes too much extra credit makes up for it. Ask questions, and answer questions for E.C.. I trust Dr. Mekik's knowledge. She is a very inspiring prof. I would recommend taking her courses.",1
"Dr. McCarron is a super smart guy, definitely knows what he is talking about. His lectures are actually really interesting with his enthusiastic personality and anecdotes. My only issue is that he just felt like a lecturer, not as much of an educator. CMNS 110 involves a lot of self-teaching, which isnt really his fault.",1
"Dr. Markham makes this class harder than it needs to be. She is extremely intelligent, but she isn't a very compassionate teacher. I was scared to ask questions because she would make people feel dumb if they did. Tests are extremely difficult, but final was manageable. Easy course material but very difficult with this professor.",1
"Dr. Bottomley is very passionate about being an Engineer.  She is so influential and she has really inspired me, as a girl, to engage in the profession and go against the female stereotypes.  I really enjoyed learning from her.  As for the class itself, you have a semester project to work on outside of class and you learn about cool stuff in class.",1
"He is a very enthusiastic teacher and loves what he does, but he is very difficult.  Even going to see him in his office doesn't always help and some of the tests have things on them that we went over very briefly rather than 3 times like other things.",0
She teach you how to think !Very good and very helpful prof.,1
Ms. Conleys class was probably the most entertaining class Ive attended at smc. She is so funny and her teaching style is fun. She can rush through power points at times and put some questions on the test that have nothing to do with what she taught. Although she does provide a lot of extra credit opportunities inside and outside of class.,1
She is a very good Professor with a kind heart.,1
"Unlike most classes, his lectures are pretty brief. Rather than discuss everything in detail, the lectures are pretty much just outline+highlight, and you must read the texts outside of class.  He give quizzes instead of assignments. Also two projects. He cares about the students, but to do well you must take a lot of initiative.",1
"This class is on you to learn entirely by yourself. Exams are about every 2-3 weeks and the powerpoints he posts dont help at all because he makes them so basic compared to the exams. Homework doesnt help your grade unless you dont do it, then it will drop your grade. If you are taking this with any other classes it will be hard to pass.",0
Horrible online teacher! Hated every second of it. Only gives two examples per subject when there are 10 different things to understand. I mostly taught myself and barely scraped by with a passing grade. Never EVER take this guy's class!,0
Awesome professor...very helpfull..,1
"Incredibly easy course, overall nice professor and honestly cares about her students. Not a lot of writing for a college writing course however.",1
"Doesn't teach very well and usually explains things poorly, but his notes are excellent.  Teaches straight from class notes.  Requires a lot of work outside class to succeed.  Attendance of TA's office hours is usually required to get a good grade on the homework.  If you put in a good amount of effort, a great grade is possible.  Slackers beware.",0
"every class all he does is write on chalkboard (EXTREMELY small font)after class I asked if he can write a little bigger as everyone around me was using their phone camera to zoom on the board.. his response ""no. your just gonna have to get a seat in the front"" I have perfect vision.. he doesn't care about your education or if you pass his class.",0
"Worst prof ever. basically learned from past experience in calc and the pre-class modules. she doesn't even teach the concepts at all, any student could go up there and teach the lecture more efficiently. she was my only option too so if you have no choice, make sure you study and find resources to teach yourself independently or you won't pass",0
"By far one of the worst and rudest profs that I have ever taken. Does not keep office hours appointments and is very condescending to anyone who isn't a scholar in calculus. Lots of homework and grading on ""major"" and ""minor"" exams is beyond confusing. Does belittle students during class if you ask a question.",0
"She's definitely the most condescending, rude, garbage prof I have ever had. Shes so patrionizing and sorry honey but if you are going to class with your hair electrocuted and hideous old navy sweats, go and fix your life. she can just drop out of unviersity because she is the worst educator. profs shouldnt make you feel dumb.",0
Quite possibly the worst professor I've taken at Rutgers. Took him last year for  Research Methods and thought that it was just the class that I didn't like. He ended up teaching this class last minute and has never posted a syllabus or graded assignments from two months ago. Makes jokes at the expense of any student with a different opinion.,0
"You can pass the class however there is an excessive amount of reading and her quizzes are opinionated, unclear, and worth a lot of your grade. She is completely inflexible and has no consideration for her students. She teaches in a manner that outright contradicts what she is teaching.",0
"Terrible class. Don't listen to the bootlickers here who give him good reviews. They would give him good reviews irregardless of class quality. Such a boring man. Doesn't use canvas. Ancient. Requires attendance. You'll never understand the dichotomy of being assigned one page papers but getting comments like ""insufficient content"". Save yourself.",0
Worst professor ever had in USC. He's really having a hard time explaining things not that difficult and tries to confuse students during exams/homeworks. Very inflexible on everything while having a whole bunch of unreasonable requests from his students.,0
"This prof was not helpful. He did would not answer my questions, and was not clear in what he wanted from me. When I expressed I had concerns about a project and some personal disabilities. He repeatedly directed me to the accommodated learning center (even after explaining to him I was already registered in the ACL) with no further explinations",0
take someone else.,0
Hard but good class,1
"Very disorganized, not helpful at all, you dont get to learn anything useful from this prof. I honestly dont know why he teaches. Avoid if you can!",0
"I had the best time of my life in Steve's classes. If you have a chance to take one of his classes, do it! You will not learn more about birds/natural history anywhere else. And I agree with the above comment, shame on Evergreen for not realizing what an amazing professor they had/have. Steve is awesome!",1
"While extremely intelligent, she expects too much and rewards too few. Her class is completely discussion based, so its critical to read all 150+ pages of journals for each class. Papers are graded harshly with horrible feedback. She clearly cares less about student progression and more about an immediate correct answer. Save yourself the trouble!!",0
"Overall this class covers A LOT of material. It is challenging and time-consuming. The lectures are very boring. Your grade is based on weekly quizzes, midterm, and final. Exams were through Examity online.",0
"Don't bother watching his lectures. Midterm questions are challenging, but they are copied and pasted from his study guide. I practiced only with his past midterms I could find online - ended up with an A-. Final exam was a bit easier; I basically memorized the slides and did a couple of past exams.",0
"I have had Dr. Chandler for four courses including honors courses. She goes above and beyond for everything a student could possibly need: letters of recommendation, fantastic feedback, helpful in the enhancement of learning even in extra-curricular activities, ex. offered teaching books to help with volunteer work.  ",1
"this guy RULES, so all you negative ppl can kiss AZZ!",1
He is a great prof but the lectures are really boring. The material is directly from the text book and the examples aren't that helpful. He's a really funny guy though.,1
"He's a funny guy but I deeply regret choosing him as a professor. His lectures essentially require you to be under the influence of some sort of drug to be able to come up with the answers and responses he is looking for. He isn't always willing to help you and he can be very circular in his discussions. Take a different class or teacher, please. ",0
she's really helpful and explains things really well. i don't know about the favoring guys things...i don't see it and i've had her 2 sem already. best one from my experience,1
"He is amazing professor , if you want to pass the class with A just take with him. He is very helpful and he try to answer all the student question.",1
"His accent makes him harder to understand; however, this wouldn't be the end of the world given support by intuitive lecture slides or whiteboard use. HE WILL NOT EVER TOUCH THAT WHITEBOARD. His class attendance went from a class of 300 to maybe 20 students showing up for the week before exams, and 10 before the finals crunch started. Demoralising.",0
"Best Professor I've had at GVSU.  His tests are easy if you know your information.  Very intelligent man, and is willing to help if you ask for it.  He will be missed greatly in anatomy land!!!",1
"Very intelligent in his field. If you want to learn I would advise to take his courses. His test are not a joke though. If you do not study, YOU WILL FAIL.",1
"Great dude, focused on helping freshman adapt to the engineering environment.",1
He lectures the entire time with no presentation. He doesn't put anything online for reference. He prints out everything and hands out about 10 to 12 paper documents every class which get very hard to organize. Tough grader. I went to him for help because I was struggling and all he told me basically was to work harder. No help whatsoever.,0
The tests are mostly multiple choice and very hard. Miss 3 of them and you are already at a C on the test.,0
"Melinda is good professor. She reads students work carefully and gives her suggestion. However, she is a tough grader. If you want to have a good score, make sure you spend a lot of time on this course.",1
This class was interesting but extremely boring at times. A lot of the material he covers isn't even on the exam! I came to class all the time and always took notes for the first exam and barely got a passing grade. 2 exams 50% each with extra credit. I got A's in all my other classes and barely passed this class.,1
"This professor is the worst. He comes up with definitions from the top of his head and tests you on them. He comes up with metaphors during his lectures and tests you on those. His tests are from 25 to 30 ESSAY QUESTIONS. You have 1hr 15min to finish. If you do not remember the metaphors and the material verbatim, you're screwed. DOT NOT TAKE! RUN!",0
"I'm considering minoring in CS because I loved this class so much. Leahy is probably one of the most patient and good natured people I've ever met. He did a great job explaining things to nonmajors; I think I got frustrated with the other students more than he did. My CS friends say he's always like this too, though their classes are actually hard.",1
He is a terrible professor. Talks about random stories and tries to crack jokes. Will not help you if you are struggling but admires the super smart kids. Don't take accounting 2 with him.,0
"Great teacher and man, well respected fun class, very knowlegeable on subject",1
"Her class is not suitable for beginners. The instructions for assessments are not clear. The focus points on each class hard to follow. Unreasonable time management for each project. Hard to communicate. Useless feedback. When you ask her a question, her feedback is not what you asking, her feedback is what she wants to say, and this is not",0
This guy right here might possibly be the worst professor to step into the state of Delaware. I would recommend that all costs to never ever take this class with Crissinger. The most dull and boring classes of all time. Test are had and there are no curve. HW quizzes hardest thing. Highest fail rate for a class I have ever seen. Don' do it. Please!,0
First off he's very particular about the language you use when doing projects for the class. Although the guidelines are there for syllabus it's still hard to get a good grade on the projects. Should make the projects more clear.  Lots of vocabulary for a math class to know. Uses his own textbook which doesn't have solution in it for you. ,0
"BIOL 225 is pure garbage and a complete waste of time. No one should have to sit through a 150 minute lecture, especially when Dr Princehouse doesn't even pretend to care about teaching the class. There isn't even a real syllabus. She studied under Steven J Gould at Harvard for Gods sake. At least it's easy.",0
"Sophie is extremely incompetent and feeds her ego by marking her student unnecessarily hard. She is malicious, vindictive, and not mention, EXTREMELY disorganized. She gets flustered easily and doesnt care about students. The WORST prof at Ryerson and she should not be in the position she is right now. Sophie doesnt even have her PhD.",0
"He is a nice person; however, he is a terrible professor. He sits at his desk and reads straight from the book in English. The class was a waste of time overall, I am literate, I could just as easily read aloud from the book and gain the same understanding. Also, it is very difficult to get above an A- in his class. He gives a lot of A (-)s.",0
Professor Shannon will tell you one thing is acceptable but will take it back the next class and totally forget she said anything about it. I sat down with her for an APA formatted paper to make sure I had everything correct because it was my first AP paper. she told me everything looked great then proceeded to mark me down on my formatting.,0
The Goat,1
"Excellent prof.  Super clear.  Material is hard and the course moves really fast, but he's really good at teaching it. Spent a saturday in the lab helping people finish up projects.",1
"He's the NICEST most KIND HEARTED, enthusiastic, knowledgable prof out there. I could not imagine a better history teacher. His excitement about the Ancient Middle East was SO engaging! I truly enjoyed learning in his class. He truly cares about his students and their success. The exam was BEYOND fair with an extensive outline! TAKE HIS CLASSES!!!!",1
Solid prof.,1
not alot og good to say about this class. Alot of busy work that requires too much time for a gen ed class. She openly embarrasses students that give wrong answers. Takes forever to grade assignments. you have about 12 assignments in progress at once very confusing. Poor time management. the only positive thing is if you do the work you will dook,0
"Lovely women,  but her class is definitely difficult. Get used to her accent fast because she breezes through class time with tons of information. forgets about quizzes she offers to make up on a test questions most of the class gets wrong so remind her.  Print out review sheet she gives to use during class. You can find the textbook online!",1
Bigot. If you are white you ain't right. Dismissive of points of view that do not agree with the standard militant african-American pap.,0
"i did well in this class but really, she is a very mediocre teacher and an ideologue",0
She is kinda hard but almost lets you cheat in a way. The comments without a doubt on here are a little harsh i did very well in her class as did the others around me we did work very hard but that's what it takes sometimes.,1
"worst . prof . ever . i am not kidding you have been warned & if you can swap the course you need with a different prof, please do it",0
Professor Busch is a professor who likes online assignments but they are super helpful. He likes talking in Spanish so prepare to talk. He also loves having you watch clips in Spanish and then have you write essays on what happened. He even had us work with language partners in order to talk in Spanish easier.,1
"Terrible teacher, barely even teaches the basics. Why he attempts to teach mathematics is beyond me. I've heard good things about his MIS classes but otherwise he's probably the worst teacher at the school. He'll skip chapters that you need to understand in order to do course work and",0
"Dr. Peck is so genuine. He truly cares about each and every one of his students success and well-being. Hes a geeky sort of funny and he keeps lectures interesting. The tests arent too difficult as long as you study, and the study guides are really helpful. He provides a lot of extra credit opportunities too. Love this guy.",1
"What she teaches in class is interesting, however she sometimes she does put you on the spot. Her tests have NO relation to what is taught in class. Seems to have little direction in her lectures (no wonder she hates power points).",0
Learning with Trim online was up and down. Perks: his videos made it easy to review lectures and he's so passionate about what he's teaching that it's fun to watch. Downside: we never really got to interact with him other than email because he couldn't figure out zoom or anything. I always find math tough but this was a bit harder than normal.,1
"the professor was very helpful. She made the class interesting and is willing to help students. She answers any questions. Her class is made up of quizzes, and discussions. It is recommended to show up to every class for notes. Quizzes are based on the lectures. She is a great teacher. I would recommend students to take her class.",1
"I love Serva! He is an overall great guy and an amazing professor. This was my 3rd class with him and it was just as I expected. He is tougher than some other professors, but you will actually learn. This course is one of the most difficult ones, but he does his best to help you. 2 tests and a final project are the main grades.",1
"She is such a sweet woman, but her grading scale is ridiculously hard. The papers that were assigned had nothing to do with what was covered in class, which made the classes seem useless to attend. If you're looking for an easy A, do not take this class. I had done very well in English during HS, but she sure showed me that college is different.",0
2 essays. 3 Online exams. 1 in class final worth 20% of your grade. You have to go to class to pass. Takes attendance. Weights everything in his class. And is very anal in the way you have to use the course site. WOULD TAKE ONLINE!!!,0
"She has a heavy accent, and skips out on some words that are important to the understanding of the material. She teaches very quickly and assumes you understand. Also assigns homework before she teaches the material and gets angry when we do not understand. Overall extremely aggravating.",0
"He is very helpful and makes chemistry understandable. If you are having any troubles with his class, he will help you as long as you ask!",1
"Taken online (covid)Easiest GE I have taken and professor Yeager is caring and passionate about music. Weekly tests that are worth 2 points and 2 papers at the end of the semester that are each worth 11 points or 25% each. He doesn't take late work but I put minimal effort into the class, quizzes took me 10 min per week. Easy GE I highly recommend!",1
"She sets a very distinct criteria from beginning of semester. Tests are hard&worth a lot. She curves down for her tests so if you get a 100 on the test after the curve it will be significantly lower if the curve is large. She did not seem understanding when I emailed her about a personal issue, hw on mindtap for every chapter. Not an easy A",0
"Great Prof, love his final lesson! BIG RESPECT!",1
"Dr. Travers was my very first professor back from my SFU days and it's only in hindsight that i can reflect on how much brainwashing there was? Rather than focusing on sociology we were literally told a million times over that there are no biological differences between women + men in sports, which is obviously untrue and is harmful to women+girls",0
Ms. White was a good teacher and really knew how to make the learning environment fun. The only issue for me is there was only 3 exams and that was your grade. Personally Im not a big fan of that style of grading. Other than that she is a great teacher. ,1
"Great guy. He is very quiet, so I would recommend sitting as close as possible. Assignments are very clear, and most tests are take-home. He curved grades too. Kind of dull material. You will do fine if you put in a little bit of effort, and come to class (kind of) regularly.",1
"First of all,if one of his accomplices in the Eng Dept doesn't like you,you'll have a difficult time in his class, even if your papers make it abundantly clear that you grasp the material and can extrapolate it(pretty much true throughout the dept).If you arrive in class with no such baggage, you stand a chance, a slim chance. Suck up.",0
Just the nicest lady ever. Honestly don't really have to go to class as long as you keep up in the text. Exams are all multiple choice and she tells you how to prepare. Can also fall behind and prioritize other classes if you catch up on the reading in time for quizzes and exams. Great combination of easy class in which I actually learned a lot.,1
"Actually a great prof once you get past his hard accent. Don't skip class because he writes stuff on the board which is very useful. Do good on the midterm and do the assignments, and the exam should be a blast. Use the textbook, do the questions related to the topic and you should be fine for 1025.",1
Horrible. She's borring. Teachers her textbook. Cant understand her. Would not recommend her at all,0
"Bolster is very knowledgeable in his field and elaborates beyond the slides so I recommend attending class and reading the textbook for the more complex topics (don't buy the new version if you don't have to, old editions are just as good). His tests are very fair, allows you to choose between multiple questions for short answer",1
"Good prof, seems to be into what shes teaching, interested in helping us learn",1
"Brooklyn style grit and wit. 1/3 - 1/2 of lecture is information dense, the rest is meant to help you find what interests you by showing many many many pictures of animals.",1
"By far the best professor I have ever taken (especially at Stockton), period. There is a fair amount of work, all of it was relatively easy. This professor is amazing, a true asset to the university. She made poetry interesting and fun, she cared about us, treated us to lunch for our final, and the outreach portion was extremely fulfilling.",1
"Show up to lecture and you will pass. 410 is not easy, and frankly the material is dry. But from my experience, he has and will give you answers (or insanely large hints) towards exams & projects during lecture. Besides this, I think of him as one of the more respected teachers in the department. He knows his stuff; only the best for students.",1
Wow this prof. is the most boring and uninteresting teacher I have ever had imagined. His class is simple and straight forward. 60 pointless journals about whatever you read and discussions. 2 Midterms and a Final. Daily quizzing on reading material 10 pts per.,0
"This class requires a lot of self discipline and study. As long as you study everything she covers and keep up with the assignments, youll do fine...bio major or not. Debby was very helpful and even met with me a few times to go over some tough material. Shes willing to make time for her students and if you put forth the effort, youll get the grade",1
He is great teacher but hard at times and doesn't really correct you as much as I would like.,1
"Unhelpful, very insincere, and is not empathetic of students in the slightest. Very strict hand in time, very rude emails, and will completely blame students for eclass crashes, even if they are out of student control.",0
Dull. His notes are all confusing and messy. He has a way of making a simple concept seem confusing. Never responds to emails and is unorganized to a point where it hurts the students.,0
"Great prof and I highly recommend her. Thermo is hard but she teaches it well. If you have any issues, she or a TA will gladly help. Do the homework or passing her already hard tests will be nearly impossible, but the homework isn't that bad and the amount is good.",1
"Nice guy, wants to do examples but gets sidetracked and forgets to finish example. His test are dialed down from material covered.  Overall, class is bs and shouldn't be required to graduate!!",0
"I took a PDE course with this guy a while ago. The course basically turned into a physics course. The guy is a mathematical physicist pretending to be a mathematician and gets visibly agitated when you ask him to provide more rigour/details for a result. The guy basically lectures himself instead of the students and thinks he's ""intuitive"".",0
"I had to retake this class after completing it in another program with another teacher and revived an A but with Nella she gets personal grudges and if you give her the wrong impression she will set you up to fail, Im shocked I even passed as she goes back and changes your grades if she feels you no longer deserve that grade. Horrible teacher.",0
Dr. Miura did not give a single lecture during this COVID-19 pandemic and was extremely hard to reach during these hard times and during the normal semester. He is not specific nor clear in his grading criteria and when asked for feedback he takes very long to give answer back. Lectures are long and boring! Do not take his class!,0
"I took 2 years of Spanish in middle school, 3 years in high school, and she was my first professor for my first college Spanish class. Honestly, thought she was a really good, clear professor. Yes, the class could be hard sometimes, but she was very helpful during lectures. Partner work was annoying, and the quizzes could be hard, but good overall.",1
"Potter is a very knowledgeable and intelligent prof.  Cons: Assigns a ridiculous amount of reading, is not always as clear as he could be, exams are looong. Pros: great at initiating interesting class discussions, coursework is practical, looong exams are reflective of readings and class discussions, I learned a lot.",1
"Midterms were short/long answers that were given before time, but only had 50 minutes to complete in-class. 50% of your grade was based on sentence structure and grammar which was not reasonable for period of time given. The topics were interesting but her slides are disorganized and have some outdated stats.",1
"Worst English class Ive ever taken. Gardner is great personality wise, although hes a VERY tough grader. He had very unclear and harsh grading expectations. There were only a few high stake assignments. Participation also matters. Do not take this class if you want to keep your GPA.",0
"HATED THIS CLASS! Horrible group D. Think he forgot this was an intro class.  For final review session had the review time options DURING OTHER EXAM TIMES! Forget the review sheet too, just easier to read the darn book because he is going to make you go through it all anyway. If not a science person do not take.",0
"Great professor, makes the content interesting! It's hard to organize a class with over 3000 students but he did a great job!",1
"lol. i wouldnt recommend him to anyone.he came to lecture prepared like 2 or 3 times all quarter. nobody ever finishes his exams. average scores out of 100 points on two exams. 40 and 44 for the whole class.he always gets stuck during lecture on problems. never any solutions or answer keys.hes really smart, just really easy to get lost in lecture",0
Scatterbrained & unorganized.,0
Hes horrible,0
"He is a fine man in class but the assignments are horrible and the structure of the course is confusing. I know it was not him who build the course outline but he should reformat everything to make the course better. He knows it is bad, he knows it is confusing, but he does nothing. My only B+ in a sea of As.",0
Very spiteful and hateful prof. His lectures are dull and boring. If he doesn't get his way he will make sure you are miserable and it shows how unprofessional he is as a professor. Will definitely never take another class with him ever again.,0
"get on his good side, if he likes you he will grade you much easier and if he doesnt like you you...well...to bad",0
"All English Literature and Linguistics students should take this course. Yes, it's a math class, but its focus (cryptography) gives a look into language from a different perspective. Wells' teaching style walks you through some difficult problems; he is always available for help. Just don't jump into this course without reviewing old math skills.",1
"Just don't. The first day of class he'll tell you that his passing rate is very low. I thought I would be ok as math is my favorite subject.. but no. You're not learning how to do the actual math here, he gets frustrated easy when there's too many questions because he goes so fast and doesn't make sense. uses a horrible textbook that hardly helps",0
"She's really got her heart in it. Canvas quizzes- you will do poorly. They are hard. All group activities. It sucks when you have a bad group. Easy in class activities and quizzes. Let's you do corrections. She's unorganized and takes awhile to put grades in, but i'm giving her a 5 because she deserves a better score overall.",1
"Boring as heck...nice guy though, easy grader",1
"never ever ever, EVER, take bio 120 with him. guaranteed failure. plenty of other good professors to choose from here besides him",0
This was probably one of my least favorite classes. I felt like his tests were extremely unfair and difficult.  He didn't really have too much homework and there were periodically reading quizzes.  The tests made up most of the grade which made it hard to do well.,1
"I genuinely loved Professor Coolidge! She is clear about all her assignments. You know exactly when you will have a quiz or paper due, however there is a TON of reading.",1
"One of the best professors i've had so far at York. He's absolutely brilliant, and if you get the chance to talk to him personally, he really makes an effort to get to know you. He makes everybody feel worthy of his time, and i can only wish that more professors took notice of his interaction with his students. (Plus his class was really easy.)",1
"he's clearly a great semantics/syntax professor, but he really takes it to a level of depth that's a bit inappropriate for an introductory course. his lectures are very dry, and you will have to relearn everything yourself. would avoid him for 201, but i imagine he's an amazing professor if you find yourself drawn to his area of specialty.",0
I thought I knew a lot about computers but the class covers so much that I was surprised at how much I learned.,1
"Dr. Sobhi is a pretty good Chem professor. He seems intimidating at first, but he's not so bad. He is fair with his grading and gives partial credit for trying. Some lectures were dry, but I was able to stay pretty engaged in class. He poses questions and uses examples to get you thinking. I had to retake CHEM 131 and I'm glad I took it with him.",1
"intersting info, but boring prof. knows her stuff, but every example is about household stuff. only 3 tests the whole semester so each is on about 25 pages of notes. study from the text, too. tests are tricky because there's so much to memorize, so start studying about a week in advance. also gives one paper which is an easy A if you're thorough.",1
"His lectures are very interesting, engaging and hilarious. He is always willing to see students about questions on papers or just lecture context, which is super helpful. Overall, he's a super approachable, nice prof. ",1
"All she's doing is reading powerpoint slides. Rarely are there class discussions to help make the class a bit more interesting. I took her Japanese Film class, and as a film major whose taken courses on cinema history, I expected clips or movies to be shown as well. However, rarely was anything shown.",0
"The notion is that he never clears up his grading criteria. When you ask him how he will grade, he just say I curve it. He never cleared up the criteria or else I had gotten B+ at least. There are lots of good, kind, and caring professors around the campus.",0
"Dr. Wetton is really a good professor. You can find his systematic thoughts from his online notes. Also a hilarious guy, give math terms funny names and make fun of board games. One flaw: He concentrates a little bit too much on concepts, you may have to do more exercises after class.",1
"Professor McCall is a charming old man (late 80s) who's been doing philosophy for ages. I had him in a very small class (15 people) on a subject which he loves (Time). At this very personal level, he was extremely friendly. His marking is very fair if you show the slightest interest in his work. Take a class with him before he retires!",1
He is absolutely useless and he barely knows what he is talking about sometimes. Should probably retire by now,0
"As long as you do your excerpts every day, you should be able to do well.  Overall I learned a lot more than I thought possible. Excellent teacher with amazing and interesting lectures.",1
"The class was fun. Prof. Goldner a bit of an awkward lecturer, but he clearly knows his stuff. He assigned 4 (pretty interesting) books to read, and you need to write a short essay for each of them, but he drops the lowest grade and grades pretty nicely, so you can get away with skipping one if need be. Tests are mostly multiple choice. Easy A.",1
I took this course Spring 2013 via video stream. The instructor deducted points for not attending onsite. This is an instructor who should retire. Fails to post any grades online or go over exam results. Text book is used as secondary reference you need to only know the slides and lecture material. Try to take a different instructor.,0
Great real world experience not theoretical,1
"Monty rules. Fun teacher, committed to the students. His courses usually cover some in depth stuff so they are not easy, but you get a good education from him.",1
"If you're taking this class simply for general ed he's a good choice. You might learn a bit and will easily get a A, but if you, like me, want to pursue Journalism or any related field then I would suggest another professor. I did not learn anything from his class which is a shame. He is a cool dude but this class wouldn't be well suited for all.",1
"He's amazing. Online class, however he's very willing to help via in person or over the phone  if you make an appointment. Class consists of weekly papers that involve reading primary texts, summarizing them and then analysing them. There are class discussions where you post on d2l and respond to students on a weekly basis also. Good professor!",1
"Different philosophical readingscture weekly w/ 1pg summary about it due. Points for attendance, participation, and showing summary. Partnered debate about harsh topics EX:abortion, environment. Diff topic 5pg paper due. Final exam is summarizing 3 phil. views and 1 debate topic with defining phil. words. Gives extra credit work weekly.I ENJOYED",1
"Dr. Neustadter is very knowledge, but definitely makes you work for your grade. I studied a ridiculous amount to get my A. There are only four tests in the whole class and no study guides. Not going to lie- it is a very difficult course, but I made it out with an A so it is doable. If you show up and try, you shoudn't get lower than a C.",1
"His tests are hard and very application based, but he tends to follow the same format every year. Tip: do the multiple choice last when writing tests. Prepare for quizzes, on which you generally get either 100% or 0%. He likes to talk though and will gladly meet with you to work through problems- it may not seem like it but he wants you to do well.",1
C-clearly the best; A-amazingly brilliant; T-totally the tops; H-hillllllarious; Y-you need to take a class of hers. now.,1
Very easy if you read the text and take notes. He always puts an outline on the board that goes with the reading to make it easier to understand. You get 3 absences and tests are easy if you study. He really seems to care about students needs and he gives a lot of examples so u understand. I would take him again.,1
boring lecture..! too long ..! attendance is mandatory ...! can't leave class until he says so.! even he has taken your attendance many more things likes this,0
"Incredibly boring, treated students like elementary kids, accent was nearly impossible to understand at times, not very understanding or reasonable.",0
"Price is a solid teacher who really cares about computer science and the development of his students. While the lectures are usually great, the homework, especially the later ones, can get extremely tedious and unnecessarily confusing. However, its still a good class. I would not recommend for non-comp sci majors, however. I've heard that's rough.",1
"I feel that he was a very clear-cut instructor. He asks questions to keep you involved, and was willing to explore different scenarios to better understand each philosopher. He offers a lot of extra credit, is clear about what will be on tests and finals, and is very easy to work with. One of my favorite professors.",1
"I sleptskipped every single lecture day.  All you need to do is fill out the study guides provided and you are golden.  Towards the end of the semester I was able to fill them out more during the actual lecture which was nice.  Don't wait to do the quizzes and writing assignments, the writing assignments require some time!",0
Dawes is a genuine guy. He's clearly incredibly passionate about what he's teaching and it shows. He'll explain why material is legitimately fascinating rather than just presenting it.,1
"He takes down valid class information beofre it had even been up for a wekend, leaving anyone who hasn't copied it down in time because they were busy behind the rest of the class.",0
"You would almost have to try to not pass her 304 class. She talks about people that she knows a lot, but it's to ground the material that she's covering. If you've passed your English Comp. classes, just show up and you'll do fine.",1
"HARD class. Very subjective- what he would tell one class would be different from the other (and in class to on tests). Even if what you said was right, he would count it wrong if there was something more right in his eyes. Everything is about Argentina. He is a nice buy, but a tough grader. Quizzes daily. Some homework. 3 Tests and a Final. ",0
His class (Ethics) is incredibly boring--both the books and the lectures.  I learned a lot more in my high school philosophy & ethics classes.  Do not take this class with Conee.,0
"Great professor who knows his stuff, brings stories in from his own life of being a journalist and a lawyer. Learned so much! Good class if your interested in the law too.  Always willing to help!",1
"She will prepare you for college writing.  Go to class, do your work, and act interested.  If you make progress with your writing, you will be OK.",1
"I had to switch time slots and ended up in his class. I'm so glad I did. It's such an easy class and the tests were super easy you just need to show up to class (his online notes are pretty scanty). I never missed a class because weirdly enough i found this course so informative. I just wished he put more stuff in his notes, it's so hard to keep up",1
"Horrible Prof. Mumbles everything, sets up his office hours so it's impossible to get help, if you don't understand the question he repeats it rather than phrasing it differently.  That being said, do the Homework, get an A. The study guides he hands out, are just the tests with a few more questions tacked on.",0
"She was not a friendly person and giving everyone that feeling that she was seeing teaching as an errand for herself. Otherwise, she may know her stuff but knowing and teaching a class are completely different things.",0
Monotone voice will surely put you to sleep.,1
Such an interesting person.,1
Worst professor I have ever had. Utterly terrible in every regard. Disrespectful to students. ,0
"A teacher or a machine?yes, a machine",0
He assigns multiple online assignments in a week. (might be too much for full time students) This week for example: 1. Homework from the ebook: Multiple mcgrawhill assignments 2. Pros and cons/ Compare and contrast Discussion board AND you have to respond to others. 3. Six paragraph research assignment basically #2 AGAIN. BUSY WORK BUSY WORK,0
"She is hard, and she doesn't care about your understanding. I am taking this class again because I didn't understand the first time. I would never take it with her again.",1
"As a French major, I had Dr. Smith for many classes.  She was brilliant in every single one.  She presented an outstanding syllabus, created engaging discussion and lecture, and offered a sympathetic and helpful ear for any questions.  She was tough, fair and inspiring. She is a remarkable force at K.",1
"Love his lectures, you will feel the time goes so fast. The material for final exam is accumulative, 3 exam total. If your final exam's grade is better than any one of your previous exams, you can swap the grade. Oh! The full score of his exam is not 100, it is 51 for the first two, 52 for the final. Anyway, he is the best instructor ever !!",1
"She has an accent which makes it hard to understand her sometimes. Her lectures can be pretty boring too, but overall she is a good teacher and perhaps the best Econ teacher you could get. If you just do your part of studying and doing the homework (which aren't hard at all) then you'll be guaranteed to pass.",1
"This was hands-down the most intellectually rewarding class. Be prepared to work hard, but everything you'll learn in this class is fundamental and inspiring. He does a great job of presenting moral questions from an unbiased standpoint and allows you to respond from your own point of view. I'm so upset that the class is over, great proffessor!!",1
Funny and engaging. Don't care which section you signed up for but find out his time slots and attend his sections. You won't be sorry.,1
"Rude, hard exams and hard assignments. Avoid if you can.",0
"The lectures themselves were easy to understand. here comes the bad part: VERY LITTLE guidance and clarity given on the labs themselves, lack of clarity on the rubrics and organization is basically nonexistent. Conflicting information coming from the lectures, personal office hours, and from the TAs. Very disorganized, unhelpful for online!!",0
"Lectures were quite confusing/unorganized. The course did not follow a specific book, so it was difficult to study off of the unclear notes taken in class. Midterm and Final were very fair. Assignments were very difficult especially if youre not familiar with MATLAB. Nice guy, friendly personality! More organized lectures would be appreciated.",1
"Before I took this class, I heard he was not a good prof and I should witch out, however after finishing the semester, I can't tell why I was told this. He explains the concepts well and cares about students learning. His lectures can be boring at times, but if you take good notes, skim the textbook and think critically, this course will be great.",1
"Shes a nice lady, but not the best teacher.  Most of the time our class had no direction.  A lot of people just never came.",0
"This prof was quite lazy to say the least, his 'lecture slides' were quite vague and you basically have to teach yourself to understand it. He has three things due in the class which have nothing to do with course material so there is no point even reading them. Would have like to see this prof engage more with his students, waste of money.",0
"Anyone who says he's a good lecturer, must have had a different prof. He's boring, condescending and vague about things like what's on the exam for no reason. He never recorded his lecture for no reason and never wanted to help us in any way. Snobby and pompous",0
"He talks about himself a lot, & his organizations. Seems ignorant and didn't spend much time teaching.",0
"Prof. Neff is amazing! A truly wonderful guy. His class is interesting and he loves open-ended class discussions. Readings are engaging and he makes everyone more open to talking together. A kind, funny, exceptional person and professor.",1
Great professor for what could have been a nightmare class but was not because of her teaching methods!,1
"If you want to feel like a failure, take this class... Tests are nearly impossible, and the lectures are nothing like the tests. The only reason my class passed is because of all the extra credit. When the whole class fails, the teacher will blame you for not trying, instead of making adjustments. Professor refuses to review before tests.",0
"Mr. Colby is the roughest and most subtly arrogant teacher I've had. There is too much work considering most of us are taking 15-18 hours, and even on snow days he'll assign more work because he thinks you have more time. Don't bother asking him a question or email him because it is no help. If you want to pass you have to have a lot of spare time.",0
"This teacher is great at lecturing and a wonderful easy going teacher.  However there was never much clarity provided on expectations of writing essays on tests and grades were given very late so the chance of rebuttle was slim to none.  Also, there is too many chapters combined for one test (10) to be exact you are cramming the entire semester",0
"This professor did absolutely nothing the entire time because this class is conducted on an online server. It is essentially Microsoft Office 101 and is incredibly boring and easy. I would have skipped often if he wasn't such a stickler for attendance, and I'm sure I would have still got an A. If you have the opportunity to take it online, do it.",0
"What a catastrophe. Vague, unfair grading policy and completely unappreciative of students who are willing to go the extra mile and do extra work. She bases your total grade on 2 papers and 2 tests, for which her feedback makes no sense and doesn't help. Why criticize my rhetoric in a PoliSci paper, this isn't English Comp. Terrible! Wouldn't take!",0
"Paul is an absolute legend; I cannot describe how much I love this guy. He's an amazing prof with very straight-to-the-point lectures. The class is review of 11 and 12 chem so it's extremely easy if you know the basics. As well, he is extremely accommodating and took the best 3/5 quizzes giving partial marks. Wish he could teach me my whole program",1
"She talks in circles most of the time, reads from a paper and obviously isn't comfortable with public speaking. Rarely looks at the class, except when she asks a question she finds interesting,annoying voice, weird attire. Completely oblivious to her students' activities during class. She also tends to laugh at phallic references and sex jokes.",0
Dr. Sigler brings professional enthusiasm to the educational experience. Students will be confident in his understanding of course content matter and will learn a lot. He is serious about teaching but also genuinely has a good time with his students. Dr. Sigler requires a high output from his students who in turn reap rich discoveries.,1
"very nice guy, made me change the way i perceive the world and appreciate things we take for granted. tries to keep class interesting but exams were ridiculously lengthy and hard. clicker quizzes on textbook readings that i had trouble with even after doing the reading, and not many opportunities to bring up your grade. Absences affect grade",1
Superb prof - makes genetics easy to comprehend!,1
"Is that right? OHHHHHHHH? Be prepared to ""mudpie"" your GPA by 0.5 because this is what Yun Gao will do to you.",0
"One of the best professors I ever had. Doesn't curve but he drops the lowest quiz grade, so if you study and put in effort you'll be fine. Does many examples of problems on the board. Gives group quizzes so if you don't get something someone in your group might. Easiest math class I ever took. He takes attendance. Homework is on webassign & is easy",1
Makes a lame topic even more difficult to understand.  Wanders around the topic without really getting to the point.  Makes a lot of mistakes in class.  Teaches the topic in such a way that made me hate Finance even more.  Is not very organized.,0
didn't care about student understand or not. many tests and didn't have time to ask he question.,0
"He's the best science professor. His lecture notes are only seen in class, so you do have to take notes to be prepare for his exams. He will slow, if you tell him he is going fast. His exams are fair, a lot of topics for sure(but interesting topics) if you study his study guides there will be no surprises on the exam. he will help you, if you ask",1
"he was great! many classes, thought every class was worth it. learn a vast knowledge of information besides art history. he is quality.",1
"Most incoherent prof I have ever had, and I regret taking him. He just shows videos, can't teach. He has no degree related to what he teaches (check KPU faculty). Do not take him.",0
Heather is very dedicated in her role as director of clinical training and will absolutely go out of her way to ensure student success. Wonderful person to have in your corner.,1
"His notes are harder to follow than his name is to say.  Abysmal notes, long tedious assignments, very boring lectures.  He emphasizes everything he says making it very difficult to understand the main points of the lecture.  The class does not follow the textbook by any means, formulas and variables are different.",0
"I would definitely recommend this professor for CHM 102. Professor Baum made this class exceptionally easy, and as long as you do your online assignments its an easy A. He also allows test corrections for half points back on all exams. He rarely takes attendance, but showing up will definitely make tests easier. Great professor overall!",1
Coach is great.  He has a great energy and if you are in class every time and paying attention things should make sense.  He is good at explaining things multiple times in different ways.  Lecture style is powerpoints which he puts online and it is very helpful.,1
Dr. K is an absolute great teacher! Is very helpful and gives students plenty of practice so they know the material not just to pass the tests but to carry on throughout life. Super nice and laid back but has no tolerance for phone use. Will definitely be taking her again!,1
Clark knows her stuff! I love to hear her talk about all the things she knows on a particular topic. She is a little harsh on grading in my opinion though,1
"Marc is one of the most self-centered people I have ever met. Most of the class time is spent listening to him talk about his career and experiences. He fails to teach most of the material and I did most of my learning by reading the book and attending ""review"" sessions held by the TA. He routinely shames students in front of the class for talking.",0
"Tried to go into her class w an open mind but everything on this profile is true. Shes disrespectful, patronizing, has a fill in the blank style lecture & expects you to finish her sentences with terms and insults the class when we have no idea what shes getting at, her grading is ridiculous. Youll never know when hw is due. UA should fire her.",0
"Great method for exams, sends via email. As similar to normal as possible. Lecture would have been fun in person based off his descriptions of what they did. Lab is factored in and not separate. Homework is WileyPlus and is a pain; it's too time consuming and picky. He is kind if he recognizes you are a hard worker.",1
I had him for Physics 2 Lab. He's an awful teacher. He only helps people who are already great at physics 2 and doesn't care about the rest who he decides are stupid. Im hard working and do well in my engineering classes but physics 2 I had trouble with. He didnt help and spoke to me like I was worthless. Hes a crotchety old man and needs to retire,0
great professor great guy - no matter what the negative comments say,1
"RUN. Nice demeanor, however she is new to teaching. Requires odd-ball assignments no one has ever done or heard of. Does not really know what she is doing at times. WRITING INTENSIVE!! Group project/PowerPoint, textbook reading, 20+ pg *purchased* case studies, and Memos all expected all to be worked on at the same time.",0
"Horrible class, makes you do everything on your own and assigns homework every freaking week.",0
"Never showed up to class on time. Don't expect papers back for a long time. She's a complete mess. Super nice woman, but avoid at all costs.",0
"I took a summer class with him and it was great. There were so many opportunities to get extra credit and as long as you pay attention in class and do the readings, the quizzes and tests aren't that hard. I literally didn't write the essay which was worth 14% of my grade and still got an A off all the extra credit I got.",1
"Had Dc. Drew this pass semester (fall). His teaching skills are very old. No power point, simply notes on a word doc. No study guides youre on your own. Extra credit is available though. Hes not a fan of laptops but you can use them. He gets off topic very easily so that can be a little annoying at times.",0
"You'll either love or hate his style.  He just hands out worksheets and expects you to learn on your own.  Really laid back and funny guy, but he just can't or won't teach.  I'm conflicted because I've learned absolutely nothing, but he's so cool you almost feel guilty for hating this class.",0
Great professor. Really wants his students to do well.,1
She is simply the best.,1
"Harold was an amazing teacher that really cares about his students. If you show up to class and ask him questions, you will do well. His class is pretty tough but don't fear. He will try and do everything to help you if you show him that you will put in the effort. Go to the TA sessions! Harold still meets with me to just talk about how I am today.",1
"I made the mistake of thinking i could cruise by in two of his classes this last fall. Let me say this, he isn't very organized, and his TA does the grading. This semester we often didn't have homework ready until late the night of, the assignment weren't clear. His tests extremely hard, you must have a great Memory to pass.",0
professor mayo is a great professor really easy teacher as long as you write down the stuff he puts on the bored you should do well on all the test and quizzes he gives 4 quizzes 20 points each one midterm and one final which are worth 40 points each,1
HORRIBLE got a D in the class. When you ask questions he tells you look in the book doesnt bother to help. pop quiz when he feels no one is participating doesnt even tell you what to study or focus on for the exam. terrible professor doesnt care for the students.,0
"Do not take this class. Lectures are awful. The teacher is rude at best, doesnt care for students. He knows what hes talking about and makes it clear to the class how brilliant he really is. You can read the chapters repetitively and still fail on the respondus quizzes, which you only get 3 tries on. The tests are even harder to pass. Good luck.",0
"He very experienced and teach us new technology and methodology like Agile, scrum etc.",1
"Mrs. Hollis is a great teacher and keeps you entertained! There are daily assignments, but they are easy. Class is not hard as long as you study for tests and pay attention.",1
"fun class to sit through...very easy class, if you dont get something he will work with you on it and is quite clear with his explanations...gives good examples and backup for whatever he says",1
"Class was online and I may forever be turned off from online courses because of him. I worked very hard and kept up with the extensive workload and still received a grade below expectations. His communication was terrible, was a struggle to get feedback  and wouldn't accept a face-to-face to discuss my grades. Stay away if possible!",0
"Fun subject matter, fun class. Jim is clearly very passionate about music synthesis, and it is infectious. Does take some time outside of class to learn the techniques learned in Reason, but nothing too crazy. Playing your music in front of the class can be nerve-wracking, but it gets easier. Very funny and laid back guy, highly recommended.",1
Great Teacher! She has awesome stories about the weird people she knows and is always willing to answer questions.,1
"Erica is one of the best professors I have had at UNL. She's kind, funny, and knows what she's doing. She makes french super accessible to anyone",1
"Honestly, shes nice and caring, but thats where it ends. The class for a 100 level requires WAY MORE EFFORT than youd expect. You have to read, write and write really well as the TA does the significant grading. I was slacking but tried on the final. Understand I didnt deserve higher than a C, but an F was overboard. Avoid please.",0
"Has a very high opinion of himself, likes to read out his own stories and talks about his life A LOT. There's never a clear definition of what he wants as a paper, and he's a tough grader. I was bored all the time.",0
Graded off of two midterms and a final essay which consists of two essays. His lectures are helpful. Only used one of the books which was the shorter one since it was more concise and had easier to understand language. Not a tough grader if you show evidence that you know what you're talking about. Given the exam questions ahead of time.,1
"Avoid at all cost. His tests are all essay format.Does not believe in giving a 100. On my participation he put""Great class input,perfect attendance"" and gave me a 90.. He will nitpick you to death and when you challenge his points he will embarrass you. Do not waste your time going to his office to question anything. He is RIGHT and YOU ARE WRONG.",0
"one of the best professors i've had at GV, i definitely recommend her!",1
"As an online professor, he basically didn't do anything but post the reading and the test. I didn't learn a thing. His Blackboard was very unorganized and it was hard to contact him. Waste of time and money.",0
"Don't take this prof. He's rude. His final exam expected us to finish 80 questions (including fill in blanks, multiple choice and t/f) within 50 mins and u cant skip questions or go back. When asked to increase the time limit, he said we needed to get help if we have learning disabilities. Deleted all course material 2 days before the final.",0
Great way to fulfill your FA.  I hate philosophy and I still had no problems in her course.  Shes very understanding and likes to involve in debate rather than lecture.  No homework outside of reading,1
"Professor Hunt takes a fun approach to teaching topics that many people might find boring. BL431 is one of the most useful classes I have taken at WIU. With Covid-19 restrictions our class was online. I normally try to avoid online classes, but the recorded lectures cover all required topics very well. Don't hesitate to take it online.",1
"She teaches scatterbrained.  One of the basic qualities a teacher should have is organization, but she doesn't have it.  I had an A on all the assignments, but did poorly on the tests because I had to jump around so much in my notes to study just one topic.  People who have had the subjects covered in this class before have the advantage on tests.",0
The only C i ever got in any biology was with her. I should have taken Gavin. Gavin's tests aren't much harder than her's and his lectures actually help you rather than confuse you. She can't even provide decent answers to students' questions. I spent at least 8 hours a week studying for this class and still  only got a C+.,0
Honestly the worst teacher I have ever had. She drags on everything we do. I would never recommend taking her. Incoming freshman beware she is heartless.,0
"Great professor, came to class prepared and rarely messed up in lectures. Lectures were engaging. Was available outside of class, even outside his office hours. Glad to have had him for my first proofs based course.",1
You have to watch the videos in order to understand the class/homework/labs but if you do that you should be fine.,1
Very enthusiastic on the subject.,1
Dr. Blazer is one of the hardest and least-caring professors I ever had. His finance class is online and for a 5 week course the material that you have to cover in that short amount of time is very very hard. Do NOT take him unless you absolutely have to. He does not give extensions and does not have sympathy for emergencies. I do not recommend.,0
Take him as much as you can. He is very organize and very smart. He offers extra help. Awesome professor.,1
She's a sweet lady when u take to her on a personal level. .. but she is very judgmental she points u out in class and will talk terribly about you in front of the class she constantly contradicts herself and then when several students call her out on it she catches an attitude she makes it very hard. She doesn't use electronic so she is unrechable,0
It's mind-boggling how unprofessional he is. His lectures consist of pulling content from other universities and his assignments and randomly assigned questions from past programming contests. Seniority is the only reason why he's still here.,0
he is so funny one of the best get his classes early they are the first to fill up,1
A very Good Professor. Teaches well,1
"This is without a doubt the worst professor I have ever taken at UA. Absolutely demolishes your grade with homework that takes hours to complete and graded like it's a test. Mittenthal is the Department Head for OM so there's not much you can do to avoid him, but if you can, avoid him AT ALL COSTS. Worst guy, worst professor, worst class ever.",0
Mr. Ed is the reason why iam doing so good in school. the best teacher I ever had.,1
I agree with everything here.,0
"Dr. V is the best professor I've had at Carroll. Her Bio 2 class is not easy, but if you study the powerpoints regularly you can definitely get an A. She makes her lectures interesting and is just a great person to get to know. I will be taking her again for a higher level Bio class and recommend her to everyone",1
He puts so weightage on tests that he doesn't give enough time for so that his students can fail -_- Don't feel like he really cares for his students.,0
"The Test are hard in the beginning but as you go along they'll become easier. In order to pass you will have to study, you will learn in his class. He has good lectures and he's caring. All around he's solid",1
She is the worst teacher ever! Sucks you have to take this crap!,0
"Very, very hard on grading.  Humiliating to some students.  Do not take writing with this instructor.  I recommend M. Hampton for all writing courses at MHCC!",0
"Does her best to make the material easy to understand for non-science oriented students. Online quizzes for every chapter, graded group activities, and pyramid-style tests consist of your grade. Lecture is boring and so are the videos, but try to stay awake because the information in the videos will show up on the test. Final is cumulative.",0
The class was full of long assignments and graded activities with unfair distribution of credits. You will have more than 10 assignments  activities together each takes more than 1 week to finish 1 quiz and 2 exams. He didn''t teach. He just made you work. Don''t know how something works Find out on your own. His feedback was ambiguous. ,0
This was an interesting class but the way we did online readings was just stupid. The tests were extremely hard and i think she could care less about your individual learning. She just wants people to know what she does is hard but doesn't dumb it down for the rest of us regular people. Not impossible to pass if you work really hard.,0
"Steve Miller is wild and hilarious. You won't regret going to each of his classes, they are extremely entertaining and pretty interesting. The three tests are the whole class. 50, 50, and 100 multiple choice questions. The final screwed me a bit because it's on much more specific material than the first two and I barely studied.",1
"5 quizzes overall and your lowest grade gets dropped. She didn't really have a lot to work with for this class, but she still pulled through. I learned a lot in her class. At times she likes to take a break and talk about her dogs.",1
"Hoffman is very smart and sometimes funny but his lectures are tough to sit through, he doesn't provide slides with clear cut information so pay attention! readings about once a week with clicker quizzes which aren't horrible if you just skim the readings. Exams are 3 essay questions, gives you a study guide but be prepared for curve balls",0
"The WORST TEACHER EVER... Her PP are outdated. She does not like when you ask questions or to go back on the slides. She is so monotone, boring and rude. No manners at all. She gets a satisfaction when she fails students. She teaches irrelevant information. I do not understand why IVC has not solved this this problem.",0
easy - especially tests,1
"Dr. Cote is one of the sweetest professors I've ever met. She loves linguistics and that's obvious. But her lectures are a bit confusing and dry, so I studied the book and did fine on the tests. She's sometimes not clear on her expectations or what she wants but she's really nice and willing to help you. Not the easiest, but shes a good woman.",1
"absolute worst professor ever! she is an old, brainless moron. her powerpoints have NOTHING to do with her tests so you are bound to fail. i ended up just not going to class at all.. no point. now i have to pay to retake my art credit. save yourselves.",0
CHEM 3003 Horrible class...doesn't explain things very well...wouldn't recommend taking this class unless you have to,0
"This professor has a very heavy lecture. He took attendance before every lecture, and only provided 3 exams and a final. He does not provide any extra credit. Because his voice is so monotone, it can be extremely easy to wander off (his words begin to blend together). The information you are required to learn is not expected of an intro class.",0
"Professor Morris is a very nice lady. However, the class is way too group work heavy. Also, you do not pick your groups. So if you get stuck with awful group mates, you have even more work. She is also inconsistent with grading. She grades everything very easily until the final paper, which she grades incredibly strict.",1
"DON'T TAKE HIS CLASS!!! Course assessments did not test our understanding of concepts, instead, we needed to memorize the smallest and most insignificant of details (ie, graphs he showed literally once). In other courses I got low 90s, in this class I got 60s on assessments despite hours and hours of studying. VERY textbook heavy. Good luck.",0
Among other half-witted professors this one likes to randomly add passwords to quizzes for no reason other than to make your life harder because it's easy to use someone else's work and throw your name at the top. Her videos aren't helpful and she depends on course simulations to teach because there's clearly a lack of experience on her part.,0
Worst Prof Ever. I feel stupider after going to his classes.,0
"While Colvert is passionate, she basically reads off of her slides, making for a boring lecture. She throws a lot of material at you and goes very quickly. The online homework is a pain, but easy points if you have Chegg. Get access to old tests, they will help you learn everything better than class does. It's not much fun, but you'll get through.",0
Professor McKenna is one of the best professors I've ever had! He is very concerned with his students and is great at teaching. He's so funny and kind. Definitely take a class with him!!,1
"Honestly she is very confusing on what she wants you to do for speeches, assignments and exams are not very clear. Many students in the class were confused some even dropped in the last weeks of class.  I have taken so many communication classes loved all except this one. If you truly want to learn about comm and want a passing grade don't take her",0
"She is very helpful; don't be afraid to ask her for help, especially on review of cases.  You're allowed to use notes on exams, but they only help on the T/F and MC the practice fact patterns are a little tough.",1
"When I say avoid Suvak at all costs, I MEAN IT. Choose a good professor over easy course content. Suvak is a horrible prof and human being. He is inconsiderate, ableist, merciless and hateful. Almost all of our class failed his exam which he made mandatory to pass to pass the course. And it was worth 60%. He wants you to fail. Will not help you.",0
Nig hands back assignment and exam marks back almost two months after they are submitted but will dock you 10% for handing in an assignment 30 seconds after the due date. Apparently profs don't have to follow the own rules they set for themselves and Nig is a shining example. His lectures are unnecessarily long and he goes off topic 100% of thetime,0
was not very open-minded to n ew ideas and picked his favorites,0
"He really told us, here's the notes for each week, have fun learning, here are the test dates and the online resources. There was no lectures in the class, I still don't know what he looks like because he doesn't even teach the online resources, they're done by another prof. Every email is so snarky, I'm right you're wrong mentality.",0
"really treats his students fairly, doesn't treat you like a kid and he knows so much about so much it seriously makes your head spin. i mean yuou really just every class learn so much you leave the class like in a daze.",1
"He outlines the procedures very clearly in the video lectures.  Always responds to emails quickly.  I would have preferred to take this class on campus, but if you have to take it online take it with him!  Do the work early in the week and send it to him and he'll go over it for you.  Wants you to understand and do well.  Only used book for tables",1
"As everyone says, his lectures are pretty boring. I bombed the midterm, stopped going to class and just studied everything on my own and finished with an A (final mark can replace midterm mark). His exams are fair, just study the lecture notes and the textbook and you will do well.",0
"I love Dr. Wheeler; she is a fantastic professor!! She is hard, but that is the class. You have to put a lot of effort in or your grade will reflect that. Study Groups are a MUST. She is willing to help you outside of class and wants you to be successful, but you have to put the work in. She cares about her students and will do anything to help!!!",1
"Maria is the best nursing instructor at Delco.  She is tough, no doubt and she expects alot from her students.  But, if you come to class prepared, listen to lectures, and study every night, you'll do well.  She's challenging in the classroom and expects the best from everyone.",1
Great Prof. You can tell how bright he is and how great he is at teaching a subject. Ask him questions he would love to help you. Hard course to understand but he helps a lot.,1
"He's a really nice guy and it's clear he's passionate about what he's teaching but boy is he dull. During course selection season his rating here went from its current 3.2 to a 4.2, and then back down. Additionally in his syllabus and online he spells his name as Iouri Pankrats (unable to find him here). I can't help but be suspicious of this.",0
"I took her online math class, there were video lectures that weren't needed to pass the class. Her notes are exactly what you will be tested on and if you had problems with the homework she will get back to you right away.",1
If youre thinking about taking this class DONT.  You have to type a 25 PAGE RESEARCH PAPER. This professor puts you in groups to play stupid games and claims he will buy the winning team starbucks. He never buys the winning team starbucks. He constantly repeats himself like an old record. He makes jokes to lighten the mood but fails miserably.,0
"easiest class of my freshmen year!! If you do all the essays,you will get B. But if you want an A then you have to show him that you care which is by coming to classes and participating in class even if you say random stuff (he is random half the time himself).P.S. Bring your laptop and games to class because there is no point in listening to him",1
"Nice guy and u learn sum interesting things but the tests he gives r rediculously hard, at least half of the questions on the tests were not covered in the notes or reading. U get easy pts 4 attendance and hw assignments but the tests really hurt ur grade. Advice u to skip his class if u can.",0
"DO NOT take this Professor, I cannot stress that enough. Shes rude and not understanding of problems you have and goes way too fast. If you dont understand something or cant remember how to do a certain thing, dont bother asking her. Ive been those situations many times and all she does is look at you like youre stupid and say something rude.",0
This course needs to have a new professor. This one is the worst professor I have had. I don't understand why she teaches when she doesn't seem to care about the students. Her exams are super hard and she marks extremely hard. Stay away from the course if she's teaching.,0
"Easy A, most of the material is online. She provides you the materials needed to do the assignments but will instruct you that 2 books are needed. We wasted money on cengage unlimited that we never used. Quizzes are online and the ELA is super easy but she won't provide instructions.",1
I have to second the previous comment. Spot on w/ everything. Also her pettiness is shocking. She singles out & berates students publicly for any little thing that bothers her. The homeworks are like riddles which absolutely REQUIRE a TA to provide add'tl info to solve. The mean exam scores are abysmal. Thank god for Aloupis' recorded lectures.,0
Great teacher great person.,1
"If you are debating on taking Dr. Thompson-- JUST DO IT! She is the sweetest lady you will ever meet and cares so much. Due to her having students in many different times zones she does recorded lectures, 3 tests, and a simple 20-minute presentation project. She makes it where you can succeed in all of her classes and responds to emails so fast!",1
Very unprofessional.,0
"He has the ability to be the best professor, but his attitude towards students and his rudeness already makes some of the hardest classes, harder. He is nasty in how he responds, refuses to help, and treats you like a moron, yet you don't get any other options.",0
"Great professor, even greater guy. Passionate about what he does. Take Danesi's classes if you have the chance! I've had him for 3 years and have loved every one of his classes.",1
easy class...big waste of time to even go...I learned nothing from her,1
"She is pretty intimidating/scary at first, and I thought so throughout the course. You better not be late to this class, she embarrased late comers on an occasional basis. Overall made the subjet seem challening but ended up giving assignments that were easy to figure out. She wasnt bad and gave me avery good grade.",0
"Just terrible. Doesn't teach what he expects you to know on exams. Will take away all points on a question if you miss a single part. Wastes class time by talking about his cats and personal life. For such easy concepts, this class should not have been this much work. I learned nothing at all and ruined a perfect GPA. Do not recommend.",0
"Wonderful teacher! She really knows her stuff, and she is concerned about every student understanding the material. The only complaint I have is that she focus a little too much on group work. I will definitely take her again.",1
"Ferguson is an amazing lecturer. You have to attend class in order to complete daily in-class short answer assignments that count for attendance. Take good notes in class. Study a decent amount and make A's on exams, study the night before/day of and make B's.",1
"Took two classes with him and loved them both! He is a truly caring, respectful professor who shares his lived-experiences as an Ambassador in a relevant and informative way. He is a very fair grader and offers great feedback. He shares fellowship opportunities and truly wants to see his students succeed. 100% would take a course with him again!",1
"Fr. Smolarski is a good guy, but like others have said, he is not a very easy teacher to follow. He talks way too fast, assuming as if we are following right along with him when many of us get lost somewhere in between. Feel bad for him though, because no one laughs at his horrible jokes. I think his self-esteem is hurting, so he's not confident.",0
"This woman is incredible. Easily the best professor I've had at Loyola. She treats you like an equal and the discussions are always amazing. Just take her class, I promise you won't regret it!",1
Amazing professor!! I highly recommend him!!,1
"Neglects to tell students about huge concepts until the review classes before the test.  Doesn't do anything but read from the slides. NO time in-class for students to do example problems and discuss, which is NECESSARY to understand math. Acts surprised and condescending when students aren't getting it.  DO NOT TAKE FINANCE WITH HIM.",0
"Professor Klimchuk teaches very engaging lectures.  Though I am not interested in philosophy, I enjoyed going to class and always clearly understood the material, even when it was very abstract concepts.  I would recommend Professor Klimchuk.",1
"If you aren't an athlete or in his fraternity, he doesn't like you.  I switched to a different teacher and got an A.",0
"This guy is great! i absolutely hate history but he makes it fun! you need to pay attention and take notes, or you won't do well on tests",1
"Professor Good is a great teacher, in fact one of the best at GVSU. He is very laid back, but is willing to help with problems. He leaves assignments a little vague, so it makes class tough. He does this on purpose though to make you work, and it really helps you learn. Take this class, you will learn a lot.",1
Thought taking his Intro to Classical Mythology class would be worth a try despise these poor to average ratings and it was one of the worst mistakes i've ever made. Pop quizzes almost everyday (no makeups) and papers are super tough; will not receive a B or higher no matter how many rough drafts you do. His classes will just hurt your GPA so RUN!,0
"I have no idea why people don't like this professor, I absolutely loved him. He is so sweet and caring! He holds extra office hours before every test, on top of the already 3 a week, and he listens to his students, even started assigning less homework. This man is a gem that is criticized completely unfairly because of the rigor of the class.",1
COB191 is a hard class but he made things way too difficult. I did all the readings and still failed the quizzes and tests. He makes things seem easy in class and you think you understand but his tests are SO MUCH HARDER than they needed to be. He cares a lot and is a great prof but just made things more difficult than they needed to be.,0
I never actually had Dr.G as a professor but I did work in his office while I completed my work study and he is such a nice person. Anything you need he helps you get it taken care of. He helped get me set up with a tutor for my math class and he also gave me study tips and tricks.,1
"The notes Dr. Lynch gives do not line up with what is actually needed, making it incredibly difficult to learn the things needed. He is an incredibly caring professor, but that doesn't make up for the garbage notes. Avoid taking this class with him if at all possible.",0
"Kremer is a great teacher, he is very knowledgeable, and could seriously take you to the next level. However, his assignments are so ridiculously hard for the average second year student that you may risk failing, or dropping out. Take Kremer if you want to play on expert mode - otherwise I'd strongly advise you not to.",0
"Do not take her if your lazy or a non-studyer because you will fail. If you study for the tests, do the online homework & quizzes, and do the 2 papers she assigns you then you're guaranteed to pass.",0
He is the worse professor I ever had in my life. His class is boring. Students look to their watches hoping to get out of the class. His accent is very very thick. I am having difficulties in understanding him. His explanation is very poor. He think he has a sense of humor whereas he does not have it at all.,0
"One of the best profs easily. Speaks clearly and is very caring. You can tell he's extremely passionate about CS from the way he talks about it. Would love to take another class with this prof. One negative, is that the examples in class are sometimes pre-written and quite long , so it is very hard to follow. But overall I highly recommend him.",1
"Hes a decent guy but the way he teaches class is ridiculous. Your grade is based off of 2 exams and the final and for the 2 exams he grades so hard. Theres vocab with no word bank, any little detail he takes off points, hes just not a good professor, do everything you can to avoid him in order to save your gpa",0
"He answers all our questions although sometimes they were basic questions. The tests were okay but very limited time, so we had to practice to get used to it. Solid professor.",1
"He is one of the best professors I've ever had. He explains things well and had good visual aids to learn from. He is helpful, and it is actually an interesting class. I suggest him big time.",1
"This class really isnt THAT bad. Yes, it is boring the majority of the time. But if you write down everything he says and pay attention in class, then you will be fine. He is a little harsh on the papers but you can always re-write them. I did not read much of the books and used sparknotes to help and it did. Open notes for tests and quizzes, easy",1
"HE IS THE WORST TEACHER I HAVE EVER HAD.  if you are cursed with his class, then run run very very very far away.  he is boring, unorganized, slow, unhelpful, and did I mention boring.  NEVER EVER EVER take his class",0
She is really difficult to achieve. I sent her 3 emails and she did not respond any of them. You will not expect to get any help from her. She gives too much reading. More than 20 pages each every week. Very long boring lecture. She does not put her presentation on sakai.,0
"She's really not that bad. I have an A in her class and I've never had to pick up the book once. Just read the powerpoints and make flashcards. She's nice enough. It's the kids who want A's handed to them without any effort who are bitter. You don't even need a professor for this class, so don't bother rearranging your schedule to avoid her.",0
"Professor Delaney always has a positive attitude and is very enthusiastic about teaching. During class, she makes sure everyone understands the content and is open to questions at any time. Her lab sessions are held by TAs, and is an easy A if you show up. Overall, great class",1
"The course is not hard at all, as long as you show up to class.",1
"She's the toughest grader I've ever seen, and will destory your soul with her comments. But can be slightly helpful if she likes you. Overall worst college class I've ever taken.",0
"Everyone who has Carageorge either absolutely loves or hates her. She can seem a bit unorthodox at times, but what ever she is doing it works. Her freshman production class always has the best films to show at screenings and her class is a great starting point for any film maker. Her feedback can be abrasive but is usually accurate. ",1
Good class horrible teacher. ,0
"Drop this class RIGHT NOW if you aren't a psychology major. I'm a CAS student with a job + own business on the side of school. Unless you have the passion/countless hours to read, study, and MEMORIZE the LOADS of useless (but interesting) information he piles on you, you will FAIL. NO multiple choice on exams and tests on like 9 books/semester.",0
Arnold is an enthusiastic lecturer and by far the most interesting. I learned so much about teaching Science and feel more prepared than before. She was great and funny but was a hard grader on random errors and often had extensive assignments. If she recognizes this flaw our grades could be more reflective of who we are as competent candidates.,1
"Can't Understand him, has no idea how to grade and sucks at teaching anything remotely to what you are learning. Stay away from this Prof.",0
"unfair, and bias.  based most of his grading on participation and not quality of work on exams.",0
Professor Sanford is a hoss plain and simple. By far my favorite professor I've ever had. His lectures are very interesting and he has a good sense of humor. Be prepared to read and take good notes during his lectures. I highly recommend this beast. I want to take every class he teaches.,1
"He teaches at SF state now. He gave daily readings and quizes the next morning on them. Final was easy; an essay and some multiple choice. The material taught in class was confusing and didn't seem to fit together, it was also one sided. If I didn't have to take this class as a GE I wouldn't have taken it. However he is passionate about politics",0
"Great professor! 100% recommended! I learn a lot during this class. Do the discussion board assignment early, and try to write more. The extra credit will boost your grade a lot (even from B to A).",1
"She is really a good professor and try to solve your questions and can reply email very fast. In the exam, she didn't deduct too much points to punish students. The exam is good and can test whether you know the knowledge clear or not and it is not tough. ",1
"Prof Song is a great person; energetic, smiley, loves what she teaches. The lectures are EXTREMELY boring. Barely learn anything about Microsoft Office and learn about one other type of software. Lots of extra credit offered. Didn't really learn anything important. Attendance is taken in class but not doesn't go toward your grade so its pointless.",0
"Paul is a pretty nutty guy, but his class discussions are funny; they're pretty long but still remarkably hilarious.  He is not very clear with instructions, so get the number of a classmate or two to help keep track of everything and get 2nd opinions.  He uses the Wiki heavily and that will be the basis of the info you get for projects.",0
"My friends and I are going to write him a five-page letter sharing our opinions about how this course was taught. We'll write it on engineering grid-paper (double sided of course), using our worst handwriting, list our names in random order, paper clip (not staple) the pages together and slide the whole thing under his office door.",0
"I had Jason Prey for Introduction to Anatomy&Physiology (BIO160)and it's a fascinating class. He is funny and nice! His exams are sometimes hard, but most of them are decent.",1
"My most favorite teacher.  No one is giving her and HOT ratings.  Come on guys, Mrs. Russell is not that bad looking.",1
"Incredibly nice guy, I just found the lectures to be really boring. Depends on how much you like the material. Lenient grader, very approachable, and really smart.",1
Terrible! SAVE YOURSELF! Treats everyone but the front row terrible. Don't ever be late.  Actually don't take the class.,0
Had him for 215. Honestly was a little boring since he values lectures a lot and it was hard to pay attention with him standing in one space and maybe writing a word or two on the board. Tests cover exactly whats on the review sheets. Pretty straight forward. Will give extra help when needed and always open to give advice.,1
Really good prof. Teaches well and explains clearly. Will help you right after class if you ask questions.,1
"A very cribable prof, but he is a very stickler-y grader. The final exam is nearly half theory, so  make sure to prepare for that. Other than that, he is a very entertaining prof with his fair share of stories.",1
He is a nice guy but at first he doesn't come off that way. He wants you to work hard as if it was your major. You will have to teach yourself throughout the whole course. This course is hard and you may need a tutor. If you take this class make sure you read ahead and request the power points from him via email and GOOD LUCK,0
Terrible!! He doesn't give you near enough time on his quizzes or exams. If you don't know the information as he does you will run out of time. His study guides are ridiculously long and you have to write essays along with your 80 questions on exams. He does give extra credit was the only bonus but you have tons of other work too.,0
"I do NOT recommend taking this professor for this course. The class is test heavy with four essays. If you do not do well on these, you will not do well in the class because he does not give any other homework assignments. It seems like he grades the papers on his own opinions.",0
"If you enjoy self-learning then this is the class for you. For the online version of his class, all he did was give you links for youtube videos and said figure it out. He also doesn't give enough time on the exams but when you ask him for extra credit he doesn't offer it. Go with caution when taking this class, many breakdowns happened.",0
a bit dry in the lecture sometimes but intresting and easy,1
Super chill.,1
Not an easy class but at least he's fair about grading. Very helpful if you ask and doesn't make you feel stupid for asking questions.,1
This instructor is nice but he doesn't really explain anything.  Most of the test if from the book and his power points.  His lecture is pointless and so are his labs.,0
Russo isn't very helpful. She takes a very long time to get back to you when you e-mail her and if you go in to see her for help she blames you for not understanding the material. In lecture she repeats herself over the same problem over and over. It's very repetitive. ,0
"Terrible. Yells when he talks (can't talk like a normal person) acts like he is better than everyone else. If you ask him a question you'll get attitude and you won't even get your questioned answered, he'll say like 2 words on it and that's it.",0
Great person,1
If you want tedious quizzes where you dont get good grades no matter what then this class is for you. honestly another sociology class is better than this. for an intro class its absolutely ridiculous,0
This class is fairly easy but the professor himself is horrible at explaining things so make sure u have friends in this class so you understand whats going on. If you are looking for a teacher who gives concrete details you wont find that with Sibner,0
"Excellent. I'm not an English major anymore but I still think about my senior seminar (which focused on Joyce's ""Ulysses"") as one of the most satisfying classes I've ever taken. I truly miss the environment of that class and just discussing the literature with my peers. P.S. If you are an english undergrad, do NOT take those years for granted!",1
"WORST TEACHER EVER. He is a horrible teacher. My friend did better than me and he never went to a single class. Not only that, he's a prick. My friend and I both tried e-mailing him for our grade breakdown, I didn't get one, and his grade was changed for the worse. He even admitted to making the test differently than he teaches. Just awful.",0
Very good guy. Great to see someone and hear someone passionate about social work and changing lives. He is a very well connected individuals. He is certainly someone to get to know personally.,1
Made us believe turning in review packets would give us 5 points on each test that they were turned in for and apparently this is not the case because my final grade is 6% lower than it should be.,0
"Although Judy is very knowledgable and an extremely nice lady, I found her lectures were very confusing. She was constantly flipping back and forth between pictures of notes, pictures of the textbook, and pictures of practice question solutions. Instead of actually teaching the material she would just skim over it.",0
"The nicest guy in the world, not the most consice teacher. he curves the class big time.",1
"He is awesome to just go and listen to for an hour. Lectures are pointless for exams, but he talks a lot about real world stuff you don't get out of the book. He knows the subject well. Exams-just read book and take exam. Offered other projects if ppl wanted to do them. Lots of EC. Very helpful outside of class.",1
"Professor Woods was a terrible first choice. She over explains way too much, gives enormous amounts of homework that barely count for anything, grades HEAVILY on tests, and thinks the entire world revolves around her class. Had to drop her to save myself from miserable failure.",0
"STAT 212 is the absolute worst class I've ever taken at UVA.  The way the class is run is terrible... it seems as if Ted Chang and his TA's WANT you to fail.  Tests are extremely difficult and nothing at all like the homework.  The only reason I took this was for my Econ major.  For an intro course, it's unnecessarily painful.",0
"He is an amazing teacher. He is really funny and he knows what hes talking about and explains it well! Most importantly he curves the exams which is really helpful! He has classroom discussions, a couple papers, a couple tests, and some assignments out of the book that he counts as attendance! Over all a great teacher! I would take his class again!",1
This is my third math class taking at ARC but never had one professor giving us 5 exams and 1 final plus quizzes. They usually give us 3 quizzes and 1 final. This professor overloads you with a LOT of homework! You won't have time for other classes or work if you take her class. Each exam is about 20 questions and the final 35-40. Though grader!,0
"He is one of the worst teachers I have ever had. He does not teach, he's hard to understand, and he grades very unfairly. He does not know how to do the problems on the board and messes up constantly, but expects you to do perfect. If there's anyway to avoid him, do it.",0
"Shes not that bad guys, i don't understand why she has low ratings. Shes a very professional Professor who cares about her students. Yes she may be unorganized at times but her assignments are very doable and she encourages participation. Just do your work and listen to what she has to offer. Long Night classes suck all around so just be ready.",1
"A horrible instructor but good life teacher. Thinks too highly of himself and always brag about his achievements. Always gets off topic. No point of going to class, you're better off just reading the many readings and all of the homework he assigns. Exams are extremely hard. STUDY STUDY STUDY!!!",0
"I was in Dr. Williams history class and his classes were fun and full of stories. Each story literally explained about the topic really well that even I, who wasnt from the US got to understand things easily. The way he conducts the class was clear so I had no confusion or troubles staying on track. Im definitely going to take his class again!",1
"This class had such a high workload-- we had only 1-2 days to read passages, view a PowerPoint, and watch a movie. He gave very succinct feedback as he didn't help clarify exactly what I did wrong and how I could fix it. If you want to do well, you need to spend COUNTLESS hours working on his assignments. One of the worst classes I've ever taken.",0
A bad professor in a bad social work program.,0
This the absolute worst professor anyone can have he belittles your opinion and he's always talking about thing that are not related to the work itself.  He is always bringing in his political views constantly. He never explains his papers thoroughly and gives no helpful information. Talks a lot of irrelevant things rather than teach!!!,0
Did not know much on the topic he was teaching. (Caribbean History) I could have done a better job teaching the class based on stories I was told by my family members. ,0
"This class is one where subjective grading is prevalent. A majority of the class is made up of discussions and participation grades, where no real grading rubric is available. Many times the professor would talk about topics very one sided that made some people openly feel uncomfortable. The class was not the best experience for me.",0
"Her lectures are rough bc she has a very sleep-inducing voice but when going over her PowerPoint presentations and lecture videos she gives very good explanations. Her syllabus indicated I think 10 quizzes or something and we only had 3 in the end. Also stated we would have multiple assignments, only had one. Exams are tough but not meant to trick.",1
"THIS PROFESSOR IS HORRIBLE. She grades horribly and failed me on a paper because I chose a prompt that other students chose. She teaches the exact same things over and over but will count you off on papers and discussions if you bring them up in your own work. I do not recommend her at all. Yes, she's sweet, but she's a horrible professor.",0
"I don't really understand why she's not ranked higher. Quite possibly one of the best professors I've had thus far. She really, REALLY knows her stuff, and is a very effective communicator of otherwise somewhat dense material. Lots of readings, but that's expected in a class like this. Hard but fair tests, and she's very approachable to talk to.",1
I traveled to Greece with Yunus for Ancient Greek Philosophy. He is extremely knowledgeable and a very good person. He will help you if you reach out to him. He is Turkish and has a rather thick accent but you get used to it. He is not a hard grader but cares about the material.,1
No communication & not a lot of feedback.,0
"bad enough that it's just plain hard math but it's all the more confusing when you cant learn as effectively because of his horrendous handwriting he can also make frankly uncalled for jabs at you for asking a ""stupid question"" If he's your only choice left for a class consider taking it somewhere else or another semester seriously. Never again.",0
"This class was extremely hard. My class had an average score of a D or D- on our midterms (there are two). The tests are impossible, but he curves so most people get a B-BA. I recommend taking this course with a different prof if possible. I learned a lot but wish I could've shown what I learned on tests related to subject matter of the course.",0
Took pre-covid and when David was still a prof. Mark stayed on topic mostly because of David. There are very few informative slides so take Notes. Actively participate and ask questions. If he sees active engagement he will try to help as much as possible but you'll have to be specific when asking questions. Tests are very hard so make sure to read,1
"Professor Jervis was very inconsistent with due dates and was an extremely tough grader. She preferred to teach a Psychology class rather than a Writing one, asking a lot from her students in terms of analysis. Multiple papers assigned with not enough time to properly work on them and too early in the course (one assigned in the first week).",0
"One of the worst teachers I have come across at Pierce. I received a 1.3 in her class, but when I took it with another teacher I received a 3.7..Tell me how that works. Very hard, vague and unclear. When you ask for help she is very rude an doesn't give any sort of help. She will tell you to ask the librarian..even though she is the teacher. AVOID!",0
Take it if you want depression,0
"Nice man, pretty conservative and not afraid to let you know just how conservative he is.. I hope he considers posting more articles for BOTH sides of the argument rather than just articles supporting his beliefs. lots of work so make sure to keep up",0
"Absolutely loved her! She was very concerned whether or not you were doing well in her class, and will always meet with you to help you if needed! Attend the classes and you'll pass easily!",1
Boring class. Just read the textbook to pass the class!,0
"She's a good teacher, class difficulty is about Calc 2.",1
Dr. Zambrano made me realize how much I loved Spanish and showed me all the possibilities there were with taking the class. Take Zambrano if you can! He will help you whenever you are struggling but also make you learn it!,1
"Love Dr. K. She is very knowledgeable and has lots of experiences. She is very helpful and always available. She knows when you're BSing, so some effort has to be applied in class, but she's willing to answer questions and offer guidelines for expectations. Wish I had her again!",1
"I love Cote! She is super tough though. I managed to get an A in her class but only after studying for hours for each test and I never missed a lecture. She is specific on what you need to know, especially what you need to memorize for each test and quiz. For lab, ask questions! if you mess up in lab she will get angry, so it's better to clarify .",1
"I really enjoyed Father Ranieri's lectures, but he can get off topic with historical information. Come to class and take thorough notes and tests, quizzes, and papers will be much easier. He was a pretty easy grader but he rarely gave feedback on assignments. Definitely would recommend taking!",1
"weekly quiz, 2 midterms and 1 final. Dr. Hasan is the best in math dep. take his class if you can. you will love his lecture.",1
This class is horrible and should not be taken by anyone other than insanely intelligent Science students --not Arts/Social Science friendly!,0
"Terribly boring class and nightly homework assignments. The homework is pass or fail but you also have two papers and a midterm and final and participation counts. I went to every class and had perfect notes and when writing the essays they were accurate but he gave terrible grades. Boring class, don't take!",0
"Took this class and teacher during Covid-19 so it was all online. This is the worst teacher I have had in my entire life. So nit picky with papers and failed almost every assignments with her standards. Had horrible feedback and comments on papers, did not answer any of my questions. I would not recommend this class to anyone, I dropped it.",0
"Professor Slate was an amazing professor. She is really big on grammar and participation matters! When giving back the essays, she gives a lot of feedbacks so as a student you can fix and work on your mistakes. I learned a lot from her. If you take her summer course be ready to read a lot.",1
This teacher did not listen when I would try to ask for help.  He didnt think it was his job to help me understand because everyone else got it.,0
"The class is pretty easy, but I took an online test and and one question was fill in the blank and my answer was combining vowel. I got the question wrong because the answer was combining vowels and she would not give me credit when I told her about it. Very picky so be careful if you take this!",0
Save yourself she will mess up your average.,0
"I dont use this ever, but here I am to warn you to not take David Stone. His average on his exam was a 47% (the first was a 58%), and the final was a 51%. He refused to say what the final exam average was until I asked the TA. He literally sent out a PDF explaining he's not fair bc life isn't fair and hence he wouldn't curve and to just suck it up",0
Avoid professor Kornfeld's history course it's not worth your time or effort. She is a tough grader and so are her TA's. Her grading is only 100 points so if you lose 5-6 points you are almost at a B and it's difficult to keep a good grade. Most of the students in my class are failing and have struggled to bring their grades up. AVOID HER CLASS!!!,0
Favorite Teacher by far!,1
Idk who decided to give this man a good review but they're wrong. He won't post lecture slides and is the only professor not to have open note/book LEB tests. He will cold call and roast you. He is eccentric which could be seen as entertaining but his lectures are basically pointless. Tests are all based on the book even the smallest of details.,0
"If you rely on homework as a cushion for tests, this is the class for you. The grades are based on the unit averages. For example, workbook average score, tests average score. If you are not good with homework and keeping up on time then this will be a painful realization to get yourself in check.",0
"Mr. Alavrez is a very nice and caring professor. He talks a lot to the students as he is very open, and asks for class participation. He is well respected and easy to get along with. He gives out assignments on canvas every other week, but the work is not difficult. You dont even need your textbook for his class, all you need to do is show up.",1
"Mr. Gross is a great teacher. He gives lots of assignments & homework so as long as you do them all you will pass. Just show up, pay attention, & definitely do homework. He gives pop quizzes but they are not very difficult. I would recommend him as a teacher - I actually signed up for one of his classes next semester.",1
I was so excited to take this class but it's definitely hard to take online. We didn't have scheduled meeting times (but there were office hours). My only issue is that it was hard to follow and understand what was going on. You really need to live by the syllabus. Not hard once you figure everything out.,1
"Dr. Bob is an incredibly nice guy, sadly he can't teach for his life. He speaks super fast and it's very hard to follow him. He doesn't walk through any problems, he just goes over completed ones. Works a lot with the program Maple. Although his poor teaching, he is very lenient with due times and will almost always give you an extension if needed.",0
"Took this class, and dropped two months later. She doesn't give introductions or summaries about what she teaches, so students have no idea what she is teaching in class. She does offer help to students, fair in that way. But her teaching style is not good. I'm taking this next semester. TRUST ME DONT TAKE HER.",0
"Dr. Tolliver is a really nice guy. His lectures can be somewhat obscure, but its very possible to get an A without attending class. Although he sometimes uses unnecessarily long and confusing wording on the tests, you will do fine as long as you have studied his study guides. Its a really interesting class and he's a cool guy.",1
"Professor Smith is full of himself and never truthful. I barely got an sleep from studying hours on end and writing down everything. Then after all that I would maybe get a 60. I was so stressed from this I didnt sleep or eat before a quiz. He also would send nasty passive aggressive emails blaming the students,and bragging about a 73% average?!",0
"pretty horrible, very boring in class. lots of notes and random power outages and wifi problems. No responsiveness to emails. very abrupt and non forgiving aswell to homework related issues. make sure your turning in your work promptly",0
"Get ready for boot camp, because that's what you get. Non-stop work, she seems to flaunt how many students she has turned into the Deans for plagiarism. Very strict on everything, there is no room for anything but what she wants and when she wants it, and it is a lot.",0
"Test are much harder then the basic examples in class, does not give solutions to problem sets, does not post marks online and attendance is mandatory to pass due to in class questions. Overall you have to do a lot of work to pass this course.",0
"Nice lady, but I feel like her lectures are inconsistent with test questions. 2 test (50 mc each, each worth 20%) & no final. Group project (20%), participation (20%) easy money, 2 journal article assignments 10%, & mini-presentation. Would recommend, but make sure you understand stuff very well before taking exams.",1
"very biased prof.....if she likes you, your on east street....if not too bad.  Very rude....she speaks while students are trying to present.  Knows nothing of the work place outside of academia.",0
condescending...misses class,0
"Extremely knowledgeable, but very unapproachable. The math is useful, but is difficult to grasp just from the lectures alone. I spent more time watching videos online about the topics than reviewing the by the book lecture notes. Must be prepared for a very fast paced course. Very harsh grader.",0
"The book is clear and easy to follow. If you do a little reading, you shouldn't have any problem with the material. He is helpful and willing to talk about other philosophical issues if you are interested and ask. The grading wasn't bad, but it's definitely not a blow off class. Most people seemed to assume so, and were thus very unpleased.",1
"There is a lot of positive things to say about this professor. She is a nice person and right away articulates how to pass the class. However, she procrastinates posting grades. Final grades are almost due and the last posted grade was from a speech four months ago. Frustrating for those who need the credit on their transcript in a timely fashion!",0
"Skips key steps in homework solutions, which gets rid of clarity you would hope the solutions would provide. Hard homework problems that class won't prepare you for. Be ready to be tested on all the math you've ever learned, not just what he teaches you in the course. Don't skip class, don't be late (or you'll be too busy writing to listen). ",0
"Prof is fine, I'm here to leave a review of the course. DO NOT TAKE PHIL279. IT IS THE WORST COURSE YOU CAN POSSIBLY TAKE. YOU DON'T GET INTO THE HARD MATERIAL UNTIL AFTER THE DROP DATE. CARNAP IS GARBAGE. THIS COURSE BELONGS IN MATH NOT PHILOSOPHY. THERE IS VERY LITTLE ACTUAL PHILOSOPHY INVOLVED IN IT.",1
"Excellent teacher, very underrated. Really nice guy, seemed a bit standoff ish once when I saw him in the hall, but going to his office he is really helpful. Final exam was very fair, but you gotta know the whole course and especially the stuff he teaches in the second half of the course.",1
"She is the best Accounting teacher ever! I took her for accounting 1 & 2. I received A's in both courses. If you do the study plan she will give you up to 10 point to your total grade (up to 5 points each half of the class). Attend class she explains thing well, practice exams Are the same as the mid term and final just different number. #easyA",1
"First off, she's VERY condescending.  I mean she won't be afraid to announce to the class that you are a ""failure.""  Second, she expects students to show up on the weekends even when there is no class that day.  It's almost as if she decides who passes and who does not pass!  Most unorganized and unprofessional professor on campus.",0
"For the love of your GPA, don't take this class. She expects her students to read massive amounts of homework , and basically teach themselves to do everything related to the class. Class time is spent breezing through some, not all, concepts in the class. This semester is almost over and I'm still not sure what I actually I learned from her.",0
"You learn a lot from class than any other high school or human sexuality courses. It's true he talks about his life A LOT so likely you won't get through the whole chapter. His exams are hard so study repeatedly. I had open book but I still ended up with a C so be prepared, attendance is key, read during lectures, and stay awake he watches everyone",0
Suggest taking another professor if you can! His exams are extremely hard. Tons of information and memorization. He gives out study guides that are very detailed (75 bulleted list!) but only tests you on about 20% of it.  Very open to help you. If you are stuck with him all you can do is STUDY STUDY!,0
"Accent did not bother me, I could figure out what he was saying. He is very nice and cares about students. However, I found his class to be VERY unorganized. Blackboard is all over the place, lectures didnt stay on topic and he would say he sent out emails that I have no record of receiving. Its doable but not enjoyable.",1
The way she teaches is confusing. She expects you to know how to do problems before she explains them and then when you don't know the answer she acts like your stupid. The class average for the second test we took was 60%. Then she gave us a 25 minute lecture about how we should have done better.,0
Very sarcastic and rude,0
"I recommend taking a different prof. Dunn expects you to read his mind when it comes to his short answer questions, and his multiple choice are very poorly written and confusing. His lectures do not follow a structure and induce slumber. He's passionate about it and cares about us, but he's arrogant, like he needs to prove something to himself.",0
"Her lectures are useless. She points at models and babbles off a whole list of anatomical terms leaving everyone confused. Her quizzes invoke anxiety because you have to answer 1 question in front of the whole class. The cadavers are cool, but she tricks you on the practicals. That makes her lab very hard to do well in, very frustrating.",0
"One of the worst teachers i've had to deal with during my educational road. Seems unprepared during class, does not know how to lecture either. Constantly goes back on her examples saying forget this forget what i said this and you never get through anything. I suggest studying the material to understand it, because exams aren't math heavy at all.",0
"Daniel is a fantastic professor! There are two big exams involving multiple-choice and SPSS portions. There are also a number of short SPSS activities (walkthroughs available) & a few homework assignments as well. There is one semester-length research paper with randomly-assigned classmates. Overall, 10/10, one of my favorite professors ever.",1
"i loved dr. lima, and i don't even like biology but he made it so easy and fun! i'd take him again in a heartbeat",1
Professor Calderon is extremely passionate about his work with the community. His class is great because it encourages you to act on what you've learned and get involved with the surrounding community. I appreciate his commentary on his past work with organizing because it solidifies the readings we do in class. Excellent class!,1
"Very knowledgeable and helpful. Instills high standards and expects nothing less. If you take her class, you will learn something. Always willing to help those who ask, but is not a doormat for scammers.",1
"Dr. Euler is one of the last professors at Northwest I would tell anyone to take for a math course, especially if you are taking anything below Calc II. He acts as though he is too good for his lower-level students, and he is clearly just trying to make it through the lectures. He speaks too quickly and will not repeat himself. His tests are ROUGH.",0
"Polly Diven knows her stuff, and wants her students to be successful . Lectures are informative and she posts the powerpoints after class. Even the papers, films, and projects were interesting and I felt I gained a lot, academically and personally.. However, she has a big personality and will call you out or talk over you in class.",1
This man speaks something like 13 languages and he's in my Japanese class learning more. He's absolutely crazy and absolutely the most fun Spanish professor anyone will ever have.,1
Its a really easy class Professor Wood is very nice and caring I highly recommend and you will have group projects.,1
"Janet is a Journalism Goddess. She knows all there is about the journalism equipment, how to use it, what it's helpful for and why you should learn about it all. Probably THE best journalism teacher I've had thus far at Emerson. Can't wait to have her for TV News Producing.",1
Pretty specific pop quizzes on most days. Good luck if you don't agree with him on pretty much any issue.,0
My first year at bc. not impressed. She gives way too much homework and keeps her students until the end of class and a couple of times over. If you get lucky and happen to get out early it's only because she has work to do. Very anti-religion and found her to be offensive (I'm Catholic) Avoid at all costs.,0
Respect.,1
Tim is one of the best people I have met in my life. it was an honour to have been taught by him.,1
Do not take this class! The instructor is rather condescending and his TA is just as horrible. They do not really respect the views of others and talk down to the students. My personal experience was terrible. He is extremely boring and his office hours aren't as helpful as one would expect.,0
Hasn't been relevant this century. He should have stayed retired and spared all of his students his unrealistic expectations and archaic thinking.,0
"Tyler is a very knowledgeable professor. I think he is an efficient professor... he gets things done on time, but is he an effective professor? not really. His grading criteria is clear but his time-consuming requirements like homework and online exercises do not have a lot of weight on your grade. The 4 exams are your best bet so study study study",0
"Amazing class. Actually made money off the skills I learned from Garver. If you want to understand what quality audio really is, this is the guy.",1
Professor Kuo's class was super easy. Do every assignment and study the PowerPoints he uses to lecture. I never paid attention during the lectures because they weren't very engaging but I studied the PowerPoints and was able to get good scores each time. Those that didn't do well either didn't do assignments or didn't study at all.,1
"The worst Professor on Earth, not only is he a tough grader hes also highly inconsiderate. If you have him just consider dropping out.",0
"Honestly I thought his class was fairly easy he assigned homework and a quiz every week but gave a reasonably amount of time to complete it. The quiz was based on the DVDs he would show and the homework was always based on an example that he went over in class. I hardly touched my book, it would have been better if he went over the quizzes though",1
"Dr. Sobhi makes the course seem very simple, he is such a great guy who cares about his students success I am looking for his name to take chem 132 in the Fall with him as well, great experience overall",1
"Great stories, great prof.",1
Her class is 3 hours long and very boring.  The lab is difficult and bad instructions. Quizzes are extremely hard. ,0
She makes marching band so much fun...even the 8 am practices seem to fly by...she makes sure everyone is having fun and we always look great!,1
This guy gives awful exams! Don't take either psyc of sport or psyc of law. You'll do poorly in both.,0
"knew a lot about the information in lectures, but gave way too much busy work. read the book and go to all lectures since he takes attendance randomly. take advantage of extra credit and go to all study sessions to get an A. ",0
"I enjoyed him and actually still think about him. I had to take Physics 2 with another guy, and I instantly regretted it. His lectures are not magical, but the simple way he explains things made everything clear.",1
Ms. Cindy is fabulous! She is so fun and I truly enjoy her class. She makes learning fun and simple. She is very understanding with any issue and is great at helping in and out of the classroom. She is definitey one of my favorite people at JMU.,1
"God the testing format is horrible, power point style,2-3 minutes per slide/question m, spelling counts! And the information your tested over is hella specific jeez",0
"First off, Kilmer is a nice guy but poor teacher. Tons of homework that doesn't relate to the tests. It was the hardest work for a C I've ever had to do. Most of the class dropped by the end. I wouldn't ever take a class with him again, but if you're already in it, try to go to his office a lot.",0
"Dr. Truchil is a gem. There are only three exams, all of which are fairly easy as long as you dedicate some time to study. Likely to go off on tangents but if you listen closely, especially when he discusses essay questions, youll do fine. There are only a few textbook questions on midterm and final so dont sweat it if you dont remember to read.",1
You will not learn anything from the book. He is just talking and wants students to talk with him. You will get C even though you complete all the assignment. He is a confusing professor!,0
"i like this prof.  he is very interested in students' learning and can be very funny.  he does say what a lot, but i think that adds character.",1
I wish to say thank you to this Professor. He had really helped me with when I needed it the most concerning family and etc. He gave the assignments early at a ich helped me with my schedule. I had asked him to help me and he did so and benefitted the whole entire class.  Thank you again and God bless with all my heart. Elina A,1
"Awful. Not an English class. Take this class if you want to debate and hate the gov't. Discuss and talk about imaginary aliens that would ""rape every orifice"" on you. The government is out to get us and everyone is racist. There was NO structure on what he expected from papers. His feedback is condescending and unhelpful. Not encouraging/inspiring.",0
Your grade depends heavily on 2 things. Group work & tests. If you end up with bad group then you're basically screwed. He crams 2 big group projects after the midterm that lasts till the final. This ends up interfering with your studying for the final which includes EVERYTHING (and i mean everything) you're learned the entire semester.,0
He is monotone.  Class was okay. Didn't learn much. Exams are all multiple choice. He tries to help but can't. Going to office hours didn't work. I tried really hard but the exams are tricky. Try to get someone from his previous semester's class to get old exam. The exams are similar to the practice exams. He picks like 5-6 questions from there.,0
"If you have an opportunity to take any other instructor for this course, do it at all costs.  Mr. Roberts doesn't respond to emails and if he does, he doesn't address your questions, forcing you to ask again.  He is of no help with questions about the content of the course.  I am a straight A student and this course about killed me.",0
"Even though she was an online professor, she taught the material well and very concise! Easily accessible when I needed a question answered, very straightforward materials/tests, light but comprehensible coursework. Well rounded professor in general!",1
"EASY A! I had Professor LaSalle once a week for what was supposed to be a 3 hour lecture but he always ended class early. His lectures can be boring, but he's a nice guy and willing to help his students. Only two exams: mid-term and final, that were both take home! One term project assigned on the first day and not due until the end of the term :)",1
"I think it's near impossible to get an incredible teacher with physics. She works really hard to help her students and spends a lot of her own time making formula sheets for us to use, as well as truly cares about students questions/concerns. She goes beyond what a lot of other teachers do but I assume is given little leeway from the department.",1
"She is a GREAT professor, highly recommend to take her class. She explained the information really well and answers your questions. She gives out worksheets after every lecture to practice and then your table group has to turn one in for a grade. She cracks a couple of jokes once in a while so she kept us entertained. Highly recommend!!",1
"Absolutely do not recommend this ""professor"". Does not post anything on bright space and does not allow laptops in class. She is extremely rude and if you are confused about anything she will not help you or answer any of your questions if you go to see her outside of class????????????",0
"Great professor. You do have to read and go to class but if you do the reading and assignments her class is really not  hard. She knows her stuff, class is interesting and actually relevant to health sciences majors, and she will help with writing assignments.",1
"Professor Meckes gives quizzes everyday based on the reading from the previous class. There is homework and reading due everyday, and the homework is graded in an extreme way. Four midterms and a final exam that are all graded hard. Be prepared for a lot of bad grades on homework.",0
"She has wasted so many students money on her class. Even if the students received a 4.0 in the college level math class, this class will ruin them. She rushes through her examples, and her portfolio and group themes will make you fail. I hope NMC knows she will be the reason the teaching degree for transferring will be ended soon.",0
This has been the worst class ever. Spent countless hours studying and doing his homework. Do not do not take this class if you are not a music major! He loads you with sooooooooo much homework its just busy work and so hard to understand. I usually get As in all my course work and have never struggled in a class so bad.,0
"Dr. Day is the WORST professor I've had so far! If you skip lecture, you are guarunteed to loose points because attendance and pop quizzes count toward your grade. Also, he teaches as if everyone has a strong background in coding (despite being an INTRO class). If you don't have experience coding, you will most likely struggle in labs.",0
"She makes class mandatory but shows up late, grades papers late and doesn't help you understand the material well I would not take.",0
"If you can read thoughtfully and really want to understand the way some medicine works in our body then this is for you. Theres a good bit about the different methods of discovering new medicine. It was interesting and helped tie together much of what I learned in all my biochem, genetics etc. classes. So much makes sense that was blurry at best.",1
"He is a terrible teacher. He is so self-centered, arrogant, and such an inconsiderate teacher. He literally cannot teach and his lectures are boring and he rambles on about nothing.",0
"Not helpful in the lab. I'm sure he's great at his research, and it would be better for everyone if he continued to focus on that instead.",0
This instructor is very helpful and generous. He makes math look very easy and interesting. He is by far the best instructor on campus and very good looking if I might add! I would definetely recommend taking him for Trig and Calculus. :-),1
I took his class my first quarter as a freshman in 1986! I will never forget him. He gave the whole class a signed copy of a book he had written on Eleanor Roosevelt. I still remember my final essay test for his class: name two people I had learned about that I admired and why. He is unforgettable- A real class act.,1
One of the best teachers at UT. I had professor Hug for both anatomy and physiology and microbiology. She knows how to teach the classes and explains everything in detail. Her exams may be a little challenging but if you study for her exams a week in advance you will do fine. Study the notes! Go to every lecture even though it is not mandatory.,1
Not a bad prof. Movies are standard film studies stuff. Super easy exams. Everything is from the texbook. Essays are pretty fair. If you do the readings and watch the movies online you don't even have to come to class. I skipped the entire second semester and got an A.,1
"Personal negative, social and political views where constantly issued, some students where ignored and dismissed often.",0
"Worst professor I have ever taken. You are expected to read a 2000 page book 3 times through. He does not teach, he only goes over homework problems in class and then tells you how dumb you are if you get it wrong instead of helping understand. He slams everyone with the exams, after not having taught anything to us. DO NOT TAKE HIM",0
She's a good professor who gives good feedback and is accessible outside class. She prefers to be notified if you won't be showing up to class. There is a lot of homework and writing to do but that's because its an english course.,1
"She is not the nicest person, she tends to pick on people. She is very vague about papers- she'll write on the handout that she wants certain things, and if you follow that, you still won't get an A because she will have expected you to read her mind about the other 5 things she wanted, but didn't specify. You have to go to every class.",0
"It was an absolute pleasure to be Pabel's student. His lectures are captivating; instead of giving you boring details about history, he delved into the culture and mentality of early modern Europeans. His marking is on the harder side, but his comments are really helpful to improve on future assignments. I plan on taking further classes with him.",1
"Kyle is the most dry prof I have ever had. He just reads directly off of a powerpoint slide the whole time and sometimes gets off topic with random rants that are irrelevant. I fall asleep during his class. The whole class is just tests, no assignments. All you need to do is look through the textbooks on your own time, and you are better off!",0
Show up... listin to every word.. and ask as many questions as you can.,0
puts history into perspective. extremely helpful. just do the assigned papers and you should be fine!,1
"While Denemark is very knowledgable about everything that he teaches, his teaching methods are not ideal. He uses no powerpoints or anything. He only writes 3 questions on the board and then talks at you for the duration of the class. The discussion section wasn't too bad, usually a reading or two and then class discussion. Tests are difficult.",1
"Dr. Carter is a little longwinded (she uses 10 words when she could use 3), and her tests are surprisingly difficult, but overall, she is a great professor for Civ Arts. She loves what she teaches and it shows.",1
Go to class and show her that youve learned something. She really appreciates creativity so if youre not an English major you dont have to do an academic paper. Expect group work. Juliet is a lovely person and really cares about her students. If you show her you are paying attention you will get an easy A.,1
"Dr. Isaacs is the best professor I have ever had. Everything is extremely clear and applicable to future teachers. She gives feedback to encourage and help you improve. The class is very interactive and time goes by so quickly. I felt like I learned something valuable from her every class, and she always challenges you to look at new perspectives.",1
"do the work you will pass but got to put effort , homework once a week just doing a article and write a summary about it, final exam is research project/powerpoint doesn't grade hard just wants to see if you put effort and do it right.",1
"Horrible. Random lectures a& the info is never on the exam. He words the exams so badly its hard to understand the meaning. Bad textbook. Struggled for a C, barley got major credit. Will avoid his class at all cost in the future. All Psych majors avoid unless you can memorize the whole text, manyyyyy theorists & definitions.",0
"Set own pace, great, get done early, nit picky things hold you up. Mastery based would be good except for the nit pickiness. With APA, I would have liked to take a C and just let that be averaged in. There is no way to do that in this class. You must finish to his perfection level or fail. Very frustrating class. Would be better not online.",0
This is the worst professor I ever had.  Does not answer questions.,0
very nice online class. Professor explained difficult concepts clearly.,1
Honestly this wasn't a bad professor at all. She does not follow the syllabus because she asks the students their opinions on when tests/homework should be due. She teaches quickly but is open for questions and use the chem extra help center!,1
He is so wonderful. The most compassionate prof I've ever met,1
He was a Political Science God!! Did an independent study with him senior year and I feel honored to have learned from him! God bless you Ed!,1
you  literally don't have to do anything in this class to pass,1
Lots of work outside of lab.,0
"His class if very boring, mostly because it's just a review of last semester. You can get a good grade in there pretty easily, but you will get soooo fed up with him by the end of the year. Mostly because he never gives you a straight answer to your questions.",0
Fascinating class and fascinating man.  He made this material interesting and gave me a new awareness for environmental issues.  He is a true gem and an asset to AC.,1
"Never take this professor. He lets you have a page for exams to write down anything you want, but it doesnt help because tests are designed to confuse you, my class avg for the 1st test was a 28% and the extra credit offered due to this was hrs worth of hw for a max of 2%. No point going to class because you usually will spend the time watching TV.",0
Great professor! I didn't like history but he taught me to love it! Very interesting man.,1
Great class. Learned a lot. Connected to real world. Many students participated in class discussion. All take home projects. No exam. Lots of research and writing but easy grade if you put the effort. Guest speakers. Will take MS from him again.,1
"He is really bad at communicating with students. He assumes everyone is a CPA candidate when not everyone is a Finance major. He never learned ""don't assume."" He's is extremely redundant and drags on the class expecting everyone know everything he talks about. The course load is extremely heavy for a once a week course. He is knowledgeable...",1
"An absolute gem of a professor. Her lectures are very engaging, which will help you tons on tests & quizzes. 3 quizzes, 2 midterms, 1 final, and 1 paper. Although the syllabus ""requires"" a book, you will do very well if you just go to class, pay attention, & TAKE NOTES. If you're not an art major and looking to clear GEs, take her! Solid professor.",1
Simply an amazing teacher,1
"He's a nice guy and is willing to help you out whenever you need it, but he expects you to remember a HUGE amount of information for the exams. He is a harsh grader, but he is also very interesting and even brings visual aids. He is a nice teacher and he really does want you to learn. Two hard exams and a tricky 10 pg paper.",1
"She's a decent prof but seemed very indifferent and not caring about students. Exams are weighted 80% a little tricky but she scaled/curves them quite alot. Textbook isn't necessary, the in-class notes are good enough to prepare for exams.",1
"This man is a terrible professor. For his classes, he makes a list of students to pick on and will continually insult them right to the last day of the year. I will give him credit for his knowledge however given that he has edited several book on mannerism's, it is shocking that the subject has never rubbed off on him.  Avoid him if you can.",0
"There is nothing bad to say about this man. Easily one of the best + most engaging professors. He still practices which makes his view on things that much more trustworthy, and interesting. You don't need the textbook to do well; his notes are thorough. Easy, online discussions. Exams: 10 M/C and then approx. 8 short answers. 8-10 page final essay.",1
"Gosh, I love Dr. Behrman! Most definitely, one of the best of the best! Thank you Dr. Behrman, you've taught me great Physics! Hilarious and interesting lectures. Prepare to work for the grade and put some effort into studying (yeah, it's college, get used to working). The grade reflects EFFORT, not performance. Love, love, love.",1
"Had her for lecture and lab. She was very personable and always nice to talk to. She really wants her students to succeed, so she gives a lot of participation marks and even bonus questions! Her online class was structured and organized!",1
"I have never had a more monotonous and pompous professor. He is a sweet guy but tells old jokes he thinks are funny and reiterates the same thing each class. He thinks so highly of himself and generation. Most of the class he rags on the students for being the ""special generation"". DO NOT TAKE HIM. I regret it with every fiber of my being.",0
"He is irrelevant and very biased. Don't disagree with him over anything, there's no point in arguing because it is his way or you're automatically labeled as an imbecile and he'll be biased in grading you following the disagreement. He references the sciences often but cannot be bothered to get his basic physics, biology, and chemistry facts right.",0
"This professor doesn't provide any constructive feedback or rationalization for grades.  Course was: read text, answer questions at end of text, submit a paper based on another question.  Tests are taken from obscure portions of text with no study guide available.  Contact via email was not helpful as he provided no usable feedback.  Unimpressed.",0
He Sucked,0
"Circle time, all the time. We sit around and listen to students present on material they haven't read. Total garbage, I want my money back.",0
"He is an awful professor, the whole lecture is just gibberish. He doesn't even know what he's talking about, and won't answer a simple question even if asked multiple times. He gives his students no encouragement to even come back to class. He makes Composition the worst class ever took. I wouldn't advise selecting him as a professor at all.",0
"Take good notes on lectures and you'll be good. I went to every class before first exam, studied notes, and got a B. Second exam, missed some classes here and there, and wanted to get an A, so I really studied the textbook, but got a D because I studied wrong. He simplifies things in his own working for lectures and tests. Don't skip / have a buddy",1
"Honestly, the best prof I've had so far, he cares so much about his students, and really understands how Covid ruined online school, so he really tries to help you(literally). You're just gonna have to take him, and see what I mean.",1
Erny Ramirez is an EXCELLENT teacher. His classes are extremely fun. Although it can be confusing at times I think that he really makes you think and has very profound insights.,1
There is NO structure to her teaching style whatsoever. She is extremely vague on assignments and gives out meaningless work that have absolutely nothing to do with the course (Midnight Robber). Also completely unprofessional in the classroom with all the unnecessary profanity she used. Ive had to shorten this as much as possible due to word limit,0
"Took 2160 with him a while back and it was the worst experience ever. Will reply sarcastically and embarrass you if you ask questions. This will not be easy. Your will and drive will be tested. As he always says "" We can't all pass, some people have to fail"". Passed the course with a B+ but he really made me work for it. Prepare to self-teach",0
"He was a terrible teacher, very difficult to understand. The SI Sessions saved my grade. He is however, one of the most nicest guys. He cares about his students and education, he just doesn't do good at his job.",0
"He's amazing. I always loved going to his lectures and had fun. He would always crack jokes during the lectures, and he would let us use our notes for the test and the final. I would honestly retake his class for fun.",1
"While Professor Dunn is most certainly not for everyone, I learned more about the world we live in during his class than I have in any other. He makes you fight for your grade (he doesn't ""boost"" them), and frequent participation is your most valuable tool to achieve success in his class. An invaluable educational experience from a brilliant man.",1
One of the most frustrating experience of my college career. There was no justification for her grading beyond silly personal comments. The feedback she gives only insight into her egotistical personalty which you soon learn to placate. She expects you to read her mind and identify with whatever critical perspective of the LONG 3x weekly readings.,0
"Dr. Vohs was a great professor.  He was very helpful when I needed him, and I thought he explained difficult concepts very well.",1
"This was an awful class to start my first year with, he was awful at responding to emails and when he did it was passive aggressive and not any help whatsoever. He threw his students into the deep end and expected us to know what to do each week (as there was no interactive classes only recordings) and we had to teach ourselves. He did not teach us",0
She is an amazing Economics Professor. She is very smart and ready to help you whenever you ask for help. A very well run and organized class with very thoroughly feedback but I also spend a lot of time working on the assignments and studied for the quizzes and exams. Take her if you want to LEARN but you have to put in the work.,1
"""I try not to lecture, but since this is not in the book I guess I have to"" Wendy Reffeor. More or less a direct quote. I dropped this class because of her, the material wasnt hard but she didnt make it easy. She has videos of some material, but are the worst videos ive ever seen, no exaggeration. She tries to do a flipped class and fails. AVOID!!",0
"Dr. Jay is one of the many great professors York has ever had. He is well respected, his lectures are so inspirational that his classes are packed. Infact I had to get special permission to enroll in his class because there was no spots avail. Anyways, I took SOSC1000 last year and it was great, learned alot and this year taking 3000 level course.",1
"Ann is possibly the best professor I have ever had. She is extremely knowledgeable in her field and that makes her lectures so interesting. She teaches in a way that makes you critically engage with the material and perhaps see things in a new light. It is very difficult to get an A in her classes, but what you gain from the course is much greater.",1
"This semester's class was really non-traditional. Video lectures w/ scripts, pass/fail assignments, no exams. The assignments (incl. 2 short essays) make you read, understand, and apply textbook info. Sync. sessions are for Q&A so bring any questions you have. Use/read the forum. Deadlines are given in advance so work at a good pace.",1
"I entered college wanting to be a writer. This class took that away from me. We wrote a paper about someone we admired and I chose my friend that passed away a few months prior. He told me it was garbage, crossed out the entire last 2 pages and told me to start over. Curses WAY too much which I also found inappropriate.",0
If you are not on his good side you are screwed. This man does not have an open-minded bone in his body. You must be able to change your opinion to his opinion if you want to pass. He is irresponsible with scheduling and is just an outright sour human being. Please do not take this class with this professor.,0
"Best Teacher i have ever had! he is full of energy and will help you when you ask for it. He tells you what you need to do to succeed in his class on the first day. Read the book, come to class, try on your speeches, and your golden!",1
"Nobody is more passionate or knowledgeable about what they lecture on. He quotes passages from the text, and other texts that sometimes aren't even part of the course, from memory at length. I left every one of his lectures feeling like I knew more than I did an hour ago. A ton of fun whether or not philosophy is your thing.",1
Mantone is easily one of the best math prof's i've ever had. she's really good at explaining concepts in a different way and has a good sense of humor about her lectures. her new york accent is hardly noticeable once you're used to being in her class. i recommend her to any future math 105 students,1
"Jones is probably one of the best professors in the EET program, but he is very demanding in terms of book work. I recommend not taking more than one of his classes during a single semester, but highly recommend him as a professor.",1
"After reading reviews, I thought I could understand that she sometimes needs time off for her MS. But taking this class is FRUSTRATING! Prof & TAs pass duties off each other, questions not answered. Will inform students last minute abt exams, or addressing concerns. 80% of mark from Connect ($$) & tested on inane facts. Not there to help us learn.",0
worst prof ever,0
Take this class with CAUTION!,0
"I took Professor Newmans online course. He gives a list of what work will be due in the syllabus before the course starts,which gives you the opportunity to finish the course early. You will use his book,be prepared to read. He responds to emails clearly. I totally recommend his course ,you will learn a lot about government.",1
"Dr. Wong is a really nice person, but I can't stand the class. I have yet to learn anything useful. The writing prompts & papers aren't hard, but they're pointless. Her rubrics and instructions are wayyy too complicated too-even for a 400-level class. Sometimes I feel like she talks to us like high schoolers instead of future high school teachers.",0
"Read and ""Practice"" what he gives. Don't study text book. His sample papers will be easy but exam will be really tough and confusing. No assignments. No attendence.  Russian accent. Only problems even though he gives theoretical questions in sample paper. RTT is a must read topic.",0
"do not try to help you. he says smart remarks. he will not give study sheets, do not take him please.",0
"Amazing lecturer and although he doesn't use slides, the way he present keeps you interested and listening throughout. Personally, I liked not having slides because I pay all my attention to listening and not copy-pasting slides as my notes. Don't miss class though because it is difficult to catch up and yes, he makes you work for a good grade. ",1
"He grades as if this is a class full of Harvard scholars. The class is supposed to be an easy first year class, but was not treated like one. I struggled to even get a B. He is the worst professor I have ever taken and I would not recommend him to anyone. Expect lots of homework and for your GPA to drop.",0
"Wonderful person, but horrible teacher. Does not actually lecture, but she will play video upon video. She does not teach. Her tests are ridiculously hard and are all short answer/essay. The first test was 32 short answer/essay questions!!!! You will have to teach yourself AND finish the ridiculous repetitive and useless online biology homework.",0
"Extremely clear, class is usually really quick, no hw, no text book, easy tests because he's an amazing teacher.",1
"I haven't really learned anymore, its only a lecture class, no participation",0
"Very very boring, easier to learn from text.",0
"Prof. Barnes was a very horrible professor. She constantly goes off topic while teaching and you will learn absolutely nothing. She grades speaches extremely hard and leaves rude comments along with the grades. I took her class after reading all of these good comments. However, it was a huge mistake. I will finish with and A but shes still horrible",0
One of the worst eecs profs. He is clueless outside of math theory. Doesn't know any coding languages. doesn't know how to teach effectively. test's and exams are really difficult. not worth the time investment because you won't learn anything.,0
"Wow... just wow. Horrible class, seriously take anything else. Maybe even change your major. Grades absolutely nothing and makes the exams as hard as she possibly can. Seriously trust me do not take this class. Every single exam was curved at least 20-30 points and it barely helped. Hands down worst class structure and worst prof Ive ever had.",0
hard but great at explaining,1
very unclear about many specifics when it came to assignments and would mark extremely harsh especially for any small errors such as format of code and organization,0
"Had him for freshman year seminar. His choice of books were really interesting, he didnt disappoint, and he always started by asking us a questions which ended up being the funniest way to start class. He is kind, give leniency when needed, and is very helpful. Honestly he is the best professor and mentor.",1
"I strongly disagree.  I found him extremely fair, approachable, and thought he had penetrating insight into fiction.   He is a great editor.  He is listed as a popular prof in Macleans university special, and rightly so!",1
This course is a complete waste of money and time. This guy has no idea what hes doing hes terrible. Professor Thompson does nothing more than read off The overhead projector its obvious he has no idea what the cost is about. Long boring lectures that have nothing to do with what youre going to be tested on sad so very sad. Take another class,0
"Seriously, amazing. This professor does literally everything she can to help her students pass a class with difficult content. Be nice to her.",1
"This guy gives a LOT of reading for homework, but you don't have to read them most of the time because he just rereads it during class. He didn't teach much about English - we just read essays in class and he expected us to know how to write essays right off the bat. I wouldn't recommend him for a person who isn't good at English.",1
"I loved Dr. C's teaching style. She brought in lots of different content like interactive activities, videos, etc that kept my attention. She was a delight. She also lets you use your notes on the tests.",1
"Took 191 and 193 (same prof) online at the same time  lots of busywork. I thought the online version would be better, but it requires a lot more time. She is a picky grader (cannot use contractions in your writing, for example). Test and weekly quizzes are ridiculously hard. She gives good feedback and lots of extra credit if you sweat for it.",0
"Professor Howard is one of the hardest, unclear professors I have had so far in college. Aside from being unclear, he is an EXTREMELY hard grader. If you mess up a little section of an essay for a test, you will be graded down immensely for it even if you did great on the other parts of the test. I would not to take this class/prof ever again!!",0
Child maltreatment was probably one of the most pointless classes I have taken. Professor DeYoung was not clear with her directions at all. I gave her everything she asked for on a paper and basically ripped me apart for not following the paper guidelines when I did everything she asked for. I would NOT recommend this class!,0
This man is the reason I gave up engineering my third year into the program.,0
"I never thought it would be possible to laugh so hard and learn at the same time.  This guy should be a stand-up comic.  Also, he has a nice body!  The added bonus is you'll learn alot in his class!!",1
Both he and this class were ok. I just wish he used PowerPoint slides instead of lecturing the whole class.,0
This was the best class I have taken at Oberlin thus far. If you need a class to take just for credit purposed. TAKE THIS CLASS!!! Tom is an amazing instructor and his good at what he does.,1
"Hard class. Took AP Calculus in high school, passed with an A, my grade in this class isn't even close to that. Lapp is definitely a smart man with a good heart, but the way he teaches the class is very difficult to grasp.",0
Absolutely do not take this man's class. He relies on the online textbook and you to teach yourself. He didn't interact with the class at all for it being a Social Psych class. This class was horrible and the professor was ineffective.,0
"Mrs. Smith is totally unorganized. She lies about exam grades. The exams are spread out over long periods and on many different topics. I found that she doesn't count that well.  For example,I made a 108 on exam one but she wrote down 98 because she forgot to add the ten points from another part of the exam. Good luck with this looney bin!",0
do not take this class! he is unclear and does not know what he is talking about half the time.  he is the worst teacher I have ever taken.,0
"He's a cool guy and a brilliant musician, but I do not like how he taught this class. He jumps way ahead to things you don't need to know yet which makes it confusing and challenging, and then doesn't spend enough time on what you should be learning.  He is very disorganized in his teaching. The homework was often impossible and not helpful.",0
He wants everything perfect! I missed a test and one assignment and he still failed me with letter D as my final grade!!! Even if I had passed my other assignments he still managed to fail me. On top of that; he does have due dates and no late work is accepted.  Will not take  his class again!,1
"This professor does make jokes but he teaches more then anything, If a student is really listening they will hear that he is teaching unless they are sleeping in the back of the room, took him for this class and I learned what no other teacher at Molly could teach me: to work hard and value me as a person. He helps the students and guides them too.",1
"I loved having Mrs. Kurtz as a teacher this year! She is very funny and silly when she needs to be, but serious enough for class. I greatly enjoyed taking this math class from her and would highly recommend taking from her!!!",1
Memorize the textbook and you will be fine. Your grade in this class all depends on how bad you want it.,0
"At first I hated this class, but he actually grows on you.  It has been an interesting class, and I've learned a bunch.",1
Terrible teacher. Take A201 with a different professor over the summer. Much easier.,0
"She was a very good teacher. I took her SOC101 in class and her Woman Soc127 online.  She was very helpful and very understanding if you were sick or had and emergency, she would let you make up this under these circumstances. Overall pretty fare teacher and not bias at all. Knew her material and was a good teacher.",1
"This guy is crazy. He teachs this class like a Math 140 class. His tests are crazy, but he does offer 50points in extra cerdit. You can not read his hand writing and he makes a lot of mistakes when writing on the board. He does like everyone to try and understand what hes doing but he doesnt do a good job of teaching it. Do not recommend taking him",0
"He tells us to just accept what he's presenting without explaining why sometimes. Crams too much into lecture, with many mistakes in notes, and there is too much material. The problems we are required to know how to solve are given step by step instructions. Class seems to focus more on memorization than understanding concepts",0
"I took Bull's class this semester, and I don't regret it. He's nice and cracks jokes during class, and showing up isn't really mandatory, making this class an easy A. If you're looking for a real biology class, this ain't it, bc I learned more about forensics than anything else. I ended up not having to take the last test because I already had an A",1
This professor has super long and super boring lectures. The only grades are 6 quizzes and two exams. The exams are worth 80% of your grade. The content is very science heavy and the lectures are so monotone and boring its impossible to pay attention.,0
"Soares is a great teacher who is lecture heavy and sometimes goes a little bit too fast- but if you tell him, he will slow things down as well as making it simpler. Webassign HW due at the end of the week (time consuming). 3 tests and a final. Tests were pretty difficult- but if you go to OH he is very helpful. Nice guy, sometimes makes bad jokes",1
"There's no point in even showing up for class because you have to self teach yourself. But don't let that be a turn on for you for the class. Can never hear what she says when she goes over the power points and she spends approx. 3 sec. per slide ""explaining"". I just passed the class. If it was essential for my major, I would've dropped it.",0
"Sweet guy. Likes to tell stories, and can lecture for a long time- basically the whole class. Did show a couple videos which were interesting. If you are a visual learner, this class will be VERY challenging, since it is based on lecture with little guidelines. Recommend to do a couple bigger research papers, rather than many smaller ones.",0
Shel was an amazing professor to have. He was passionate about his material and made the 8:30 time slot entertaining with his jokes.,1
VERY DISORGANIZED COURSE. His grading criteria was not clear whatsoever!!! He barely assigned any homework or questions and did not give us enough feedback on our progress. He took forever to grade anything and did not even give us back out mathematical epic essays that ended up being taken as pass or fail. He did not prepare us well for the final.,0
"The assignments are relatively the same each week: read the chapter, do the practice test, and then a quick quiz on the previous weeks chapter. I never once touched the book. On one of the class project assignments, I did not do it right, so I emailed him and he responded right away. He explained where I went wrong and allowed me to resubmit.",1
I had her during the pandemic and she didn't even teach us. She posted recorded lectures from 2016 and more recently edited slides so they didn't even match up. We did not have a single meeting face to face. The only grades were 4 Tests. I did like the material that was taught just not the way it was taught. Take the class in person not online!!,0
Enjoyed the opportunity to work with a client. He keeps his lectures interesting and makes sure everyone understands what's going on. Portfolio class represented the real-world workflow which I appreciated. Graduating by plan to speak highly of DC from my experience.,1
"He has a dry and cynical sense of humor that may not be fore everyone but he's literally one of the best, fairest, and most helpful professors. Dr. Thompson is great and the review made on 12/21/10 is hilarious. Dr. Thompson? Acting tough and gangster? Did you come to class high?",1
"Very apathetic about if students are learning or not-assumes students aren't trying. Will give you flat zero on a problem if not answered the EXACT way he wants it answered. I've gotten straight A's in all math classes at Tech except the 2 classes I'd had with this guy, and I probably worked twice as hard in his classes too, so something's wrong.",0
Dara is the best!  She is so helpful!  Her lessons are clear and precise.  Her tests are hard but fair.,1
"This online course was fantastic, everything was well organized on Dr. Kelley's part and she was very accessible throughout the semester. Easy A if you stay on top of things, however, as with most online classes-if you fall behind, it can quickly get out of hand. Overall I highly recommend this educated and kind professor.",1
"Loomis is one of the most passionate teachers I have ever had. He's a goofy old man, who is very knowledgeable of his subject. With that said, he is tough. His tests are almost all essay, and you will read. If your interested in Literature, definitely take Loosmis.",1
Easy A. Do your work and the A is yours.,1
He LOVES to repeat himself time and time again. The first 6 weeks were redundant. Its a little hard to understand his lecturing due to accent. Lots of times people would be yelled at after asking questions. I would NEVER take him again. If you missed class or are late YOU WILL be called out for it. Group project is worked on through term.,0
"Professor Engelsgaard is... interesting. She likes to drag assignments out (like the class wicked question, we spent 4 weeks on it and we're behind now on the personal question). She is very nice and does care for her students. Just make sure you are on her good side.",0
"I took BSEN 395 with Professor Bowal Fall 2017 and based on RateMyProfessor I was expecting the class to be difficult, and I was not wrong. If you go into this class with Bowal expect to study hard for tests, but expect to LEARN. READ THE CASES and be prepared for class and you will have one of the best learning experiences.",1
Grinnell is one of the nicest men I have ever encountered. Wants every student to do well and is extremely helpful. Seems very interested in things that student say about the readings. You only need to buy the 3 books that you will read in the beginning of the semester. Take this man as much as possible!,1
"Ok don't get me wrong, she's a nice woman and was accessible outside of class but if you need to take a class to fulfill a requirement, look for someone else or wait until the next semester. She provides feedback that isn't that helpful and when you ask for help, she basically tells you to settle for a lower grade.",0
"Absolutely horrible proffesor. Sugarcoated my standing in the class when asking her if I should withdraw. Tests are not similar to what you learn in class. Showed up to class everyday and spent hours in tutoring and still failed. Was not clear when asked about my final(made me believe I passed). Do NOT take her class, seriously stay away.",0
"Hands down to professor Lattier! Best professor of all my semesters! I enjoyed his classes a lot! His lectures are very entertaining! He gives good feedback, and he has an amazing character! I'm very motivated thanks to this professor! He has given me the opportunity to have a more understanding about business.",1
"Worst professor yet. Hw and exam is a 400 word personal essay (informal). He reads everything directly out of the book with not explanation. He rambling a lot and gives unclear on essay assignment. He incapable of help you improve ur writing skill. he will noted when you received help even if you went to a tutor, he'll tell you not to do that again",0
"You just need to buy a blue book, get stamps (every 2 weeks probably), and all the projects are online, so you can do some research before submitting them. She grades easily. Overall. she is an easy A. Very recommended.",1
Doesnt teach you what you need for the assignments,0
"You never know what is going on in this class. He tells unrelated stories, and can never get through any of the material he is supposed to. He doesn't test over the material he tells you he is going to. Take a different professor if you can!",0
"Worst prof Ive ever had avoid if possible!! Heavy textbook readings, articles then tested on the smallest details. Doesnt lecture, uses class time for discussion then brushes off all student concerns. Time consuming discussions worth almost nothing, TAs do all the work for him. I was constantly ignored when asking questions, extremely rude prof",0
"Woefully ill equipped to teach an online class. No white board, ppt or excel, just him on webcam for 3+ hours. He expects you to read the chapters before class and do the homework before the material has been taught, then come to class with questions so he can answer them verbally, which nobody can follow. Run from this COVID online class!",0
"most classes, he came off as very rude in regards to how he communicates. talks over you and -- which can make the classroom setting unsettled. aside from that, do your work and show up to class, and your grade for that class should be fair.",0
"I love her classes. She has lots of work over the materials, but I feel they give the student an opportunity to understand the contents of the course, instead of just passing a class for a grade. She's encouraging and helpful when needed. Her course is layed out and able to finish early if one desires. Multiple retakes on quizzes. Great teacher",1
"a very challenging course and he isn't the greatest professor so if you're in this course, good luck with it!",0
"This is my second class with Trussler and he is amazing. Definitely expands your horizons. If you talk with him and challenge him, he will respect you. Same with essays - go beyond! I almost failed his lit class and came out with an 85%. Understanding, intelligent and extremely helpful.",1
"First of all, its not the easiest class in the world, and it certainly didnt help that Rayburn didnt seem to care to actually TEACH the material...pretty much he just told you to do it and whether you not you already knew how to do it or not didnt matter. Hopefully if you take this class, you are able to look at the book and just teach yourself...",0
"Awesome guy, I graduated 2 years ago and he is probably one of my favorites. He loves classroom engagement and does these crazy quirky assignments that make you think but I loved them. By far one of the best WCSU has to offer! Great guy",1
hated her! very unhelpful!,0
He is honestly the best professor. He teaches so well and if you don't understand he will easily help you in office hours. He cares about his students. He's overall a great professor if you pay attention you will definitely pass your tests and the class.,1
"She's a nice person, but her class is really hard especially if you're not good at biology. She's an easy grader on assignments but they're super difficult.",1
"You actually have to do work for the class, but the readings are very interesting so therefore it's easy to keep up. All the tests are written, but Dr. A explains the material thoroughly. The class was not only about feminism, but rather about political factors that affect feminism and the lifestyles of women around the globe. Very interesting.",1
ugh!!,0
"Dr. Hyser is so helpful. 395 is generally a terrible class but if you have to take it, TAKE IT WITH HYSER. He structures due dates for sections of your paper,which is really helpful. He'll give you a bunch of opportunities to have him read your rough drafts, use them! I went to him a bunch of times and kept following all his corrections, got an A!",1
"His lectures are usually pretty clear, but can get boring after a while. His exams are tough but can be prepared for by reading through his lectures. Problem sets were graded very generously. He was usually a pretty nice and engaging guy but some days he would just be in a bad mood.",1
"This guy's class is so-so, but what threw me off was the not so subtle Anti-Catholic views expressed in the class. (He once handed out material on why the Sisters of Mercy were an evil organization--which had absolutely nothing to do with the material we were discussing.)",0
"good professor but his tests are much harder than others out there.  problems on tests are difficult and advanced as if everyone in the class is upper level finance major.  doesnt explain well - had to teach it to myself.  try to take someone else, but if you get ervin its not the end of the world.  problem is you need C to get credit - hard to do.",1
Hes a funny guy. His tests arent bad and the essay paper is alright. If you listen and study the notes youll be fine.,1
"I am not sure how she still teaches this class. Her tests were made up of pieced together google tests and EVERY test there were correction errors and sometimes she said ""I would have to google it."".. I CAN GOOGLE IT!  Her study guides were not what you were tested on. Does offer extra credit via corrected tests",0
I had him for a once a week class and he missed at least 6 days out of the 16 week semester. He would give us the test cover (example) chapter 1-11 and we would have onlygone through chapter 1-9. So he would cover the chapters after the test. I got an A on midterms but final was 35% of grade. He makes us buy his book in order to get an A,0
"He is not a great teacher, but he grades papers so EASY! His tests are not the easiest, but they are definitely not hard either.  Easy A for me at least.",1
Two tests. Gives you the question which is great. But doesn't teach the questions and how to solve it. St John's needs someone else to teach this class because he is the only professor that teaches this class and he really can't teach. He bases off the power points from a textbook. Doesn't even prepare class materials himself.,0
"Mrs. Wolfsen's a great instructor, her classes are inspiring and not hard with the work load. She's has a lot of videos that relate to class, especially for Gender Communication, so don't slack off! Do the work and you'll get a 4.0, love her!",1
"Dr. Maher is nice, his class however, is the most unorganized, frustrating, and annoying course I have taken in all of my undergraduate career. His exams were all essay-based, taken in a lockdown browser with the only material to prepare about 100 pages of reading a week. He was not equipped for online learning. I paid three dollars for the final.",0
"Fast talking, hard to keep up with, and gets off track a lot. I had his 3 hour class and I could not take sitting there listening to him speak! It was so boring and most of the time he did not let us out for a break. His tests are hard. You have to write two essays and he does not grade them generously. He knows what he's talking about, though.",0
"An amazing prof, really interesting and fun to listen to, and you can tell he cares about and is genuinely interested in the subject matter that he teaches. If you pay attention, you're sure to pass and do well. (Be careful in this course though, as the prof for the second half of the course is not as great).",1
he is so good that i earnd a million the year after,1
"DO NOT TAKE HER CLASSES. She expects you read more than hundreds pages before every lectures. Her lectures is the most boring I had ever have in UW, also the most unclear. I don't understand why UW would hire her. She is not even community college level professor.",0
"Professor Miller is eccentric. He has a good heart and passion for his teaching, but is incredibly repetitive. His jokes get stale fast and the majority of the learning we did was reading old papers from previous students he handed out. He answers emails, but otherwise avoids technology. He gives out an absurd amount of paper. Buy a large binder.",0
Very nice teacher and likes to add humor to his lectures. Lectures mainly consist of his personal stories and how they relate to sociology. He does not discuss everything in the textbook so it is important to read through it.,1
"absolute worst professor i have ever had in my life. I had to retake the class because she failed me with a 72. She may or may not be clinically crazy. Her tests are impossible, she is extremely lazy, she gives you one day to do hw. makes you hate microbiology bc shes so awful.",0
He is an overall nice guy. He is very clear during lectures and cares about his students.,1
Dr. Ahmad does very little explanation for essay topics and has a habit of going off on random tangents that take up to half the class time. She is extremely confusing during lectures and can be difficult to follow. You never really know how to ask for more explanation without setting her off.,0
"One of the worst program coordinators and prof, She doesn't help students in any way and always blames students about everything even though she can't teach! I really don't know how she became a program coordinator, has never been helpful in any way. One of the main reasons students don't do well in this program because she teaches intro to prog!",0
"Very interactive learning. Most classes are dedicated to explanation and demonstration of terms, attendance is mandatory. Very easy going with grades, she's more concerned that you're learning and understanding conflict resolution. She's a kind lady :)",1
"This man has the passion to really make his subject matter come alive. Excellence is the only standard he accepts, and so you must work hard accordingly, but in exchange he will do almost anything to help you understand.  A truly inspiring man.  If you are willing to work hard, an A is within your reach.",1
Great guy :),1
"She was not clear on certain explanations and assignments. She just assumes that you know how to do everything. She makes you feel like you are beneath her, makes you feel very dumb. I worked hard in this class and she never liked any work i turned in and i worked very hard.",0
One of the best Math professors and professors in general. Is always there to help you and is flexible with due dates. (He understands we have a life outside of school) If you can take him do!,1
"This is hands down the worst professor I have ever taken a class with. Please heed my advice and don't listen to the other reviews and get fooled like I did. Maybe at one time Jeff was a good teacher, but now, I wouldn't even call him a teacher because he does. not. teach. He drones on about irrelevant things & tells people their OPINIONS are wrong",0
Effectively trys to provide a top tier level of ACC at a local regional level.  He has high expectations for his students.,1
Terrible... Tests were ridiculously hard because she puts you in a situation to most likely fail. Do yourself a favor and get out of this class. I got A+ and A's in all my other classes and a B in sociology. I also worked the hardest in this course because I knew it was gonna be the hardest. Take sociology with a different proffessor if your intere,0
"Has no clear guidelines but expects so much. He gets mad when the class does bad but when you ask him what to study, he'll call it ""fishing for answers."" ""Fishing"" makes him even madder and he says if we ""fish"" the test will get harder. He asks questions on content he hasn't taught and expects you to know it.",0
"Professor Smith's class was pretty easy, quizzes during and after each chapter that you can find the answers to in the text. She requires you to do a blog research paper on The trail of Tears which is 20% of your grade. I passed with a 94 and I made a 83 on my paper. Pretty easy class. 4 total tests/exams.",1
Prof Epley is a nice lady who grades fairly. There was only a total of 3 full essays wrote of 1200 words or more. Everything was pretty simple. She was a sign of relief for a first year college student. Engage in the class discussions! Overall she was a good teacher who is clear about expectations and assignments.,1
"I found his lectures to be extremely hard to follow, his examples were lacking, and he was unable to answer questions for those students who were not in love with mathematics.",0
"He is very strict. Don't ever think he would accept your excuses, for example, when you forget to bring i-clicker for the quiz, he'll NOT let you write the answers down and turn it in to make up for it. He simply just tell you that's what you get for forgetting to bring your i-clicker. His lectures were pretty good though. Very enthusiastic.",1
Class was online. The textbooks that we ere told that we needed were something that we barely used. The guy seems to have a nice personality and has things set up to where if you need help he is easy to contact. Directions were super clear for all of his assignments. We wrote a total of seven papers in this English composition class.,1
"I took this man last year and put it to you this way. He was the reason I changed my major from Psychology to Communications.  Intro to Psychology should not resemble medical school.  My own advisor told me never to take him again and avoid him at all costs.  He talks fast and it's hard to take notes, tests are impossible, wound up with a C.  Blah.",0
"This was the worst prof I ever had. Don't bother taking her. She is so rude, very un understanding and extremely tough grader. You have to do everything exactly the way she wants it or you will fail. Her lectures are also extremely boring . Also make sure you're never late because she will take points off.",0
"Lectures got to be very accelerated towards the end, and it became very difficult to follow along with what was going on. However, the three tests are very easy and you will be prepared if you do the practice midterms and review homework.",1
Arrogant and rude. She forces her political and religious beliefs onto the class and makes it well known that she is VERY liberal. She made me feel inferior since day one. Strongly recommend NOT taking her if at all possible. Not to mention her tests are incredibly difficult.,0
"Boring, difficult to listen to lectures. You have to write exactly what he wants for papers, or you miss massive points. Avoid if possible.",0
"He is a really smart guy but he is really not that great of a lecturer.  Hard A, B is more than managable.  Despite his talking in circles I learned a lot and would take him again without hesitation.",1
"I love this professor and wish that I could have him as a prof for all of my bio classes. 100/10 recommend taking his classes! He is super sweet and funny, he is also very flexible and genuinely cares about his students!",1
"Great guy, bad professor. He cares about his subject and students but struggles to convey the lessons. However he is quite easy to at least get a B. You'll come to class, you'll laugh, maybe cry and leave confused but you will get a good grade.",0
"First time to comment, Professor Camaj is terrific, take him if you can. He is very caring and helpful. He wants you to succeed, and he wants to help you. I like him a lot, and I will retake him if I can. Tests and quizzes are not hard, pay attention to lectures and review; you will be fine.",1
He is a really good professor and would love to have teachers like that in all of my classes.,1
Dr. Lands was not the best professor. Her tests were extremely hard and you have to do a lot of reading. Her tests also used webcam which was annoying. She also never responds to emails. I definitely wouldn't take her if history is a subject you struggle with.,0
"This is a difficult class, but George is excellent. He uses different teaching methods to ensure the lessons are learned.",1
I am 99% sure this professor just makes up words during lecture to sound smart.,0
"Its very tough to do well here unless youre a native speaker. Favoritism is rampant & melanin seems to interfere with his hearing aids. The more you have, the less you are heard. The grading criteria varies without warning & you will not know how your grade will turn out until its already over. Take his overall rating literally.",0
a professor who is passionate about art while still acting goofy from time to time. he will make you smile and inspire you to take your piece to the next level. take his ceramics class if you want to become a better artist with a great work ethic--really prepares you for the art world!,1
"One of the worst experiences I have ever had with a professor. Highly condescending towards students, even when they are simply asking for help. Seton hall should stop regarding some professors so highly especially when they care so little for their students.",0
"Honestly the WORST professor I've had in my college experience. Expects students to make 500-word discussion posts and 250-word responses (to five different students). That's basically a 7 page MLA formatted paper. Everyone just types nonsense to get the word count. But, if you do try - she nitpicks every single thing. Her harshness is unmotivating",0
The reason I'm enjoying Humanities so far is this professor. I would not have grasped the concepts otherwise. Very clear and great 1 on 1 explanations. Tough? yes- but for a reason. Full of himself? he has a reason to be. You want a professor worth your tuition? Deal with it.,1
"McEvoy for Business Law, never again. 50% of your grade is a 12 page paper on a topic she picks and the other 50% is the final exam. Lectures are boring and she is rude. Out of touch with technology and makes you send the final exam through the mail, no electronic submissions. You fill in notes during class in a typewriter booklet from 2010",0
"Pas assez interactif. Très linéaire. Il me semble très passionné et crédible, il a également un bon vocabulaire mais n'est pas capable de nous faire participer et s'intéresser a la matière. J'ai l'impression d’assister a une messe...",0
"There tended to be confusion on the grading scale often. Rogers course was simply laid out, PowerPoint then group quiz. There was a research paper at the end of the course. She is a difficult women to get ahold of. On the plus side, she is incredibly good natured- she jokes and allows for discussion within the class.",1
He wants students to do well and gets disappointed if you don't show up for class. Doing the homework is important as the tests are strictly homework problems but he answers any questions you have.,1
"Dr. Buder Shapiro is a real one. If you show up to class when no one else is really there, she'll give out extra credit. Her tests are so easy if you study for a little while, and the homework assignments take 20 minutes tops. You don't even need to get a 90% to get an A- and EIGHTY SIX will suffice! She loves her job and is super chill. Love her.",1
"I had a lot of trouble in this class. Her assignments made no sense an I often found myself stressing over due dates because she was so unclear about assignments. I love science, but this teacher has made me resent teaching the subject. I dread going to this professors class because she never gives us any breaks and we often have to stay late.",0
"Great professor, very knowledgeable, funny in a dry way. This class helped my pronunciation so much. However a lot of the material can be dense and hard to wrap your head around if you don't have prior linguistics experience or have a genuine interest in it. A lot of studying and work but worth it in my opinion.",1
"Personally, I would not recommend her at all. She is a tough grader and when she gives feedback, it sometimes sounds demeaning. She corrects assignments to the point that it sounds more like her writing than your's.  However, I do have some good things to say about her: she is intelligent and picks good literature.",0
Quirky personality and very interested in what he teaches. Discourages students with hurtful comments and is very unorganized- often misplaces students work (but blames the student).,0
"Ms lee is true professional she is amazing explain everything and you can understand very fast every problems, she goes through steps by steps also she is kind , I would like to take more classes for her",1
Professor Panek is a very tough grader and designs her test and assignments to specifically test those who attend every single lecture and pay very close attention. If you do not go to her classes and take detailed notes on everything she teaches you will not pass.,0
"I am a recent graduate, and Nina was my saving grace at CMU. She provided creative outlets through choir, and challenged me to be the great musician that I became over my years as a vocal student. I had several voice teachers, but Nina was the one that taught me the most about music and responsibility. Do yourself a favor and join her choirs. ",1
Duff is one of the best instructors here! I love not only going to class but learning from him. He is helpful inside and outside the classroom. As long as you go and pay attention he is not to hard. Great professor!,1
This guy will make you want to change your major. ,0
"He is very smart in the programming sense. Other than that, he is condescending to students, and uses the lab time as extra lecture time. his classes consist of him reading code to you over the projector. you barely get class time to practice. this is a course you learn by doing, and he doenst let you do much.",0
You should take it with her..You'll have great experience.,1
I took stats with Tyne and thought she was wonderful.  HOWEVER. Her new version of calc is mostly online with a recitation type class meeting time. ENDLESS clicker questions and weekly quizzes that are a nightmare. She takes the HARDEST POSSIBLE questions and puts them all on a quiz. Very rude in class and took everything personally. ,0
"Definitely one of the worst professors I've ever had. He is so lost in class, making the students feel lost as well. His syllabus lacks assignments except the final paper. When he says he'll get something the next day, he'll forget, and then forget again the next day. Lectures are almost the same everyday. Extremely boring. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS",0
"If you show up, get all the notes, and attend concerts then this will be an easy A. There is hardly homework, but do study for the tests. ONE OF THE BEST.",1
Horrible. Never had a worse professor in my entire college career.,0
Beyond boring! she is so unorganized and that stresses you out so much. Worst class ever !,0
You will learn nothing in this class.,0
Easy class everything flows care about her students,1
"CHIEUX  !!! pas de classe, commentaires ****es. pédophile, emmerdeur, ne connait rien a sa matiere et veut faire croire qu'il est connaisseur !",0
You won't find another teacher who will make you focus more on music making. I think too many people focus on the technical problems and think that's all they need to worry about. He is undeniably one of the best trumpeters in the country. He just won BU's highest teaching award as well. No one deserves his position more than he does.,1
"To start off, He might look like Gandhi, but he does not teach like him. He Gives a tremendous work load, and only wants you to write verbatim to what he says. If you are a little off topic then you cannot get higher than a C- on his papers.shout out to the pics on the camera.I do not recommend this prof to anyone unless you are a filipino women.",0
It was my first online class. There were the office hours every week.  There was requirement to write 3 or more comments on the discussion on the Blackboard for credit. To get 80% on homework we could submit the answer 4 or 5 times. Tests wasn?t easy but final was simple. She is a great professor if you want to have Math knowledge.,1
"Wendy makes her classes unnecessarily difficult. Disregarding mandatory attendance (taken before and after class) that takes up 10min out of a 50min period, her coding assignments are marked on a pass/fail basis; and conveniently handed back the day before the drop date so you can join the third of the class that dropped CSC225 this term.",0
"I dreaded attending this class every week.  The lectures were very boring and tests were tedious.  Not a particularly hard grader on tests, but the class was just painfully dull.",0
"Just because Wen Zhang has a Ph.D. in math doesn't mean that her intelligence will rub off on you. She expects you to follow along as she skips critical steps in proofs and problems. Her accent isn't that bad, but her teaching style is.",0
I freaking love monica. seriously best bio teacher. She is so nice and is the bomb and so cool and just really helpful and accessible and wants you to do well.,1
Renee is a great teacher. 3D is a very hard class and is alot of work but she is there to help you get through it instead of critize your ideas. She is very approachable and makes her class very enjoyable. Take her class if you can shes awesome,1
"Dr. Woods is very unorganized , and she does not put in grades on D2L so check on your grades frequently. The class was easy, many presentations and quizzes. Attendance is mandatory during presentations, because you will be required to do peer reviews. This is a big part of the grade that is not listed in the syllabus.",0
"If you do not go to class, you will not pass, even if you get the ""notes"" from a friend. She lectures VERY heavily and uses NO teaching aid whatsoever. Lectures consist of an outline, meaning she will write one word on the board and talk about it for 20 minutes. She doesn't emphasize important information so you're blindsided even when you study :(",0
"If you are not great in English, DO NOT TAKE HIM. I always did as he said, I asked him for help and ideas and I still got a C- in this class. ENG 4 and ENG 15 are exactly the same if you take him.",1
"I learned a lot from this class, but I definitely had to work for it. Markwell is very liberal and says what hes thinking so be prepared for that.  Help is definitely there when you ask for it. Luckily there are no quizzes or tests. ",1
I personally loved Meade. He thoroughly explains most topics and genuinely wants you to do well in the class. Focuses more on your thought process than the actual answer. You HAVE to read what he assigns and truly take time to understand it. He likes books that challenge the reader.,1
Terrible attitude toward students. Unprofessional. Severely unorganized. I would avoid this professor completely.,0
"If you're in any way considering dropping out because you had a boring, low-energy prof (like I did with Professor Jeffers), then stick with it so you can get Professor MacIntosh. He explains things in a very easy to understand way, and tests are relatively easy as he makes sure to grind the information into your skull, in a funny, interesting way.",1
He's a nice guy and a decent lecturer. His handwriting is pretty undesirable though. He loves to talk about his experience and does it a bit too much at times. He also is not very clear in his financial analysis. His class is not too exciting and he is a little lazy at times. He doesn't pick on people in class usually. Make sure you run the numbers,1
"hard to know what to expect. quizzes are super similar to test, problems hardly change. hw is not required and useless. can treat you like an idiot frequently when asking a question, in lecture or msg. Lots of bonus on tests. Unclear class / lesson structure. teaches material well though. stickler with partial credit. WRITE YOUR THT PRCSS.",1
"Definitely recommend. Matt's interdisciplinary approach to phenomena is fascinating - perfect for geographers! In-class discussions and weekly Canvas responses monitor participation. However, lectures were too slow for me and readings too long, so I skipped about half and did just fine. A fair amount of writing: 3 short essays and 1 final paper.",1
His notes are very vague and he does not explain what he is doing. The tests are multiple choice but difficult.,0
His lecture are so dry. Very boring..,0
"professor Robinson is something. He is overworked, underpaid, and understaffed. He tries to teach, but he just goes over formulas in class not HW. Tests are online in his labs and you need a 80 to pass on each in order to take the next test. He doesn't ask any questions and gives just about no help. If you just do  HW and study, you'll get a B",0
"The most interesting lecture professor I've had. If you don't go, you def won't pass. Super helpful outside of class. Super funny & respected. Tests are not as hard as people make them seem. Go to class and study the week before and you'll be fine. Incredibly biased, so if you're political be ready to be super annoyed. Still a good guy.",1
"Class is easy, exams and homeworks are definately NOT.",0
"Dr. Levesque gives the most incomprehensible lectures.  She rambles on about minutiae and it's difficult to see the big picture.  As a result I felt like I learned very little, and I had to teach myself.  The tests require you to memorize an enormous amount of material.",0
"Critical thinking at its finest! His lectures are heavy but he speaks thoroughly & helps make it relatable. There are 3 exams, 2 papers, & group in-class work that he grades us on. The class is 100pts so do the work, study his lecture, meet him up if help is needed & getting an A is easy! You will actually work/learn the material, dont be afraid!",1
"We get it Hassold you're smart and you have a PHD in physics. That doesn't mean he knows how to teach. And you would think that being a teacher would involve adapting to newer mindsets. Psych. Get ready to get your head bitten off if you mess up, and get ready to deal with a stubborn teacher who only cares about proving he's smarter than you. Ugh.",0
"Doesnt explain anything in class, so labs and assignments are hell, but the midterms and final are relatively easy compared to it.",0
"A great professor if you want to actually understand accounting, not so great if all you want from the class is an A. His lectures are more focused on understanding concepts than solving problems so they won't get you ready for the test. Class is manageable if you do the homework and go to his office hours.  ",1
"This class is really ""Teach yourself Digital Hardware Design"", not much in class teaching going on.  Dr Rafla is fairly helpful if you ask for help.  Assignments/projects were huge, tended to be thrown together and not super clear.  Whoever graded was pretty harsh at times.  Interesting material but better off learning it on your own.",0
I took him because of all the good reviews but I guess its just if you take him in person. He was very confusing and claimed his midterm/final were like our quizzes for the chptr. Wrong. They were different. A lot of memorization.,0
STAY AWAY! First english teacher at smc and was the absolute worst. Old school type of grader who only wants his essay done his way only. Zoom meetings are the same every day and doesn't help you with essays because he thinks everyone already knows how. Find another teacher asap.,0
"Although the assignments are graded either credit/ no credit and the assignments arent a lot to do, but theres A LOT of reading! I know this is a lit course, but if you have other classes that require a lot of work too then be ready to really work. Theres 5 books that are 300 pgs each. Overall, alot of reading, midterm, final, & a medium paper",1
"Dr C is an average level Professor.  He is somewhat political in his approach to teaching. By that I mean he expresses his political views during lectures.  This seems inappropriate since he teaches Science, not Political Science.",0
"I dreaded taking these course but Dr C made it understandable. The course consists of discussion, midterm, proposal/bibliography and final paper. No exam.",1
"I've had her multiple times for upper level. Wonderful, charismatic professor, extremely intelligent but can be disorganized and unclear about due dates and assignments. Ask a lot of questions if it's unclear to you. Participate A LOT. I have good memories from my classes with her, very personable and fun.",1
"asks for specific things in assignments, but doesnt know them when he sees them. none of the work is worth doing, because you'll get a b no matter what...yes, i'm a geek, and if you actually care about school, king will just waste your time.",0
"HARD CLASS!!! His lectures are really interesting but totally different from his test. The book didn't help either. GO TO EVERY CLASS, even though it is not mandatory. He is a great teacher and helpful, but with the difficulty of his test, I would just avoid the class all together. I'm an A student, but this class totally destroyed my GPA :(",1
Professor Harvey is always trying to help his students and give them a different perspective,1
"Worst professor at Geneseo. Wasn't surprised when I saw the polarized comments. Some love her, some hate her. Prob bc she shows favoritism to parrots, and is downright rude to people who ask questions. Doesn't care if you learn, you just have to be good at repeating things back to her. Cute at first, but that RBF (""frown"") is no ""accident"".",0
I've taken his Math60 class before the reason why I didn't hesitate to take his Math 90 this summer. His grading is clear through web-assign you're able to monitor your grades based on your work. The forum on canvas helps you to have a better understanding which Mr. bertens are very helpful to help you solve a problem. No regret taking his class.,1
"Doesnt care for attendance, a good professor, but tough",1
He is a very good teacher. Extremely helpful and will go over problems in detail so that you can understand. Highly recommend you take this professor.,1
"He made fun of my cool spiked hair, but he's bald! Total Nazi!",0
"The professor has a heavy accent, and along with his quiet voice makes it incredibly hard to hear him. 98% of the class is just taking notes from a windows document, 1% political videos, and 1% taking large tests. When taking notes, he stands in front of the projector screen, making at least two thirds of the class bob and weave just to read it.",0
"Dr. Clinefelter is awesome, I had her for western civilization 1600-present or whatever and i loved it. She was understanding when I asked for extensions, and her few assignments she gives are kinda interesting.",1
graduated 10 years ago and still remember how wonderful Prof Harris was.  He was so supportive and interested in the material he was teaching.  A great person.,1
"Highly recommend his courtship and marriage class! Its fun, interesting, and engaging. You do have to study and do some work but its very worth it, I was never bored in class. Hes very knowledgeable and the information is relevant. Definitely take it if you can!",1
"Prof Walsh is amazing! Easiest class I've taken at TCU but you must go to class,  just take some notes and you'll be good to go. 3 tests but half the questions on each test come from the previous test which you get to keep! Final comes from all previous tests which he gives you so you have all the questions for the final :)",1
"Hands down THE worst class I have ever taken. Garrison is impossible to understand, and I never knew what to study! Felt lost 100 percent of the time. Lab work and class assignments are do-able but the tests are impossible!!!! This class was just one big migraine",0
"very helpful prof. goes his way out to help students. generous and knowledgable. very glad to have him as one of the ""good profs"" amongs my graduate study at Waterloo.. other courses/profs seem like a joke comparing to Sazonov!You rock Dr. Sazonov!",1
He is by far one of the nicest professors on campus.,1
"Reyes teaches more of immersion style, and participation matters. If you do the work and show up for class, and he knows you're trying, he can be generous with grades. Learning another language is hard and he knows it. Very responsive to emails and willing to meet before class. Genuinely cares about students and checks in with everyone often.",1
"He needs to learn to teach the material to the students, not read it at the students. He should not blame the students for ""not studying enough"" when the class average for a test was a 50. Hard to understand and will make you fall asleep with how bad of a lecturer he is. This man is lucky he has tenure. You'll be fine in basic chem but not orgo",0
I had Professor Cook for Theatre 111 & I loved it! I wasn't sure about the class but he made it very interesting and exciting . He provided options so we did not have to take the final. I would highly recommend this professor.,1
great teacher. nice. easy to listen to and work with. cares alot.,1
very nice person. clear and engaging,1
She goes on tangents and doesn't giver herself and accurate timeline of how long thereading discussions will take. Because of this she just shoves like 3 or 4 assignments into a two day period which is super stressful. As a person she's fine but genuinely she is not a good professor. Also we had to read 60 page spanish chapters in two days. Not fun,0
"Very confusing lectures, d/t made up variables that he interchanged at will and endless derivations of formulas.  Exams/test were fair and he was very approachable.",1
Good lecture material. Fair grader of tests and projects. Several Powerpoint presentations required. Encourages discussion with classmates after tests are submitted. Textbook used every week.,1
"Love the professor, but 75% of the final grade depended on exams and only 25% on essays. I did good on the essays, but the exams were hard to get an A on even though they were open noted and it's a 100 level class. I wish the exams & essays were weighted differently or had another component/category to it because the outcome of grades would differ.",0
Solari is hands down my favorite political science professor at state! His lectures are engaging and he often shares personal stories to relate to lessons or shows relevant movie clips which makes class more interesting. Your grade consists of 3 papers and participation. It's not difficult to do well so long as you listen to his feedback.,1
"Boring to listen to and hard to follow. He seems really nice though, just not a very good lecturer.",0
"There is only a mid-term and final test. There is also a huge project that is basically your whole grade. She didn't grade anything for the project until after the final, so you had no idea where you stood before the test. Also got points taken off for the final project presentation even though we had no feedback all semester about it.",0
don't expect a response back to your emails.,0
"This class is an easy A but the issue is she grades your free response answers on the quizzes, tests, the 2 assignments, and 2 discussion posts with impossible expectations. She says not to plagiarize but then she COPY AND PASTES questions and its answers from the FREE ONLY TEXTBOOK (openstax - American Government 2e). PS who cites for a trivia????",0
"Dan is awesome. He gave fantastic feedback on all our writing assignments, and had really interactive lectures. He's open to new ideas and respects his students for sharing theirs. I would recommend him to anyone!",1
"He assigns projects and never comments on what you are doing wrong, only to give a bad grade after the production is finished.He does not seem to ahve  areel background in broadcasting, so he thinks the right way to projects is only the textbook way.  a's are impossible to get, and he always seems to favor peopl who who kiss up",0
Do not take his class. Avoid it at all costs. The MLSC actually has their own sections just for students in his class because of how hard he is. He's different from every other professor at OSU in terms of homework and tests. Homework is very tough and grades it hard. Also tons of pop quizzes and a quiz in the first week worth 9% of the class.,0
"HORRIBLE!! DO NOT TAKE THIS MAN. He hates life. Never happy. It's his way or no way. You opinion doesn't matter. Have no idea how he still teaches there. He will give you a zero for wrong format, wrong folder, if he doesn't like your opinion. Should not teach. He hates everything. He's the devil of English. He enjoys being miserable. No sympathy!",0
Elza was such an amazing professor to have. I left class every day inspired by her lectures. Really sweet and intelligent. She only assigned a midterm and final and she's a tough grader so do the extra credit! Wish I could take her again.,1
"Did not enjoy lectures, very long (2.5 hour class with only a 5 minute break halfway). Most things in the notes were not on the tests, tests were strictly book, even then when I read the chapters I still did poorly on the tests.",1
He is was a great professor! I enjoyed listening to him speak. The multiple choice was a little hard but not too bad. I read the chapters but most of test is from your notes which are basically the essays. I hope to get him for my future psych classes.,1
"Dr. Kosnik is lovely. He is super passionate about music, and it shows in his lectures. He keeps his lectures short and engaging. He is by far my favorite professor.",1
"He is really great, very clear and interesting.",1
If possible try to avoid this professor. Is a good guy but does not teach well at all. During lectures he will pull only one slide up and then talk for the rest of the class without changing it which makes it very difficult to follow. Tests are difficult and reading book is a must to actually learn. Only upside is a lot of extra credit.,0
"Students only like Garyen because he is funny and caring in lectures. In terms of actually learning something in his class, chances are you probably have to learn it yourself. He's forgetful and sometimes tests you on material that you haven't even learned in lecture and not even found in the textbook which is unfair. He's not as hype as you think.",0
"His grading is very unfair. You might have the same mistakes as others but would get a different score depends on how much he likes. Class is not hard, but do not expect you would actually learn off studying his hw and lectures. He is top 2 one of the worst professors in mylife. You dont learn anything out of his class and very biased for grading.",0
"Not much help being an online course, but she does provide an analysis of the texts used. Theres like 5 childrens books that are read. Midterms have questions beyond what would be expected. Theres only one essay. Final consists of two essay responses, midterm is multiple choice. There is a discussion board on each book.",1
"This lady KNOWS HER STUFF! Smart, Bilingual, and a pretty descent author. Come to class with an open mind ready to learn and ready to read. I just passed with an ""A"". She is a little feisty to some students  sometimes but, it's your responsibility to stand up for YOURSELF. Her Teacher assists come in handy especially if you are having trouble. ",1
"At first I was struggling and was not getting the grades on homework and tests I wanted. I went to see him and started going to office hours regularly. He took tons of time to help me and my grades totally improved! If you attend class, do the homework, and go to his office hours you can do well. Not an easy class but he knows his stuff and helps.",1
"Spends most of the class on things unrelated to current work, but clearly passionate.  Attendance is NOT",1
"Very funny guy, Really easy class, just sometimes I got a bit confused with what was going on and the class in general is just boring im not interested in sociology at all. Peter made it fun anyway he could though!",1
Excellent professor. Made me actually want to attend my Calculus lectures. Great at relating mathematics to fields outside the realm of solely numbers and keeping things fresh and interesting.,1
Great teacher.  Very informative.  Really enjoyed her lectures!  Tests were tough but worth it.,1
I liked his class at first but It all went down hill when he was snarky to me because I used my phone in class to take a picture of the board when he asked us to. Since then I wanted to attend the class less and he was rude more and more and is extremely passive aggressive to me outside of class. If you don't live and breath chem he's not for you.,0
"Very nice man and very helpful in explaining things in an understandable way. very interesting at times, has a real passion for teaching which comes though in his lectures. he is a great asset to the college and frankly one of my fav professors",1
I personally hate this class. The layout of the class is Horrible.,0
"Whe it comes to teaching the students, she is all over the place. If you are a beginner, You have to rely solely on the textbook. Not helpfull whatsoever and she seems like she doesn't come prepare to class. She is very forgetful and if you try to follow, you'll relize that you are being misguided unless you catch it or someone else in class does.",0
"Great prof! Super intelligent guy who truly cares about his students and wants them to succeed and enjoy English. Very caring guy, great teacher, pretty easy marker and easy course.",1
I had him for Calc II Tutorial and all he did was work through equations like we already do in class so we aren't learning anything new. He also would only learn the material himself the night before teaching it to us so he wasn't actually sure what to do himself.,0
Every lecture all she did was read from a PowerPoint and hardly interact with students. She seemed more interested in botany than in cellular/molecular biology which bi 151 consists mostly of which would make sense if I was taking a botany class.,0
"""Who let him in the college!? While is he still in the college? When will he leave the college?Why would he let anyone be taught by him in the college? Why would he grade anyone in the college!? "" These are the questions that pop out In my head more than the semester questions....",0
"Worst professor you could imagine. Impossible to reach and when you do, extremely unhelpful. Very condescending. Gives no instruction on assignments and is very unclear.",0
"Sometimes the language barrier can be insurmountable, and I'm not sure she enjoys teaching, as questions often upset her.  However, she definitely understands the subject, and apparently is herself, a ""book-learner""; hard for her to adapt any teaching style other than power-point and reading the book.  She can kind be a bit moody; helps to suck up!",0
This is one of those professors who don't really know too much about the subject they are teaching so in the end just passes everyone so that no one writes bad evaluations about her.  Never really seemed to be prepared or to really know what is going on.  Take her if MAT 109 is the only Math you need because you can get a good grade but won't learn,0
"She is the sweetest person ever, but unless you speak french you won't be able to understand a word she is saying.  She isn't used to teaching gen-eds so she grades extremely hard and the reading material was very difficult.  If you go to her office hours and gradually improve throughout the semester she is willing to curve.",0
Not only in college but my entire life hes the worst teacher Ive ever had by far. He sets the class up like a videogame so no one knew what was going on most of the semester. You have to teach yourself through videos. He requires you to get an 80% or better to pass a test or its a 0 and you retake it. If you don't play his games you get nowhere.,0
"bruh, this lady is a nut case.  Hardest tests and quizzes I've ever taken and you have to go to 2 jazz performances.  aint no body got time for that.. Biggest curve at the end so you'll get a good grade.. do not take... trust me..",0
"Be prepared to teach yourself, no actual teaching takes place in class.",0
"He has a way of making you feel stupid, but I enjoyed his humor. The class is easy to pass if you're great ready.",1
"Worst professor to take for upper level courses, obviously trying to prove something.  If you have to take this professor, truly question yourself.  Anyone that says otherwise has their head to far up and buried deep, you finish the rest,",0
Terrible choice. All she does is read off the slides and is not willing to help the students when they have questions. She even gets annoyed when you ask questions. She thinks she is funny,0
One of the worst-rated professors at the law school on rate my professor. No surprise.,0
Kent Sun is easily the worst professor I have ever had and it's really not even close. There's no words in the English language vile enough to describe how awful he is. In all seriousness. DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES TAKE HIM. You're wasting your time and money. Honestly felt like I wasn't supposed to pass the class. A 200 level class...,0
"Dr. Hughes-Isley is really a great professor. Almost no one wanted to be in that class by choice, but she made it a lot more bearable. She is also somewhat lenient with assignments, as long as you get the gist of it and seems like you tried your best, she'll take it easy on you. Great instructor, definitely take her.",1
Very nice professor.,1
Dr. Kaminski is definitely one of the better teachers. If you're a computer science major you're probably going to have her eventually. She's unavoidable. But that's not a bad thing. Her classes are tough and her homework assignments are specific and detailed. Just follow instructions carefully and you'll be fine.,1
Dr. Mart can come off as a person with an attitude but she's actually really nice if you respect her and show interest in the material.,1
"Tracy was a good teacher, and if you needed help she was there for you, but man her class was terrible. Year long english was not the way to go. Not much guidance, you really interpret her assignments your own  way. No motivation for the class.",0
"As much as I like math, I was so bored in his class.  He is very smart and loves math.  I think for math majors he's a great teacher.  His class just was not exciting and TR at 9:30 is not the time to take it.  Overall the class was fine for a GE.",1
"Worst professor ever! Unfair marking, doesn't speak clearly and writing is not readable. He is very lazy and hates helping; most of the time directing people to the TA. He's also a hypocrite, demanding use of very specific language yet is very ambiguous and inconsistent himself. Avoid! It isn't worth having him, even if the course material is good.",0
Bad bad professor!! You write a ton and she grades off her own opinion. If you answer something clearly with back up she will still give a bad grade if you dont answer the way she feels about the subject...even though its an opinion based paper!! she gives alot of attitude if you ask a question and is overall just ridiculous. DONT TAKE HER!!,0
"Runs his class like a high school band class, and expects the rules of high school to apply as well. College isn't the same as high school and his inability to adapt to that makes him an arrogant teacher. Didn't learn anything from his class and expected the same results from non-music majors as from music majors.",0
She's not even a business teacher!,0
"Gets off topic too quickly, and for long periods of time. He spent two weeks teaching us significant figures and conversions. It made no sense the way he taught it. I do not go to lecture, because it is pointless. Just read the book, go to lab, do the online homework, and go on quiz/exam days. If you do that, you will get an A",0
"Terrible. He seems to take pleasure in telling his students when they're wrong. The tests are straight up designed for students to fail. Dropping the grading scale to 56 for a C and students still dropping means the class is too tough, or the teacher is terrible. In this case it's both.",0
"Please do yourself a favor and stay away from her. She will ruin your grade for one research paper even if you had a good grade, she will drop your grade based on how she wants to grade the paper even if you follow her directions ""explicitly"", she will still mark you down. Do not recommend her to anyone.",0
"Bias in his views, Its more of a religion class then a history class. If you can find the class with someone else teaching... i really recommend it",0
"She is a good teacher but always super busy, she never replies to any e-mails and always leaves grading until the end of the quarter. I took this course online so it made it difficult to have any questions answered by her. The class is not difficult, just make sure you turn in assignments on time. Her face to face classes are much better.",0
"This class should be called ""how to think like an extremist from the Left Side."" Very liberal class with a clear bias. I've learned more about the professor's political views then I have art. Dissapointed that WMU requires their students to take this class as the teachers clearly have an agenda that has nothing to do with education.",0
"He is okay. Often used bad language in the class, which is really not a problem. I had a semester with him and i honestly did not understand how he marks student's grade. Some student work harder and received lower grade. He often got lost while giving speech; talk a lot. If anyone take his class, you should expect to do your own research .",0
"I was a 4.0 student coming into this class and let me just say that I'm not anymore. This class is AWFUL! The tests are ridiculous and unless you can teach yourself concepts that are foreign to you, you won't learn anything. Classes are a snoozefest. BEWARE!",0
You'll be graded on five tests!  I had two bad tests and three good ones and I never I reapeat NEVER missed a class and he FAILED me!  DO NOT TAKE HIM! If you want to move on take another professor.  He shouldn't be a teacher.,1
"Dr. Beymer-Farris is a wonderful woman! The work she has done is incredibly inspiring and she genuinely cares about her students' mental and physical well-being. She thinks critically, pushes students to think critically about presented subjects, and is willing to learn from students. She also has a vast knowledge about what she teaches.  A+ :)",1
She has a weird grading criteria in which she gives a cumulative final and if you dont pass that even if you have a good standing grade she will fail you. She is awful at explaining and she even puts things on midterms that werent on her study guides and arrogantly tells you she knows it wasnt on there but you can atleast try for partial credit.,0
"Lectures were a waste of time. Questions on exams were never covered. Notes or any help on exams were not allowed. Extra credit not allowed. Reached out for help, to not be given it. Only ""I have full belief that you'll pass."" Worst class I've ever taken. Do not recommend Rachel Smith.",0
"This is the best science class that I have ever taken. As long as you know the notes that are posted on blackboard, you'll do fine and make sure you go to class because he gives extra credit questions randomly, especially on days when not many people are there.  I loved the class and I hate science.",1
"Everything he says is long winded. Fine for some, awful for others.",1
"Nice guy but overall the class was really disorganized. Spent way to much time going over the easy concepts and saved the hardest for last two weeks of the course or we didn't cover it in class.If you don't like the idea of learning on your own, reading the book, and browsing online for solutions this class is not for you.",1
"Dr. T is a great teacher to knock out your SCOM requirement with. Her class isn't very difficult, you have three tests (including the final) and two group presentations.  I never got the textbook due to chegg messing up but I was still able to pass the daily chapter quizzes by reading the outlines online. You only get 2 absences so just don't skip",1
This class was really hard. The content is very complex and he rushes through everything so fast that it is hard to take notes. Dont even try using the textbook because it is practically incomprehensible.,1
"Had orgo 2 with her in the summer, it went by really fast so you had to keep studying every day. It's a hard class but she tries to make it easy, gives lots of practice and the exams are what you expect. So much better than the professor I had the first half of the summer, wish I had her for orgo 1 too! Made the DATs a breeze!! Take her class.",1
"She is willing to help if you ask, also very nice. She is a tough grader and does not use rubrics. She doesn't use a point system so you never know you're grade in the class & she doesn't use blackboard. The exams are based on the readings, but even if you do read you still don't do that well because she's so picky. TAKE THIS CLASS CREDIT NO CREDIT",1
Best prof I have ever had. Very inspirational.,1
Very poor attitude towards students. Weighting of material on test was very unfair. Students were given the opportunity to give feedback after the test. Dr. Balshine was only willing to listen to positive comments and when anyone made a negative comment (true and valid) about something she had done she rudely shot them down and ignored this input,0
"(General Geology) Amazing guy do the work its easy and written out in the textbook. Honestly share the textbook with someone its easy. My friends and I split the answers up. We had mini presentations, my power points were short and to the point. He loves geology and if you talk with passion during presentations he'll be so happy it's cute.",1
"Attend classs, do the homework and pay attention and you can get through it.",1
"Very arrogant, doesn't reply to emails, marks hard, and test are very hard. Stay away at all costs!!!",0
"You NEED to be an independent learner to do well in his class. Put effort into doing your homework because that's the only time you will learn anything. Forget learning from him, its all corny jokes all day! Don't ask questions, because he will confuse you more. The book is great and most of his test are from the book. Easy A if you can follow this",0
hi,1
Amazing lecturer! ,1
"This professor is ok I guess, Even if you read the chapters and study the test are still hard. The question on test are worded differently. He doesn't give you a 2nd attempt on ANY assignments like the other teachers do. He is a tough grader. Unfortunately for me I had no choice but to take him he was the only class left open. Good Luck",0
"Warren is rude, unorganized, and not very bright. Her lectures consist of stories about her family. Our class time is done and she says ""Oh! We are out of time. We will talk about our topic next time."" Yet halfway through the semester when it was time to take the midterm, we still hadn't gotten to any of the material. Cannot stress how rude she is.",0
Extremely lazy. The in class notes he posts on canvas are pretty much useless. They direct you to class slide which literally have nothing important on them. Uses break out groups to work on class problems but no one even converses in break out rooms so its pointless. Rushes through material assuming you already know everything.,0
"The work load is a lot but if you grasp concepts quickly you'll do fine. Or if you have the online textbook handy. Definitely don't wait last minute to do her assignments, there's a lot due at once. She gives good feedback and is always quick to respond to questions if you email her.",1
More than half the class had Ds. That means theres something wrong with the way the instructor is teaching!,0
"Such a nice, helpful professor. He realizes that general education classes shouldn't be as hard as 300 level classes... some profs don't get that.",1
Dont take him-- He makes you feel really small when you try to make a comment or state your opinion.,0
"Good class and knows the subject well, great teacher but still requires reading the text to understand the concepts fully. Trick to doing well in this class is keeping up with homework and DOING THE EXTRA CREDIT. ALL OF IT. actually though do it",1
Exams are so easy since its just like the practise exam: yes i said just like,1
Terrible professor. Avoid at all costs.,0
"I liked all the examples that she gave to the students on her slides and compared it to real life situations, so that we understood the concept clearly.",1
"Top-notch scholar! Ive taken most of the classes he teaches + independent seminars. Classes are lecture heavy & summarize assigned readings. Its important to cite text, consult lecture notes & formulate cogent arguments in papers. He has a great sense of humor & nicely melds personal experience into lectures. Read the texts & pay attention!",1
nice prof. Explain things really clear and easy to understand.,1
"Detrani is a very funny guy who always seems to make the time in class very interesting. Expect to write two or more pages a week in analysis form on any particular movie, most of them very entertaining and thought provoking.   ",1
"While Dr. Athanas can be a tad bit wacky at times she is a solid professor. Emphasis on concepts, but that's not necessarily a bad thing and helps to establish a solid base of calculus. Much better than my high school teacher who gave 2 examples then sat down. Expects a lot from her students, but will curve if need be. Online exams stressed her out",1
Interesting class but alot of work. You have a TP and a quiz every week. Content was interesting but there is a lot to do.,1
"Absolutely no tests except the final. There are 2 papers which are super easy to get full credit on as long as you read the book for each. Other than that each class has a short note card you fill out and as long as you were awake, that'll be no problem.",1
He is by far the best professor i've had here. Not only does he teach well and encourage participation but he also thoroughly enjoys helping students understand. If you go into his office he will help you with anything from class material to making academic decisons.,1
Very knowledgeable however his teaching style and forms of grading are way beyond this class. Lectures have no organization and youll listen to him basically ramble. The tests are like reading a different language. Focus on quizzes and discussion posts for points. Final exam average was a 48%. Good luck trying to even get a B.,0
Simmons and this class in particular is the epitome of why someone goes to college -- to be challenged and to develop & grow as a higher education student. The lectures are engaging and the curriculum challenges you to learn a tremendous amount about the subject area. Well-crafted projects and good feedback in grading. Show up and participate!,1
Dr. Hilts is amazing! Class can be a bit dry sometimes so make sure you're focused. Helpful outside class. He cares about his students.,1
"Paul's course was easy to achieve a high grade in, but was really boring. He isn't a great lecturer and uses a lot of filler words that can make it difficult to follow his train of thought. He is disorganized and doesn't really seem to care about his teaching responsibilities. I feel I would have enhanced my skill sets better with another professor",0
"A lot of people dont like Dr. Delgado because of the amount of work she assigns but, every single thing she assigned had a purpose. I feel so much better prepared after her class and i dont regret taking it at all. The other common complaint is her personality. She is a sassy gal, so if you cant take the heat, get out of the kitchen.",1
"I had to take him for the new English 303 class. He was incredibly rude and counted off tremendously on my papers. I got a  1925 points because of four ""missed"" commas. Honestly, he picks favorites and if you are not a favorite student of his you wont pass. Also,read the last chapter of the reading assignment that is where the test questions are.",0
I was walking through MAK Hall after my MTH 097 class (we just learned how to use rulers that day--cool!) when this professor yelled at me from his classroom and asked what we do with the hypothesis when we're negating a conditional statement. How the heck should I know? I still don't know how to add fractions! Found out it was Fishback. Scary!,0
"Dr. West is very entertaining! His lectures are great, but can get really boring which causes you to stop paying attention. It is crucial to read the books he assigns.  6 quizzes, drops one and are all fill in the blank. There is also a final and it is multiple choice. The final is pretty much all the quizzes combined! Really funny!",1
I would not take any class she teaches because you do not know what kind of grade she will give you. Grading is not anonymous and she has favorites. She can really hurt your GPA. She is not available outside of class without an appointment. I am not aware of anyone who is better off in life from taking her class or knowing her.,0
"Class is a waste of time.  If you want to take a class that is sugar coated, this is the one.  I can't believe my tution pays this instructors salary.",0
"Morris straight up didnt care about teaching this course and all he talked about was his job at iRobot. Didnt look over the lectures beforehand, and lectures were a week behind homework for most of the semester so you were learning what you needed to do the day you turned in the homework.",0
Professor Wilson is so unorganized it actually begins to take a toll on your grade. It took him nearly 4 months to grade assignments so getting feedback on how to improve in the course is completely up to the student. His explanations often leave students more confused and he doesn't skip to the syllabus. He adapted fine to online learning.,0
"welcome to Miami Prof. Attar- Also the class itself may seem intimidating at first, but it is structured and very logical",1
Great professor. Really got me interested in ecology even more than i already was. I am taking his Bio 492 class and it is awesome,1
Dr. Curtis is very funny and made class entertaining. She always let us out of our hour and 15 min class early which was nice. Easy A if you pay attention and go to the study groups before the tests. She also offers extra credit which is helpful. Overall a fun and informative class.,1
Eckhard is a national treasure.,1
Make sure to show up to class. Doesn't post on blackboard. Traditional lecturing style. Write everything down. Final grade is based on 2 tests and the final. There's always a discussion so be prepared to talk. Mostly about liberal and conservative points of views on different topics. Repeats himself multiple times. Can sometimes be funny.,0
"I have never spoke to her in person, but the lessons and comments she makes seem extremely passive aggressive.",0
"I really liked Professor Gilles. He's a very genuine, down-to-earth guy and doesn't mind being a dork in class. He loves what he teaches and actually wants his students to do well. He's a little bit distant at office hours, very busy, but overall a really great professor. Highly recommended.",1
Hard class. A lot of studying will give you a C.,0
"Bernstein is my favorite professor at JMU thus far. He's hilarious, but he's easily on of the smartest guys I've ever met. He makes sure you know that you suck at programming, but helps you get just slightly better. As long as you don't act like a dumbass, you will love Bernstein. #FeelTheBern",1
"Professor Kee is an absolute genius. One of my two favorite professors at Holy Cross, Kee is absolutely in love with what he does. His lectures are extremely insightful and beautiful. He takes a philosophical approach to literature. I had him for a 300-level course on Chaucer, and was intimidated at first, but ended up loving the course. Take Kee!",1
"Had the worst time with this professor. She does not put up the study guide for her exams until a day before the exam. Really unorganized on blackboard, and does not provide proper feedback to her students. Be ready to read a lot and participate in class to get C. Made us buy a textbook, and we did not use it once. Would never take a class with her",0
"Errico is absolutely phenomenal! All her grades are from online. There is only Hw and Quizzes that are due, either every week or every other week. She is super helpful and wants everyone to pass the class. Lectures can be long and tiresome, but pull through them and you will pass the class in no time. Easy A, definitely take her!",1
"Very smart guy, but not good at teaching. If you took Calc in high school, you'll get to really appreciate how much he makes relatively simple concepts sound like rocket science. He embarrasses students for asking questions and for some reason he really has something against community college. Hes funny sometimes, but thats about the only positive.",0
"Professor Chen was amazing. All you really need to do to pass is pay attention in lectures and try your best at the homework. Had a Joke of the Day which were usually so bad they were funny. He has test corrections, gives some extra credit during labs, and has review sessions with test answers, and can use notes on test on reference sheet.",1
"Class is absolutely impossible. It is a class based on acids and bases and nothing else. **A class based on the hardest topic in chemistry...** Never used textbook, help sessions are a great idea. He is a very obnoxious person and does not grade leniently. He expects you to know everything before you come to his class which is impossible...",0
Lets have class with a guy that is hard to understand and loves to ask questions and then get irrate when you don't know the answer.,0
"Dr. Beattie is passionate about what he does.  He wants his students to do well and learn.  His biggest goal is for people to walk away appreciating people with special needs.  If you attend class, you should do well.  His class is lecture but there are 200 people in the class.  He is very funny and is able to hold your attention for a large class.",1
The best professor I ever had. He basically designed a class that included the most interesting things about the entire CS curriculum.,1
Puts up his notes on the projector but only gives a limited amount of time to copy. Going to class is a waste of time but he takes attendance. You're better off reading every chapter of the book AT LEAST TWICE. Test questions aren't too difficult but have very trivial material in them.,0
"Lectures/discussions are mandatory, attendance will be taken. Exams are easy as she gives a complete study guide with all of the material on it, just memorize. Papers are graded rather harshly (especially the first one). They look for a very specific format for the papers and it is up to you to figure out what that is.",1
"This class was not worth taking. I didn't enjoy the class at all, if you don't understand something he yells and slams his hands down on the table. He is very rude and doesn't help you understand anything in the course. The course itself is hard if you don't understand the materiel and has a lot of math work in it.  Maybe try another teacher.",0
"Be warned, she is an extremely tough grader when it comes to papers and quizzes, which are all written. Even if you don't like the memoir you read, participate in discussion and it will pay off. Overall, not a terrible class-just wish the grading were a little more fair.",1
"I'm a good student & receive good grades. Even though I was interested in the material and ready to learn he made this class unbearable. He is very strict, unforgiving, rude, and gives a horrendous amount of busy work. He's a Christian (you can see his cross necklace through his chest hair) and is bias against the other religions in his lectures. ",0
"The class wouldn't be bad at all if the grading and questions on the exams were anything like the homework. The exams are far more difficult, and her grading is extremely inconsistent. Good luck getting a response if you email her as well, she almost never replies. I would do everything possible to avoid having this professor ever again.",0
"Easy to understand with an accent. kinda boring, will make you want to skip every once in a while.",1
"He's extremely dry and boring, but he knows his material. His essay questions are really just one question applied to different texts, so don't expect much scope. He gave us 90 minutes to write three essays for our midterm. That was rough.",0
The class was hard for zero coding experience learners but I survived. Professor Cormack had good materials in the lecture and he created helpful assignments as well.,1
I really enjoyed this class. He was always ready and able to help outside of class if you weren't sure about an assignment or even just a small question. His lectures really helped with the material and were exciting. I would recommend buying the textbook. It helps if you want to try extra questions or for examples.,1
"Not a very bright professor. At times, lacks integrity in class! He is a follower not a leader!",0
"There are 5 one page papers on 20 page readings that are difficult, 1 visual analysis on the most obscure thing, and 1 long paper at the end of the semester due right before finals. 2 tests- midterm and final. He is super sarcastic and very passionate but too much work for a gen ed, especially if you are not interested in this at all. take music",0
"Professor Benjamin really does mean well. This class is very lecture heavy and I didn't really understand them. However, the material can be learned if you put the work in. I strongly recommend going to the Math Lab to get additional help. Make sure to do the extra practice problems as they are very similar to the test. He really cares :)",1
Excellent professor who really cares about his students!!,1
"Dr. Rhoads is a nice guy, funny, and very approachable. But just something about the way he teaches makes me not absorb anything at all in lecture? I think its more me and the way I learn rather than anything wrong on his part. Very dry lectures, could never pay attention. Took a different prof second semester and grades went from a C- to an A-.",0
"Eva is a special breed. She is a FANTASTIC teacher only IF you are there to learn. She knows her stuff and she will prove that every day. If you are in her class to fool around, you're wasting your time. She demands respect and there is nothing wrong with that.",1
"I wouldn't recommend taking this class with her if you have little background in stats. She assumes the class knows more than they actually do, so she tends to skip many steps when doing problems. She won't take responsibility for the class doing poorly (My class had a 62 average for exam 1 and said ""it wasn't her fault"")",0
"He is the worst teacher I have ever had the displeasure of meeting in my college career, he does not care about his students. He thinks anyone and everyone is trying to become a scientist.... don't take him if you can!!!!!!!!!!!! he is really hard",0
Incredibly large assignments. Only had 1 (out of 6) assignments graded by the last week of class.,0
"Worst DE class ever! She was lates with marks, gave people back wrong papers, forgot to post things she said she would to help us study for midterms/exams etc. and didn't give any feedback on how to improve for discussion posts. Never taking her again!",0
"Basically it was like he was speaking a different language. Him and his ""games"" were a waste of time. I just stopped going and went off what I learned in HS and passed. Get Busch instead, the difference is like night and day.",0
His class is a lecture and requires you to take  notes. His lectures are clear and very interesting. His test are from the lecture and if you take good notes you'll pass with flying colors. Each test he gives you readings from the book to do on your own time and he'll put some of those questions on the test.  by far one of my favorite professors,1
"Smiles all the time because he loves math so much. Makes me want to attend the lecture! Reads off of a PDF, and does not show work on the board. However, he takes his time in explaining the material well. Practice tests are posted for each test, and sometimes have the same questions as the test. Posts solutions as well. I love this man.",1
easy,0
He spend most of the class telling stories barely related the the course description. It felt like he did not prepare for any classes. He was very disorganized and bad at using Blackboard.,0
Worst WRC professor  ever. never explains always talking about random stuff. doesnt grade essays untill 2 months later. avoid her at all cost. her ratings were higher when i checked they must have been bs.,0
He is really interesting to talk to he tells a lot of stories that actually tie in with his lectures. however if you get him started on a subject you will have spent the whole class going over it. he really doesn't expect a lot however he does expect you to pay attention. Test are a BEAST!! just know your stuff and have a passion in learning.,1
"She is a sweet person and a tough teacher. She does use the books she requires from you and I felt like I learned a lot from her class. But participation is definitely a must. She's helpful and yes, the class moves at a fast pace, so be careful of that. Other than the pace of the class, she's a great professor.",1
She does not make it seem like she cares so much about her students. She is very strict.,0
"She has a heavy Bulgarian accent, so it is really hard to understand her. I went to every single class except when I was sick, which was only one time and I regret missing that day. If you miss a class, you will not know what is going on for the rest of the week since the material is cumulative. YOU NEED TO READ THE TEXTBOOK AND STUDY NOTES",0
this guy is a JOKE of a professor! don't ever take this guy!,0
Easy-going and knowledgable guy. Loved his classes.,1
This is my first semester with this Professor and thus far she hasn't given any effective feedback. I find that it's instead very critical with no ways of actually helping. Her homework assignments are high and the descriptions of what to do are incredibly low. I wouldn't recommend taking her class if you didn't have to.,0
I took this class online and it was awful. She teaches obsoletes concepts.,0
"This class is honestly not that bad. You will be fine as long as you ""follow the steps,"" and do the practice problems before the midterm and final. Yezer is horrible at explaining in detail, but the TA's are very accessible and helpful! Make sure to go to classes and discussion sections for pop quizzes.",1
"The history book already needs a fact checker, but he needs one too. If you don't care about history, he'll entertain. If you get annoyed at the not-always-accurate stories, he'll annoy. Definitely makes things easy by weaving that narrative.",0
"One of my favorite professors ever! Marshall's brilliance is mistaken for bigotry. I think weak-minded students misinterpret his love of intellectual battle for zealotry. He's demanding, but extremely helpful and always available. Take diligent notes on lecture material!",1
"Definately knows what she is doing. At the same time, she tries to use the collage teen language, like ""upper three voices down"" compared to ""contrary to the bass"" I am honored to have a teacher that can explain things and advance us in skill without having us realizing it. It's just a fun class.",1
"Wouldn't Listen to many of these posts because they are from 10 years ago. Rumenik is pretty easy, one homework a week its half a page. doesn't really care if people show up, the tests are tough but I have gotten a C+ on them and still have a B+ in the class all together. Would take",1
challenging course,1
"Horrible attendance, most students were there more than he was",0
"Mumbles and trails off on his words a lot, making it hard to understand him for most of the times. Also not very helpful during chatroom sessions--acts like he expects students to produce an answer to his questions within seconds. Sorry, but it's impossible for anyone to produce a full paragraph in less than 10 seconds.",0
"Kyle is awesome.  Sometimes it's a challenge to stay awake but generally his lectures are really interesting and he covers book material well, making the reading really only necessary for papers.  Very understanding if you need an extension on a paper and you have a legit reason. Accent and general New Zealand style make Kyle epic",1
"Very engaging lectures. Always includes every student during the lecture and asks random questions so pay attention! Be on time, be respectful and study for the test. You will be fine.",1
"The first thing I notice is that Professor Shen is a hard working professor. He is smart, humorous, and he gives positive feedback. He gave me a lot of good advice about my project from last year, and I appreciate his help a lot. He also worked to promote computer networks and computer science in general to children, a plus!",1
"She is such a sweet and understanding lady. She loves her job. She tends to do a lot of peer editing. If you go to her office hours, she will give you so many suggestions on your paper. She likes to see A LOT of improvement from your rough draft. Her grading is extremely fair. You get out as much as you put into her class. Take her!",1
His lectures are good and he is very knowledgeable in his field. However he teaches the class as if you should already know all the technical terms and is never there for office hours. ,0
"Mrs Miller is fantastic. You know exactly what is expected of you at any moment in time. Communication on a one to one basis is a bit slower, but she always gets back to you. She shows interest in you as a person too and encouraged us to share weekend or break stories on Blackboard. Really glad I took her class",1
"Not explain things clearly, skipping important parts. Exams are based on IMPORTANT PARTS.",0
"Professor Bender is a very intelligent man. Although his class is difficult, you will be very grateful you took it with him. I studied quite a bit for this class so be ready to take good notes and read your text book for extra clarification. Ignore all of the obnoxious ""DO NOT TAKE HIM"" comments. If you are willing to work, you will succeed.",0
"Prof Smith is a very nice man. However, he does not command attention like Prof Bott or Dr Williams. Musicality is hampered by blatty tubas, biting trombones and weak trumpets. Drill is written with no concept of spacial relationships. He does not call people out for being wrong three months into the season. We want Prof Bott!",0
He was pretty cool...but the class kinda sucked,1
Tests and quizzes are really hard.. Isn't much help.. Expects you to know everything about calculus and does not give credit for trying .. He grades really hard especially if ur answers are not perfect .. Avoid,0
"She is pure trash. Unfortunately I made the mistake of taking her class, it is so unclear and under organized. She gives you the first 2 months to work on a easy personal paper then gives 2 weeks for a difficult research paper. For the love of god do NOT! take this class . Only positive is cool people were in it",0
"Took his night class.... bad idea. All he does is talk and talk, and rants about other random stuff. Don't get me wrong he is funny, but that doesn't make up for other stuff. He literally has to walk up to you in order to hear what you said. STAY AWAY lol",0
An absolutely terrible prof/person. The book he forces you to buy (his of course) is horrible! There are whole pages that are just missing specific letters. I don't think anyone ever proofread it. Plus he thinks he is god when it comes to econ (yet teaches micro which is self-explanatory). He's arrogant and rude. I suggest macro if u have a choice,0
BEWARE!!! He is a horrible online teacher. I DO NOT recommend taking him at all. He doesnt respond to emails whatsoever. I went to meet with him about my grades because projects that I turned in months ago still hadnt been graded. He didnt know that he hadnt make the final available to us until I met with him that day..,0
Dana is a great ASL teacher. Many students are hesitant when they find out they will have a deaf instructor but she is very patient and easy to understand. As long as you do all of your workbook assignments (which take 20 mins typically) you will do very well in the class. Love it!,1
"This guy is the worst guy you can take for 330, he doesn't care about,  and he thinks u're only taking 3 credits per semester because you have to constantly study for his pop quizzes.  Avoid it at all cost.  When I took this class he gave us the pop quizz in the second of class .... like seriously ?  u have not time to warm up with him ",0
"I went to his office hours once and he just straight up left for like 20 mins. His lectures were comprehensible and articulate despite what other reviews may say, however he has a tendency to go very fast sometimes and skip over concepts that he didn't explain fully. If you speak mandarin ask him to explain it in mando its pretty sick",1
"BEST PROF I'VE HAD AT QUEENS! Not an easy marker, but fair, clear and always willing to help ie with essays and material. My advice is to take ANY course he teaches! Wish I was still in undergrad to take his courses.",1
Roussas is the worst professor I have encountered in my 4 years at Davis. He literally does not care about his students or his class. He puts in almost no effort into his lectures. His job could be better done by a text-to-speech converter. He literally has answered his phone during lecture multiple times. That shows how much he respects the class,0
"First thought when I saw him walk into the classroom: ""Please don't die in the middle of the semester!"" Not that I'm saying age is a bad thing but this professor is older and hard of hearing. Tests don't match content taught in class. Best of luck if you take Cooper! You're gonna need it! One positive, he allows old editions of the textbook.",0
"I mean, Its E101, I hope its easy. She will take the time to sit down with you and help you with your questions and problems. Great resource during and after the class. Clearly loves her work",1
"Does easy examples in his lectures, but you ABSOLUTELY can't follow along because his handwriting is horrible. He doesn't explain that well, and makes online quizzes 5 minutes long, and that is 40% of our grade. The tests are impossible to do. He expects 50s from class, not sure why York keeps him on their payroll, as he is making $200,000+ a year.",0
Did not consider him a decent teacher.,0
She expects a lot but gives a lot too. You couldn't ask for a better professor.,1
"Really nice and wants you to do well, but if you're not good at math try someone else. Goes straight off handouts he's made. DO THE HOMEWORK or you'll do terrible. Lets you bring a sheet of notes for each quiz/test and 4 for the final, don't stress about quizzes because they're dropped at the end. Put in the work and you'll get the grade you want.",1
You have to present a course case from your seat for 2 minutes once. Then he just speaks about course cases for the rest of class. He lets you out after 2 hours and you can find the information from the cases online. His exams are based off if you can memorize the cases the night before. Very easy class.,1
"Took it online in the summer. Teacher gave so much work I had anxiety attacks over trying to read all of the chapters assigned, write papers, and take a midterm in a short amount of time. Didn't have time to really absorb what I read. Received midterm and paper grades without answers so have no idea what I got wrong.",0
"There is no sense to showing up to the class as long as she keeps giving the review sheets.  She grades like a monster.  You miss a date by 1 year, or have one little piece of information missing that will cost you 8, she could be a much nicer grader.  Also assigns more work than other us hist 206 professors.",0
"Great teacher with a very fun, enjoyable online class! He gives great feedback and is always on top o the game! Very organized professor and class!",1
"Okay, so when I took this professor, I thought he was terrible. He's a bad teacher, makes me want to fall asleep. HOWEVER, after taking other professors, he's not that bad. Yes he sucks at teaching, but he gives REALLY good sample tests so its REALLY simple to get an A in the class. Not to mention extra credit.",0
Professor Guerra is one of the best teachers at UCF. He is so understanding and great at explaining everything. Honestly a true gem. Highly highly highly recommend taking him!!!!!!,1
"Jones' class is lecture heavy, but her tests are fair, especially since you get one page of notes. She gives many extra credit opportunities, and many of them are going to campus events. She talks about her experiences from traveling places and obviously knows a lot about the subjects she teaches. I thought it added a personal touch to the class.",1
"Best English teacher I've ever had, understands the workload at poly, very helpful, knows how to teach and get results, will know you personally and follows up with you. made the class very entertaining, taught us skills no other teacher would take the time for.workload is not so much like other profs at poly who's always keeping you busy, go w him",1
read out overheads every class..always absent..no point for setting up lectures!,0
He is egotistical and rude.  Very unreasonable grader and unwilling to help any students  Seeing him in office hrs won't help as he will tell you everything was your fault. Exam is memorizing 200 concepts and only 4 on the exam! I do not recommend taking his classes.,0
"Prof Jalalvand is an old school engineer. He likes everything to follow a specific format, and if you follow it he will reward you. Don't follow it and he will ruin you. Tests are very similar to practice exams he emails, and he is good with partial credit if he can follow your mistakes. He wants everyone to pass, just do everything the way he says",1
"Very clear assignments, do the reading and the assignments and you should have no issues with passing.",1
Notes are very vague sometimes... Seems like half the stuff he goes over isn't on the quizzes or tests. Never worked so hard in my life to try and pass a class . Make sure to write EVERYTHING he says down because you will need it in some type of way. Moves very quickly so pay attention! Prepare to study hard. ,0
"one of the best Japanese teachers I have ever had.  She definitley knows what she's talking about.  Although she could go off track and sometimes her explanations were pretty confusing, simply ask her and she'll do her best to clarify.  Also just email her if you have any questions and she'll get back to you as soon as possible!",1
"He is very vague, goes off topic a lot, its very difficult to pay attention in his class but he is very lenient on grading and is pretty nice",0
"Very straight forward. Easy to understand. Lots of HW. HW gets super tough, but not mandatory. Tests are extremely simple compared to hw. If you can do the test review well, you can easily get an A. Pros: Very straight forward. Easy tests .Cons: kinda tough to approach or reach out of class.",1
"Professor Bartlett will NOT upload lecture notes and expects the students to follow along and take notes while he lectureshe talks fast and jumps from timelines, so it's really hard to follow along for 2 hrs. Readings are crazy heavy and you need to do them, and assignments require a lot of research. His teaching style is too old fashioned.",0
Kass Banning is extremely disorganized in her lectures. She makes the students do useless presentations instead of actually teaching the course material herself as a professor should. She concerns herself more with asserting her power to fulfill her ego. Extremely  upsetting that such a person has hi-jacked all the upper year courses,0
"Very personable and explains things well. He co-taught this class with another prof (who was terrible) and under the circumstances he did the best he could to help us understand the other prof's material. Going to class is a must because I maybe opened the ""textbook"" once and he didn't have powerpoints.",1
"I would recommend Professor Hower to students who don't good in math, or think they won't do a good job in Stats. If you do the bare minimum you will pass, and if you push a little harder you can easily get an A. My only complaint is when we switched to remote learning, she was hard to reach. She only responded back to a few of my emails.",1
He is an amazing prof. It's the only class i had which wasn't boring and everybody came to class because they loved it. He helps you out alot. His notes are the best which makes it easy to get A+ in the course. BEST notes ever. Make sure to take his class any course he teaches otherwise you miss out.,1
"Oh my gosh, what a hilarious guy.  Humor as dry as a bone.  His classes were insanely difficult but there was never a dull moment or a time where I questioned his credibility.  I think he just loves history and hates attending ""staff meetings.""",1
"She doesn't teach the material that is in the homework, or does simplified versions that are not helpful to learning the difficult material. She taught multiple concepts blatantly wrong. She gives rude responses to reasonable questions from students. Her lectures are ineffective at teaching the concepts and often focus on irrelevant material.",0
"Everybody loves Baughman.  Material covered in class is interesting and he's a pretty funny guy, too.  Highly recommended.",1
"Plays favorites, desultory lectures, outdated, unoriginal content. Terrible lecturer, lazy and can't be counted on for help. If you cater to his esoteric, irrelevant interests and write some sentimental autobiography (I didn't) you'll get an easy A. Either way, expect a frustrating class. Avoid if you can.",0
He's a nice guy. He's always willing to help his students pass and do well in his class. He drops the lowest exam.,1
"He is very helpful, funny at times, take lots of notes and pay attention to what he says, he gives extra credit. HOT!",1
"On a personal level, she is a really cool person. It's always nice to see such genuine enthusiasm for a subject. As a senior, the exams are probably the most difficult I've ever taken. You must write a lot in a relatively short period of time, but you get the possible essay questions ahead of time, so just prepare/make outlines/go to office hours.",1
"FOCUS ON THE WORKSHEETS-- they are identical to the test so don't stress about understanding the whole lecture. The real way to get through is if you can laugh at his ""quirks"" instead of them making you insane. Absurdly smart guy, learned more from him than of any other prof my freshman year.",1
"If you have a choice to not take this professor, don't. She seems like genuine human but not a great professor. Never replies to emails!! so good luck! Iv'e sent over 50 emails and heard twice back, and only because I asked her to check during zoom. I don't understand her lectures and she does not record them so if you miss class, good luck!",0
"I had Mazamit for Cultures & Contexts: Modern Israel. The material of the class was interesting, but I have to say Mazalit made the experience during this class beyond miserable for various I found her to be extremely difficult to follow up with during office hours . Her grading was confusing and shes rude when confronted about a grade.",0
"If you need to take n English class at LTCC take it with Professor Wexelbaltt. You will have far less homework , and the end of quarter research paper is done is steps so you have less room to procrastinate which you will be grateful for towards the end of the quarter.",1
"shaffer is awesome. he's very helpful during office hours, seems really into what he teachers and besides his constant abreviations on the board, he is a great teacher. scopes isnt supposed to be easy, but hes a good teacher for it.",1
"Dr. Schittjer is extremely difficult.  I had him for an online class through Liberty University.  His papers are very demanding. He is a VERY tough grader. All his instructions are completely different from EVERY other professor at LU, and if you turn in assignments incorrectly you lose LOTS of points.  I'm an A student and got a C+ bc he is RIGID",1
"Like many profs, this guy is a bit of a know-it-all.  He was pretty unpleasant, especially if you had to meet one-on-one.  I'd avoid him if at all possible.",0
She is a great and informative professor who cares a lot about her work. She does give her opinion on a lot of lectures and feedbacks but this is to help the students become more informative and attended in lectures. She does count attendance and is serious about her grading skills. Just participate and follow her lectures and you will do good.,1
"Awful teacher. He does not actually direct you, and the lectures are pretty pointless to the homework which you are left to figure out on your own. He is arrogant and rude, and expects far too much from students who have never worked in the field. Will mark your papers as ""So what"" and ""irellevant"" but give zero direction.",0
"I know its the pandemic, but he hasn't taught half of the year and moved the due dates or cancelled half of the work for this class. I was hoping to learn something in this class but feel this was a complete waste of my time. Take him if you want an easy A without having to work for it.",0
Great man. Very knowledgable and knows he is not a good lecturer. If you need sleep he will put you down. But because of this he will sometimes cut lectures short. He is a very humble man and understands his weaknesses.  Great prof I suggest him for anyone.,1
"She is basically not contactable, she doesn't answer emails at all. So if you make a mistake and want to fix it, prepare to be frustrated trying to get in contact.. You've been warned",0
"What makes her so difficult is she is a horrible marker. We had an drawing assignment & she told me in the comments my dendrites were to big - even though she told us we would not be marked on are ability to draw. She gives 20 seconds per M/C, FIB & matching question on quizzes & exams - which is extremely hard & she marks very difficult.",0
"In my opinion this class was very difficult.  The material is not presented in a useful manner, the prof. uses the book that he wrote.  It is hard to use the reading effectively to grasp it due to the similarities of the prof's teaching and the text.  do not miss this class because there are assigments and quizes due everyday.",0
worst teacher ever. avoid at any and all costs,0
I am a Junior in Engineering School at U of I. Bayomy is the most passive aggressive professor I've had so far. He has no respect for his students.,0
"For this specific course, he does not give partial marks, sometimes not at all. This will have a big impact on your exams unless you work extremely hard. He'll help you if you visit his office and tries to help his students, but don't take this specific course with him. Other courses, maybe, but not this one.",0
"idk the reason for showing up in class cz finally you have to learn all by yourself. Besides, f you are an international student, pay attention to this. he will make you UNCOMFORTABLE.",0
"I feel like all the good reviews on this website were written by her. She doesn't give guidelines on any of her assignments. She's a narcissist, she teaches very different from the book, the final will be hard. She grades groups based on who she likes. The group in my class that didn't finish the pres got an A. vs everybody else's C. Shes nuts!",0
"Very chill teacher. Wants his students to succeed. Flexible with handing in papers. Fun classes, gives you points for being on time. Only a few quizes  and papers",1
online class ... didnt answer emails ... randomly made it a film class...,0
"He's a bit tough to learn from although he does want his students to pass. If you have lots of trouble in math, don't take him.",1
"Wonderful professor! His lectures are so much fun and he keeps you engaged! He definitely makes you work for it, but, if you do the reading and the work, you should do fine!",1
"DO NOT TAKE! He is not insightful at all and is vulgar at best! He is very disorganized, the class is terribly boring. He is very opinionated. And unless you want a very detailed lecture over the art of ""pegging"" (just google if you are not aware of the term) pass on Swedenberg!",0
"She's easy, but she's too high energy/perky.  I disliked having to do so many activities during class and thought that we wasted a lot of time with these activities. Thankfully, there aren't that many speeches.  Don't bother buying the book.",1
"Before this class I was always an A&B student. This class I received a C!!! If the average grade for the exams are 60-70, then its definitely not the student it is the teacher! He is a passionate professor and I get where he is coming from, but a little understanding goes a long way.",0
"Awesome guy, not a difficult class if you show up and take notes. He makes it fairly interesting for a theology course.",1
"Despite Radu's Romanian accent, he is not only unconventional academically, but engaging in his passion.  To be certain, he is demanding, but dedicated, and more than willing to share his philosophy on the evolution of the mind as he is on the degeneration of community implicit in cuisine-- the saltiness of canned salsa can't  beat a good goulash.",1
It is obvious he has passion for the subject. The notes are posed in advance. He varies the topics and delivery from day to day. Overall a good learning experience.,1
"God love him, he tries his best, but can only somewhat speak English. Otherwise is very knowledgable and helpful. Would recommend for sure.",0
"Boring class! Lecture material not on tests, but it is online. He sends helpful emails about any technical issues or announcements! Not a bad professor overall!",1
"She really grew on me. the first time i had her i thought she was okay, but the second time i found her very informative. when she is talking about subject matter she really knows she is very clear, organized, and even funny. Its easy to follow along and the readings are usually good. the tests seem daunting but she is a pretty generous grader.",1
Her essay prompts weren't super clear but she did a good job explaining questions and requirements seemed fair. The material about the amazon was really interesting and I learned a lot,1
Passionate about teaching. Open for questions & wants you to learn what others feel. See it from a learning experience & write about how you can understand why the author felt that way.,1
"such a sweetheart! loved him! wore the funnest scarves to class.. a really worldly man, intelligent as anything, shows great film clips.. tests are long with tons of writing, but just write down everything he says in class per film clip and know it, then re-write it.. easiest A ever. Plus it really gets you into movies you wont normally see.HELPFUL",1
"Dr. Pete is a really nice guy however it seems like he is better suited teaching more advanced finance courses. He posts notes on BeachBoard and there are 2 (difficult MC) midterms and a cumulative final. Grade based on exams, a group project and attendance. Book didn’t help much at all. He curves grades at the end.",1
"Excellent prof! Class started out a bit slow coming from a science background, and a lot of the information seemed repetitive. I am glad I did not drop the course though because as the semester went on, the class became more interesting. Really helpful during office hours, and a GPA boosting class for sure! Light workload / fair exams.",1
"A lot of this class is about giving students freedom. However, when it comes to grading, his class kind of stinks. There really is no grading policy other than the story is ""felt"" which is so vague even the professor cant explain it to you, so when you get a bad grade, prepare to feel confused. Fun to take if it doesnt get in the way of a real clas",0
"She is awesome. Willing to help you understand the information. Study powerpoints, no surprises on test everything comes from notes. She records her lecture so you can go back and listen if you need!",1
"Dr. Rumenik means well, but sadly, she misses the mark on being an efficient professor. She knows Psychology material but is not great at teaching it to others. She takes ridiculously long pauses in between sentences, takes an excessive amount of time to answer emails, and goes off on tangents constantly. Also, she lacks up to date tech knowledge.",0
Professor is a great reference. She is very knowledgable and is always available to help. She was a tough grader but gave good feedback.,1
I enjoyed this class. You do need to attend class because he does not post notes on eclass as long as you go you will get a good mark. He has a good heart and jokes around sometimes. He only uses the textbook for a couple questions on each midterm. He is very approachable and I would definitely take another class with him.,1
"One of the silliest, most pretentious, power-tripping, airheaded profs I have EVER had.  I majored in Poli. Sci at Mt. A, and will be attending Grad School in the fall, and she represents the worst of what that discipline has to offer--grand theory with no backing or facts.  Awful!",0
His instructions are confusing.,0
"A poor mans Swales, who puts a great deal of effort into 'getting down with the kids', 
 or at least, the popular ones he tends to favour. He's often late and unprepared for classes, 
 and announces that he'll talk for the next 5 minutes and then let everybody work of 
 their own accord. An extremely lazy teacher, yet a unproportionately harsh mark",0
"LOL, I just notice that he literally put a lot of PUA-related content in his lectures.",0
"His lectures drag on, you cant miss any days or youre grade drops even with an email and valid excuse, he assigns huge assignments on top of tests due the same day, and rushes material to cover as much as possible. Also imposes personal biases too often when lecturing. 2 large papers (8 &10), 4-5 large exams, and 8 or so quizzes.",0
"Hastings is a good guy. Not the best teacher, but he's been around for a while and is there to help you if you need it. Some of his test questions are very poorly worded, so don't be afraid to ask for clarification. Overall easy class.",1
"I had taken Gen. Chem. 1&2 at a community college... So I was super afraid going into this class. This stuff mainly takes a lot of practice (time). Krumpe is awesome at using METAPHORS and making class a light hearted environment. Dont take a lot of other hrs during the semester, and you will do well in his class. He is def one of my favorites <3",1
"Dr. Ernst is by far my favorite teacher at Loyola so far. Her lectures are intriguing, engaging and honestly a pleasure to listen to (if you're interested in Psychology that is). The tests can be hard, but not if you're prepared. She asks that you read the textbook as we cover each chapter, but she also gives you a vocab list before each test.",1
"You and her have no contact. She only assigns text book readings, and a lab or quiz every week. You have to literally read an entire textbook. ",0
She is the best teacher alive. She helps when you need it and will stay after class as well. I also had her for chemistry 104 and made an A in there too she is by far the best teacher at Gadsden state,1
"Davis was an excellent instructor who shows his care for the course material. He wants you to succeed and as long as you want to as well and try, you will. Loved this course and would definitely take it again! Best Class Ever!",1
love her,1
"Kaleem is a meticulous prof. He explained everything in detail except sometimes a bit disorganized. I gave 4 for difficulty because of the assignments, they really took us a huge amount of time. Midterm and final are very manageable though.",1
"I had him twice and I have to say he's one of the best teachers I ever had:)He communicates well with his  students, very helpful and will do whatever he can to help you become a better artist. He makes class fun with his sense of humor and explains his lectures very clearly. I highly recommend him!",1
"Overall he is an okay professor but like many others have said, he talks the entire class and sometimes it seems he's just talking to himself but yet expects us to listen closely. The bright side is that we do watch movies every class but they are sometimes hard to follow and expects us to take notes on them. But I would try to avoid his classes.",0
Great guy. Great class,1
I studied so hard for this class and really thought I did my best on every exam but then failed every exam.. He goes very fast during lecture and does not record them. Coming from a student that has ADHD it is very hard to comprehend during his fast lectures. My self-esteem went way down after taking this class. Never Again.,0
"Tough class, but he will give you points for anything, so show your work. Great guy and awesome class. If you think the material is boring, it will make it hard to listen and do well.",1
Talks very soft and fast. But other than that the class is an easy A,1
"Hard marker, exams are kind of fair",1
John is a highly respected professor in the Walton College. He cares a lot about his students and brings in tons of guest speakers to talk about sales in the real world. Taking his class is a great opportunity you should not miss.,1
"I got an A in SPAN-101 and took spanish all throughout high school so I know I'm not bad at spanish. She assigns a ridiculous amount of homework due every class which turns out to be a large part of your final grade. In the semester I had good grades on all the quizzes, mid term and final, but struggled with homework and ended up with a D.",0
"If this man's thinking were any more constipated, his head would explode.",0
"One of the hardest classes Ive ever taken. He only has two exams. Sounds nice now. But there is no other quizes or anything to bring your grade up. If you do bad on one exam you are screwed. The exams were very hard. Everyone got a 50-60 on the first one. The man doesnt really teach, he goes over a long prez each class. One extra credit for 5 pts",0
"No complaint towards the class material itself at all, very useful class for any programmer who wants to write good code. However, Liberatore and the TA have very different grading standards. So if you get used to how the TA grades you, you will be ripped apart when Liberatore grades you himself. Also no curve at all in the class, a 89.5 is a B.",0
"Hard to understand during lectures. We were graded by 3 exams then the final, all of which were extremely cryptic. He grades very harshly, if you don't write exactly what he wants in an answer you do not receive credit. Remember that his goal for you of the semester is to learn how to think philosophically, not memorize things about philosophy.",0
"Took his B18 online class in the Spring. From what I remember you have 10-question tests every 2 weeks that are 8 minutes each. There was also no final. As long as you follow the readings and don't cram before tests like me, you should do great. His class is only as easy as you make it.",1
"Prof. Velling is a great guy, just a bad professor. He uses Mathlynx and Maple which should not be a way to learn math. He has office hours, but rarely helps the student if they come to ask. If you like Mathlynx and Maple then take him at your discretion. He also has a bad rep in the tutor center for being unorthodox.",0
"While the lecture material is clear and laid out, it often times felt like he was showing and not telling. A clear emphasis is made that prior calc 1 knowledge must be down to a science, and if you fell behind, you stayed behind. There were many unfamiliar problems on homework that often required help from outside sources.",0
"She's a really chill prof, and she leads interesting discussions. The works she picks to read are well-rounded and interesting. Work really hard on the two take-home essays and use her office hours. She really prepares you for the in-class essays, so don't miss class leading up to test days. Readings are due in every class as well as journals.",1
Dr. Hart has a vast knowledge on biology. The major DOWNFALL of her is her teaching method. She is very unorganized. She goes all over the place with her lectures and gets distracted very easily. Most of the time she wouldn't even lecture. She would just talk about herself. Then she would squeeze in a TON of information in the last 15-20 minutes.,0
"I LOVE her! Best professor I have ever had. I actually learned everything in class and hardly had to study anything because she teaches so well. She really cares about her students, and she gives study guides for all of her tests.",1
Best prof. In the department. Very opinionated but very knowledgable and interesting. Impossible to fall asleep in his class. Defiantly likes students who take initiative and seek his help for needed projects.,1
"She is such a fun spirit, and she makes class interesting. My favorite professor so far. Do all her assigned work and connect assignments and you will most likely get an A in the class.",1
"This guy is the man. He's clear, concise and has a good attitude. His class requires a lot of reading and he'll put you on the spot if you don't know what's up. If you do the reading you'll learn something which is never a bad thing...",1
"He really knows the material. Grades homework tough, but will give back points if you can show your reasoning. Lecture notes are well-written and teach what you need to know. The book is needed for HW problems. For the most part, the exams line up with the homework, but unless you are very comfortable with the problems, you will run out of time.",1
"What a roller coaster with Shapiro online. MAKE SURE YOU ARE DISCIPLINED IF TAKING HIS ONLINE CLASS. I slacked on lectures first two exams and did HORRIBLY. His exams are very tricky but if you study hard you'll be ok. THIS IS NOT AN EASY A. His projects and assignments help you make up for difficult exams, and he is accessible for help w projects.",0
"What a boring and horrible professor. He just stands there behind the podium using powerpoint. While not a philosophy major, I need a good background in this stuff for my further studies, but this guy basically made me HATE philosophy. He attempted it cram way too much complicated material in one semester. might be nice, but he stinks as a teachers",0
"Prof. Yuhl is one of the most interesting professors I've had at HC.  Very engaging and prefers to teach her classes as discussions more than lectures.  Overall, a great professor who should be taken by those interested in the course material but avoided by those seeking an easy A.",1
"Not only was he hard to understand and the homework/Accounting CD thing useless, according to his grading scale I should have gotten and A but he gave me a B. I tried emailing him/calling him MULTIPLE times (I'm a transfer), but he never responded. The material is easy but the professor is useless.",0
"Never replied emails!! The feedback he gave me in the extended outline is ""plz insert page number"" and then gave me a 65%. excuse me?? Then another feedback said, ""your final results are different with the results in previous work you submitted, plz explain."" Why? because I found I was wrong in the previous one and now I wanna correct it! Can't I?",0
His class is very easy and he is such a nice guy.,1
WONDERFUL PROFESSOR ! IF YOU GO TO THE CLASS EVERY TIME AND PRACTICE IT'S A PIECE OF CAKE. !,1
"PSCI 100, you must take notes, and literally write down EVERYTHING he says.  No textbook. He usually lets the class out early. He's pretty funny. Short answer tests worth 25% . Also, he posts readings online with lists of terms that you need to be able to recognize. Overall, a good way to learn the basics of political science.",1
He is the most specific grader i've ever had. his lectures are good and you'll understand the concepts but his grading on tests is enough to drive you crazy. You have 4 tests and a final and one of the tests are dropped (if he didnt drop your lowest grade you wouldnt pass). try and take someone else,0
"Rick Brown has been in TV News for a loooong time, which means he knows what he's doing. I heard a lot of scary things about him, like how he was mean. However, he's very nice and gives a lot of constructive criticism. You can tell he's so passionate about his profession and really cares about helping students get jobs in TV News. 10/10",1
"Her blackboard and syllabus are a complete mess but she expects perfection from her students. I took online classes because I work full time, go to school and I am a single mother of 2. I like the option of working at my own pace. She does not allow this and she expects ridiculous amounts of hours from us.",0
"Classroom was an uncomfortable atmosphere, prof frequently told students they were ""wrong"" after he asked a question and was given an answer (it's an ENGLISH course- how can you be WRONG??). not very friendly at all. Critical of feminist theory. Non-approachable. Heavy workload.",0
Worst teacher ever in the whole universe!!!! Did all my work not even miss one paper or a class and he gave me my first D ever.He expects 101 work when he does not teach it!!!!!,0
"Moved to online courses and he did not adjust material at all, actually had more work to begin with. Constantly ignored emails and uploaded materials late. The class became more work than all my other courses combined. Spent 7 hours on one exam that he said would take 2 hours max. Worst professor at wcu and hoping to get him removed",0
"This professor is amazing, she is someone who inspires you and even when class was over you wanted her to keep on going. This class was great for both men and women but be advised some topics can be difficult. You have plenty of chances to earn extra credit and you will learn a lot about yourself. She also, teaches an Intro to Psychology class.",1
I took his class online for Dual Credit and it was difficult but manageable. It was a lot of work but you know the due dates ahead of time so if you don't procrastinate you should be fine & make sure to study on your own - you get out of it what you put into it. Overall I enjoyed the class and the material and he responds to his emails quickly.,1
Overrated prof. Content is boring and he goes way too slow. Posts practice midterms and finals but ends up putting tricks in his actual evaluations. He doesn't seem to care about students or their success and doesn't bell curve at all. Not a good professor.,0
"This class was okay based material but the workshop was such a let down. Her grading is arbitrary and subjective which is completely insane based on the fact most of the work is based of your creativity. I did extra work outside of class and never missed a single class to be sure I secured my A, but only then to be slapped in the face in the end",0
Lots of reading.,1
"He's a decent teacher but if you're work is not in exactly on time he will hate you the rest of the semester. He's not at all flexible or understanding, and on top of that he's extremely boring. If you want an intersting class, or if you are a procrastinator, do not take Blake!",0
"Do not take this class if you do not want to teach yourself. Her lectures were so long and boring they made no sense. She does clicker questions almost every day, so missing class will eventually affect your grade. Her tests do not really correlate with lecture, so study a lot for them in order to get good grades. She is really caring though!",0
Hands down the worst prof in the cs department,0
"She may be a little all over the place but her teaching style prepares you for real life where you have to think and not just regurgitate information. She marks everything herself and gives you points for any relevant thought so it's easy to get part marks. Going to class is essential. Overall great prof, would recommend her any day. ",1
Best online class for history.  His tests are not easy so keeping up with work is important.  Sometimes he opened assignments on Wednesday instead of Monday or Tuesday like he said he would.  Dr. Bachoffer also answered my emails and questions fast.  Fair guy overall.,1
"Grace is the man! It will take awhile for him to open up, but when he does he's easily the coolest teacher in the engineering/physics department. There's only three tests a semester, but he clearly states what will be on each test. He obviously knows what he's talking about and will help anyone who needs it. Take him if you get the chance.",1
"Here is some real feedback: everyone who has commented here either really loves him or hates him. I don't hate him and I don't love him. Truth is he lacks structure, rants quite often, and is way to opinionated for an academic. He may also come off offensive with his opinions. If you want to be entertained by all means take him! Cool guy..",0
"Super easy class if you put in the work. I would study like 2 days a week and I was averaging an A on the quizzes. The cool thing is if you maintain an A in the class you don't have to take the final! He's a little dry at times, but its an interesting class. Would take again.",1
Flannery is a great professor. He is very young and I assume this year is his first year teaching but you wouldn't know it by how well he constructs his lectures. He can be a little over the top at times with his silliness but it makes a boring class easier to understand and more interesting. He is great at answering questions if you ever get lost.,1
He didn't make his grading criteria clear at all and then scolded the whole class for missing the point of the paper. He will make your life so much harder than it needs to be. Take literally any other professor for this class if you can.,0
AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!! I have NEVER had an online class with as many assignments due each week. If you take this professor you might as well quit your job if you want to pass. Professor also wants nothing to do with the students so good luck getting in touch with her. Also all tests require computer lock down and webcam.,0
"i know im not the best at chemistry, but Dr. Bushey was very rude even when it not intentional, writes everything on his screen so its very messy and hard to read, an tests and quizzes are very difficult",0
"Dr. Catto is an amazing prof, much like most profs in the Geography department at MUN. Made this remote learning semester easier.",1
Don't be tricked by this class even if it draws your attention in the beginning. Her lectures went so boring in the later of the quarter that just puts you into sleep. Required many test books. Overall not interesting lectures.,0
"One of the best professors I have had. Knows his subject matter. His use of Heidegger in explaining Transcendentalism this semester was so incredible. You HAVE TO READ!! People say they did not buy the textbooks, but that is only shorting themselves. If you don't use texts in your essays you are penalized. I looked forward to this class.",1
take phys chem from some other professor! this guy is rude if you don't go to class. his handwriting is HORRIBLE! and he speaks very softly.  his classes are too boring to stay awake! take some1 else unless you have a firm gen chem background!,0
amazing teacher! makes you want to learn more and wants everyone to enjoy the class! love love love this class! if everyone has a chance to go on one of his trips you should definately go!,1
"TAKE HIM!!! This is the BEST MATH PROFESSOR. Doesn't mind breaking down anything you dont understand.  He goes over all test/quizz material and will let you use your notes at times. Not a hard grader.  You will not be in class for the full class time. He cares about his students, wish I could take him for all of my Math classes.",1
"No clue to how his grade was based.  Class was in a computer lab, studied basic math systems.  Often makes mistakes in his work, spends only about 20 minutes learning new material.  Go to class and study for the final, if you do well you should be alright.",0
"The book was really helpful and interactive. His lectures basically repeat what you read the night before. DO YOUR HOMEWORK or you will not pass. Tests are difficult, but not impossible. Amazing professor and really makes sure you understand. iClicker required so show up. Mikes Bikes simulation is fun, but hard and you must remember to do it!",1
Very disrespectful person makes fun of sensitive topics. I am someone who isn't sensitive to risky humor but he takes it way to far. Some of the things he said were extremely disterbing and literally threatening. I can't believe some of the things that came out of his mouth. I didn't even feel like I was in a sociology class.,0
"She is an absolutely amazing professor... probably my favourite ever! Don't get me wrong - she's hard, real tough BUT she's so so helpful so never hesitate to ask questions! She's also HILARIOUS, her lectures are amazing. Don't skip them!!! You learn so much during every single one of em. Study long in advance for exams... she packs a lot in them!",1
"Dr. Dan is a great professor. He is very wise, friendly, helpful, and inspirational. This class was a hybrid, so some of the work was online. Dr. Dan designs his classes for those who are not good at taking tests. There are only 4 tests throughout the semester; study for each one and you'll be fine.",1
"He was really awesome! Very very clear lectures with organized powerpoint slides, always took questions and answered them thoroughly. His tests were fair and not just MC which meant it was a little easier to BS...Great class though :)",1
not useful,0
Get ready to read. The information we learned about was interesting but it was a lot of work. There is one paper and one quiz every week. Its a lot of work for an online class but it was interesting.,1
I love this class and think he is an excellent teacher!!,1
Sadly she is the only professor who teaches this class. Something tells me she is an able adminstrator but a very bad professor. She honestly does try but she cannot teach for nuts. Its simpler to just have an online class. She is fair though and tries to help students. Avoid if you can.,1
"Really good prof for a first year class. Wants to see her students do well. Provides final in advance so that students can prepare in advance. Midterm was easy. Is very approachable, either through email or office hours. Lecture material can sometimes be dry but she does a good job presenting it.",1
Her powerpoints are fill in the blank and diagram labeling which is pretty much what her tests are as well. If you've taken other biology courses at JCU youll know that the kind of clear cut straight to the point answers she gives on her powerpoints is heaven-sent compared to other bio courses' material. Lots of extra credit. Highly recommend. ,1
"I took the honors section and it was a ton of work, but I think that should be expected with an honors class. Super knowledgable lady and she's always there to answer any questions. Exams are tough, but again, in an honors course you should expect that. All in all she was super cool and I really liked her class!",1
"Very tough grader and will not curve. There will be extra credit questions on the tests, but, you will also have major points off for minor mistakes. Moves very fast. If you don't already understand the math that you are taking you will be in trouble. If she likes you, she's nice. If she doesn't...........",0
"Each class almost entirely depended on knowing how to do Model UN beforehand so that you could participate in the simulations, which was kind of pointless if the class is an hour and 15 min long twice a week and the simulations dont carry over to the next class. Failed me on final paper with unclear guidelines.",0
Reza is a great guy outside of class and really cares about his students.  In class he is all over the place and VERY difficult to follow and understand,0
He's long winded because he's lived a long time and has a lot of knowledge. Sit up front and prepare before you go to his class. You can coast through the class but when finals come you better know the material because the questions require a lot of thought. Only 2grades & 1 extra credit.,1
"I have taken a couple of classes with Prof. Ni.  He is a very considerate, emotional person with gripping stories to share if you let him.  One of the best professors and men I have ever met.",1
People fall asleep in the class,0
"He does live + prerec lects  2x time on lects. With in-person classes we would be spending x time. This leaves no time for reviewing concepts on our own. Attendance to live lecture is mandatory, I spend extra hr to understand and absorb the prerecorded lecture. His all lects based on assumption we know a lot, doesn't explain concepts very well.",0
"she is honestly such a sweet and caring teacher! She's SUPER funny! I actually used to looked forward to attending her class because she's hilarious and easy to understand. she's very passionate and helpful. if you have her, then you should be happy!",1
"She was an absolutely horrible teacher. She is extremely judgemental and it's clear that she wants you to believe what she believes. I've never had a professor make me cry until I took a class with her. The only good parts about her class was that she allows up to 6 absences, and she puts the notes and podcast on blackboard.",0
The exams are based mostly on the readings. I went to every class and studied my notes and skimmed the readings and it was a mistake. The amount of effort required for her teaching style is unnecessary.,0
This was my FAVORITE English class at GU!! I learned so much about poetry. He teaches you how to interpret poetry by reading the text. He is very generous with help for papers and doesn't expect you to do more than a reasonable amount of work. Better follow the reading schedule!,1
"never take this professor, EVER!!!  Assumes you've studied migration as much as he has and condescends you for having independent thoughts.  His pompous attitude is as ridiculous as the beret he wears!",0
"Whenever a professor is interested in providing the student with the tools needed to excel not only in their course but in life they deserve kudos and a hug,lol.  A professor is the epitome of professors and wants to help you become knowledgeable so you too can change the world, making it a better place for generations to come.What a blessed course",1
Great guy.  Learned a lot from him.  Incredibly patience and knowledgeable.  Take him if you can.,1
His tests are ridiculously hard relative to the rest of the class.  No homework except  3 group projects and 4 quizzes.  LOTS of memorization for the tests.  English is reallllly hard to understand.  He intentionally makes the project descriptions arbitrary and  confusing.,0
She missed 2 classes and I took it during the 6 week summer semester. Very boring discussions and lectures. Tough grader on exams and presentations. Not at all helpful outside of class.,0
"not bad for lab, although the classes go on and on..",1
"She's very nice but infuriatingly slow in lecture. She repeats herself ad nauseam. Her pace would be bearable if her TAs weren't such harsh graders. You have to follow strict guidelines on the papers in order to get anything above a B. I've done well in upper year philosophy courses and got a poor mark in this class, so I wouldn't take her again.",0
"She has no idea what she is talking about, and she stopped teaching the class after 3 weeks...someone else had to start.  What the hell!",0
"She has her quirks but she's a good professor. There are 3 tests, they aren't too terribly hard just be sure to study. She curves each test and then curves the overall scores after the semester . No papers. Pay attention to her lectures because that's where most of her test questions come from.",1
I did not really understand her explanations during the lectures. Better off studying on your own.,0
Great professor. He talks with clarity and is very helpful and open to questions.,1
"Keeping in mind that this class covers two requirements... it is still a lot of work! 15+ articles to read each week w/6-10 discussion posts + responses per week. Midterm and final took hours to do. 3 five page papers and the final project is to create a sculpture. If you have the time and patience for it, it is worth it to get 2 requirements.",0
Only take her if you are a history major. She loves what she teaches which isnt a bad thing but if you dont understand jack crap about history dont take her. Sweet lady though very understanding. However from one slow person to another DONT DO IT!,0
"Went into the class thinking it was going to be an easy A for credit.  It was not as easy as I thought, but with all the extra credit he gives you you'll be fine.  Class isn't really mandatory, but you will benefit from going to class as he gives you information that could help you with tests.  3 tests, a little on the harder side, but manageable.",1
Its one of the hardest and boring class i have ever taken. He did not post any lecture notes or videos and have to attend the class and class is very boring. I have no other option but dont take this course if you are not ready to attend and make notes of each lecture.,0
"Do not take this course as an elective. This guy purposely makes such an easy course so hard. He seems like he cares for his students but, he does not. The amount of reading is ridiculous. The quizzes he makes is purely memorization and its unnecessarily difficult. Just do not take this course/professor. Also he just makes lecture recordings.",0
"definitely can see that he must have been a philosophy minor because what you learn is tied in with a lot of philosophical concepts. He's a nice guy and all but definitely not good at expanding on difficult content, also not so good at responding to emails either. if you aren't good at testing don't take the class. Also grade is made up of like100p",1
All lectures are pre-recorded on Pilot so it's on you to not fall behind. Labs were tough but he posts a video that literally walks you through the whole thing. 5 practice exams with solutions are posted ahead of time for you to study from. Office hours everyday. Tons of extra credit. Class time was just used for Q & A. Videos + Practice Exams -> A,1
awful teacher. would never take this class again,0
"Dr. Lageson is hilarious and truly enjoys teaching Earth Science.  He is passionate about what he does, and that passion makes his lectures wonderfully interesting.  ",1
If you are serious about design then you already hate her.  Completely biased and weakwilled.  It is dispicible that this woman heads design.,0
"class was hard because homework was all online so he doesnt even grade anything. 3 chances online to get it right but if you have no clue as to what you are doing wrong then you cant get it right and there is no partial credit. terrible class terrible teacher, I even had a tutor and went to him for extra help and he gave me a D. terrible professor!",0
She is dull and boring. She talks to you as if you already know all the jargon there is to know about english. She is kinda a tough grader too. Her class is boring to sit through every week. Personally DON'T TAKE HER CLASS. especially if you don't like english,0
"He was actually a pretty enjoyable professor, always gave helpful ways to make sure we remembered important concepts. Definitely need to study from the textbook for the tests, but whatever he focuses on during class and my class notes were actually able to help me do better on the tests! Things he would focus on class would be on tests",1
"Ms. Klebaur is an extremely difficult professor. This was an introduction to psychology course, but I felt that she treated this course as a high level psychology major class. She gives you almost no points for assignments that take hours to complete. If you miss one thing on a discussion post, you'll automatically get a failing grade.",0
"This prof always has a bad attitude and expects the worst out of everyone, very negative. Half the work in her class seems pointless. By far the worst prof I have ever had in university I don't how she is the head of her department....",0
"Professor Papaccio is a fantastic English teacher. I took her for 1201 and 1202. She is super sweet, but knows her stuff. The work is not bad at all. You have one big research paper, and then a few short essays (round 3). She encourages class discussions that are rarely ever boring. She provides ample amount of  feedback on papers to encourage you!",1
"Birr is very strict and doesnt care about weather you pass or fail. All his EXAMS 1,2 and3 about 75% to 85% from GLIEM book questions. It comes with exact answers form GLIEM and somFrom his lectures note. All weekly quizzes from the book. DO NOT EVER TAKE A CLASS WITH BIRR. DO NOT SCREW YOUR SEMESTER WITH BIRR. DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH BIRR.",0
He is such a sweetheart. You will never feel intimidated by him. He will go out of his way to do  his best to help you. His lectures are a bit boring but he can't help it and that is a very small part of the class any ways. Has a great sense of humor. He loves Star Wars and he is really cute.,1
"She's a nice professor, her class was just very dry and a lot of busy work.",0
"GAHHH this class was so over my head :( It was very interesting, for the most part. But don't take his classes as quads, it's too much in too little time. And his tests are REDICULOUS! The final was 20 essay questions. I consider myself a decent student, but this was just hard hard hard :/ Decent prof, willing to help, just hard. Good luck!",1
"I was a little confuse, it was a lot of material and all the question ooked the same.....in the exams i thought i was going to fail with a 30% but ended up getting 73 and 70%...just by using common sense.",0
He was a good person while in class but the worst person to ever stumble upon EVER. Be sure to not email him or have any contact with him. He is rude and full of himself (for what reason i dont know) i feel he gave me a grade not based on what I did but how he felt about me.,0
"This class is an easy A as long as you keep up with the readings and complete the assignments. She isn't a tough grader. The subject matter is interesting and relevant to the border region, but the class materials are extremely dated. The professor speaks during the entire class and students aren't given the opportunity to engage with the material.",1
"One of the best teachers I have ever had. Very intelligent man who encouraged process thinking. Hard maybe, but very fair. Do the work, show the effort and he will give you an A.",1
"He is the worst professor for Biochem. His lectures are full of mistakes and he also makes errors when grading tests. His tests are very detail-oriented, so know every picture the slides, because there are barely any words. If you can, DO NOT TAKE HIM.",0
"Good teacher, very very well informed on his subject and enjoys teaching it. Go to class and do your work and you'll do just fine",1
Goes to great lengths to help you understand if you ask and show interest and take advantage of office hours.  Has good depth of understanding of all physics topics and is genuinely interested in your success.  Heard he was good at PCPS/USP before.,1
"Claims he teaches you to think independently. Dont believe it! He only cares about what he thinks. If you treat him like a guru and agree with his politics, he loves you. If not he blows you off. Very disillusioning to have a philosophy professor who is so close-minded.",0
"The classes are extremely slow, heavy, and redundant. Her teaching method is very confusing unless you ask specific questions and get the answer youre looking for. Resources on blackboard are all over the place so it will take you a while to find the correct resource for the assignment youre working on.",0
"Dr. Colbert is a good prof but a bit of an oddity. She was engaged and knowledgeable throughout the duration of the semester. 30% of the semester's grades come from discussion posts so it is very possible to get an A if you put in the work. I found I disagreed with some of Dr. Colbert's feedback on my essays, but it was not a major problem.",1
"First off, he's a nice guy with a big heart. However, Vallee is very unclear about his expectations. He is a very poor marker; no constant b/w projects/reports. If course material was presented differently, it would make for a much more enjoyable term.",0
"I would personally take him again. He gives you extra credit for showing up. His lectures can get boring at times and you will rarely get out of class early. His worksheets are awful, but you only have 2 of them. Lots of homework and quizzes, but you have multiple attempts on the quizzes. He drops two lowest tests grades and one lowest quiz grade.",1
She does not care if you go to her office hours and show that you are really trying in the class. I had what I thought was a good relationship with her and she still gave me a C. She screams in class a and you cant understand her that well at times. I would never take her again. DO NOT TAKE HER!!!,0
"Really enjoyed her class, made it interesting and fun. I learned a lot. Would recomend her for any class.",1
I took cgeo106 its a one week intensive course i thought it was going to be EASYYYYY. I WAS SOOO WRONG! You like have to pay attention to what he says in lecture because his tests are mainly based on what he verbally says. His slides are all pictures there are no words so like there's no getting around not listening. But he is nice.,0
Guy cares about what he teaches and speaks well with lots of hand gestures. Lectures are mandatory in the sense that they cover so much and are interesting,1
"Her class is a bit boring for the 2 hour and 45 minute TOSS class, but she really does care and she yearns for her students to be interested in what she has to say. The course load is pretty minimal compared to other TOSS classes, and the textbook readings are short and sweet. All that she goes over is relevant and useful.",1
"She is amazing professor! Super passionate in her field, always willing to help students out, goes above and beyond with feedback, and is really approachable. Just make sure you really put effort into doing the readings. Definitely a real gem, take her class! I can definitely say I Learned a lot from her.",1
"Easy A if you show up, and even if you dont, he sends out ALL the info you need for the final. Your grade depends only on the final so you can never come to class, study the guide he sends out and pass- but I suggest actually going its FASCINATING if youre interested in Philo.",1
"Amazing and very easy class. Lectures are fun and you can tell he knows what he's doing, I would highly recommend him to anyone looking into criminal Justice.",1
"The TA I had was the worst TA in all of UK. He failed almost our entire class on the first midterm exam. He is a terrible discussion leader. He makes the class feel uncomfortable, and he is very disrespectful towards all students. Dr. Summer's is fine, he's just extremely boring, very knowledgable though.",0
"Dr. Jurisich is one of the worst math professors I have ever had. She gets flustered about the material, & her hw assignments take a huge amount of time. She does offer help in office hrs, drops your lowest hw, & lets you use a formula sheet for tests, so its possible to do well if you are willing to learn on your own and read the book.",0
"To put it simply, get ready to teach yourself Orgo Chem I and pray that the massive curve at the end of the course will save you. Only 4% of people in my 200+ section made A's.",0
rambled during class and expects you to learn most material on your own through the text book. tests are really tough.,0
"Horrible prof! Encourages everyone to take the course, but delivers the course extremely poorly. He is extremely lazy. There are absolutely NO course notes. He has slides but refuses to post them anywhere. This course is a chaos. The course itself is good, but its not worth taking it with him!",0
"Seems scary but its actually the most caring professor. She wants you to be the best writer possible. After taking her, I am a more advanced writer. She is DEMANDING but if you listen to her long list of DOs and Donts then you will get an A. LOTS of work but she will give you extensions if you need it. Im very thankful to have had her.",1
"Class is boring at most times though he is a nice, charismatic guy. Difficult political theory material and I'm not quite sure if it attempts making it easier on anyone.",0
did not like,0
Great prof and fairly easy if you do the readings :),1
"I'm asian, and thought of her history class as the ""white people suck"" hour. Lots of political bias and unnecessary tangents on historically irrelevant current-day issues. She's limited to presenting a leftist view of history. An excellent instructor who is willing to listen and assist.",1
Dr. Kovatcheva is incredibly kind. Her students love her and she speaks French very well. Take this class with her!,1
"Very nice, helpful, and relatable. Her assignments are reasonable, as well as her grades. She made class interesting and I looked forward to going. I would definitely take her again and recommend her to anyone.",1
"Great professor! Have taken him twice. Very entertaining and funny and knows everything about the subject.Very easy going,and friendly. He is absolutely not hard.Two small quizzes, and Three papers: 2 five page and one 20 page. This is a senior history course if you can't write a paper after 4 years in college then you have problems not him.",1
Professor Jackson is so rude. She gives so much assignments and doesnt explain the course well at all. She always has an attitude when you try asking her a question. I would never take her class again.,0
"BORING!!  class is often useless, bc/ he spends most of the time deriving equations which are derived in the book.  and since you never have to derive an equation on the exam (you just use them), the class is useless.  tries hard but his lectures are gay and dry.  lauterbach is much better",0
trust me when i tell you this guy will never understand your point of view on anything its either his way or the highway he is absolutely a terrible professor and you'll hate having him as your lab instructor,0
Her hybrid lectures were not different than what was posted online. Frustrating because she would just show the same videos and a very surface/basic outline of the chapter in actual class time that was already online. Also the essay citations must be within 5 years and that was not clearly communicated. Which left an excessive point reduction.,0
"impossible to understand and even more impossible to contact. doesnt help with anything and barely goes over the materials needed. things in the homework have no relation to what is ""taught"".",0
"Great Professor. Lectures are long and there are a lot of notes which you have to go to class to get, but if you go and pay attention and take good notes its an easy class. 2 exams, which are not hard if you pay attention, and 2 4 page papers which are graded very leniently. No homework. Over all an interesting course, would recommend to others.",1
"Took this as an online course. My main complain was that the weekly quizzes and the three tests had such a small time limit that it left you feeling in a panic.   A lot of reading and seemed like what you read was not on the tests and quizzes. There was a weekly chapter to read, summary to write and quiz to take. Three online tests total.",0
"He seemes like a good man, but as a Professor sadly just not very good. Notes are limited, extra hard questions are in lectures. The way he explains things isn't great either.",0
GAH i couldnt understand him to save my life!! worst struggle ive ever had.. he means well and teaches the material pretty smoothly but i never learned anything cuz i was buys trying to figure out what he was saying!,0
He is an amazing prof. He does love grammar so if that is not your strong suit go with someone else. But I love M'OD and have gone to his office just for visits when he is not even my professor anymore. He does grade papers a little tough so make sure you understand what he is asking of you.,1
"Dr. Johnson is an incredible professor and cares greatly about his students. If you don't attend class, you will not pass, as exam and quiz material is taken directly from lecture. Additionally, he does not post his lectures online since they are all hand-written on a whiteboard. He is a great teacher and his lectures are always interesting!",1
"Refuses to publish his powerpoints, read the textbook and pay attention to his study guide to figure out what type of test he's giving this time. Unsure if he's just new to the job or what, but he was completely inconsistent in assignments. Also regularly says inflammatory things to get discussions going. ",0
boring! she lectures reading the power points! i am interested in the subject but this class is just horible...,0
"When Dr. Anderson taught this course, it was Harry Potter and Homer. Easily one of the best classes I've taken and he is prob my favorite professor. He will challenge you to think outside your comfort zone and look at literature in a new way. He might have ruined Harry Potter for me but I'd take his class again in a heartbeat.",1
"After looking forward to this class, I left completely frustrated. The professor appears lazy using pre-recorded lectures to teach core concepts instead of actually teaching in class. There is a heavy reliance on the doc cam, which is close to worthless, as his writing is abbreviated and extremely hard to read.",0
"Dr. Kernan is good. Show up and participate and you are fine. Weekly modules, includes 1 homework assignment and one quiz. The entire semester is you working in a group to answer questions on material regarding the assigned module for the week. No exams. Easy A if you show up and work.",1
"Pretty great guy in person, but as a prof he's a little tough. I didn't have any major issues with him and his grading, but a lot of the people in my class did. Be careful when taking him. Be very careful. Definitely passable, but you will have to work and be almost perfect.",1
"Horrible teacher, offers to help but never takes you up on the offer, i emailed him several times for help on the final paper and never received an email back. Then has the nerve to give a bad grade. Also takes up the entire class time talking about nothing and yet attendence is mandatory? He enjoys hearing himself speak about literaly nothing.",0
"Writes in an illegible script. I could not read his writing and some of the textbooks for his class are in his handwriting. Trying to decipher the notes and ""textbooks"" took more time than the homework problems. If you're trying to prep for upper div math then take him at your own risk but if you're just trying to understand I would not recommend.",1
"Relies too much on powerpoint and biographical info, does not attempt to explain its relevance to the text.  Went to Harvard, buys into the Ivy League Bias -- bad taste as Harvard gains one the image of an education rather than genuine education.  He should not be teaching at Trinity with great profs like Salomon, Middleton, Aarons, Coltharp, etc.",0
"She made the class real easy by not making us go to class,  however when she grades she is tough I did every assignment and made A's on every test and I will just barely have an A don't know why, but a great class anyways",0
wooowww one of the worst teacher I've had in my life...,0
"midterms are super fair, assignments a bit complicated, but he gives good lectures. he says you may need the textbook but his notes and practice papers are enough",1
Horrible teacher. she made me want to drop out of college entirely. She lowered my self esteem and I felt very uneasy around her. TAKE KATHY SOHN!!!,0
"Like many have said, he is one of the most apathetic professors I've ever had. A friend in the class ended up spending a week in the hospital and Kearl was unwilling to work with her to adjust homework that was due, and a test that was coming up. The guy has an ego like no other. Stay away!",0
"One word to describe him: Lazy. His marking is inconsistent. He just assigns readings and essentially you do all the work. What is the point of even having a professor? Also, he doesn't mark the final because everyone receives the same grade they were given throughout the year.",0
"She comes off as mean at first, but then you learn her sense of humor. She is very clear in her teaching. Easy to understand. You have to have the courage to speak up and tell her when you don't understand something, then she will help you and won't make you feel bad for asking. The book is expensive and confusing but she is great. Tests are easy!",1
MacMillan teaches the ribozyme section and refuses to put any effort into his notes or lecture plans. His lectures are all over the place and he often misspeaks and does not correct himself. Comparing MacMillans lecture quality to the other excellent profs in this course (Dr. Mok / Dr. Shultz) is embarrassing. Worst prof I've had in my IMIN deg.,0
"Omg dont take comp with her. I learned more from the writing center than I did from her and nobody in my class made a good grade. She doesnt mark your papers, telling you where you messed up and doesnt explain anything. Honestly could have taken the class without her and just using the writing center and still wouldve got the same grade.",0
"CHOOSE ANOTHER PROF!! This guy is giving us 50 mins to answer 80 questions on the final :// ++ he makes things complicated than it shoul be. Don't ask questions hel'll just say ""I just did it"" or ""it's pretty straightforward"" yikes",0
Dr. Pringle taught the second semester of this course and she is a fantastic person and her lectures were well organized but her tests were absolutely ridiculous. She would ask a question about 1 sentence on one slide that would be completely irrelevant to the rest of the topic. She's a good person but terrible test maker.,0
"I literally wasted 3 college credit hours on this class. Dr. Cook may be a nice person, but he's an AWFUL lecturer. If you see Religion, Magic & Witchcraft in the course listing, STAY AWAY. It is the most boring, pointless waste of time you'll ever have.",0
"He is a very monotoned speaking guy. He  talks constantly about the same thing without telling you what it means, or if its important. He will tell you you are wrong very rudely if you attempt to raise your hand to answer, yet gets mad at the class for not raising their hand and answering. He is very biased on the way he teaches. Don't take him!",0
"""Sooby"" is the worst professor myself or any of my classmates have ever had. Don't even try to ask a question in his class. He will basically shut you down and ridicule you in front of the whole class. He sends out rude emails, passive aggressively threatens students with their grades, and talks down to everyone. Also his website sucks! AVOID!!!",0
"P.Davis has very clear instructions and expectations. Always had feedback and good questions. 1 wkly DB, M.C midterm and final (open book), 3 papers, but they are not hard. You learn if you choose to do the work. I'm military and needed an extension, and she was understanding, although she does have a policy about that, so be sure to read it.",1
Interesting and enjoyable class.  He does a good job of clarifying the material and is very strait forward.,1
I don't think he cares any more...,1
"Great guy. Great Jokes. Fun atmosphere, tons of laughs and giggles. Best class I've taken in OM",0
"The guy is ALL Over the place. I mean come on, as I write this i still havent received my grades from him for the Fall semester... Ridiculous. Brilliant Professor but is one of the most disorganized humans I have encountered in my life. Doesnt seem to follow a plan and really just rambles on for the entire lecture.",0
Very funny and clear teacher. Teaches very well. Assigns a lot of readings but you don't have to do them. Gives a study guide before the test and a question session. Tests are relatively easy. ,1
He is rude and harsh; very negative,0
I came into Metcalf's class with no prior experience in Chemistry. The class difficulty was rather difficult but the tests were definitely possible to do well in. His lectures usually do not reflect what you need to master for the test. I recommend doing the recommended practice problems that are on the syllabus and the homework. STUDY AND PRACTICE,1
"Althoug sometimes confusing, he certainly thinks like an economist. He has incredible knowledge of the course, and is very responsive to queries.",1
"Sweet lady, but i dont understand how i got a b-in the class when i got high As on EVERYTHING. She claims it's due to my lack of participation. WELL ITS NOT MY FAULT THAT THE SAME 4 PEOPLE talked all the time. she doesnt listen to me when i did talk, so whats the point. save your time and get a better professor",0
"Easily the most enjoyable class of my life. The way she teaches the material is second to none and she always finds a way to make you look forward to her next class. She is the most informative and likable professor Ive had to date. Unfortunately, she is retiring and I was a proud member of the last class of her career. I loved every minute of it.",1
Takes forever to grade.,0
Dr. Bohanna seems like a really great person and teacher but her tests are very hard. I did make an A only because this class was online this semester making it a little bit easier with some tests not being proctored due to tech issues. Her lectures can be long but they are told like a story so write everything down.,1
"If you dont understand the material, and cant find outside help, good luck.",0
"He has a lot of knowledge to share with you, but expect it to come out in tangents. His assignments are vague, but he gives a lot of good feedback and room for you to explore your own personal design ideas. His dry sense of humor isn't for everyone and you'll only get out of the class what you put in, but you will learn a lot.",1
HORRIBLE TEACHER!,0
"GREAT professor! He's very tough and serious about his class, but his lectures are great. Extensive analysis of the texts in lecture prepare you for the test. MUST attend lecture to pass. His lectures are very interesting and he's such a character!",1
"Pretty dissapointing. Her tests are Long and overshadow anything else you might do in the course. over 1/4th of your grade will be determined in 50 min and by 3 questions. She's a very nice person but is incapable of teaching. If possible, avoid having her.",0
"Professor Rugg is really enthusiastic about kinesiology, and he's always excited to be teaching. He covered a lot of material and it wasn't always well-organized, but the tests and homework assignments were open note (online semester). He's always open to answering questions after class and is also helpful during office hours.",1
"Make no mistake, 18-100 is a weeder course: *very* hard exams and if you're drowning no effort will be made to save you if you don't take initiative. Great professor if you get to know him though. (Protip: Don't understimate HW2).",1
"It used to be a very easy class. You would just come to class, listen to his lectures, and take notes. However, after the school shut down because of the virus, he got lazy. Instead of doing video lectures like other teachers, he decided to give us tons of long readings. He would ask us to find answers from the readings, which are very difficult.",0
"3 long hard quizzes every wk, long weekly hw, reads of her notes in lecture (which are a worse rehash of the wikipedia/textbook, cancels her OH because she's too busy/forgets from her email replies, and gives projects late leaving little time to consult TAs/her. Absolute nightmare, worst professor ever and I've done 7 Math400 classes before hers.",0
Worst professor I ever had,0
"Grades essays very hard, and rewrites never improve a full letter grade (and rewrites and original grade are averaged together).  Class was extremely boring and she didn't make enough effort to push the conversation forward, leading to long, awkward silences.  Some books were enjoyable, others were not great reads.",0
"Good guy, but meh as a professor. Youtube and SLG will be your bestfriend.",0
he is so boring. tries to be nice but comes off as condescending. exams are the hardest things ever. only gives one day to complete a final worth 25% of grade. feedback is not that helpful and just is overall not the best.,0
Amazing Prof,1
"Took Dr. Licari last Spring, one of the kindest, wisest, sweetest ladies working at SJU. She takes on the attitude that her students are a direct reflection of her, and cares so much. Take her 10/10 times",1
"often says ""i disagree"" to the students opinions without giving any reason..",0
This lady is NUTS! Avoid taking this course with her if you can! Take my advice please! You will be better off taking this course with somebody else!,0
Take this professor! Literally the easiest A and I even missed an exam and he let me make it up for full credit. Very caring and the tests are easy!,1
"He is really boring, but if you can get ""study guides"" then you are totally fine to get at least a B Not as horrible as people make him out to be. You really dont have to go to class much, but if you do Drink COFFEE!",0
He takes a a long time to understand the abilities of the students he teaches. Does not understand the preparation given by the prerequisite courses and assumes a lot of material not covered by other courses. His homework is achievable but difficult. His exams are tough. Not much feedback initially but was decent by the end of the course.,0
Unless you want to fail do not take. He mumbles and has a heavy accent. You will fail. My class started off with 35 students ended with less than 10. ,0
"She's a nice teacher, don't get me wrong but she cancels class all the time. I signed up for Eng 102 at 9:00 am and I drive all the way from Caldwell to Boise. Waits last minute to post email about cancelled class. It's week 8 into the semester and she hasn't posted any grades on Blackboard. It's supposed to remain a mystery if you pass or fail...",1
He is so funny and is so good at explaining. his lectures help so much and he will help during office hours.,1
Tammi is more than a great teacher. She cares about each and every one of her student and will go beyond to help them succeed. I am a shy person in class but she made it comfortable for every student. Really enjoy having her as a teacher and advisor. Definitely recommended her,1
very nice professor and very understanding. Definetely take him if you get a chance!,1
"AMAZING prof, fantastic lectures. He is a genius and it is truly a gift to hear him speak. He makes you want to do well on essays to make him proud. That he retired after my taking only two courses with him is legitimately upsetting.",1
"Basically we just write screenplays outside of class, and then discuss each others' work in class. We all get critique at some point or another. Very passive class. Excellent professor. Highly recommend if you're into writing.",1
Prof Molina is a GEM! I cannot recommend her enough. She is extremely helpful and provides many useful resources. Her lecture videos are both entertaining and engaging. She cares so much for her students. TONS of extra credit. Tests are fairly simple and straightforward. I wish I could take her for every class. Please take Prof Molina if you can!,1
Passed Accounting 2 with an A again. The study plan on MyAccountingLab works along with going to class and listening to her explain topics and material we are learning. Excellent teacher. ,1
"Dr. Jacobson was a lovely person. She was super understanding and was willing to work with shyer students when it came to presenting in the class. While she was funny, she also admitted that she had her flaws, and was willing to listen to other perspectives. She kept the environment respectful. It was an overall good experience.",1
"A product of a different age, which can make him a tad inaccessible. Despite teaching a Document Design course, he's unfamiliar with computer techniques (how to download a pic from google, etc).His grading is abstract- with no rubric and few comments, and refuses to use Blackboard",0
"Dr. Kauffman is a great Prof, a little intimidating in the beginning but once you get used to his teaching style he's incredibly helpful. Had this professor for nine semesters and I strongly suggest him to anyone in need of a great class! Extremely helpful, and willing to help until you fully understand the concept :)",1
"Sandy was not understanding or kind about the COVID-19 situation at all. Students used to love her, but her true colors came out when she made students pay for online cameras and forced us to watch hours worth of lectures and do online zoom labs for hours even though our college experience got ruined. Hard class. Not kind teacher. Good luck folks.",0
"you might think you r the luckiest to have him, but guys, think outside the box. he would answer your question after you turn the assignment. never ever try to talk to him about your situation because he doesnt care, he might seems like he does. you will work really hard to earn each point and he will be more than happy to take 20 points for nothin",0
"The best Prof in the world. What a guy, what a ma dude! Teaches wonderfully and his course is mathematically great. Let's you build your own matching model. Best Prof!",1
Literally the worst teacher I've ever had.  The only kinds of students that like him are those that are gullible enough to buy into his wannabe hippy mentality.  He just only teaches to live vicariously through his students and his not even slightly helpful unless you suck up to him on a daily basis.,0
You can only enjoy this if you are a chem genius! His tests  are so hard and tricky. But his final exam which was written by 2 other profs was fair.  you will definitely fail the first midterm if you are an average student. He even tells you that every year his first midterm average is only 30%. good luck,0
"loved the idea of the class, wasn't aware of a lot of things posted on Moodle",1
"Probably the worst instructor I've ever had. Mumbles random sentence fragments and reads off the powerpoint. If you can actually pay attention to what he says for longer than 5 mins, you truly deserve a medal. Gives a huge curve on tests to cover up the fact that he's a terrible teacher. Never study the powerpoints, none of the info is on the test.",0
"On the first day of class Mrs Shapero walked in with a matching exercise outfit and a recyclable Trader Joe's bag. I had a sinking feeling in my stomach, expecting her to be stuck up and lame. I couldn't have been more wrong. Mrs S is the least prejudiced, most helpful, most passionate, most authentic professor I have ever taken. Highly recommended",1
"No grading rubric. One of my teammate received 18 on midterm which was significantly lower than mine. His grade was only half letter grade lower than me.  I asked him to show me a breakdown of my grade. He didn't show it to me, because there is none!",0
"Amazing lectures, lots to learn from. All five projects were lots of fun. However the midterm was 25% and the final is 30%, so make sure you go to class and pay attention if you want to do well on those.",1
"Great prof; very kind.  Wonderful lectures, and clearly incredibly knowledgeable about the material.  Exams are NOT analytical.  VERY DIFFICULT if you have grown accustomed to the traditional style of the 'Liberal Arts'.  Hard to pull a B... Recommend if you have an intense interest in the subject and can cope with the high level of difficulty.",1
"If there's one piece of advice I could give anyone it would be to NEVER take this professor. I went to tutors and learned through them, however he gave me no credit on several problems because they weren't his way and he doesn't give partial credit on anything! Unless you're a genius in calc do not take him, he isn't worth the stress.",0
"Easy class, good teacher.  Pay attention in class and you will have absolutely no troubles with anything.",1
"Cool guy, very helpful, keeps things lively and interesting.  Assignments and exams are tough, but fair.  Brings plenty of real-world examples into class and has some great stories too.  All-round good guy.",1
Brilliant man!  That about sums things up.  His class was really the only worthwhile one I've taken this semester.,1
"Each student interprets things differently and even if you get the concept of the material right, it's like she grades you low if you don't word things EXACTLY how she sees fit. I'm a great writer, but even I struggled with nailing every assignment due to her tough grading. My other 400 level Psych classes were a breeze compared to her class.",0
"Excellent teacher and quite trained in the field of communication. Is demanding of students but the workload is all for the purpose of imrpoving the communication skills of every one of her students. Can't say enough about this teacher, one of the most interesting and intellectually compelling I've ever had! Recommend to all!",1
"Jaideep is probably the best prof you could get for this course. All exams are based off lecture notes, which he writes directly on the board, so you have to be there every class (or find a buddy). He has so much knowledge of the industry and wants you to succeed. Easy points from learnsmart and connect HW. If you put in the work you will get an A.",1
"Worst professor I have ever had. He is a jerk. He gives no feedback. One time, every student failed a group paper. All 3 groups got an F. He said, ""it's not my responsibility to provide feedback. Just be better."" HE IS HORRIBLE. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME.",0
"Dr. Chet is very kind and entertaining, certainly a unique man. His lectures are long but engaging and fun. Chet's history class covers lots of material making it somewhat difficult. If you do not study or work hard, you will not come close to receiving an A in his class. Good guy all around though, he is a lot of fun to be around and listen to.",1
I had her for my Advanced topics in Cognitive psych class (Spring 2018). Homework is pointless busy work. Group projects that she expects perfection on. More pointless memory journals. Final paper is expected to be like a PhD thesis. Feeback very unclear. No tests. Attendance not mandatory but participation is a huge part of grade.,0
"When you take Honors 210 do yourself a favor and do not take White's & Ritzenhoff's section. Before, this class was only taught by Ritzenhoff, which everyone said was fun. This was the first year with White & she was awful. Gives no assignment guidelines, not available for help with assignments, and then has audacity to tell you not to worry Awful",0
"He is truly THE WORST PROFESSOR I'VE EVER HAD IN MY 4 YEARS OF COLLEGE. His class is not structured at all, his teaching style is boring, he does not care about students, and his tests are VERY difficult. Look, there are WAY better professors for management at Pace, please AVOID HIM... you will not regret it.",0
You don't attend Thurs and have DBs about movies instead those days. Proceeded to look around at what people said the movie was about then pretend I watched it too. Final project poorly explained. No lectures in class; all you do is discuss assigned readings in groups. Why is this not an online class? Ugh. I couldn't take her seriously.,0
"If you showed up and paid attention, everything was very simple. Makes it very easy for you to understand. Great teacher",1
"Professor McDonnell is one of the nicest people I have ever met. She is an awesome person, and her class can be fun. There is a lot of homework but not usually an overwhelming amount. Her class is definitely worth taking, it made me a better writer for my other classes.",1
Best professor I have ever had in college. This is the way all professors should be. This guy definitely sets the bar for excellence. Wish I could have this guy again.,1
What an amazing professor.  He encourages conversation.  He finds value in many views.  He uses real like experience as a way of teaching this class.  Very supportive of students.  Available to answer questions and help when needed.,1
"Isn't much of a teacher. She relies on the online homework, which she doesn't create, and reads off power points for every single lecture. If you are able to do the online work on time and can handle sitting through incredibly boring lectures where you won't learn anything, she may be the teacher for you.",0
"Donald donald donald, If you only know what he speaks about in class, you will fail. His lectures are more of discussions rather than actually teaching. Hilarious and super nice guy. Donald the type of guy to be held at gunpoint and still whip out a joke about his nieces.. If he gave good notes, he would be the GOAT prepare for the curve",1
"Gives a lot of assignments that can be subjectively graded. Made the final non-multiple choice with certain questions that were very ambiguous. Seems like a nice guy, but the class was quite disorganized and poorly formatted.",0
"I took this teacher for Statistics at De Anza and it was a rollercoaster to begin with. Constant shouting of ""Stop Talking, You have a question?"" and other little distractions that would get her off topic. Her lectures move at a slow pace and staying focused is hard due to her thick accent. Overall would not take again, nor recommend to anyone.",0
Lectures are packed with a lot of material. She uses good examples and is willing to help students if they ask. Homework is not mandatory but is very helpful and she will go over it if you ask. Offers a lot of opportunities for help if you choose to take them. I had her for two terms in a row and would take her again.,1
"Dude is the best, 2 pages long essays doubled spaced!!! can't beat that",1
"Dr. Dulin-Mallory is a joy, if you take her class seriously and put in sufficient effort. She will genuinely help you if you go to her outside of class and make the effort. She enjoys what she teaches and it shows in her lectures.",1
"Prof. Danko is very kind and she tries to be lenient. There was a group assignment in almost every class for the first half of the semester so make sure you have a good group. She gives you a handout before each exam that covers what will be on it, which is very helpful. Overall pretty easy if you do the work.",1
He doesn't explain assignments or expectations.  Everything I learned was from reading the book & teaching myself. Worthless professor.DO NOT TAKE HIM!,0
She rambles...A LOT and is very hard to understand. She also likes to repeat things. I barely went to class and still got a B,0
He is a pretty nice guy and makes a point of making himself available for individual questions after class. However the class itself is by far the hardest class to get an A in I have taken at this school. With new reading assignments each night (4 a week) usually ranging from 50-80 pages I spend more time on this class than my others combined.,0
"I am thoroughly impressed with how Dr. Kelley laid out course materials in Blackboard. Everything is easily accessible, organized to limit confusion for students. I WISH that every professor would lay out their classes this way.",1
"Id say she was a fairly average teacher. I personally hate group tests, but I had a fine group. On the cumulative final we were allowed a single paper cheat sheet, and I filled it to the brim. Theres a lot of content and I think I would agree with the other comments about her lecture slides being a weak point. But overall shes a fine teacher.",1
"Gerry is the best professor that I have had thus far at St. FX. He is extremely passionate about his chemistry, and is very helpful. Do your homework and you'll get a great mark. He is a brilliant man (his mental calculations are unbelievable) who is a very generous marker. If you have a choice, take his class!!",1
"It honestly is an awesome class, and there's no one I'd rather have as a teacher. Yes, there are quite a few readings, but they are easy to keep up with if you space them out enough. Studying for quizzes and tests is more complex, but it is a positive experience learning how to.",1
"This professor is tougher than she looks. The course seemed to good to be true, and it was exactly that. She would provide me with feedback that really made me feel incompetent and discouraged about my writing, especially since I received a 4.0 in both my English comp classes. Vagueness seemed to be attached to all of her assignments too.",0
I took this class during summer and it wasn't hard at all. We had a quiz and discussion board post due every week and they were easy. Gives exams to study guides which were very helpful. She made class fun and made everyone laugh all the time.,1
"Prof Kelly's course is great to take. I found it fairly easy. Many of the questions on the test are common sense if you listen to him or read the book. He assigns a textbook and his own book. I did find his own book hard to get through at times. He is also very fair- he missed classes and as a result, made the fourth test optional to take!",1
"I took this class because Dr. Allen really is a persona. He's such a big deal in the philosophy department. While lecturing about Zarathustra, Dr. Allen's voice took on an embodied character, and he told us how Zarathustra came to town to spill his giant load of wisdom on the people. This is serious business. I'd never learn this in science class.",1
"Kind of a tough course, make sure you study and understand concepts rather than memorizing stuff and it should be okay. Tests were pretty hard, however he did curve a couple.",1
"The class was a total JOKE, respectfully. Seems hard at first because you get HW, 1 Midterm, 2 Quizzes, 1 Final & Extra Credit project. Midterm problems are identical to HW (which is online) & the final was online (answers on Chegg). Copies from solution manuals during lectures, cancels class & arrives late all the time & posts grades 2 weeks late.",0
"Awesome Teacher!  She makes calc seem easy, and shes HOT!!!",1
"Completely self taught. Unless you have a good concept of what finance is already, avoid taking this with Wagner. He gives no lecture material. I have had other courses online where instructors upload videos showing you how to do the formulas, none of that was provided in 3220. I feel this course has done a disservice to its students. Shame on you.",0
"If you don't have to take this professor, DO NOT! He's a very smart man but he cannot teach for the life of him. He's a terrible teacher. He lectures but not well. He doesn't explain  anything or walk you through what exactly you need to do. EVEN IF YOU ASK HIM!!!",0
She shouldn't be teaching this class. She used another teachers syllubus and scheduale. She had a hard time answering questions about the subject being covered. The grading system is hard to understand and you don't really know what your grade is until she posts it at the end of class. Massive point deductions for small errors like others have said,0
"Lectures are not very interesting usually, but he can be funny and make things fun to learn sometimes.  However, he really cares about his students, and he is always willing to help them out.",1
"10pg research paper, group project, surprises quizzes, & participation points. You will read until your eyes bleed. Check out author's work beforehand, I'm very serious. Midterm & final are based on the readings. You will not pass if you don't read the material TRUST ME. Angley is great & helpful, but this is not an easy A. Proceed with caution!!!!",1
"He is arrogant, pompous, and condescending. The grade breakdown is extremely tough and unforgiving. The lectures are boring and testable material is just barely glazed over. I would never take a course with him again, nor would I recommend taking a course under him.The only way you will enjoy this class is if your entire life is devoted to classics",0
"If you don't like to work hard, you won't suceed in this class. As long as you can handle ambiguous direction, this is a great class. Very realistic to the real world and Kai is one of the only profs I've had who actually knows what he's talking about. I recommend taking the class - but be prepared to work.",1
"I really did not like this class. I use to love history, but after this class I dont know if i'll ever take another history class at oregon. She says if you know the answers to the questions in the beginning of her lecture slides you'll be fine but her questions are super broad and on the test they are very very specific.",0
"Professor was not clear on requirements of paper assignements, which made it difficult to understand what he was wanting us students to complete. We had to complete 8 small paper assignments plus a 15+ paper, along with obnoxious midterms and finals. Hard and stressful, not worth the stress or listening to his nasal-y voice.",0
"An absolute gem!  Sadly, I only had her for this one course - I truly missed out.  Few professors, if any, show the same kind of dedication and genuine care that this professor does.  And given EVERYTHING she does, besides teaching, that's nothing short of remarkable!  If I were grading her, A+++.",1
I took her SOCIB1 class for my fall semester and I guess shes okay. Not the best professor but if youre looking to just pass and not learn take her. I was hoping for an A but she gave me a B just because I was an inch off of a cover paper for the 10 page paper we had to do. Believe me if you follow her format she wont read it. Tests are easy.,1
home works are so long like 8 parts per question basically. possessor is kind of boring. no cheat sheet for midterms his definition of cheat sheet is a formula sheet. random memorization of schematics. test tend to be long and boring.,0
She is such a nice prof. I really enjoyed her class. I wish she would stray from rond point a bit more and give more paper handouts/exercises. Her tests are very hard if you do not study the material covered for that chapter. She is very understanding and willing to work with each students individual circumstances. One of the best profs at GVSU!,1
"Often, he teaches us techniques that should have been taught before working on a project with a deadline fast approaching.This is due to the fact that he is pretty much at the same skill level as his students. The only difference is he has modeled houses & bottles more than anyone taking his course.",0
"Pretty easy class, but he is a tough grader on the 3 short essays we are assigned. His writing isn't the clearest but write down what you can from the board, listen to his lectures, and you'll do fine on the quizzes (offers curve). Very awkward professor but he's kind and soft spoken.",1
Dr. Young is extremely rude and condescending. She will treat you like you are in elementary school. She refuses to be wrong and claims to be an expert on things that she doesnt know anything about. I cried in this class twice a week. There is also an insane amount of work in this class and she grades your personal note taking subjectively.,0
"I took Akeroyd for two semesters now, He is by far an excellent math teacher, he knows whats hes doing and, is enthusiastic about what he does. I recommend him to anyone interested in a good math class",1
"Absolutely awful - dunno what the hell that guy underneath me is saying in his comments but he mustve been a teachers pet to have liked her - there were plenty of those that she got along with. Take care my young padawan, keep getting stepped on - clearly you like it :)",0
"He really knows his material but his tone is the same throughout the lecture so it gets boring. He tries cracking jokes, but my class either never understood them or they just were not funny. His tests are extremely hard. He has to do at least a 15 point curve for so the majority of the class doesn't fail the tests. ",1
"this man is not a man, he is a total jerk.  He is unhelpful and demoralizing.  he should have been fired 15 years ago.  very condescending.",0
Easily the best CS teacher I have had at UVA. Focuses much more on problem solving concepts rather than just the material. Homeworks are very challenging but well worth the time spent. I really feel like I learned a lot from this class.,1
"All he does is sit in front of the computer and ramble around through the Bible every class. It does not appear that he prepares for class, just opens the book and starts swimming around. He also says some pretty weird things, on avg, once a week. Only 3 tests for grades, all it takes is one little slip to mess you up entirely. Choose someone else.",0
TOUGH GRADER!!!!,0
"I enjoyed Prof. Rosen. She can be hard, and yes difficult to understand, but she'll help you when you come to her office. That's where you'll win props with her.",1
Volunteer class at art an camp. Taught kids basic Spanish. I learned no Spanish! Waste of my parents tuition money! Worst of all! EVERYTIME I SPOKE SPANISH TO THIS LADY SHE RESPONDED IN ENGLISH! What a shame! If she is so apathetic that she can't even try to further the ability of her students then she is in the wrong profession!,0
"This is the worst professor I have ever had. There are minimal grades, and the tests are difficult. Her lectures are boring and make my favorite subject so difficult to love. DO NOT HAVE HER AS A PROFESSOR!! I have reached out to her with questions and extra help and she was nothing but rude and unhelpful.",0
good prof. he explains things well. hard class though.,1
"Rachick is a really good professor. While he has an attendance policy it isn't strictly enforced, however, with this class, the more you show up, the more you learn. He seems a little mean sometimes, but as the semester goes on you'll see that he's actually a really great professor and a great guy.",1
He is not a great lecturer but his tests are extremely easy. He uses a lot of questions from past tests that he posts.,1
"Amazing amount of insight.  Makes you want to learn the material outside of the class, which is something not many teachers can do.  Sometimes I wonder why he teaches at a tech school.",1
"Ryno is hilarious. He's really clear in his teaching because he covers one topic for a whole day, then reviews the same topic the next day before moving on. YOu can also ask him questions any time your confused and he's very helpful. he gives you study guides before each test. And you can write essays for extra credit. Highly recommended!",1
"Her readings are extremely boring!!!!! Bring your pillows; she will put you to sleep!!!!!! A Don Quixote groupie, her stupid brownie points are annoying, seriously how old are we? She’s a harsh grader! Avoid taking her!!!!",0
"Great Professor. Class is an easy pass if you have basic writing skills, graded on four papers and weekly discussion posts. Definitely take his suggestions on the essays, and after the first three meetings class is totally online so really as long as you do the weekly posts and write a 2 decent essays expect the easiest A in college ever.",1
"Had her for Options Class, Great Professor.  Funny and makes the material more interesting.  I wasn't that excited about taking the class, but I learned a l ot and she does a good job at teaching (the book is bad)",1
"Solid prof. If you did well in MAT223, MAT224 wouldn't be extremely hard as some people said. He explained everything well and the level of difficulty of the tests were reasonable based on your quiz and homework.",1
"Go to every class--he explains everything you need to know about the readings (so you don't really have to read if you can take good lecture notes). He reveals 2/3 of each exam in advance, so there aren't many surprises. His philosophical slant made class much more interesting. His late paper policy: 1 pt (out of 100) off for each CLASS DAY late",1
"Just an overall bad teacher. Not much more to it. By far one of the least relatable and most boring professors I have had. Very hard to reach outside of class. I actually did well in his class, but mostly taught myself. It is really sad, because OM is a very useful class and UA wastes it by letting Mittenthal teach it.",0
"i recommend taking a class with him at some point. Even though his class is easy he is a great professor. There are plenty of class discussions to keep you awake, and he actually challenges you. i never considered a class like before but i loved it.",1
"There is a TON of reading and just as much writing to go along with the reading. It's not a class to take when you have a heavy course load, but it was one of the best classes I took. I was very reluctant because of the preconceived notions I had about WMGS courses, but I am forever grateful I had Dr. Hersh as my instructor",1
"She's really funny and goes off lecture sometimes, but the class is really interesting. The exams can be a bit tricky and she gives good study guides. There is no extra credit. You do have to buy a reading packet that's about $35.",1
"Really hard class, tested on way too much material, but really good lecturer and wants students to do well, the material is just really dense and complex.",1
She is an easy grader. Amazing lectures.,1
"Schmidt is extremely intelligent, but it was difficult for me to learn from him because he seemed bored with what he was teaching.",0
"This guy is propably one of the worst professor in the histoty of teaching. He'd tell you all these nice things in the begining, and then he'd turn against you.",0
"Excellent teacher!  He takes care of his students and will take the time to explain it till you know the materials.  He's always there to help.  I just wish there were more professors like Dr. Lindsay.  The class is tough, but the teacher is there always to help.  Definitely recommend him to any students who looks forward to major in accounting.",1
He is extremely specific in the answers he is looking for. If you don't meet his specific requirements you will get half credit at most otherwise you will receive no credit for your answer.,0
"Wei is not a good ""professor"" and is too full of herself. She is spiteful towards her students and does not give a crap about them, uses them as a means to an end. Lectures are unclear, not very helpful outside of class, and is an unpleasant person. She also loves to complain about how UW students are lazy.",0
"He would rather insult your writing than offer constructive criticism, which takes all the joy right out of creative writing. He forces you to write inside the box unlike better writing classes. His syllabus is hypocritical.",0
"Lydia is great. Shes knowledgeable, energetic and comes across as a genuine caring person. She can be a tough grader but as long as you do the work its a great class.",1
Prof. Saler is the best lecturer I've had at UCD. He has genuine passion for intellectual history and does an amazing job conveying the information. His lectures are very old school but very effective. I could listen to him talk about Hegel for hours! Reading is heavy and the grader you get will determine the overall difficulty of the class.,1
"Dr. Tonn is a nice, funny man, but he is NOT a good teacher. He didn't explain topics well at all. The weekly tests took up time that he could have used for teaching. I wouldn't recommend taking a class with him unless you are a physics major.",0
Amazing instructor. Loved the course.,1
"Hard exams, which sucks because there are no assignments other than exams. His exams are over things he doesn't really cover at all on the slides and they are just things he randomly mentions. He does allow a handwritten note card for every exam but they are still difficult. I would avoid this class if possible.",0
"Katey Leverson is such a sweetheart and her lectures are always interesting. Her exams are all completely reflective of her lectures, so don't skip class! If you show up, listen, take good notes, and spend the necessary time on your homework, you will do great in this class.",1
"Teaches useful stuff but he's totally unfair. Students who hardly show up to class, fail his exams etc get the same grade as the ones who excelled during the semester. His grading makes no sense.",1
Finlayson is the only teacher at BYU I've ever officially complained about. She takes no personal responsibility for her actions. Finlayson will treat you like a child. I echo the comments of a previous reviewer : she is the product of the tenure system at its worst.,0
"The instructor is passionate regarding the subject,but a little overboard in expectations for a basic class. His attitude that knowing what may be on an exam might cause one to focus on those points, rather than focus on the entire presentation suggests that the exams are based upon what he considers important,rather than on what one has learned.",0
"Lectures deal only with proofs and are boring. Homework is extra credit. McNulty is great at explaining problems if you go to office hours. For exams, just memorize the example problems and go to the review session. Careless errors will kill you in this class. You receive many attempts to Master a problem so poor performance early on is okay.",1
Turning in essays she would mark out things I would say and add in something that is much longer and unnecessary. So when you take this class be prepared for your essay to be heavily nit picked. An essay that deserves at least an A is actually graded a B and even closer to a C. Keep in mind your finished grade is based solidly on these essays.,0
"She definitely knows her content and how to teach... she's just so dry. If the course notes weren't so terrible, no one would attend the lectures. Preparing for assignments and exams was a nightmare because she asks questions on such assessments that appear only once in the lecture.",0
"The other comments are very true! She is horribly rude. Do not take her classes. The class itself isn't hard if you go to it and take notes, but she makes it impossible to WANT to go to class. She yells at you if you don't participate, and then when you try to, she yells at you for something else. She even yelled at someone for reading too fast!!",0
"Maybe Colin is good when he's teaching in his subject, but as a Great Con prof he was unsatisfactory. Try to avoid taking Con from him. A lot of students like him because he's ""cool"", but he also comes off as kind of self-centered and pretentious. His teaching style is sloppy and he isn't helpful one-on-one, either.",0
"In terms of teaching fundamentals and teaching the basics, Altenhof is great. Puts emphasis on KNOWING the material and not just knowing how to do it. The tutorials are a bit unfair as multiple long questions are assigned but in the last 15 minutes, he tells you what one is being graded. Exams are challenging and graded very rigorously.",1
"Best history professor! She facilitates a fantastic discussion that always makes students think deeper. I was alway excited for class! That being said, there is a lot of reading. You will need all of the books! Grading is: 3 papers (2 for midterm, 1 for final) and participation (each 33%). Hope to take her class again! Awesome course & professor!",1
"This class only have 3 group discussions and 1 written exam. No homework, project and paper! The written exam is hard and is a big factor to decide your final grade. My written test result was bad so I got a B- in this class. If you don't mind get a B-, it is a good class for fulfilling the elective class requirement.",0
Super interesting lecturer,1
"If you're taking this class for a theme... DON'T! I found this class excruciatingly boring. I hated going. She's a nice enough lady... but rambles on and on, doesn't encourage class discussion, and doesn't make any topic interesting (even though a lot had the potential). I would not ever take her again, or recommend her.",0
"do not take him-does read out of the book, is clear in teaching, but totally unfair-takes a lot of points, and not reasonable. the humor works while in class, at the end when u get ur grade-hes not fair!",0
"super easy, if you show up to lecture and write notes you'll get an easy A he only gives out 2 exams and 2 papers they're easy as long as you read the material.",1
Does not have point system for grading. If he feels your paper is a B he will simply give you a B with no reference to a point ruberic,0
"Nice accent, good lectures. Try harder next time",0
"Mrs. Aida-Brown is a good professor. I had her online Nutrition class and it was decently easy. You will have to purchase Mindtap from Cengage in order to partake in the class ($100). All of the assignments are very easy and she gives you ample amount of time to work on them. If you do everything you're supposed to, you'll get an A. Guaranteed.",1
"Hybrid class: Do online work & go to class, even if you feel you dont need to, GO TO CLAS -lectures are tough to understand -examples dont make since! -I would def. take into consideration before taking him if math is your weak spot. Hard to tell if he actually cares to see his students succeed! -Utilize tutors & study groups for sure!!",0
"Online class is dreadful. She has no concept of design and should not be labeled as such. Does not give you the freedom to make an up to date website. Instead, she insists that your site be straight from the 90's. Class is unorganized. Rude when helping. Thinks you should already know. First web class was ok. This one is not.",0
The nicest and best professor at Bentley.  So fun and you learn so much. You have to take him!,1
Terrible prof.  Makes absolutely zero sense and has horrid lecture notes.  You will have a better time using another profs notes and the textbook.,0
"Kam Chu was a very respectful prof that showed a clear passion for Economics. Sadly his downfall comes to whether you can understand what he is saying. I mean this in the nicest way possible but I genuinely could not understand what the guy was saying half the time. His accent was VERY thick. Due to this, his lectures became useless to me.",0
Definitely the best math professor out there. He made everything look so easy and he knows where every student is struggling and hell reach out in class to help you understand. Be ready for a lot of fun exercises in class,1
Dr. Cain is a sweet guy but his class is pretty tough. His lecture slides have very little notes and goes through the powerpoints very fast. You're whole grade is based on ONLY four exams so there is little wiggle space to raise your grade. Recommend reading the textbook for more clarification and know almost all of the figures presented in slides.,0
"She has a lot to tell you, but she won't really want you to ask her any questions... her marking was ridiculously vague and unhelpful.",0
"This is college, you must learn the material at home.Go to his office hours, he is very nice if you put in the effort.",1
"He is an easy grader and offers extra credit for participation. At times he is difficult to understand because of his accent, however, he goes by the book. So if you have the book and read it,  you can easily follow along. The tests are easy and straightforward. He is very helpful and truly wants everyone to pass.  I would definitely recommend him.",1
Her Grading System is too harsh and she definitely puts hard stuff on students.,0
"He was AWFUL! So incredibly boring. He thinks he is funny, but he's not at all. I was really excited about this class, but he's totally killed the joy for me and my class. He's a terrible professor. His lectures are god awful boring, and his discussion days are either him talking OR him asking us paradoxical questions that no one wants to answer.",0
"Gives actual constructive criticism, is very caring to all her students. She really wants all of her students to pass the class and finds ways to help them pass.",1
Alright professor but reads off the slides which makes the class seem a lot longer then it is. ,0
"Takes absolutely no partial credit on tests or projects (meaning that if you mess up one tiny thing on a test problem, you'll get the whole thing wrong!). Gives out quizzes randomly during lecture, so attendance is mandatory. If you get him, go to class because the high grades you get on tests will cancel out the bad test/project grades.",0
"Taking one of his classes will definitely improve your writing. His lectures are never dry but its unclear as to whether his theories on the lit are brilliant or bull... great if your prepared for a challenge, but otherwise I would take Kuzmanovich for American lit and take Nelson for a class in his field - short fiction",1
Dr. Trant's class was difficult but if you do the work you'll do fine! He calls on people in class to answer so be prepared. If you show up late he'll tell you something. Take notes and study them. Gives study guides for tests. Lectures are interesting but record them because he talks fast. Large portfolio due at end of year so be prepared.,1
"Simply put, David Bernstein is a paradox. One second he says he loves to fail his students, the next he appears very genuine and kind. His grave curves are beyond atrocious, 35% each for both midterm and finals, 10% for programming assignments, and 20% for your own project. But he does have some interesting stories to tell from time to time.",0
Prof seemed very rude and didn't care for his students especially mental health giving major assignments on breaks and making tests harder when averages were already low,0
I absolutely loved this professor! It is an easy A and he will have you laughing the entire class!,1
"Professor Wolverton's History 436: Top Charlemagne course was profoundly engaging, deep on content and heavy with lectures and participation. She's a tough one with grading and comments, but she is incredibly intelligent and well-versed in her field. Her course isn't for those seeking to skip by; attendance is a must, participate at any chance.",1
"Scott is my favorite professor I've ever had at OU. He is extremely knowledgable in his field, caring, understanding, and makes class interesting and different every day. In COM 2403 we had ONE written test - a Name quiz. It is very evident that he cares about his students, and as long as you show up and be yourself, you will pass. TAKE HIS CLASS!",1
This professor uses tricky wording on the tests which can be frustrating but this shows if you truly know the material or not. I would recommend recording lectures because she speaks quickly. Play the lectures over and over again. I enjoy the stories she tells during class.,1
He is by far the worst professor I have had here. He just lectures the entire class and does not care about whether or not you actually retain any of the information. his study guides are extremely large and broad and about 2/3 of the material on there is not even on his tests. avoid taking him if possible.,0
He was the only option for CMPSC 131 and the class was an easy A. Not much more to say.,1
"Professor Diven is one of the nicest professors I have ever come across. She is very knowledgeable in her field of International Relations, and she wants to have a relationship with her students. I highly recommend her for an international relations course.",1
"I mean, I needed this class to be a full time student and it was all the registrar would give me. It was okay, I learned tons of interesting facts, but every day was something new. Unclear connections from lecture to lecture almost like he would just wake up and decide what to talk about that day. This lecture style led to very random tests...",1
"His lectures aren't really helpful and almost everything he lectures on can be found in the book. There are 4 homework assignments. A  group lab and group project. All of which were fairly easy. The midterm and final were the hardest part of the class due to the fact that he is a very harsh grader. If you want to pass, do the HW and read the text.",0
If you want an easy teacher and an easy grade take her class. If you want to learn something-try someone elso.,0
His exams are really hard no matter how much you study you still fail. Dreaded going to his class. He is nice but hard.,0
well organized & helpful.,1
"This class was very easy, but lecture seemed to go on for ever. This teacher loves to talk about himself!",1
"I learned more from my classmates and my TA than Feldman. Very sporadic with his work, did problems wrong on the white board and had to erase it all and start over. I had a 100 on homework assignment, an 82% for quizzes, and didnt do well on the tests. Very test heavy. Didnt respond to emails within a day, sometimes never responded at all.",0
"This class, related to biology, is going to be really hard no matter who you take it with. Textbook and consistent reading is a must. Pay attention during the lecture. Three exams, multiple choice. You have to really study and understand concepts in order to pass. I'm a straight A student but even doing my best will at most get me a B or C here. ",1
Excellent professor and I learned a lot. Her class helped me explore my passion for journalism!,1
Incredibly easy class.  He is more then willing to help you and does whatever he can to prevent you from failing.  Great teacher and a fun guy to listen to.,1
Makes even numbers fun,1
"Very good lecturer, but very disrespectful and inconsiderate of students learning needs, time, and investment.",0
"I am actually in Law school now and I'm taking Con law.  He actually did a great job of explaining the black letter law without going into the analytical depth required now.  If you're planning on going to law school take his class, do the work and take good notes you'll learn a lot.",1
"Harry seemed like a very sad, old man.  :(   His depressed nature took all the life out of me and made me feel like skipping his class every week.  But, I went and instead found myself coaxed to sleep by his grandfatherish tone.  DO NOT take this class with him!  The subject is easy, but he makes it very difficult.  Your GPA may not survive Harry.",0
"Well I really didn't learn a whole lot from this class. All we did was show up to class and keep staring at our cell phones to see when we could leave. His lectures are long and boring, and in the end on the tests you're going what the... when did we go over that. Anyway there is only three grades so you've got to do reasonably well to pass.",0
"Dodge this teacher at all cost, he won't give you any information regarding the course unless you attend every lectures. Every lecture is so unorganized and you learn much more by yourself, but you have to attend lectures to get the exam dates, exam corrections etc... Dodge this teacher",0
"Amazing professor all around. I can't wait to take another class with her before I graduate. Her readings are challenging, but she breaks them down very easily without outright giving you the answer so her discussions were very gratifying. Fair grader with very insightful comments to give. She is a theory buff and is very knowledgeable.",1
"I'm going to be honest here. She seems like she is a nice person, but she is not a good prof. More than half the class dropped out after the horrid exam which majority failed. Her tests are hard and the final is worth 60%. I regret not taking this class in Chang.  Also, she is a picky and hard marker.",0
If you're looking for math comprehension class then he's definitely the professor for you. Makes it way harder than it actually is but thats only because he loves math but please not on my time you can do that.,0
"He expects you to know everything he is going to teach that day before you get into the class. If you miss classes, it's not a big deal but there isn't much you can do to catch up. Take good notes and watch the UD captures later that day. ",0
"Absolutely horrible teacher, worst I have ever had in my life I dreaded going to her class every day. She grades the first two pages of an essay and then doesn't read the rest if she doesn't like what she has read. Also on the day any major essay is due no matter the excuse she will mark you down 10 percent on the essay if you are a minute late.",0
"Absolutely useless online course.  Most of the online resource links don't work, the assignments are posted late but still expected to be on time, and there is no organization.  We went from saying ""Hello, my name is..."" in Week 3 to being expected to introduce ourselves and someone else in a paragraph of French with no lead-in.  Just terrible.",0
"Best teacher I've had at the JC. Super funny, and very helpful. I genuinely enjoyed taking his class.  ",1
"Despite a potentially easier online class, Gateman was not engaged with students at all. His responses to emails were dry and never actually answered questions. An actual response was ""Great question ask your TA"". He also did not make it clear what we were going to be tested on and hid our midterm questions so that we could only see grades.",0
"Very scatterminded - assigns lots of papers and tests for almost every class but doesn't really go over them; class itself is easy and not much work, papers and exams are short but frequent. Easier to handle if you've had her before and know what to expect from her",0
"He goes of on tangents A TON. But he's hilarious. GO TO HIS OFFICE and you'll be okay, but do not plan to get great grades on your papers, even if you revise them a million times. But he gives better grades to people who go to his office and talk to him. Check out Overheard at Hillsdale if you want the humor without having to take him.",1
"She is a great teacher like any teacher she has her style. Although she does have an accent you can still understand her clearly. She tells us how much she loves her students as well as her job. Therefore, she makes plenty of time to see her in office hours if you cannot make the office hours she tries to accommodate her students.",1
"Inconsistent grading, poor communication with students, no examples of expected work, too many projects not enough time",0
Sometimes the accent gets in the way and during lectures he focuses alot on proofs rather than how to do the problems step by step. Expects you to read his mind and know things off the bat. Would not recommend for lyman math course,0
Honestly one of the worst professors I've ever had at UNCC. Grades consist of 4 tests so if you bomb one you'll never recover. Says the homework will help boost your grade at the end of the semester but never changes your grade. Gives terrible feedback on tests and grades extremely inconsistent. Avoid at all costs!,0
"I didn't enjoy this class. It might be because it was completely asynchronous this year, meaning there were no zooms, just videos of her reading powerpoint slides uploaded to Canvas twice a week and assigned readings and homework. I found the lecture videos boring and unnecessarily long. Maybe she's great in person but online this class wasn't good",0
Great Prof. Gives good stories that are applicable to marketing concepts. Make sure you remember and study the stories/examples he gives because they will be tested on midterms. Textbook is unnecessary. Took the course in the summer and we only had two midterms and no final.,1
"He never grades your test on his own, he always let his assistant grade everything. He always assumes that the student knows everything so he skips a lot of steps and said: "" you should know about this"". He knows a lot of math but he always looks down at the student he always said:"" u should change ur major if u don't know this"".",0
"Très bon prof avec d'excellente capacité d'enseigner un cours. OR, je vous le dit d'avance que prof Labelle à des POP QUIZ (6.25% chacun - 4 d'entre eux). Ces quiz sont facile à avoir un A+ MAIS il faut non seulement lire les 12 lectures (30 pages chacunes) mais se préparer comme un examen. Les quiz sont alléatoire (pop quiz surprise). bonne chance",1
Pretty easy class. The online homework really helped me a lot with the material on the exams. The lectures are pretty dry but she does a good job in explaining things where everyone can understand. Just do the homework and youll be fine.,1
"I took this class as an elective, but it has probably been my favorite class that I have taken at ECU. The things that Dr. Knox teaches are important life lessons so you actually want to pay attention. He gives out study questions before each exam, complete those and you'll ace the exams!",1
shes amazing! definitely have to study for this class but everything is given to you and she communicates very well via email. the class is easy if you study and get used to the format of the course itself. super organized and tests were easy if you used all the study material given. everything is weighed in all fairness as well. love the course!,1
"Passionate teacher with amazing lectures. Take lots of detail oriented notes and you'll pass easily. Use Quizlet (Art 258 pieces on there) to study and have it open for exams for easy A/Bs. Bought the textbook and only looked at it once, so its not necessary. Lectures are recorded so you can rewatch and take notes at your own pace. No homework.",1
Do not take this professor. If you have her get out while you still can. Tons of homework that does not increase your knowledge on the subject. In this class you pay to teach yourself.,0
Dr. Shapiro-Shapin is incredible. She is such a genuine person and is so passionate about what she teaches. She makes sure she does everything possible to help you succeed. Exams are open-note. She accepts drafts of EVERYTHING. Absolutely take this class with CSS!,1
She start confusing me after a few classes.,0
Do not take his class. He should have retired 15 years ago and is still teaching. He is an old man who makes the class boring and impossible to succeed in. Also he should be fired.,0
"I have tried to enjoy having her as a prof and follow all direction she gives (readings, articles, homework practice) and even though I do all those things, the answers to her questions can't be found in course resources. If you ask her for clarification to a question that can't be found anywhere, she acts like you're wasting her time.",0
"good guy, boring class",0
"She sucks!!! She gives assignments that are unclear and your grades will reflect this. She is innaccurate. Hope you like math, because you won't be doing much of anything else. It would have been nice to actually do some things besides math, like maybe learning the terms and testing procedures.",0
"She gives assignments that feel unplanned. Its an easy A if you show up to class and put in minimum effort. Other than that, its pretty boring and a lot of the information was somewhat general knowledge.",0
"Constantly berating students for bad handwriting, meanwhile he has a sloppy, hybrid cursive and nonstandard abbreviations that students were constantly needing clarified. You do not have the option to type anything up, and he takes points off of anything he thinks is misspelled / can't decipher. No study guide for tests, you should just KNOW.",0
"Legit goes over a slide for 15 minutes and talks about irrelevant things that can get pretty boring. Assignments are bland and no resources are available to help. Don't even get me started on the test, jesus.....",0
I took Bemisdarfer's online CRE101 class and really enjoyed it. His writing prompts are interesting and honestly fun. He is organized with his assignments and spaced everything very well so it was not stressful at all. He also sent frequent messages checking up on us and reminding us of upcoming assignments. Amazing professor!!,1
Believe he taught me PreCalc around 1991.  Was the only real professor I had at IVCC that has really left something.  IVCC from 91-93--was the worst university I've EVER been at.,1
"Dr. Oberlin is a great professor. This is an easy 4.0 if you do the work, which is not hard. You will get out of it what you put into it. Dr. Oberlin is very helpful and super interesting and open minded.",1
BIG BOB THE MAN!!!!! He is by far the strangest/most hilarious person I have ever met in my whole life. I laugh 24/7 in his class because he says stuff that never makes sense and it is so funny. He curves the test A LOT. Every time you go to class he gives you 2 points. Take this class if you want a good laugh. For the project- pick brownie mix!!!!,1
"Worst professor I have ever had. She is rude to the students. She will ask your opinion then cut you off saying you are wrong. Be prepared to be criticized in this class for every question, phrase, or opinion. She only wants to hear what she wants and when. If you state a fact from the TEXTBOOK she will tell you, youre wrong. Awful, don't do it!!",0
"Mohsen is not a good professor, but he thinks he is. I would compare his lectures to Ted talks where you're interested for a few minutes and walk out remembering nothing. Respectable man and a good speaker, but terrible at teaching. Labs are hard and homework must be right on the first try, but he makes the tests easy if he sees us all struggling.",0
"He is one of my worst teachers as a freshman at UD. During his recorded lessons, he repeats himself and rambles on without ever defining any terms or giving concrete information. He uses things like ""who get what, when, where.."" etc to describe terms you never heard of before. One of the most boring teachers ever. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASSES.",0
"Graham is awful. His quizzes are unscheduled and so much of the quiz material isnt taught before the quiz is given. The tests are worth way more than they should be. You can fall as many quizzes as you want and be fine, but if you do bad on one test you may as well kiss your grade goodbye unless you do amazing on everything else.",0
Scott is an amazing professor! If you have questions for him make sure you ask! not everything that is due is mentioned in the class so make sure you write down due dates from the syllabus!,1
was my advisor and i even had to switch majors to get away from her.,0
"Prof's expectations are clear, gives lots of constructive criticism. Not an easy marker, but fair. Attendance is mandatory in order to be prepared for the final.",1
Prof. Jones is passionate about government--that's for sure. You'll enjoy his class if you're actually interested in government or political science. Prepare to take notes in class. He speaks slow and concise-- making it easy to write down. He hands out study guides usually a week before the exam.,1
"Deb is my favorite teacher I've had at Duke so far. Her French is fluent and crystal clear. She is very nice and she puts all her effort into making class a fascinating an educational time. As long as you participate and do all the readings, her class is fairly straightforward. After this semester, my French is a lot better.",1
"I took his class online during the fall and it was very easy. Lots of Reading and after each chapter have to write about it (300-500 words) 2 test (EASY)(midterm 25 questions-final 35 questions) you can get the answers from the internet, 1 major paper and that's it. EASY A.",1
"Kosnik is extremely enthusiastic, loves what he does, and enjoys jamming on the piano. Pretty easy A as long as you go to class, pay attention, and do the reading. You have to go go a few concerts and write reviews on them, but it's very easy and there's a chance for extra credit.",1
"Loved Dr. Storslee, he was always considerate. I took the teacher several times for a lot of my courses. He had taught at ASU so he naturally does things fast-paced, but is willing to slow down. Is willing to give you opportunities to complete work that was missed or to come in for office hours for extra help. Also gives extra time after class.",1
"he's very nice and his classes are never demanding, but they're not rewarding either.  sometimes he blatantly makes things up, which is unintentionally funny.",0
"This class really was not for me, and I found it hard to stay awake at times, but that being said, Father Dan is a wonderful person and he truly wants every student to succeed",1
"Professor Wood encourages students to participate with respect to each other. During the semester we did a group, individual, and a short special occasion speech. In all of them she helps us with the process and the writing ideas to make a confident speech. Make sure you talk to the professor whenever you have issues, she is extremely helpful.",1
"Quickly, I haven't much time. His first name is J-",1
"this guy is the best proffessor out there, you'll be lucky to have him, and you wont regret taking the class.  It's hard material, but he explains it so smoothly ans articulates the points that need to be aknowledged.  i don't know of anyone who has taken a course for prof garrity and not fallen in love with him.  I know i have, he is amazing!!!!!!",1
Genuinely terrible class and professor. Basile assigns an *INSANE* amount of homework. Minimum 50 problems PER. CHAPTER. It's as if he thinks Audit is the only thing we have time for. He doesn't teach us anything. You have to complete and present audit cases on top of the homework assignments. One of the worst professors and classes I've had.,0
"He is very passionate about his classes and it shows in his lectures. He has very high standards, but he is fair with his marks. He also has map quizzes, which are pretty much free marks. He gives you the list of all the places he expects you to learn and we have 4 chances to take the quiz. One of the best profs ever.",1
"Pretty middle of the road, all around.  His lectures conformed a bit too closely to the text.",1
Very cool teacher! Grade based mostly on class participation and a few papers. Lenient on participation and keeps class interesting.,1
"Overall, super easy class! Make sure you attend every class, she may give random assignments. She is friendly and easygoing. Returns papers back with great feedback. ",1
"His marking is terrible. It is entirely opinion based, and he gives no criticism of value. He does not deserve to teach at any institution. His lectures are filled with watching YouTube videos that are not relevant to anything.",0
"Very weird man, and he is a huge creeper (loves flirting with girls!) He may be smart, but he is unable to teach. He needs some serious help. With him teaching, it shows how concerned UW is with their teachers --- they dont care!",0
Worst professor ever. Checks everything for plagiarism and will tell the dean about you. When you dont understand something he will make sure you know your a failure for it.,0
really interesting. course was sometimes unclear.,1
"Awesome professor who wants students to succeed she is super nice. As long as you do Homework and Quizzes you should pass the class. The only exams are midterm and final, as long as you study you should be able to pass with an A. I studying at least a week in advance.",1
"Prof Moresoli is amazing. She did it all for me this semester. Her aid in tutorials was invaluable, and she was always pleasant and approachable. Still understandable even with stong accent. If your lucky enough to get Moresoli, congratulations.",1
"A brilliant man, an excellent teacher and an enjoyable lecturer.   Not a good choice if you hope to coast along without doing the reading or participating in class discussions.",1
"Text required but I didn't use it. Will be uncomfortably rude if you speak to him before class starts or you're late, will single you out in front of everyone. Repeats himself a LOT. Unclear grading guidelines, but willing to critique drafts. Nothing is online, you get tons of handouts per day. Passionate for the subject.",1
He's SO smart! But he really CANNOT teach! Ok? Ok? What the hell is a phoneme??,0
"Kathleen is a gem. So kind and truly care about her students. The class is very simple and you actually USE THE THINGS YOU LEARN!! My resume and cover letter greatly improved and I have used the cover letter i wrote for class multiple times, just changing it a bit for each job. If you are struggling just show her you care and she will be help you!",1
"she is much harder than the other teachers by far. Friends took other teachers and theirs was a joke by comparison. the only advantage you get by taking her is that she makes the final so everyone else fails and you do ok. If you can, take someone else. If you dont, get ready for worst experience of your life, you do learn a lot though.",1
If you just want a grade yes but if you want to learn anything he is not the teacher to take.  He make you feel stupid if you have a question.  He is very unclear.  His project are very unclear.  For any questions ask your teammates not him.,0
"By far my favorite professor at Stony Brook. His classes are well structured and very productive. He gives review sheets before each test that outline everything that will be on it, so there are no surprises. There is a strict attendance policy - because of how quickly we go through material - but hes lenient if you have a real reason to miss.",1
"If you put 20 minutes in a week to watch the lecture, you will get a high B. I didnt go to class because she only talked about her personal life and not about biology. She is nice, but in lecture she is like one of those nice grandmas who ramble on. Very off topic. Terrible actually. Wish she didnt talk about coffee for 45 minutes, would had A.",0
He gives us a ton of homework thats way harder than what he taught us. Most of the time he doesnt go through a problem completely he just goes through the method in the beginning but then expects you to know exactly what to do after. Hes also a bit passive aggressive when someone tries to be smart or asks a question.,0
"This class  could be a huge nap-time due to the basic ideas covered but Jeff fills the entire period with interesting stories, examples, and explanations. He gets off topic pretty quickly but ends up repeating things enough that they stick pretty well. Very nice guy, willing to do whatever it takes to help you learn.",1
Dr. Cowdin is one of my favorite professors on this campus. I went into Quest for the Ultimate believing it would be my least favorite class but I ended up really liking it. He has an assignment every night but they are super easy and manageable. He genuinely wants to help students + it is very apparent that he does care about his students as well,1
"Great professor, probably the smartest I have ever had. Always keeps the class entertained with fun random facts and cool t-shirts. Only down side is that your entire grade is made up from 4 lecture exams and 4 lab exams, all of which are very difficult no matter how much you study",1
I loved her class. Go to her lecture and right everything she says. If she repeats something then it will be on the test. You will never have to look at your book. If I had know that ahead of time I won't have bought the book. Also I thought she was very funny.,1
"She gave great examples toward real world expierences. Her slide shows may be boring but she gives you the information needed to know for all test. she prepares you for test questions with her teaching. she makes sure you understand the topics and the material. Plus there is ZERO homework. All you need to do is take notes and study, no busy work.",1
She knows the material well and is very adaptable in teaching it. I've never been so surprised as when I was having fun in the group activities she frequently had the class do. She's very easy-going and super helpful in all matters! I cannot recommend her enough!,1
"Un professeur compétent , passionné par ce quil fait et surtout rend la matière facile a assimiler , je recommande fortement ce professeur , Mr alain est quelquun qui est toujours a lécoute ayant toujours la volonté daméliorer sa manière de donner les cours selon les recommandations des étudiants . ��������",1
This class is a hybrid so pretty much everything is done online. She doesn't teach well and isn't helpful and office hours are pointless. Lecture is used to go over the ch that was assigned online the week before and to take a test. She doesn't answer questions even if its about a test. The class average is an F. I don't recommend this class.,0
She is an awesome professor who is always willing to help and who makes the class interesting.  She cares about her students and to such an extent that she reminds me of Ms. Honey from the book Matilda.,1
"It seems like she has really good intentions, but she does not convey the information in a way that is beneficial to her students. This course is crucial to the psych major, so Dr. Gaultney did not give me a good foundation in order to move on to 2103. Find another professor! If this professor is your last option, I wish you good luck.",0
Gives you many videos and lecture that do not help. She is okay with responding to emails. But does go the extra mile so pros and cons. The textbook is useless with the work given and would not take again.,0
"Professor Anderson is probably a wonderful woman. However, she grades projects entirely too harshly, especially for an entry level class. She is also very passive agressive in her emails and feedback on assignments. Save yourself the stress and try your best to get another professor.",0
worst professor at SJU. He doesnt listen to students and lies. Drop out of his class. I don't understand why hes still not fired.,0
"She's not very helpful and her lectures are HORRIBLE! I'm not sure how she completed her PhD program considering there's a ""teaching"" portion of the program. She simply doesn't know how to teach! What a shame!",0
"Great teacher, and really knows his stuff.  But can at times be a little hard to understand (his accent)",1
Great teacher!! Definitely recommend!! Easy course and great for your general Ed requirement,1
"strict, smart, a bit monotonous but definitely not a bad course or prof",1
Lori is a disorganized mess. She has excuses for everything and is never prepared for class. Her instructions for assignments are vague and confusing. She has somewhat high expectations for someone who can't get it together.,0
"This is by far one of the best professor I ever had.  Even though he is disorganized in how he assembles all of the materials necessary for the class, this is a minor detail in his teaching.  He is very engaging, and brilliant but not condescending.  I think of his class often and the impact that it had on me.  Highly recommend him!",1
"He is an amazing teacher and I would 100% take him again. I do not like history. Third time taking a history class because I failed my other 2. I got an A in this class. He tells you what he wants done, He replies fast, gives you information on everything. and hes very interactive. Really nice and funny 12/10",1
"She's a so-so teacher, but she's pretty mean. She gives you one chance to learn something; if she has said it or even hinted at it once, she expects you to remember that forever. Tough tough class!",0
Very rude. Transferred out of her class after 1 session,0
nicely organized lectures,1
Teaches nothing. He just gives chapter readings for hw and then asks the class what they thought of it instead of a lesson. He thinks way to highly of himself and is condescending when you ask for help. The textbook dictates his class and he is to lazy to do anything that isn't right out of it. An online class would be better than taking his class.,0
Terrible professor. Doesn't understand the projects he assigns and then deducts points for things his pin head doesnt hear during your presentation. unaccountable and has a very surface level knowledge of all subjects. Attending his office hours is like trying to ask questions to a monkey.,0
"Class notes are scattered like the lectures.  He can't stay on point and jumps info all over the place.  Took his class for part of my nursing, no nursing info was taught.  I don't know anything more than when I started except about fermentation which he must like.",0
Dr. Platau's class was difficult but was extremely rewarding. He is easy to pay attention to in lectures and is always extremely prepared. The workload was the most of any class I've ever taken but if you prepare yourself to spend a lot of time on his work you should not have a problem. His assignments will take time but are not impossible.,1
"Had Ams for Ochem 1 & 2. Ochem 1 wasn't bad but not as good as it could've been. Ochem  2 was a disaster b/c he stopped caring about the students and teaching after he received his tenure. There was not additional help outside of the lecture that left you confused and unprepared for test. If you want to get a good grade/learn ochem, don't take Ams",0
"Honestly, not as terrible as everyone says. She is an awful lecturer and makes the material dry, but if you show up to every lecture, take pictures of the images that she omits in her lecture notes, and have good memorization skills then you're fine. Easy A for science (biology) majors. The tests are a lot of writing, so you can BS a lot of it.",0
"This guy is impossible to please. He seems happier when you do poorly. Be careful! He won't explain what he wants so be sure to ask as many questions as possible, he will take off points for Every Little Thing. Make sure to fight for your grades if you think he's slighting you. You might get some points back if you can argue them. Avoid.",0
"Difficult to please. Makes his students work hard. However those who pass his tests, will appreciate his style of teaching after finishing the class. For those who are new to his class - do your best, and you'll have no problems writing ANY essay or paper in the future. If something is not clear ask lots of questions!!",1
TAKE HIM!! Enough said.,1
good class,1
His lectures are straight out of the textbook so it doesn't give you much perspective on the subject. I don't even know if he understood his own material well enough to explain it in his own words. You can give easy examples to match the scenario but those examples will NOT BE ON THE TEST. You will get the toughest ones.,0
I absolutely loved Sara. I was so lucky to take her during my first semester just before she left for sabbatical. Super kind to her students and was always super interested in what students had to say about the scripts at hand. A queen.,1
Take this class if you want to sleep,0
"I saw how crappy her reviews were after starting her class, but after taking her for almost 4 weeks now, she's not as bad as everyone says. She's boring, and grades toughly, but she's definitely not the worst. She won't be your most fun class, but she's not the worst option",0
"I took Mark for Philosophy of Religion and it was the easiest class Ive ever taken. Aside from a few papers, its an effortless class. He seems to not really know what hes talking about, and everyone in class just uses their phones or laptops. Easy class overall.",0
"very easy class but very boring. if u can stay awake through the movies and lectures, its an easy A. no books to buy which is great.",1
"I was a freshman when he first arrived there as well back in 1985.  Three of us got A's and the rest got D's in his inaugural LS1 class; ""Whoa!  Looks like the friendly hippie is serious!""  Found it bemusing that an 18k-per-year (back then) school offered a class taught by him called ""Psychoactive Drugs.""  He was a pretty decent guitar player too.",1
Very poor teacher.Does not stay on topic. If you take hime do all of the extra credit and free quizes though that still will not help you all that much. Dont bother buying the book he never uses it.,0
"Worst professor for 191. Stevens really knows and cares about what he teaches but he makes everything so impossible for the students. I was excited for 191 but now my grade sucks because he just doesn't care about his students passing. He only uses excel for notes, nothing else which no one in my class learns from. Just plain and simple avoid him.",0
Extremely boring. Doesnt explain things well and his gap notes are no help at all. Hes a nice guy but basically useless as a prof. Also writes with his left hand which makes it difficult to copy notes. Avoid this prof if you can.,0
Professor Freeman is the best! I loved his chem class! If you need to take chemistry I 1000% recommend!,1
"I ENROLLED IN THIS CLASS 6/29/2011 FOR SUMMER B SESSION. I READ REVIEWS WRITTEN BUT DECIDED TO TAKE A CHANCE. BOY I WISH I HAD LISTENED I STAYED IN CLASS FOR TEN MINUTES AND HURRIED TO DROP. PROFESSOR WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE, FAST SPEED AYOU COULD NOT UNDERSTAND ONE WORD SHE WAS SAYING... HOW DO EDISON EXPECT YOU TO LEARN LIKE THIS!! DONT TAKE HER!",0
I'll make this short and concise. Hard class. Explaining was bad. He talked about The Weeknd and Bieber. Test were really hard. Things on the test were things we didnt go over. Bad teaching. And he is the only one that teaches 301 & 302. Not good.,0
"I never went to a single lecture but his notes explain the programming concepts really well and in a concise manner, only had to refer to the official documentation a handful of times. Too bad he wouldn't let us use more advanced programming concepts not taught to us on the final but it was still easy. Otherwise he's a pretty good professor.",1
"Most content is in the lectures, but you'll want to read the book if you want a high A (last few weeks require the book). Not a difficult class by any means, so it's a good one to take over the summer. The labs were my favorite part of this class because he walked us through each step while encouraging the class to be creative and fun with it.",1
"If you legitimately care about advancing your writing, do not take this woman. She left no feedback on countless discussions and even exams. Her grades are based on whether she likes you or not, plain and simple, not on your writing ability. Dr. Logan really made me question what exactly I was paying for, which is never a good feeling.",0
"He's not a bad professor but I find his test difficult. I feel as if he should give worksheets for us to study and at least give a study guide for the final exam, not just review in class with us. This class will be difficult for students who isn't majoring in the scientific field or care too much for science.",0
Put in the work and you will pass.,1
Tests extremely ambiguous and could not care less for the welfare of students,0
Tests are identical to examples done in class. Lectures can be boring but overall an easy A,1
"Bill is awesome. The class was easy, but in no way boring. He challenges you to think more deeply about things and the topics discussed in class are always very interesting. I also like how much slack he gives on choosing essay topics. He's not always the most clear about directions, but he's really relaxed so in the end it doesn't really matter.",1
"Okay. Wendy is straight up the meanest , most frustrating teacher to deal with. She refused to answer any more questions because she said we should know how to do that by now. She doesn't know what she's talking about. She's boring, monotone, hard marker...
 
 SHE IS HELL....AVOID HER",0
Worst class i have ever taken,0
"Good prof, assignments were somewhat challenging, but exams were relatively fair and easy. Knows what she is teaching, friendly, helpful in office hours, very organized notes. But if you already have some grasp of the material, her teaching can be rather boring. Good prof.",1
Kemps teaching does not translate well in class or in zoom. The majority of the class is spent with him reading the novels to the students as if they were children. Kemp is a lazy professor who does not use PowerPoint in class. His feedback on assignments is more condescending than helpful. This was the worst USC English class that I have taken.,0
Hands down the best teacher at IU.,1
Really funny guy but writes a lot so bring extra sheets of paper!,1
do not take this course with Luis. I have had the worst experience in his class. he makes uncountable mistakes in lectures and is usually 5 minutes late to class and then he wouldn't complete examples saying he would fill them in later. this class has hard material itself but Luis made it even harder.,0
"Great! Super sweet and interesting. Gives great real life examples. He has A LOT of notes but if you do the readings you can see where he gets his info which can make the crazy note taking much easier! One of the nicest and sweetest and informed profs, its note and reading heavy class but you learn so much more about the world than normal!",1
"He's a great man. I'm remember him from 20 years ago, and he's the only guy prof from Waterloo I'd give the time of day too.  Thanks for being a great guy, inspiration, and doing justice to a great science.",1
Frankie was the best.  Learned more from her than from any other in the texas state math department.  She goes above and beyond to give everyone under her tutelage succeeds.  She gets an A from me,1
"My favourite professor at HSC. Came in to his classes thinking it was going to be impossible; however, you will do well in any of his courses with a little hard work and by showing some interest.",1
"Dr. Anderson is a very good guy, & it's obvious he cares for the students, but class material is ridiculously difficult.  I personally felt like there was too much information for one semester.  I feel like his BIOL 3250 class should be expanded into 2 semesters because of all of the course material.  There is also a huge and hard paper at the end.",1
"Matthew truly cares about the success of his students, as well as the topics he discusses in class. This class was eye opening and I learned a lot about topics I didn't know much about. Matthew created a class community where we felt like we could discuss issues as a class. 10/10 would recommend him.",1
Dr. Moreland is a literal treasure. That a professor of this caliber chooses to teach at a small community college absolutely incredible and I'm honestly grateful to have been lucky enough to take her classes. She's a dedicated educator who is truly inspired on a fundamental human level by her field of study. Take all of her classes that you can.,1
Don't know where to begin. Lost all interest in foreign language after this course. Paola Conte has ruined it for me. Overall lack of organization of the class and lack of respect for the students. If I could give a zero rating...,0
"Show up and do your homework and you'll pass. Daily in class assignments are part of the grade. In class assig. & reviews applied to tests/quizzes. He puts in the extra time to answer all questions and give 1 on 1 time as needed. Showed work for in class practice problems, give clear step by step instructions, and set us up to be successful.",1
"The class lectures constantly deviated from being relevant. He never outlines which texts to read for each class clearly, which would be fine but he didn't ever stay on topic. Watch out, the TA's were hopelessly uneven in grading. Anver is a great guy, not sure how much he thought through this class though. He's a nice guy, his class needs work",0
"This professor has been one of my favorites here at Creighton. She teaches well and will do anything to help her students. Also, she is hilarious! Fun fact: she is from Puerto Rico. She is also great to talk with outside of class. If you get the chance, TAKE HER.",1
Easy teacher. Someimes class was boring but he does well.,1
"Repeat what he says without thinking about it, and try not to fall asleep at your desk. The smile was quite creepy.",0
"Mike is an amazing professor and really cares for his students. he gives detailed lecture outlines that are a key to passing the class. There is no homework, but be prepared to be studying every night. He knows the material very well and teaches it in a way that is easy to grasp. Take him if you want to actually learn anatomy and physiology",1
"Professor Wiles is a nice lady but kind of a frustrating professor. She gives a lot of reading and has a pop quiz almost every class period. She goes on tangents sometimes and will make a huge show if she can't hear what you're saying by saying ""So and so can't hear you""-so kind of annoying in that sense. Isn't especially clear at explaining thing",0
"There is so much reading. The worst part is for the test, she gave us 54 terms for us to define and only 10/12 will be on the actual test and out of those 10/12, we only have to do 5/6. Lectures are alright but they do not redeem for how much reading there is or how she handles the test study guide.",0
"I love the hoodie-clad, carefree John McCullough, but I will warn you that his lectures are a bit dry.",1
"I took an online class for project management with this ""professor"". He first of all can't teach or there was no attempt at teaching. His posts on Ulearn were extremely wordy and confusing, his idea of grading was ridiculous, and his feedback (if any) wasn't helpful. Don't try talking to him in person either because he's rude and insulting.",0
OMG I didn't learn one thing from him. He talks and talks and talks and nothing important was ever said. To top it off he grades the essays without knowing english and his TA cant even speak english. You can go to the writing center and have them write the essay and you still wont pass the essay.,0
"Worst teacher i have ever had. Not a fun environment to learn in. Very rude teacher. He is unorganized, inconsistent with grading, and does not help students. DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH LOOMIS",0
Terrible. Avoid at all costs. He's useless.,0
Her class is an easy A if you just do the work she assigns. She assigns a chapter of reading from books every week and a few questions to answer about the content. It's super easy. All her exams are open book and she gives us the questions that may be on the exam before hand. Super easy class!! Also gives a lot of easy extra credit!,1
Never really learned anything in this class. Used Phys I knowledge and extra credit to get by. Aced the first test and bombed the second but still got a 92. Easy but you won't learn anything.,0
"Miss Moss has the potential to be a great teacher. Her overall personality is just really off putting. Her tests are poorly designed and labs are basically done on your own. If you have a hard time taking tests, you probably won't pass. It's safe to say that one needs to study at least three hours a day to pass this course. Hard C.",0
"Excellent, passionate, yes, scattered but fascinating. MUST attend class and do homework, the more the better. MUST follow procedure. Tough but great!",1
Bill is my favorite professor I have had since I started college. He is a really good teacher and very nice. This class consists of a lot of partcipation so be ready to talk in class. Besides that the class is the usual amount of work. I would take him again.,1
Interesting and sometimes-relevant stories kept class entertaining.,1
"She was not very clear.. She would start speaking and stop mid-sentence. She may be good at teaching other subjects but speech class is not for her. But one thing I like about her is that when you give your speeches, she doesn't critique you harshly like other professors do.",0
Dr. Pozzi knows what she's talking about and is passionate about what she teaches but she is not always the most clear. She is a very hard grader and wants the paper written her way. She gives good feed back and will help over email or in her office hours but I did not enjoy the class. The amount of reading expected was very heavy!!,0
"Dr. VanRandWyk is extremely knowledgeable about music theory, and an absolute pleasure to know and learn from.",1
"Excellent prof. Works at a slow,  thorough speed, but not annoyingly so. Assignments and final were fair, midterm was crazy easy. Lots of bonus questions for credit on assignments if that's your kind of thing. Only criticism is sometimes it felt like he prepped his lecture 20 minutes before starting and was figuring stuff out along with you.",1
Out to get you. Not a friend,0
I really like Dr. Lorimer. She knows her stuff and encourages people to participate. I liked reading the sources from history and using the iClicker/REEF to earn participation points. There were a lot of assignments to help people who dont do well on tests. I would take her class again!,1
"This is a solid choice for a humanities credit if you're interested in psych - you do have to read the textbook a decent amount and make sure to go to the lectures because there are graded mini quizzes and she'll do spontaneous extra credit. You can't get by without doing anything though, make sure to actually look over stuff before the tests.",1
"He is an amazing lecturer. He is remarkably organized and uploads the slides prior to the lecture, so during class you can really absorb what he is saying instead of trying to write everything down. His grading scale is fair and his exams are well made. He provides a study guide so you know which topics you may be tested on. Best prof ever!",1
He's a great lecturer. Only reason I wouldn't take him again is because he makes the final overly difficult. Also wish he had provided practice finals/midterms,1
"I took lessons from pawkett for 1 semester and it was disappointing. Not a good teacher for ROCKBLUES type stuff. He seemed like more of a classical guy. His lessons are monotonous and a lot of the time it felt like I was learning random things for no reason. Plus he hardly seemed interested throughout the lessons, often ending lessons early. ",0
"he does not warn you. he tells you that you need no background in programming, but you need to hve taken it in high school to do well. he sucks at teaching. he doesnt make the labs or tests, so he never teaches what you need to know. hes awful and so boring. take PAYNE or get OUT.",0
"I've heard that she is a great professor, so that's why I believe that it was probably just an issue with transitioning to online. That being said, this is the single worst class I have ever taken. I knew it was bad when I went to sleep crying and woke up crying. Most of the people I talked to got horrible grades. She just didn't explain the topic.",0
"She was a great teacher, easy to learn from and made writing very interesting and fun, yes I said fun. If you want to learn a lot and enjoy going to class, then make sure you get her as your teacher!",1
"If you don't do your webwork, you will fail. Study for his tests because they're EXTREMELY hard. I barely passed with an A after all the work I put in. Buying a chegg account might be a good idea.",1
"Wilson gets a bad rep for being vague and very confusing, which is definitely true. Her class was definitely interesting and in my opinion valuable. To be successful in this class just participate in class, do all of the assigned work, go to her office hours (she's really nice), and work well with your group. Tests are super easy.",0
"Worst professor ever. LAzy and doesnt wanna teach seriously in the class. Lots of works, everything is non-sense in that class",0
"Professor Snyder has good intentions and does care about her students. I took Bus160 online and it was a mess. We met for class once a month and were left to teach ourselves the rest. If the class was in person Im convinced I would have a different opinion, but if the class is online do not bother. Canvas is unorganized and you will teach yourself.",0
dr. bartz really is passionate about spreading athletic training awareness to her students and makes class interesting with her stories.  but she is very picky and inconsistent when it comes to abstracts just memorize apa. also does a poor job of announcing deadlines/assignments/test dates in class. over all a good prof though,0
"Prof. Olzman is an amazing professor. She is passionate about teaching and it shows. Also, go see her during office hours. She appreciates out -of-class participation. She's great one-on-one too. I got so much help on my speeches and helped with my grade.",1
Class is very laid back with no homework at all. Your whole grade is based off of four papers that he spends lecture preparing you for. No textbook needed just a reader. He is a nice guy who is always happy to teach. He treats everyone with respect. Overall he is an awesome professor. This is not your typical boring English class so TAKE HIS CLASS!,1
"Prof. handled the virus really well. Two short papers (2 pg reflection paper and 3 pg essay), open book online quizzes with the questions ahead of time. Zoom classes were fun. One easy group project. She was always available for us. Wish I took both history classes with her! My other professor made us write essays every week and didn't teach us.",1
Many of Dr. Hines' lectures build upon one another. Skipping class is not a good idea as you will fall behind on these lectures. Attendance is graded by REEF polling questions. Go to class and keep speed with the lectures and it's an easy A.,1
"Best prof at sc, he is super hilarious and insightful. The first few lectures can be hard to understand but if you practice more and understand all the concepts well you'll find it easy. Please do his handouts as much as possible, or the 3 tests would be tough for you. The average test score is no more than 70%, but you need to get 90%+ for A.",1
"without those extra bonuses credits , we won't survive the class. thank you very much dr. Randy Waterman.",1
"Had Kim for several classes over the years- great teacher. Very understanding, very involved. Didn't think I was a big fan of contemporary art before this class, but she showed us some amazing things. Never had trouble on her tests myself, she gives study guides that show you what pieces might be talked about and if you take notes you'll be fine.",1
"Good prof... really helped me through 1710. She clarifies everything, and if your major isn't CS, makes it easier for you to get through the course! Classes are pretty dull, but she makes the material understandable. Nice woman, easy to talk to.",1
"If you have a great interest in Global Citizenship, I recommend him to choose. If not, never pick him as an online instructor. Although most students are chased by an insufficient time of caring for their major courses he expects you to read his textbook over 40 pages, to take your time over 4 hours to study it or to do assignments.",0
"hope you like analogies b/c he does. ""have you ever been stabbed?""",0
"He seems like a nice professor, but his lectures are atrociously bad. Scribbled notes on the whiteboard, erasing something he just wrote, and he will gloss over questions and assume the class is understanding the content. I've asked questions and he has completely passed me to help another student. The language barrier doesn't help.",0
"He taught me Matlab and he made it easy. His course structure was excellent. Plenty of non graded very instructive labs to practice.  Fair grading, fair tests/graded labs/final. You will know what you will need to know to prepare for graded work. What you will learn, will be useful to other applied math courses.",1
"A very quiet talker, but I understood her. Its an incredibly boring and hard subject to teach, so I think she does a pretty good job of it. Never went to SI (time conflicts), understood it fairly well. She's a tough marker, but very helpful. She misunderstand often, though. I'd suggest taking a class with someone else, before one with her.",1
Not a good teacher and his communication skills lacked. Also this teacher does not utilize blackboard which hard when you are communicating with your student. Lastly Dr. Erhan class was hard and does offer many oppourtunties where may lack in the class. Clarity can be confusing when doesn't explain topic fully .,0
"She literally had the most monotone boring voice, class is almost painful to go to. It's full of obscure assignments with no real grading scale that took insane amounts of time to finish. That being said, exams are easy if you sit through the class and take notes. She would tear apart my assignments in the comment section and then give me a B+",0
"Ali Asgary is an amazing professor! He is a very helpful professor and his instructions are crystal clear. Attendance is mandatory, textbook use is medium, but his course was definitley worthwhile. Ali get's an A+ for eing a damn good professor.",1
"professor creed is great. would not recommend if you aren't a poli sci major, because it can get confusing if you're not really into it. a short 3-4 paper due every week and lots of reading so beware of that. he gives very detailed feedback and is very accessible outside of class. i plan on taking him again soon.",1
"Possibly the worst teacher I have ever had. Extremely lazy and careless, if you have to take a class with him do yourself a favor and get the lecture notes of another prof because without them you're not going to have a good time. Also tests students online in the most nonsense way possible. Good Luck",0
"math is her first language; but gives very general examples of how to work through even the most basic calculus problems in a way that someone that has never seen calculus before. also gets off topic, often- leaving you even more confused by the end of class. does not collect homework, but MUST do if you intend on learning intro calc.",0
He's a bad Prof that doesn't know how to teach material. He also showed some kids email in class to everyone saying that he was sick and wanted to email his assignments. Rick then complained about the email for ten minutes. Basically a volleyball coach that for what ever reason for what ever reason was able to land a job as a Prof.,0
"There is homework for every lecture, The only thing graded are exams, so make sure you do good on the exams and to do the assigned homework. Curves all test!",1
"My girlfriend had Barclay for Abnormal Psych.  I tagged along to one of his classes out of boredom on day, and ended up going with her 5 more times.  The guy is entertaining!",1
This class could be completed in about 10 hours of self study. The amount of information we could be learning about databases is so huge yet we learn basically nothing the entire semester. He'll ask you every single day who has signed up for apex and 5 or so other things that don't matter at all which burns the first 15 min of every class.A joke,0
"Tough professor, but an awesome one.  Spanish Litereature: Romanticism was my favorite class.  Ramon is fantastic and really knows his stuff.",1
"You will work in this class, but she is always clear and helpful. I felt like I became a stronger writer.",1
Should spend more time teaching and less time trying to be your friend.,0
"He rambles a lot and tries to be funny, but doesn't really succeed. Not the worst prof in the world, but i found his class boring.",0
"He was kind of flaky this semester, but hopefully he will improve. Pretty solid teacher if you put the work in to practice and apply the material he teaches. Zappa is his soft spot",1
"If you're an English major...you need to take Rosso at least once.A lot of  work,but really makes you sure if this is what you're supposed to be doing. Amazing personality and even better sense of humor.Truly one of the best professors out there.The work in class is justified by his demeanor and teaching skills. You will learn and love it.",1
"Prof. Lee is a very nice and helpful professor but it is unfortunate that his accent is so thick that barely anybody in the class could understand. I did not do well in the class but spent countless hours working on the homework. His tests are fill in the blank. Where in the job field of accounting will a company ask you to ""fill in the blank""",0
"he did a great job of providing students with the fundamentals.  His class was very fun and he helped us and guided us when we were struggling. The only part I didn't like is how he is so obsessed with basing everything around the character's ""wants"".",1
Professor Zimmerman is not doing well in the virtual world. She doesnt post assignments when she says she will and gives feedback on assignments after they are due. She forgot to give my class a midterm so suddenly made the final worth 40 percent. On the final she included content she never taught and posted a ppt so we could teach ourselves.,0
"1 Laura Ridenour a Quality of Teaching ai The worst teacher you will experience aii No quality in her teaching b Organization Skills i Nonexistent (she is supposed to be expert at organization?) c Communication Skills i. none, she is the worst",0
"The ancients told us of a man who was born beyond time who would come down to bless us engineering students with the wisdom and knowledge from beyond. But seriously, this class is definitely the most helpful with understanding engineering in an industrial setting and will prepare you for real-world engineering.",1
This class is not bad at all. A lot of extra credit opportunities and professor Wright held a lot of office hours. There are a lot of assignments but they all add up so make sure to do them. In class work isnt bad at all because you do the projects together as a class.,1
"Dr. Swansinger is more interested in seeing if students are making connections to what she's teaching (fair) than giving opportunities to get a good grade in the course. This makes for cool class discussions if you're paying attention and participating, but it also means you only get 3-5 actual grades. If you don't like talking in class, avoid.",1
"horrible. one of the worst teachers i have ever had.  she is late to every class, never hands assignments back on time. her opinion is the only right one.  she never responds to emails, and wont answer questions if you try to talk to her after class.",0
By far without a doubt the worse professor I've ever had. She changes her grading rubric weekly. I am convinced she comes up with her own rules of the English language and grades your papers based on that. Avoid her at all costs.,0
"The class is easy, but the professor is kind of crappy. She will assign homework on a Sunday night at 11pm and want it done for your 9am class. But then she doesn't take off points for late homework? She curves the quizzes & tests a lot which helps. She only speak in french and always corrects your pronunciation. She randomly calls on you in class.",1
"Confusing assignments, pared with his vauge grading requirements made this a pretty difficult class. He did not say until after the fact what he was looking for in assignments, and it made getting a good grade really difficult. He is not good at explaining what his expectations are and grades very strictly on grammar and style. ",0
He's okay. Two question quizzes are okay. Tests are okay. Nothing special. Better options out there.,0
worst math teacher I have ever had...Tests are difficult(but the same as the other MATH251 classes)She is very unclear and can not take charge of a classroom. The only time I ever understood what she was talking about was at a review session for the final,0
"He marks you on participation every single class... but he takes up 90% of the time talking about his own experiences??? So many students will have their hands up to give input (AND GET MARKS) but he disregards them starts sharing his own stories. Not a fan of the marking scheme, he's very knowledgeable and likes to show that off.",1
"u were awesome in the vet tech class i took, and then for the lab for lab animal, ur my favorite teacher!!",1
"Dr. Garcia-Rodriguez is easy to talk to, very knowledgable, and most importantly, a  great professor. I would definitely recommend her. She gave a lot of readings and papers with them. Make sure to re-read your papers because she'll take off for grammatical mistakes. Her test review is always similar to the test so make sure to pay attention.",1
"She isn't really a teacher, just there to baby sit us while we listen to different people lecture. Doesn't take attendance & it doesn't matter if you're not there. I don't even think she reads the few, short essays we wrote; she just makes sure we did it. She just doesn't really seem to want to be there & complains a lot.",0
"Professor Cramer is the kind of teacher I could only hope to be. He has a theme with every lecture and is incredibly articulate and thorough. I feel spoiled taking his class and I don't want to take Art History with any other professor. The tests are difficult if yo don't study, but he's fair and easily approachable.",1
"Great person, terrible teacher. SHe taught to the board.. Not the students. I had a 4.0 last quarter in math, and failed this math class. There is no structure and I wouldn't recommend her to anyone.",0
Professor Tavss is hilarious and one of my favorite professors at Rutgers so far.  He is always willing to help students no matter what and is a great lecturer.  I didnt really go to lectures but he posts lots of examples and helpful practice problems online.  Do all those old problems and you're guaranteed an A.  I definitely recommend him!,1
Dr. Brasher is very helpful and has a great personality...I recommend him to everyone. He makes everyone love English!,1
"Took this course in Fall 2014 and by far the best and most useful BIOL course I've taken. She's changed it up and while the content is heavy its quite interesting for molecular biology.   A must-have BIOL that has all the essentials for you to ace it (ie. bonus marks, sample questions, no textbook needed, etc). ",1
"Horrible these final weeks, doesn't answer questions about readings, doesn't care about the material, just do your presentation and you'll be fine.  Any Spanish major can speak better that her.  Avoid!!!!",0
Barry is a good guy-tries to be too inspirational. Do HW and do it well b/c counts a ton of your grade. Each exam is like 9% so not much of  your grade. He gives a ton of extra credit! HW once a week. Do well on your labs. 3 exams and one final (was optional my year). Lectures are boring but its physics. He gives a practice exam before each exam!,1
"This prof is very knowledgeable; however, the workload is very large and it is extremely easy to loose track as to where things are going. No matter how much of the book you read, the classes and test will contain things that are not covered in class.  If order to obtain a good grade, make sure you have a light course load or have no social life.",0
I was a dual major and the capstone in my other major (CJ) was a major waste of time.  But the SOC capstone with Prof. De Young was great.  Very challenging.  Wanted you to show off what you've learned.  Very helpful. Great experience and nice way to say goodbye to old GVSU.,1
"I don't get where the nice ratings are coming from. This man does not reply to his emails, he simply pretends he can't see them. You would think during a pandemic he would be more supportive and reply to students rather than ignore them but nope not for Dawson. He wants correct spelling and will mark you ""incorrect"" for it being spelt wrong. AVOID!",0
worst professor ever. Be prepared to watch his lecture's recordings because you won't be able to keep up with him when the lecture is live.,0
really helps me to understand the stuff being teached,1
Super chill prof and very knowledgeable. Explains everything clearly,1
"Andy definitely cares about his students success, and even more that we learn and understand the material. He posts all his lectures so you can rewatch to learn/study, has office hours, and a great attitude. He does expect a lot of detail on exams, so if you want an A you have to know the material front and back.",1
"Exact replica of Jon Lovitz...if Jon Lovitz were indian (watch High School High).  Class material isn't far advanced from high school material and the fact that he teaches like a high scholl teacher, makes class veerrry tedious.  unless you've never seen a matrix in your live, bring lunch or skip class.  good guy, but needs to teach adults not kids",1
"It can be pretty hard to stay focused in this class, especially for non science majors. Although you are given a review sheet for tests, they are still difficult and the class average was mostly 70s. He does make himself available out of class for further help, but even with this my tests were never better than a 75. Nice guy, hard class.",0
Has to be one of the nicest professors I've met.  He also has to be one of the worst lecturers I've met.,0
He was entertaining,1
"Easy class, can't explain things clearly, she's a talkative one. comes up with a lot of stories on why she couldn't hand things back o time. four essays with small other writings. doesn't teach you how to write, though, or really help at all. could easily snooze in her class",0
Didn't include in-text citation for a few sources and was given 35% off final paper. Gives very little leeway and grades poorly for minor things.,0
she is really all over the place when lecturing. notes are hard to take and hard to understand because she goes so fast. I had to find a lot of outside help in this class. she is pretty good about extra credit and letting you turn things in whenever you want though.,0
"Nice teacher, but make sure to join every class. She takes attendance at the beginning of class and it does affect your grades. Tests are a bit heavy for the hour given, homework is a decent amount on the textbook site. Many group breakout rooms each class along with projects. Always asks for volunteers so be ready to speak",1
"He doesn't help students when they need him. His lectures missed a lot of things in the curriculum. Scholz would not give you any practice exams, remove access to lecture and Mastering Physics in the last days and his test is somewhat unfair and irrelevant to what we learnt in class.",0
This man has no business teaching.  He doesn't even make sense.  He just talks.,0
Only saw Dr. Sullivan once at the first class for only 10 minutes. The TA's are nice and helpful if you have a question. There's a quiz over the lab manual every class but they're not too hard if you study the objectives. At the end of the lab there is an assignment but you can work together with your lab table to complete it.,0
"Assignments were easy overall. However, at the end of the semester, he changed his grade breakdown from what the syllabus originally said. His grading was really inconsistent and many students received grades lower than they actually earned. I would avoid this professor for this class.",0
"He was a cool guy, but he's kinda hard to understand. I always did good on the quizzes, but when it came to his tests I would fail miserably.",1
Great teacher! would take him again if i was offered the chance! easy class just pay attention he makes it interesting.,1
"Dan Smith is one of the best professors in the com department. His lectures are fantastic. The course is super interesting and applicable to all areas of life, and you get to do a super great project. Take a class with Dan Smith if you get the chance.",1
"This class was VERY easy and Prof. McNamara was entertaining. Not much as far as actual coursework. One very small paper on any business movie of your choice (mine was Wolf on Wall Street), one group project and one group assignment. There were a few tests but all the multiple choice questions were true which he'll tell you first day of class.   ",1
"Very, very, very good teacher. She is so energetic that time flies by. Don't expect an easy A though, this class is TOUGH! But, Dr. Margavio does her best to clarify the material. Accting isn't exciting, but its entertaining the way she teaches it. I liked her so much I am taking 504 with her, she is AWESOME! P.S. go to class to rack up group point",1
"this professors doesn't have a clear grading scale. He has two tests that are difficult and doesn't help with my grade and some students like me. He needs 4 exams or more to pass to the class. He's a nice guy, but the group project isn't helpful and doesn't help some students. He shouldn't assign the group project, and assign assignments instead.",0
"Psych with Palfai is great.  He is so passionate about the subject so lectures aren't too terrible, but tests are GOD AWFUL.  I had to study for hours just to get a B.  If you like psych definitely take it because you'll do well but if you're just interested in checking out a psych class or fulfilling a requirement, find another professor.",1
"By far the best teacher at KU. She's smart, funny, and knows her stuff. She simplifies the material and breaks it down into layman's terms but then follows up with the appropriate vocabulary just so all the students fully understand what is going on. ",1
"Such an interesting prof! She has good stories and you can tell she enjoys teaching about it. Make sure to go to every class: it may seem like you can pull off with just online notes and the texts, but she adds so much to the notes in class and gives many examples that are on the tests that are no where else.",1
Lecture material was straight out of the textbook / slides. You don't have to attend - just watch the documentaries. He is not this amazing thinker. Standard worker with very little interest in the individuality of his students. More focused on governance and rules than teaching. Poor feedback was given if at all.,0
"Had her for calc 3, personally i liked her as a teacher. shes very clear when teaching, however 3 tests make up your whole grade. have to do well on all three or will not do well. short presentation on a mathematician. homework due once a week with limited problems. she loves the subject, take her!",1
"While he does make Chemistry (a very hard subject to grasp) a easier to understand & writes solutions to problems on the board.. I wish he was a little better at preparing students for HIS tests. The multiple choice is easy on his tests compared to other professors, but I wish he gave a better idea on how short answers will be. That's all!",1
This professor gives a lot of homework and is not easy on grading. If you have a holiday trip planned with the family and ask the teacher to let you do something early or later theres a zero percent chance she will accept. Make sure you practice homework questions and study hard. Does provide a lot of learning materials.,0
Great professor whose test was incredibly fair! Best prof in the course.,1
"There are more cons than pros for this class. Pros are that he gives a lot of extra credit &  gives you a fair warning about class difficulty. Cons are: the tests are long and he makes them tricky on purpose, singles students out,  he isn't clear  about concepts, etc. He may be the head of the department but he's a horrible professor. ",0
"This guy is very biased and doesn't really accept any other opinions but his own. It's interesting material, but don't expect a great grade. I just wanted to get my natural science requirement out of the way. I'm glad I took it, because it offered me a unique outlook on life and my purpose in it, but my GPA is gonna take a hit.",0
"Andrew splits his notes between a slideshow, a word document, and a set of messy marker drawings. There is a slew of unnecessary information, such as biographies of nobel prize winners. He relies on oral teaching amd testable content is unclear. Recording lectures is almost mandatory. His speech is stilted and deliberately confusing. He's useless.",0
"Honestly, I picked this teacher based on the reviews on this website. I was not impressed at all. I had a difficult time getting in contact with her, calculating my class grade was literally impossible until the end of the semester, and she definitely graded quite harshly for a freshman level class. I would not take another of her classes again.",0
really slow and not interesting!,0
"Dr. Cramer is very knowledgeable. I've done well in his classes but the marking scheme is unfair. Not sure if it was like this before COVID, but since courses have been online his midterms are 50% and finals 50%. His GA's mark both and they're EXTREMELY picky. The word limit per page is inappropriate for how much information they expect from you.",1
"Very good professor, because I have had so far. He is there anytime, and can help you whenever you want. Teachs interesting topics like the Lunar Samples.",1
He's so cute! As long as you do well on the tests you'll be fine! They are open note so make sure you buy the textbook.,1
This prof expects far too much for a first year course. I took this course as an elective and regretted it. I have put less work into third year science courses and attained better marks. Avoid if possible.,0
"Prof Blackwelder was rude and obviously didn't have any respect for the students. For a low level class, the work expected was completely unnecessary and far too time consuming. I'm not afraid of hard work if it's warranted, but it was NOT for this class. Take Radha Bose's statistics class for your math credit instead. It's easy, fair, and useful.",0
Probably the easiest accy class in the department. I only went to class when she announced there are extra credit opportunity and studied all the materials myself at home. It was an easy A if you go through the past exam and make sure you know how to prepare all the financial statements.  And do go to lecture during the Halloween!,1
Professor Tripp expects you to participate in class but yet when you are talking he interrupts you so much. He is a hard grader and is not very good when it comes to answering questions.,0
the best thing to be said for chuck was that attendance wasnt mandatory,0
"Legit hardest professor at Stonehill. If you're looking for an easy A, do NOT take Kane.",0
very difficult for a 100 level class..he tells you too much material to study for the tests so its hard to know what to focus on..he says test will be on chapters 1 to 5 but then there is only 7 short essay/questions on the test..he also does not care about his students succeeding or not..if all you need it for is a gen ed..go somewhere else,0
FANTASTIC professor!  I recommend him to every single person!!!,1
"About as easy as a Grad level class could possibly be. You will have a 4 page paper every other week, every week you do not have a paper, you will have a quiz. You can literally make a case for every question you miss on the quiz, and he almost always gives it to you and adds points. Very VERY boring, but a really nice guy. He will help you out.",1
"Awesome guy! Helpful, and knows his stuff. His class is based on the midterm, the final & attendance. Hs test are really easy and he seems to enjoy what he is talking about. I would really reccomend him. :)",1
"Great teacher. Easy going and extremely approachable. Accounting is a boring topic, so do not expect flamethrowers and circus freaks to make the class more enjoyable. However, she makes the class interesting by inspiring us with her personal experiences (she is an accountant and business owner). Learned a lot from her.",1
Katie is awesome! She's not a boring professor and she tries to add a little humor into her presentations. She brings in cats when we've finished learning about them. She's very kind and helpful.,1
"I would not recommend taking this class with him. He doesn't really teach the material, he expects you to read the book and teach yourself. Do not give much guidance on homework either",0
He always willing to give 1 on 1 help and answers email thoroughly and quickly even in evenings. He says text book is not mandatory - and technically its not but I dont know how I would get by without it. He teaches based on it so if you miss class you can just see the book. Also posts notes on BB. Grades based on many things. Tests fair.,1
"Ionascu is a very nice lady and is a good teacher of discrete math. Her class is very lecture heavy and sometimes it can get a little on the boring side, but she does make it interesting by going on tangents or telling some jokes. Homework is always clear and she always gives a very helpful review sheet for tests. Would definitely recommend.",1
Julio is THE MAN-study guides are right on target. hes so cute too!,1
"This is surely one of BU's best profs! He is helpful, intresting and always values your opinion! No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't bring myself to skip his class! Will most definately take more of his courses!",1
"Please, DO NOT TAKE HER. unless you like the boring lectures. She is not clear on what she wants in Homework, plus she is Taught, grader. I wish I did not take her CLASS. RIP my GPA ):",0
"Dr. Schnittjer is a super smart guy and has a funny dry sense of humor, but he gives lots of homework.",1
Very helpful. As a beginner I learned a lot because of his patience and expertise. He gave a lot of quizzes so you have to keep up with your reading.,1
"Pretty easy class with a lot of reading, but really she outlines what she wants in class so if you attend class I did not find I had to read to attentively. It was a good class.",1
"Very rude, abrasive personality but knows how to teach and definitely knows what he's doing.",1
"really smart but down-to-earth guy, gives clear lectures and pretty laid back and likes throwing a few jokes here and there",1
"This class was unbelievably hard. Good luck getting an A unless you cheat.  Has no office hours, only ""virtual"" hours where you have the pleasure of listening to everyone else's concerns as well as dogs in the back ground. Get your code ready in advance for the quizzes as this guy doesn't give you any time should you make mistakes. Avoid!!!",0
Really did not seem like this guy cared at all. Did not even bother to teach and just sent 1 email before the class starts every week. Complete waste of time and money. Do not take this guy.,0
"Absolutely not! I received A's and A- on all the presentations and he gave me a C+ for my overall grade and missed 1 day of class. Not to mention he lost one of  my test grades.I've never feel asleep in class in my entire life(seriously), and every time he opened his mouth my eyes closed. Insanely boring",0
"He is very good at explaining and will repeat explanations if not understood. Although Anatomy and Physiology is tough, he tries to make it easier for the students by clear explanations. I enjoyed his class and will recommend him to students",1
AVOID AT ALL COSTS! Worst professor at UT. He is absolutely rediculous with grading and is unclear about directions about our two major essay assignments worth 50% of our grade. The person below me explains this perfectly. His voice also makes me want to fall asleep.,0
"This was class was awful, the work is very difficult to do here. There are rarely any new assignments to do. No extra credit either. The only way to pass this class is by passing all the exams but they're very difficult to do, without any other assignments to do you don't get any experiments with the topic.",0
"DO NOT TAKE PHYSICS HERE!! It is not worth the stress that this class produces. Lecture material is not sufficient to be able to handle the exams and homework. He's a nice guy, but should not be teaching.",0
"He won't give any feedback how you doing during the course.  Mostly doesn't care helping students .  Try to show some fancy stuff with your work even if that doesn't matter to your project or assignment , he would be happy.",0
literally the hardest math class i have ever taken and this is supposed to be easy. hell spend a whole class doing one problem and then by the end hes done the whole thing wrong. hard to understand when he speaks. i learn more from the homework and teaching myself then from him,0
The only class I have ever dropped.,0
"Best professor I have ever had. Exams are all papers but if you attend class not a problem. Easy going and concise to the point attitude make it easy to engage and participate. He is also the only prof who I have had that I can't pinpoint there political affiliation, and in a poly sci class that shows how unbiased he really is.",1
I love Burd. She is a great teacher. You have about one homework assignment per week and only two tests. Its a super easy class as long as you show up and do the work. Not much in depth studying is required for this class.,1
"He seems nice enough and I think he knows his stuff, but he is a horrible teacher. He spends more time going off on tangents that mean nothing than he does saying anything semi-coherent. He doesn't seem interested at all in teaching in an efficient way to actually help his students, he seems too full of himself to bother. Avoid or suffer",0
"Sets high standards. Actively engages the class and is genuinely interested in what you think.  Will improve your writing ability. One of my favorite professors, highly recommended.",1
One of the best teachers I have ever had!!!!,1
"I understand both students and professors are having a hard time with COVID. But even now, this guy is still such a harsh grader and is still teaching religiously by the book, exceptions are very limited. Even if wifi is hard to come by, Zoom attendance required. Difficulty for exams and labs is ridiculous, pls cut some slack for your students.",0
to the commenter who said the raters are all 100 levels and should be ignored: where are any other positive comments from higher level classes such as the one you took? Or from serious art students who had to start with 100 level courses? If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck...,1
"Unclear, boring, marks lower than Obimbo's class",0
"She is a very fun profressor. I love her casual style of teaching. Just don't be deceived into thinking she won't ever get mad. You have to work for an A, but it is achievable.",1
This professor was all over the place with his lectures. It was very hard to follow him and understand what he was trying to say. He was not very good at explaining what he wantesd from us and worksheets were always so repetitive. Although he gave chances to earn extra points. Attendace taken every class and will affect grade if you do not come.,0
"He is very popular among the student body because he is hip, relatable, and witty.Unfortunately, his lectures are very confusing and, in the case of 2110, assignments bare little resemblance to anything found in lecture. I taught myself wholly from the book. He is not a good teacher and the course is not a concise or good course.",0
I loved Professor Herrick's class! I had no chemistry background but that did not did not hurt me in anyway and now after taking his class I love chemistry. It is very possible to do well in his class but you need to put in the work. The practice tests he gives are extremely helpful and I was never blindsided on a test.,1
Not clear on expectations.,0
"Great professor! He's really sweet and makes the class accessible, even to students with little to no history background. He made the class interesting, and though it was very reading heavy, it was an enjoyable experience.",1
"I really liked this guy. He taught well, made sure everyone understood the material, which is very hard to do in a class the size I was in. This did make the pace a little slow, but not too bad.",1
Amazing professor who cares about students especially considering that math isn't my subject at all. She makes sure to help and support you with your work especially when you're putting effort into it.,1
Professor Ballard is an awesome guy that really cares about what he teaches and his class won't be too hard if you just watch all of the lectures and pay attention. He's also got a pretty massive tie collection.,1
Never take her if you want to save your time and money,0
This professor is completely inept and ignorant to any problems a student might face. I would highly recommend choosing any other economics teacher at CU. He seems to be lazy and tired.,0
"Once gave a pop ""TEST"" ""TEST that is"" NOT a pop QUIZ, ""POP TEST"". And his tests take like 2 weeks to complete. He should also be retired/gone since he sits in his office 70% of the time!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
Bev is one of the sweetest teachers I've ever had. I would take her class again in a heartbeat and Ballet 1 was easily my favorite class of the semester. She deeply cares about her students and wants them to succeed. She is so helpful and passionate and just loves dance.,1
"probably one of my favorite teachers at app! very friendly, dedicated to helping you get the most out of her class. her teaching methods are fun and creative, and working with the room 13 kids was great. definitely take a class with her if you get the chance.",1
"Pointless class, lectures are boring.  The teacher doesn't seem motivated to teach the class.",0
"Hes a great prof, who emphasizes understanding of the concept and teaches with many in class examples. Attend class and do the practice questions and theirs absolutely nothing to worry about.",1
Disorganized. Uncaring. Unhelpful. No understanding of what students have been dealing with during covid. Time is ridiculously short for LAs. Would not recommend.,0
"She is honestly one of the meanest teachers I have ever had. She puts students down for asking questions and speeds through the material very quickly. She takes off a lot of points of questions on quiz' and exams that are right. The material is not hard, it's just she doesn't know how to teach it properly. Avoid having her as a teacher. ",0
"I am not even fully done with the course and I can not stand this professor. For a class on drones, he spends half of it talking gender politics and the other half at his desk while we work on pointless projects. Didn't even give us an accurate study guide for our midterm, which I just failed as a result! And he has no concern for non GIS students!",0
she just hands out A's,0
"The class wasn't hard as long as you read, and this is coming from someone completely new to the world of computer science. That being said, Professor Cassidy is the worst professor I've ever taken a class with. She was extremely unprofessional and unprepared for class. I had to teach myself everything. Don't take her unless she's the only option.",0
Really enjoyable professor. He loves to relate real life situations to the material he teaches and does a great job at it.,1
He's super great and easy to talk to. I'm really not great at drawing and he's very easy going,1
"You can tell that Dr. Pennington is extremely intelligent and passionate about chemistry, but he expects his students to be as well. There is at least an hour of lecture to watch before EVERY synchronous lecture, you have to get the class participation questions RIGHT to get attendance points, and the tests are a nightmare. You've been warned.",0
only gave 3 out of the 4 quizzes he planned. quizzes on on about 7-12 slides of pictures that he labels and gives beforehand. he usually chooses like 5. one paper on the met trip but he was super reluctant to give any details on it. literally said what it was about during class. had to ask him to write out guidelines. don't even have to show up,1
"Great prof!! made class interesting, was easy to understand and funny too. very enthusiastic about math, definately take him for calculus. do the assignments and the exams wont be hard",1
"If you come into the Shakespeare class expecting a literature class (heaven forbid), you'll be in for quite a surprise. Dr. Poole teaches Shakespeare like it's history and won't accept any interpretation of the text if it's not based on her own, often poor, interpretations.",0
"Prof Dudley is a quirky guy which makes his class interesting. His class is not mandatory but tests are solely based on lectures. Online quizzes, a few short writing assignments, and 4 exams. Not a bad class to take if you need credits or an easy A.",1
She is so good and very helpful to student.,1
"I took organic 2 and chem 101 Kiesewetter. A lot of people like her because she is bubbly in comparison to other chemistry professors. However, she is not a good teacher. I learned all the material on my own, and she is not very helpful with explaining things. She will just go through problems and expect people to conform to how she does things.",0
"Somehow the class went towards religion, which it is not at all!",0
test what you give in class ****,0
The greatest teacher alive!,1
"Run fast and don't look back. This professor is knowledgeable, but she is too much. It is a 3 unit online class and her workload is more of a 7 units class. I am a 4.0 GPA student, and she is very ridiculous by being very ambiguous all the time! Unlike other online professors that I have taken, this professor will confuse the heck out of you.",0
"Well, a nice person overall. But the class is horribly boring, if ya have a morning class be prepared to fall alseep.",1
Jean is the best prof anyone could want to have.  WONDERFUL.,1
Dr. Feldman makes more mistakes in a single lecture than I do on an entire homework assignment,0
"I loved Dr. Field's Chinese class because he was organized, clear, and an engaging professor. My favorite moments in the class are those where he explained the meaning of the characters. He knows how the English mind works and is therefore able to teach Chinese grammar very well.",1
"My second class with Professor Bai. He's very organized in the online platform which is great. This 200-level class was definitely more difficult than the 100-level I took with him, which is appropriate in my opinion. Best advice? Do the reading and you'll do well on the weekly tests.",1
"WRT 150 requires a lot of busy work, due to the fact that you only write 3 papers in the class. You are allowed 3 absences before failing the course, but he is lenient if there is a legitimate reason that you are gone. He has a dry sense of humor and doesn't express much emotion, but is an overall good guy.",1
"professor farhat is one of the best teachers i have ever had. She makes the lectures really interesting and her stories are always funny. She is very caring; although, she is a hard grader she is all about you learning. All you have to do is show up and listen and I promise you, you will be fine. She is not boring at all, very funny actually.",1
"He means well, but he's a terrible professor. He practically reads his massively over complicated documents word for word, and explains things to the point of mental exhaustion. His teaching style is really old and he doesn't use Reggienet because he doesn't know. He cares a lot, but his teaching style tends to be counterproductive and impossible.",0
"He is a really bad teacher, get out of the 80's with your class notes scanned, need to learn power point.  Expect alot from students but he is not providing any help.  On top his exams are so hard, you remember everything by heart and the second you leave the class you forget it all.  about a 2/10 teacher",0
The lectures are extremely boring and final exam is cruel.,0
"Dr. Bayers is a true narcissist. Relative to other English professors ar Fairfield, he's not cutting it. I dreaded his class and would advise other to avoid it at all costs.",0
OMG! Absolutely loved this professor. I plan on taking SPAN102 and I'm so glad I have her again. She's a sweetheart and is truly passionate about the culture and her student's growth. This class is extremely easy and I wish I took advantage of all of the professor's advice to achieve a higher grade.,1
Mr. Johansen is a great teacher. Make sure to make it to his classes and take notes on what he says. He likes you to write things the way he likes. If you study and go to class you'll get a good grade. Would recommend him to anyone.,1
"Super cool guy. You can tell that he REALLY knows what he's talking about, and he's helpful about it, too.",1
"All the dislike on here is because she is boring. Yes she can be a bit boring, but if you aren't lazy and actually bother to pay attention, she presents the information in a very easy to understand clear concise manner. The only issue I had with her is that she can be quite strict.",1
"Tests are impossible to pass. Too many problems tough and time consuming problems. Does not test on what he covers in lecture. Problem sets and quizzes will have you thinking you're learning the material well, but when tests come around you're doomed. I would avoid taking this professor unless you have time to study 25/8.",0
I really enjoyed her honors class and we had a lot of fun discussing the various novels as they applied to the time period.  It was much better than the usual boring lectures about European wars and whatnot.  Persian Letters among others were great novels.,1
"She's a very nice person and really does want to help you do well in her class. However, she really isn't open at all to anyone else's interpretations of the assigned readings. This really takes away from the class because all you can do is listen and pretend to agree that everything is about slavery.",0
"I was unsure whether to take him or not due to other peoples opinions about his class but I passed & hes not as scary as everyone makes his class to be. Show up take notes, pay attention, and youll do fine!",1
he makes it look so easy on lectures and exams are so much more difficult and way more detailed than lab manual or his notes.,0
"Witherwax is awesome.  This class is so much fun and he really makes every second interesting.  Very knowledgeable and you'll learn a lot.  VERY little work, but he can be a bit of a tough grader.  Midterm, Final, and 3 quizzes.  Good class to take.",1
"Just do all the extra extra credit and study the tests in the back of the book and you should be fine. He gives 3 points extra credit every class and that does add up. I would take the class again now that i have figured out his style. The essay he makes you do, you'll get 100% as long as you turn it in.",1
Great teacher.  Love his stories which actually help you remember the curriculum.  One of the best at ACC.,1
"HE'S A PRETTY DECENT TEACHER! THE NOTES ARE A LIFE SAVER & A MUST TO PASS THE CLASS! THE TEXTBOOK IS REQUIRED, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE BY IT BECAUSE THE NOTES WILL GET YOU THROUGH THE CLASS. ATTENDANCE IS IMPORTANT. ONE MISSED CLASS WITHOUT THE NOTES AND YOU MAY GET A COUPLE QUESTIONS WRONG ON THE QUIZ. ",1
"I really love Dr. Forcade. Some people might find his lectures hard to follow, but they were usually really interesting. He tests very fairly. His homework can be difficult, but he is EXTREMELY helpful if you ask him for help via email or in his office. He cares about his students and wants them to do well. Highly recommended.",1
Takes forever to responds to emails and sometimes doesn't even respond. Took 2 days to respond to emails and homework sometimes is due within 2 days so he doesn't even help with the homework. Usually late to class. Exams are based on the homework and literally anything that was in the textbook. He gets off topic very easily and often.,0
"I loved Prof. Rockefeller! Lectures were so so, but exams were very easy and he's such a nice, personable guy. Definitely kept me interested in Anthropology. Reading is a must, most of the exam questions come from reading, and lecture participation is a must. Overall would definitely recommend!",1
"Dr. Schell is such a sweet and caring professor. He can be a little old-fashioned, but his decades of clinical experience are a huge plus. Incredible real-life stories and engaging lectures. Tests are easy if you pay attention in lecture and read the (free!) textbook.",1
He was fantastic!! He made the class very interesting to attend and always tried to add humor to the class.,1
"Nope, no way would I ever take her class again.  Disorganized - had to remind her to give us two or three assignments - can be friendly but is not very responsive to emails.  Teaches online as well as in person.  Online class awful.  Transfered out!",0
"Took this course during session B of M20. The lectures were quite boring, but the class itself is easy. The rubrics and expectations were clearly defined. Gallucci's biggest flaw is that he doesn't usually check zoom so if he's accidentally muted, he'll stay that way until a TA gets ahold of him... which admittedly has happened a few times.",1
It wasn't difficult once you realized you will have to learn most of it on your own. Does not know how to explain things in class. Asking her in office hours is nearly as bad. I recommend asking other professors for help.,0
"This ""professor"" is a joke. I can't believe they let this guy teach French. I feel like he coudn't get a job in England so he is here! He needs to give it up and go back to England!",0
"Honestly studied for this class harder than I have for any other class and my grade does not reflect that. Worst professor and worst person in general. His entire class is taught by pictures on a slide show, it was SO difficult to learn that way for me. Most of my studying for this class consisted of trying to figure out what we even learned.",0
"The required textbook is a good study guide but doesn't fully teach the material. Read and learn from Practical Electronics... instead to understand the material. Nice guy, good at explaining things, and knows a lot about the subject but fairly disorganized. Was an hour late to the final exam. Exams are difficult. LOTS of homework problems.",0
"Ant2 was just not that interesting. Also, Dr. Sawyer was teaching her opionion on most of the issues, which led me to question the credibility of the information. Tasks: ""read"" 3 books, 2 essay exams, mult. chioce final, one paper",0
Best professor ever.,1
"great guy, if you sit in the front row",1
"I took Professor Trapp for math 345 and it was a hard class but he got me through it. I struggled with the material and he gave notes on all of my homework, quizzes, and tests on how I could improve. He does his best to get you to pass while still learning the material. Hes funny and cool to talk to while still giving great lectures.",1
"Mechem has one way of interpreting the texts -- and if you don't agree with her, she marks you down.  If you like sucking up to professors, take this class...she'll love you.",0
"One of the most mind-opening classes I've taken. Definitely shaped and challenged my worldview. I think everyone at Calvin should take this class in order to learn more about the world around them, including different cultures and beliefs. He is a great prof and has a lot of experience.",1
"If you're decent in working with Microsoft Excel, you should pass this class easily. Go to all classes even though attendance is not mandatory. Follow along with all the in-class excel examples, and save them to review later for exams. You will pass this class by putting in almost no effort at all. Gives quizzes, but they count only as extra credit",1
"I was disappointed how much English was used in this class. If you're looking to improve your Spanish, consider taking another professor. That being said, I did learn a lot about Spanish lit and could tell that Professor Rapin is passionate about this subject and is very enthusiastic. Tests were easy but his grading was unfair at times. ",0
"Two things wrong.  1) Her lectures are confusing. They are not well connected and the slides are not made available to students. 2) She is very rude. She asks questions of students in class and then cuts off their answers. She occasionally commands students to stand up and move about the classroom, as if to show she is in charge.",0
The meanest professor I have ever encountered at UW. Never put her feet into students' shoes!!! Switched out of her section after she mocked at me because I got one clicker question wrong!!!,0
"I THINK I""M IN LOVE!",1
To be honest I was terrified to take Math 170 - Especially since I haven't had math in a while. Professor Lars spent time with us on weekends to help students that felt like they needed additional help outside of class. He's such a great and caring professor. I wish he taught every since math class I needed. I have learned a lot from him.,1
"Fischer over explains every obvious detail to the point that class becomes painful. The entire 1h 15m class is often spent on only one or two slides. Don't ask any questions, he won't listen to you and will instead try to reexplain something unrelated. If you have previous knowledge of the subject then the tests are a breeze. Would not recommend.",0
Okay let's begin. 1. She uploads the notes (if you're lucky... up to a week after they were covered in class) but without the pictures which she tests you on. 2. Not one soul on the planet can memorize every archaeological site in the world to put it on a map! 3. can't hear you! 4. memorize ALL of your notes for exams or you're screwed!!!!,0
"This course has taught me a lot & I'm so happy that I took it. However, the professors made the course almost unbearable. A combination of their confusing grading and plain rude behavior made me want to drop. I myself and other students have burst into tears mid lecture because of Abbey's disrespect. The course was a lot of work, but worth it.",0
"He is disorganized the lecture time. Also, He is not finish the class on time. Its so hard to understand what he said and explain. And what he said, it makes me confused again. Its really hard to have a good mark with his teaching skills.",0
"Dr. Holmes was the BEST professor I had at HCC! I had him for Human Anatomy and Physiology, and although the class and material are difficult, he made it fun and entertaining with ""Llama  Time"" every day during lecture. Definitely tries to relate all of the information we are learning to everyday things. I highly recommend taking classes with him.",1
"Professor Ruse was an excellent teacher and welcoming to students during his office hours. Being chair of the philosophy department, he is very knowledgable. His class is difficult, requiring memorization and application of theories and the tests are challenging. Do not take his 101 if you are not willing to work hard for your grade.",1
Class was easy. There were lots of homework and there are weekly quizzes. He does go over the same thing a lot of the time which sets back during lecture.,1
"Ok, not the most amazing conducting ive seen, but i was spoiled at my previous college. I dont think she spends enough time with concert and i think she does play faves sometimes...but who doesnt. I like her, and am interested to see how my years at CMU play out",1
she's the worst. gives so many assignments and isn't flexible on due dates at all. midterms are far harder than anything we did in class or in the textbook. she really doesn't care about student's well being at all,0
Getting an A in his class is simply impossible. His grading is ruthless and much of it is based on what he finds to be good writing style. Cant give notes for his life.,0
This guy is one of the best teachers ever! Enough said. And his enthusiasm is inspiring!,1
"Matlack is VERY passionate about forests; it's obvious through lecture. He makes boring topics interesting. He is a tough grader. You have to go to lecture or you won't understand. Study guide DOES NOT go along with the test. You have to write down what he says along with what he writes on the board. This is my worst grade, but I do respect him.",1
"Lectures are usually not worth attending.  Exams go way beyond anything covered in the class, he expects you to teach yourself.  Daniel can often come across as condescending and open to only his own opinions.  Did not adequately prepare us for group project; clear explanations were only given well into the work period.",0
WORST professor Ive taken! Never responds back to the email! And doesnt update the grades. Its a waste of money to take this class. I assure you there are better professors than him!,0
A really nice and friendly person who will always help you out if you ask her.,1
"Stay far away from this course. Journals are tough to understand and the course is based off of them. She is really bad with giving back marks so you won't know where you stand until final grades come out. Also, she is the worst lecturer I had in uni",0
"Absolutely worst prof ever, notes are unclear, only a few assignment questions which are not nearly enough, questions on the midterm and final has nothing to do with the assignment questions.",0
"Great prof, extremely knowledgeable about sales. Fun class, study terms in book and power point and you will do fine. Def take him for MKT 356!",1
Whatever you do don't take this professor! If there are any other professors for IST 230 take them and not Wang. He reads off slides and hopes everyone understands but they don't. Everyone is failing currently except a couple students,0
I ran all around london with this guy. he knows everyone and everyplace. it was great. a lifetime trip in only 10 days. i gotta go on another study trip with this dude.,1
BEST FIS TEACHER OUT THERE!!!!!! Extremely knowledgeable and awesome. Very funny and is clear on what he expects. Very easy going and respectable.,1
Professor Henao was an amazing professor. My first semester of Spanish my teacher never gave us exams or homework really but then took this for SPN1120 and it was very different. She gives exams but they are easy if you do the study guide. Also there's a lot of online homework but you can finish in 5 minutes. She's very sweet and cares about grade,1
"His note outlines are the best I have ever seen and extremely useful for both note taking and studying. He records lectures so if you are unable to make it you will be able to watch or rewatch the class. He ties all the material together very well and presents it in an interesting way. There is no curve, but the lowest of 4 test grades is dropped.",1
"She is the worst professor i had in my life the worst in UBC so far. Unorganized the explanations are totally unclear. The grading criteria and feedback on midterms is confuse as hell. The tests are not abou the lecture. My course is Algae, fungi and bryophites the finals were about Corey Bradshaw's presentation that, and about the whole eukaryote",0
No exams. Just labs. Great professor with lectures and powerpoints available. Get the notes and you'll be set for this class. I was able to work at a faster pace because he posts the whole semester from the start. Freeman even opened up all the modules at the end of the course to make sure you can get everything complete! Awesome teacher.,1
"One of the best professors at Holy Cross hands down. Gives great lectures and truly cares about what he teaches and his students. The class itself is interesting and comfortable. His office hours are extremely helpful. Overall, I recommend that if anyone has the opportunity to take a class by Kee, do it!!",1
"Honestly really awful professor. Doesn't care about his students, no participation from students because his class is so dry and boring. He's very rude and opinionated. Never stays on topic of class and class was NOT what I signed up for. Easy exams. Don't do projects.",0
His class is useless. talk about things he enjoys talking about not what students need to know. One of the worse prof I had.,0
"You need to read a lot by yourself. His grading most on lecture quizzes, but just be careful. And lab quizzes are not hard.",0
"Dr. Deegan's class was the most intense and stressful class I have ever taken. Everything is done online which is great . All exams and quizzes are open book and open notes. Quizzes are based off of the book and the midterms and final are based on lecture. Go to class, ask questions! He curves grades at the end, fantabulous! ",0
"Lectures were great but come to exam time you better be ready for any type of curve ball. Exams were missing questions, there weren't enough exam packets for everyone (etc.) If you're someone who needs to study off a review sheet THIS COURSE IS NOT FOR YOU. And IF she posted the review it was not until the day of.",0
This class helps to teach an individual to understand world music better to a person who has no knowledge of other cultural music like me. This class helped me to know more about other genres in the world.,1
"This man is a complete moron.  He explained nothing to the class in terms of what he wanted from our blog entries.  People asked him for feedback multiple times in class and his response was ""If I haven't emailed you about it, you're doing fine"". No one ever received feedback. Everyone got a 95% on the midterm. He is a joke. He grades at randomtime",0
"Dr. Mitchell was very loud, funny, and outspoken (can be seen as rude). No homework, 4 exams, and 10 labs. Labs are worth 200 points, since he drops the 2 lowest. Do labs for an easy 200 points. First two exams are very hard, which weeds many students out. Stick to the final 2 and they get much easier. Drops lowest exam. Hard but passable class.",0
"Dr. Quinn is the best teacher I've had at TCU. The only advice would be to attend his classes, though sometimes not interesting, everything you need to note he writes on the board himself to stress. If you miss classes it is difficult to catch up but not impossible, I missed 3 classes before one unit test and got a C+, go and its an effortless B.",1
He's the best professor!  I was a speech major but he made me love audiology.,1
"This man is creepy as all get out. He pulled out his camera phone and took pictures of all the students, individually. He wears the worst sweatervests ever. He has this doppey-ass look on his face whenever he's thinking of an answer to make up. AVOID AT ALL COST!!! Especially if you have suicidal thoughts, cause they will become suicidal actions...",0
"I enjoyed the lectures and the prof's sense of humor.  Sometimes I thought lectures were a bit too easy for an advanced course, but overall the pace of the course was good.  I would have liked more homework so I could have more feedback on my understanding of the material.  The professor also thinks EVERY topic in the course is easy.",1
"has tricky true/false Q, talks too fast, but funny and interesting",0
"Reading isn't necessary, so you really don't have to put much work into this class for the first half of the semester. However, after that, you have two big research assignments. Requirements are excessive for an elective course and while she is clear about her expectations, they are very high and she will take off points. Follow rubrics closely",0
great person and helpful...take her,1
Public Health: Class is fun. Article review and quiz every week.  Midterm and Final are take home essay questions.  Attendance is mandatory.  Fun Class. Great teacher.,1
"Dr. Kowallis is wonderful. He wants each of his students to succeed. The nature of PHYS100 meant a lot of work, a lot of content, and a lot of tests. But, as far as Dr. Kowallis goes, he was very willing to help us as best he could. For the class, I would suggest going to the TA lab.",1
"she requires many books that you have to order online because some are not available in book stores. Although i highly recommend to not buy all books she does not even use them, also her syllabus was not clear on her grading, i got a 74 and she gave me a D which dropped my GPA by a lot unfortunately. I thought as all professors a D was 69 or 70",0
amazing woman. she truly loves english and teaching. love love love,1
"Many people in my class did not like Professor Purinton but I am not sure why. She is super smart and will 100% help you will anything if you go into see her. Her tests at the beginning are not hard if you study. As far as the simulation goes, I had a good experience due to my good group. Not sure how I would have felt if we lost the game though. ",1
"His material is straight forward. He is very blunt in emails but not in a disrespectful way. He also grades at a super speed. If you put in the work and have basic reasoning skills, he is good for GEO 1050.",1
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED do not let her be your 1st choice. She is a kind teacher &loves math but she is higly confusing&wants you to spell out each word&number if your problem is 2+24 she wants you to explain why and how do you know for a fact that  4. Makes everything more confusing than what it needs 2b. Group projects? what are we in highschool?,0
"Course is interesting, and helpful in looking for environmental jobs, but prof is terrible! Very boring, always goes off on tangents and covers very little material. LAB IS TRULY TERRIBLE!!! Reports are very long with poor instruction and birng down mark significantly!",0
Good teacher who will help you out when ever you need it. puts all lecture notes online so all you have to do is come to class and fill in the blanks.,1
"This class drove me NUTS! He teaches so slow, and goes over so manny things that you should've learned years ago that I couldn't hardly stand sitting through class. He also wrote down the problems on the board wrong more than he got them right. We had to show him how to solve the problems most of the time. Mostly we students had to teach eachother.",0
"Prof Idziak is the nicest professor ever!! Go to him for help during office hours, he'll try his best to make you understand/get the answer instead of giving it to you. His examples are really helpful so make sure you follow how he does them in class! I got a really good mark thanks to his in class examples and help during office hours.",1
"OK Guy, but could make the class more interesting",1
Honestly i really don't know the point of this class but its a fairly easy class. She's a nice lady and willing to help. There is an attendence policy. There is a group project. Individual project. Mid-term and Final. plus few homeworks. Take the class if you want.,1
He responds to emails promptly and gives several chances at end of semester to turn in homework or redo some homework. He is homework heavy though. He gives pretests and those are exactly like the tests. Both are easy. Very understanding on turning stuff in and redoing it to get a better grade.,1
Nice guy but hardest class I have ever had to take. DO NOT take this class. Exams are impossible to study for (over 21 chapters) and he is not clear on what he expects from students.,0
"An extremely intelligent woman. However, very unorganzied and boring. Lectures are hard to follow because she jumps all over the place etc.... Dont like how she negotiates with  the students. To me, a teacher makes the decisions, she likes to appeal to the class. I did fine in the class but struggled with believing when we were really going to have",0
"Professor Cupples is a very good First Aid  instructor. Dislikes speaking as much as the students dislike listening. Class is very hands-on, scenario based. Practiced the procedures repeatedly which made remembering them easy. Skills tests were easy, and if you know the procedure you will pass.   **Expect to perform in front of people.",1
"Never seen students so quiet in the class.He is only interested in listening to those he thinks good students.Although he wants you to make contribution to the class as he said,he never believe you can do that in his mind. And the stupid questions in his exam!!!!!!",0
"Funny guy, easy marker, don't know how he gets away with keeping the class average so high.",1
"Professor Choi, (NOW BAEK, because of marriage), amazing professor, lectures are so clear, no-book, very, very clear notes, relates the subject to real life situations. Homework is assigned, but you get the solutions, so take very good notes! they're tests and a final exam, kinda forgot whether we had a midterm or not but I don't recall taking one",1
The midterm was impossible. All questions were short answer or long essay. It had 2 take home essays that needed to be done prior to the test. It included the most minute question about the littlest detail on some power point slide somewhere on her website which is a link from blackboard. Exhausted just reading that? Don't take her.,0
I wish I had Zakar for all my classes. He was so nice and actually cared about his students outside of just school stuff. He is by far the most genuine professor I have had both at community college and SU.,1
"He is so incredibly boring to listen to for an hour and a half. Talks about nothing mostly. It sucks because the subject itself I find very interesting, his classes are just so incredibly boring.",0
"She assigns the best readings that will change your world, is so helpful and easy to talk to, has such brilliant insights about literature, critical race theory and everything in between. Take a small class with her if possible to get as much out of it! One of the most inspiring classes I have taken at Wes.",1
"This teacher is horrible! He has a heavy japanese accent.  He does not use the book, he makes you read these lecture notes he posted himself. These notes are vague and hard to understand. It's like for people that already understand logic based math. No hw. 4 exams; all of them 5 questions each but they are extremely hard. Do not take his class!",0
She cares about the content but at the same time is very self indulged. Spends most lectures talking about herself and often has trouble getting materials posted in time. I have no doubts that in person she would be a great prof but would advise others to avoid her online classes.,0
"DON'T BUY THE TEXTBOOK, and DO THE HOMEWORK! I know the answers are online but it really helps to understand the material. Lectures are boring and you're on your own. Quizzes and final exams are terribly formatted (25 MC, -5 for each wrong), but with the curve you can definitely get an A.",0
"He's one of my favorite professors I've had so far. He's so funny and his class is the easiest GPA booster I've every taken. I highly recommend you have him as a professor. He's blunt, but he makes you think about your answer and makes you explain your answer. He's not afraid to play both sides of an argument so be prepared to defend your answer.",1
Don't confuse 'funny' with 'good'. I sure didn't.,0
He uses a work book that has very poor explanations and he just expects us to learn from that. He rarely explains things to the class or actually teaches. He just has use go into our own little groups and do something we don't understand. His class is a mess. We don't know what we are doing or why. he randomly stops talking for several minutes.,0
waste of time,0
WARNING: DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU WISH TO PASS. i ignored all the comments and regret it. he basically sits and talks nonstop goes of topic which makes it hard to decide what should go in your notes. there are only 2 very hard test and a final. studying from the book is useless and trying to write down everything motor mouth says is impossible,0
Very unclear and does not give direct instructions for what she is expecting. She is a hard grader and does not help you understand the subject matter. Instead if preparing you for papers she assumes you know what she wants. Would not take her again.,0
"Least helpful professor i have ever had to deal with. Serious manner issues. Dont bother showing up 5 min late, he locks the door. Whole class is scared to ask/answer a question, because he will ridicule you if not up to his standards. Does not give fair warnings about tests, never reviews for tests.",0
Going to his class is a dread every day. You can't pay attention to him talking for more than 5 minutes because he just rambles about the same thing. He talks really quiet and is not there to help his students at all. When I asked him for help he wouldn't help me. Don't take this class!!,0
She is very nice but there is a lot of material for the class and generally we do not go over much of it.  The Cultural Anthropology is never specifically talked about in class but is a must read.  Be careful if you don't read you will have a hard time catching up.  She doesn't really get much accomplished in class as I think she would like.,0
"Took Cs1101 with her. Most of the lectures are online so you are not required to go to class except on quiz days (depends on whether you take the class in A or C term. If you take in A term, quizzes are everyday but for C term its only Thursday). Her tests are relatively easy. She also gives bonus points if you work with a partner",1
Nina is a wonderful person and has a deep passion for music. But I hated this class because we sang the same 4 songs all semester. It's also 5 days a week and 1 credit hour.,1
"He is decently personable, but an absolutely horrid Professor. If you dont tell him exactly what he wants to hear (where hes a very lenient grader), be prepared to have your grade docked significantly unless you have what essentially amounts to a court case of evidence to back it. A tried and true Neoliberal boomer.",0
"RUN. I had a 4.0 before this class. She does not/will not teach the material. It's entirely up to your ability to read the text book and pray to god you understand it well enough to answer her incredibly specific, confusing quiz/exam questions. Didn't even get a zoom lecture until weeks into the course. Horrible, horrible, horrible. Do not take!!",0
"Every week you have a quiz based on the textbook, but you can do it over and over until you get 100% sometimes there are assignments every week as well, which is only 10 questions, and they are all fill in the blanks from the textbook so super easy! Exam is worth 47% of your grade so be prepared. i loved having her as a prof, definitely an easy A!",1
"Great Professor, So sweet. Really cares about the world, and the humans in it. Lots of reading: 3 readings a week & DB due for each reading. She is very accommodating. If u need extra time, just email her. She wants everyone to succeed. Easy going. Easy work, just very time consuming. Open discussions during class.",1
Gives the easiest simplest lectures ever and if you don't understand she will work with you. She was just wonderful and I definitely recommend her! All homework is on aleks and you have an entire week to complete every assignment. Reviews test and what's on the review is on the test. Easy class easy pass!,1
I took her for studies in Epidemiology and she was great. She is new professor but seems to know everything about the topic. She will take time during class to make sure everyone understands all concepts and will make extra homework and study guides to help. She does require a 5 page epidemiology brief. Overall a great professor,1
"I always have trouble keeping my eyes open in her Behind the Headlines class. Interesting topic material, she's very knowledgable, but way too much WORK!",1
Do not even take ITEC 3220 with her. It is worst nightmare.,0
Has no business teaching! Very unorganized and wants his students to fail because he refuses to answer questions or emails. Spends all class ranting I haven't learnt anything this term. Worst professor at Glendon. Also arrogant and has serious women issues.,0
"Really good professor. Interesting and engaging class filled with debates, discussions, and she really cares about students input. You have to really work hard on those essays though. I wish she taught a higher level of english",1
"This is the best professor at CLC. If he was a Harry Potter Character, he would be Professor Albus Dubledore. He is part of the trifecta at CLC; Gonder, Tenuto, and Smith. The education you receive from those 3 will change your life.",1
"Very unprofessional and inappropriate at times.  Extremely laid back. Although, her adult lecture class is fairly easy. However, not a good instructor to learn from or gain experience with.",0
Guy does not teach at all. Simply assigns homework problems and gives out pop quizzes almost every class that are based on the homework problems.  Tests are extremely difficult and without reading the textbook and teaching yourself the entire course you will fail. Do not take if you want a good gpa. Attendance only necessary bc of the quizzes.,0
"If you work ahead and ask Professor Kolluru questions as they come up, this class will be an easy A. She's super caring and will work with you even though it's an online class.",1
"Graduating senior, headed to med school - 3.85 GPA, Chem/Bio. always went to class, homework, attendance. Midterm grade was D. Rogers claimed I hadnt turned work in. Showed her proof. Went to Dean with same proof who fixed problem. Wound up with a C - only C I ever made, including med school. Vindictive professor.",0
Hardest exams in the first three years of civil engineering for sure. They are not relevant to the course material whatsoever. Pierce is far better from what I have heard. I don't ever do these things but he was that bad.,0
I had him and he is very aggressive when it comes to the students; he uses his power to destroy the student.,0
Lectures are boring and he barely replies to emails.,0
"She teaches way to fast, assuming you already know how to work the problems.  Spends less time on diffucult problems than easy ones.  Harsh on grading tests.  There is way to much work, unless you are taking only one other class and don't have a job.  Do not take this class if you plan on learning anything!",0
Horrible teacher she doesn't explain at all she expects you to know everything she give a lot of homework and she grades super hard DONT TAKE HER CLASS!!!!!,0
Owen RULEZ!!!!!!FROM THE 2 B'S,1
"Janson is a good professor. Overall the class is engaging. The only issue I have is that the field trip papers (2) and Midterm Conference are mandatory and won't count to your grade at all. The tests aren't super difficult but the method he uses for them goes by suuuuuper slow. It was a good class, I learned a lot, and I'd take him again.",1
"Tests can be heavy, but if you've studied the material appropriately you'll do very well. An amazing lecturer and talks with passion. Don't get fooled by the wording!",1
Gets back to you at the last second if you missed something. Gives a zero if you do not meet the required grade by .2 points. .2 points. Conference calls only to talk down and put down like a child. Pick another professor if you want peace of mind. Excel is easy but Im failing because of her harsh grading system. Working my butt off to get 60%.,0
"No doubt Allen is one of the most caring professors I have had. He has been incredibly accommodating in the midst of the pandemic and is very accessible. He applies what he teaches in his own classroom and very clearly knows what he is talking about. The class is challenging but no absurdly difficult. Do yourself a favor, take this class!",1
"If youre a person who is not good at test-taking, his class would be very difficult. Very disorganized and has a lot of typos on his quizzes. His class is only graded by 6 quizzes and 2 midterms. In order to pass this class, you should read both the textbook and watch his lectures.",0
"If you didn't like this guy then I probably was not friends with you cuz you were lame! Great teacher who takes emphasis off grading and stresses learning the material. Isn't that what school is for, not getting A's or B's that mean nothing to me now.",1
"Very organized in an online format. Light work and an easy grader but make sure you study for her exams. She gives you plenty of time to do the assignments asked. I wish she would have gotten to know her students better, though.",1
"She is super nice and sweet. I was sick and missed two tests, and she took 50 percent off. Still got a C. Very easy, just pay attention and come to class. For the projects just about everyone got 100s. ",1
"I actually took Dr. Sidebotham's class in the 1990s.  I've never worked so hard for a D+, but it was STILL the most interesting class I've EVER taken. I agree he is difficult, but if this is what you're interested in, this guy is the one to take the classes with. After further education on my part, I have a very serious appreciation for his talent.",1
HHHHARD EXAM,0
"Difficulty in class is due to material, NOT professor. During Midterm week we had 5 exams, the last Friday was capitalized by a Quiz none of us had prepared for. You could feel the mood of the room and asked if he could move the quiz. We were fried and he knew it. We reviewed the topic and he moved the quiz. I will always respect him for this.",1
Most of the content he teaches is not found on the exams. He goes off topic constantly and likes to call people on the spot. He makes students answer their own questions and doesn't like you if you don't laugh at his jokes.,0
Hands down the single best professor at MSU! Made the subject matter extremely interesting. Smartest person you'll ever meet too.,1
"Neill is one of the worst Psychology professors here. He tries so hard to get through a certain amount of slides per class. He goes really fast, he does not ask if any one has questions, and if you try to raise your hand and stop him to either ask him to repeat or slow down, he continues going on and then blame it on him being deaf. Don't take him!",0
The best professor ever!!! Very helpful!!! You learn a lot!!!,1
"She is amazing. Her class is lecture heavy and there is a lot of material to cover for each test, but if you take good notes and pay attention to the lectures she will more than prepare you for her test.",1
Connie is a wonderful person and a fabulous teacher. I can't say enough about her!,1
"Admits not being the best teacher for mechatronics, but its an easy course, so isn't too big a negative. I found him very approachable if I had questions. If your pretty good at doing things on your own (the basis for this class) go ahead and take him.",1
"I don't understand most of these negative reviews. He is probably one of the best math teachers I have ever had. He breaks down the information well and makes it easy to understand. I honestly think that if all math teachers taught math like him, more people would be better at math.",1
"Lots of people seemed to like him, but he wasn't my favorite. Good guy and all, but sometimes he just went on tangents for the whole class and I never felt like I was getting anything done/doing something worth my tuition money. I eventually dropped the class.",0
"Am I taking crazy pills?  This guy is bad.  Unfair harsh grader, litte-no feedback on hw, impossible take home exam.  knows his stuff and nice guy, but bad proff",1
"Great prof! He really explains the course content well and he does a demonstration almost every class. If you have trouble with the course, just go to his office. He's really nice. Midterms were super easy, but exam was a little tricky (still easy). I thiiiink there was a slight bell curve, but not sure. Ended up with a great mark (better than 111)",1
"I've Taken 3 classes with Grace, I didn't pass the first because I didn't feel like learning and I took English 1A with her again and I took English 5 with her. She is helpful, she always reply to her emails. Just give her the chance to teach you I promise you you'll learn from her. She doesn't like to see her students fail.",1
"-Great, entertaining lectures -very caring -professor brings scantrons for his class",1
"Trevor is an amazing professor! I think majority of the bad reviews probably come from the student who never showed up to lecture or did the readings. That being said he is definitely cheeky, but his humour is rather entertaining in my opinion. Do the work and you'll love the class (and learn a lot about writing).",1
"Very laid back, but muddled lectures. Hard to understand in most cases. Class notes and additional clarification of projects are not her greatest strength, even when pressed for details.",0
"He always tells pointless stories and thinks he is absolutely hilarious.  Very boring class, just powerpoint based. Little interest in communications after taking this class. Avoid if possible",0
"I was previously obsessed with Anthropology and took this class as a refresher. Unfortunately, Sullivan caused me to stray away from it from further on. Although he is a charming and interesting person, he is an extremely disorganized professor. Very unclear. Very off-topic. I would not recommend him as a teacher. Chat with him for fun",0
He is very clear about what he wants. Allows rewrites on papers. Willing to help all students that put in the effort,1
"Professor Lieberman is one of the best econ professors at NYU. You can tell he really cares about his students and has been accommodating during the pandemic. He pre-records his lectures so you never have lecture live, but there are weekly quizzes based on tiny details in his lectures so you have to watch them. Exams are kind of hard but okay.",1
Overstated by simple minds,0
"THESE REVIEWS ARE CRAZY! He is so nice and very helpful! I have a hybrid class(which is not meant for everyone) so you have to study on your own time for the most part. All you have to do is try and this class won't be hard. Only 2 quizzes and an oral final. Also, online homework each week. Easy A if you participate and do your homework. ",1
I would not recommend him at any cost. Do WHATEVER you can to get out of his class. The exams were extremely detail oriented and the lectures were hard to follow. He's a nice guy but he is ineffectual when teaching. You have to take your own notes completely and the tests are all written. Crams material quickly and never revisits it.,0
She is one of my favorite profs so far. If you can get a class with her take it!,1
"Nichols may be a goofy bald man, but between the giggles and the chin rubbing, this might have been the most i've learned in any class.  interesting stuff too.",1
Damm's da man!,1
MY FAVORITE TEACHER Always so helpful and she turned a subject that absolutely bored me into my favorite class of the semester. It's a lot of homework and classwork but she's very fair with tests and as long as you keep up with your work its an easy A.,1
"The prof is great and I loved the course! Easy to take notes in class. However, I suggest picking a good TA because some can be tough when it comes to marking!",1
"Had yongo 3 times.  If i could take yongo again, I would.",1
"If there is a perfect model a Math Professor, that is Br. Goodwin. If you have a chance to be his student, please go ahead. He is amazing, kind, understanding and makes the class interactive and not boring. I would take all my math classes with him if it was possible. He makes the most complicated thing seems simple and possible.",1
"His lectures were based on the book but he also did many problems from outside sources that were relevant to the lecture. I had to put in a lot of work as the class was mostly proof writing and I had never done proofs before. On the plus side, he is a very easy grader. There were times I got problems wrong and he would take off maybe a point.",1
"i never write any posts on ANY teacher but this teacher has been an absolute nightmare to take. Her ""teaching"" is literally just playing videos and movies during class and reading multiple chapters of the textbook that you are suppose to know every little detail of it. She literally says your wrong if you state facts from the txtbook RUDEST teacher",0
"She was nice, however, her lectures were very boring. The class was super easy, but I was bored the entire time. She had a few tests and also made you come into her office with a group in order to do a verbal test.",0
Pretty much the best. She is surely a love or hate professor though. Her classes are interesting though mostly lecture. She is interesting to listen to and easy to understand. Just do the readings and youll do fine,1
"good professor, interesting lectures and teaching style",1
"I don't need a lot words, only a few. Enjoyed this class, loved the lectures, very supportive. If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't hesitate to do so.",1
He was funny but the tests were really hard. I would take again. MUST read the textbook. Must attend class to do good on weekly quiz. Must do enrichment credits.,1
"Everything you learned in high school about math just shatters because she teaches everything so clearly and without the heavy use of a calculator.  Everything is easy to understand, and she's always open to questions.  MyMathLab is the easiest thing to get an A on, and she gives extra credit.  You can get a 110% for homework as long as you do it.",1
Very difficult class with poor instruction. Had heard he was a great teacher so maybe the class being online threw him off his game. Would record all classes so you can re-watch them later except the test review lectures. Like what. Glad this one is over with cause that was brutal.,0
I love Brother Baugh. You can tell he is super passionate about what he teaches. The tests are very specific and rely heavily on specific things said during lecture.,1
Dr. Mart is one of the most passionate professors I had at my time at Berks. She is knowledgeable and willing to help you if you reach out. This is a 400 level course and she expects you to do the readings. Class time is based on discussions and the grades on analytical papers. Do the readings and take the course work seriously and you will do fine,1
"She was not helpful, unrealistic with the amount of work she assigns and very rude. I have never been treated so disrespectfully by a teacher ever in my life.I will never take another class with her after been treated so badly. She is a hypocrite who says teachers should help all students but she only helps students she favors. Avoid taking her.",0
4th year studio.  only one review for entire semester!  he was not very helpful and changed his mind about your design.,0
"A kind, knowledgeable, phenomenal teacher.  I would recommend any of his classes. He is hilarious, engaging, and intelligent.  This class was so far from my major, and yet I enjoyed class everyday.  Study, its astronomy.  But Looney is fantastic.",1
I am paying for an education but not getting anything but a grade. If you show up you get a good grade but you don't learn anything unless you teach yourself from the textbook. Useless,0
"I found he was condescending and I felt nervous to answer questions in case I was wrong. He will call on you during class to answer questions which makes sure you are always ready. Overall, I did not like going to his class but I did fairly well in the course. And, after starting a new French class with a dif prof, realized maybe he wasnt so bad..",0
"Marchetti's ""flipped classroom"" is the worst. She doesn't teach, and you're graded on the precision of your labs. Aweful class. Avoid at all costs.",0
"Arnason is 1 of my fav profs ever & I've had ~ 35 of them. He's easy but it's more than that. He's so brilliant yet his material isn't overwhelming. I love bio, but hated plants. Now I'm actually interested in their apps in life. He's understanding except when you ask for undeserved marks. The lab is ridiculously hard, however he makes up for that",1
"Dr. Horn is extremely knowledgeable in history and is a good teacher, but this has made him very arrogant. He regularly insults the class without appearing to notice it. His lectures are good, but they are very fast paced so it is best to use a laptop to take notes in his class. He is also a hard marker and his handwriting is incomprehensible.",1
"Gino is a really hard grader. He does not give good feedback and though he is funny a real drawback is the grades. If he wasnt so irresponsible and unhelpful with grading then hed be a great professor, my favorite even. Cmon Gino quit it",0
"LOVED her!! She is the sweetest lady. I only took her for BIO lab 118 (for bio 112) but I loved every minute of it. I always found BIO to be so hard, but she made it fun and understandable. I was so sad to see that she wasn't teaching lab for 113! Take her if you can, she is super helpful and an overall good teacher.",1
"Very nice person, helpful, and funny. Easy grader, especially during the summer session.",1
"Taking this class during Covid may be extremely different from non-Covid days, but be prepared to get a tutor or read the textbook several times before class and do practice questions over and over before tests in order to understand the class. Studying for the class is more involved than other accounting classes I have taken.",0
"Khyati is passionate about the subject that she teaches, and is caring of her students. She keeps order in the class, will not tolerate people who disturb her lectures, and only tests what she teaches. The material was challenging, but if you take good notes and study, you will end up with a good mark.",1
Great Teacher!  He made me really love and understand biology more  It was a blessing that I took him instead of other bio teachers!,1
"SHAHRIAR (Shawn) is the best Java professor in Algonquin College. He is very enthusiastic and passionate about his subject. He is doing his best in teaching every student who came there to learn. He gives helpful, detailed explanations of Java, and always available if you ask for help. He is striving to make his classes interesting for students.",1
"Probably one of the most unreasonable professors I've ever had.  The material is not terribly difficult but her tests are an awful representation of how well you know the material. Many of the conceptual questions can be though in two ways and since the tests are taken in Ashby lab, she is not there to clarify.  Always cancels office hours too.",0
Best professor ever! So glad I took his course. Not a GEOS major and I did just fine. I would take him again if I was not graduating in April. Super helpful when needed. He's very nice!,1
"Professor Saudino is, by far, the worst professor I've ever had. Seek an alternative class. Her style is awful, her tests are ridiculous with material being taken from oddly specific examples, and her lectures are so very boring. I'm so glad this semester is almost over and I hope I at the very least get a C-. If you do end up in ps241, don't skip.",0
"The exams can be tough given half of it is recall with pictures asking you to name a feature. He always has review sessions before the exam so take full advantage because he gives you a road map of the exam. Show up, do all the extra credit, and turn in your maps early. They take time so don't procrastinate on them. Dane is a very nice man!",1
"Despite online office hours, save yourself a lot of time and go to the lectures. If you're trying to cram for a test with just watching OOH, then you're going to feel overwhelmed and stressed, so just go to class and learn the material then and use online office hours as review for yourself (OOH don't come out until a few days before the test!)",1
Your grade really depends on your TA. Each TA I had each quarter varied A LOT. But the most annoying thing was the fact that Petra would sometimes change the GRADING RUBRIC and wouldn't say anything. I lost a couple of points for not having something on my lab report even though it wasn't mentioned in the version I had downloaded.,0
"Professor Camarena talks about how he's huge on attendance, but he'll make you waste ur gas by missing several classes w/out emailing his students ahead of time. I think everybody takes his class because he's laid-back and isn't strict. You can use a calculator in this class.  HW 25% of ur grade and Quiz/Exams 50%",0
"HE IS THE WORST PROF AT YORK, HE DOESN;T KNOW HOW TO TEACH. HE SHOULDN'T BE TEACHING STATISTICS. ALL STUDENTS IN HIS CLASS WERE COMPLAINING ABOUT HIS TEACHING STYLE AND QUESTIONS ON THE EXAM. THE 70% FINAL EXAM WAS AWFUL.",0
"So bad. Expected us to teach ourselves complex math ideas. When asked to explain a HW problem he didn't even know how to do the problem he had assigned us, and then would do a different problem... He put in the absolute bare minimum he could and tests on the hardest version of problems and then blamed the class when we all failed. DO NOT TAKE!",0
"Clearly knowledgable and passionate about the subject. Personal preference, but I found his prerecorded lectures difficult to sit through as they were 2+ hours each. Textbook helps a lot. Tests were very difficult and really tests your ability to apply teachings rather than regurgitating info. Hardly answers questions properly during exam reviews.",0
"Best prof I've ever had. He marks hard and his exams are tough but he is more than willing to work with students outside of class and is committed to his students. Everything for the exams is on the handouts, you have to put in some effort, but hands down most helpful class I've taken in university and one of the best people I know",1
"Awesome, fun laid back teacher. Made classes fun. Bring him chips!",1
I LOVE HIM. he was the sweetest communications professor. he loves everything he talks about in class and is just all around the best man. His tests are very straight forward. the class is so fun every day and he makes you actually WANT to go to class which is so hard at college. if you have the option you HAVE TO TAKE HIM. you will not regret it.,1
"yeah, we all know about the notorious FB post he made, and I was wary of being in his class too. But I've found he's probably one of the kindest teachers I've had. I'm in CSC131 so it may be a different experience than 171/2, but he seems to genuinely care about his students and explains the material well, too.",1
"She is by far the worst professor I have ever had. Not only is the class super hard to follow, but it makes no sense. Her powerpoints are inconsistent and provide students with the bare minimum for her very subjective quizzes. She is irrational and unreliable. She makes the most offensive comments and is completely unfeeling towards her students.",0
"I took this class online as an elective, she has to be the laziest, least present prof I have ever had on an online course. She assigns approx 10 articles to read, plus several videos to watch for each module then only has 5 slides of her own writing. She marks extremely tough and even if you follow her advice you'll only gain about 5%.",0
DO NOT TAKE GENETICS WITH HAYNIE. WASTE OF YOUR LIFE!!!!!!! Lectures are pointless and tests are ambiguous. You dont learn anything or ever know what youre gonna be tested on. IF CANT TAKE GENETICS WITH MILLITELO...DONT TAKE IT AT ALL,0
"The professor never uploads her slides onto Sakai and doesn't even post your grades up online. Each quiz and exam is packed with too much material to memorize, and the lectures are long and boring.",0
"I took English 2332 with him online which most people expect less work because they cannot go to class either working or no transportation.  He gave 3 assignments everyday which is alright, but his tests were confusing and too little time on the online test.  If you're not a reader do not take it with him.!",0
unknowledgeable. unhelpful.,0
"Worst professor I've ever had, hands down. Arrogant, Ridiculous amount of homework. Avoid her at all costs.",0
"Do not take this professor unless you want to spend 90% of your life focused on her class alone. She is an extremely hard grader ( marking five points off for misplacing an accent mark). She is very critical and tends to play favorites. I love Spanish very much, however after her class I wanted to change my minor.",0
I had Dr. Kepner for GBII. He's a difficult grader on quizzes and tests but if you use his review materials and know your information you'll probably get a B. Getting an A in this class is close to impossible unless you're an absolute genius. Compared to other Biology teachers Dr. Kepner is fairer. Be prepared to study and DON'T skip class!,1
"Great professor, she encouraged the students to consult with her one-on-one and these meetings really helped me.  Our major project was interesting and I enjoyed completing it, while learning a lot too!  If you have a chance to take a class with her, do it, it will be the highlight of your university experience.",1
"One of my favorite professors at MMC. He's a really good guy & his lectures are always interesting. He expects you to participate & voice your opinions in class. If you want an A, you have to work for it. He can be a tough grader on papers, but he's always willing to help you improve as a writer & give you feedback on your drafts. I recommend!!",1
Ugh...,0
"oooh God, can't get any easier",1
Great instructor. Really loves teaching.,1
"Great, passionate teacher who cares about the students grasp of the subject. Not the easiest course, but you won't find a better person to teach it.",1
"Ahmed wasn't a terrible professor. His class lectures were a bit boring and made it hard for me to focus. I would recommend to take someone else if possible, but he truly cares about the success of his students. He can be hard to understand because of his accent and handwriting, but pay attention and study and you'll be fine.",1
"I took this class thinking it would be easy for someone who isn't good at math at all, like me, but that was not the case. This was a tough class! Prof Lee is a nice guy but lectures were extremely boring. HW is optional but helpful, issues a lot of take home quizzes. If u have 100% attendance, he bumps your grade up at the end. Hard work required!",0
"Professor Ray is such a harsh grader for no reason. If you want feedback good luck. The class was converted to online, and he made it 10x worse.",0
"OK Teacher.  Means well.  Gives good overview of Spanish culture and does have passion for language.  Does alot of projection on overhead, but not much sentance structuring in class.  Keep up with class. if you fall behind, your on your own. Final requires a oral exam.... get help on prounciation prior to exam.  It can really hurt your grade if not",1
"this man can not teach, he mumbles to the board. he got a thick accent. you get nothing out of this class, save your time and effort for something useful",0
A good guy. Nothing to complain about. Just go to him for help if you are struggling. Maybe a little slow on grading but nothing to avoid him for.,1
"Love the class. The lectures are clear, and are applicable to real life. Not one of those classes that you poke your eyes out and wonder where you're ever going to use this info. He wants you to write clearly to the point, not giving you a ton of pages to fill with fluff. Take his class. You'll love it.",1
"Great guy. He's actually the one who told me about this site. Wanted me to give him a poor rating because he hadn't gotten my paper back to me. Speaking of..where is my paper, Joe? :) J/K I've enjoyed the classes I've taken with you. I look forward to",1
"Do not take this class. I am in her HIS 154 class right now and the workload is over the top. The HW readings are lengthy and do not correlate with the lectures whatsoever. I spend over half of my HW time on the analyses and get a 60. My GPA is 3.9. Ironically, she won't accept HW with more than 3 mistakes but she makes more grading them. AVOID",0
"Great teacher. Great lady. Going to her class literally makes my day. She is knowledgeable in her field and is very good at sharing that knowledge. I could not recommend her more highly. Not an easy A, but she is kind and fair.",1
"Honestly, Prof West was great. During the pandemic, he was super understanding and was always available for online office hours. To succeed, submit things on time, and ask for feedback on your final essay before you submit. There was only one essay and 5 quizzes + an easy final exam. He's great! But always start emails with ""Dear Professor West""",1
"Professor Abdulkarim Sekta was a great professor! Was very clear to his students of what to expect for tests so as long as you study the information he gives you, you will be fine! Responds back quickly with emails as well. He really cares for his students success.",1
"My goodness. Do yourself a favor, just take it during the school year. Horrible lectures, extremely dry material. Turns an interesting subject into a lullaby. Way too specific on test questions for easy concepts. MUST READ THE BOOK TO PASS. Dwells on unimportant topics. Gets off track easily. HORRIBLE LECTURES. Need i say more? Don't take this guy.",0
"No matter what teacher you have for this class, unless you LOVE computers, will SUCK.  She is very helpful if you go to her office hours, and truly wants you to learn. Make sure you give yourself enough time to finish the pre-labs.  Do ALL practice exams in the workbook.",1
"Very different. No tests. Only four assignments and three papers due the end of the quarter. Do not slack off and wait till the end to do them. Do everything, and it should be a very easy A",1
"I took her class on-line for fall semester. Easy A. It was super easy to pass because all her quiz were questions you can search on line as well her hw assignments.. Of course the book helps as well. And you need to do a ""Direct Question"" weekly which is not bad. It usually topics like how much vitamins are in your food and protein etc.",1
"He is a very good professor, has a lot of knowledge about drugs and their mechanisms in the body. Overall the class is VERY EASY, there's an 8 page research paper on a drug of your choice and a powerpoint presentation. He also gives you the final exam in advance so you know what to expect.",1
"I had Prof Bolduc years ago.  I found his class eye-opening and engaging.  He often switched gears when presenting material if he found audience interest waning.  As a teacher now, I greatly respect this as it is difficult to do and rare to find in teachers.",1
"good professor, missed alot of classes, studied for his tests 2 nights before the exam. Just memorize the ID's..and make sure u have the notes. You can figure out what his essays will be on when u read through ur notes. good teacher...thinks he's really funny...but you will laugh at him.",1
The only qualm about this professor is grades seldom get posted on Canvas. Do the essays and journal and thats 50% of the class. Group project and quiz's are another 35% and the final and talking during class are the last 15% Grade faster PH! :P,1
"I hated symphonic band, dr ryder was not a good teacher and he talked so hard and loud he sprayed spit all over the front row, which I was in. Don't be in band at UT!",0
"Many people on here are saying he's a super easy and amazing prof, but do not take this class if you're expecting a bird course. He writes everything on the board which is easy enough to copy down but the material is EXTREMELY boring and unbearable if you don't have a passion for business or politics.",0
"4 Grades: 2 papers, midterm exam, and final exam. Give study Guide, DO NOT MISS THAT DAY! No attendant however I would not advise missing his class. Will answer any question. Super passionate !",1
"Basile is the kind of prof that reads from the slides & talks mostly about his personal life in lectures. His class is a mess. He doesn't teach, yet tests you on everything. He never answers his emails, his office hours are only 30 minutes long and at inconvenient times. He offers little to no extra credit. Genuinely awful professor and class.",0
"Actually, he is not a nice and patient person to the students if they want to ask him some questions, and his online class is hard if you take in summer. Be ready to spend enough time reading the whole book. Good luck!!!",0
Never available to get help from.  Grades are based off of midterm and final only.  He didn't even know my name!,0
best professor I have had in college so far. he really cares about his students and will really help you understand the concepts.,1
Didn't really enjoy my class with Sheldon. Everyone wants to have him so the classes are huge. He isn't very funny and he curses far too much to be cool anymore. He over explained simple topics while I was puzzled over the more difficult ones. I guess it's worth the experience and you don't have to go to the big lectures very often.,0
"The class was ""Argument and Analysis"" but she made it debate class. She is passionate about her teaching yet is really lazy and unorganized. Two students debate every class period on a topic assigned 24 hours before hand. The tests and quizzes come directly from the textbook. Go to class because each day is an in-class assignment.",0
"This teacher expects you to be  a native speaker, grades extremely hard and assigns a ton of homework and be able to do it in 1 - 3 days. i  talked to her outside of class to figure out if i could improve my grade but all she said i need to have better time management, even when i told her i was doing 15 h/days, it was as if she didn't even care.",0
"As I have only experienced Dr Nejat online, I can only speak to this experience. I find the slides helpful in this course but the teaching style is not for me, instead of helping students through problems he makes them feel incompetent and doesnt help with the learning process. I dont enjoy the constant threats about participation. Not recommend",0
"DO NOT! His lectures are him doing homework from May 2020 in which he DOES NOT use the book at all. There is not actual explanation for anything outside of the problems. Then, when you email him he responds with, ""Believe in yourself."" I have been struggling the entire class.",0
Ron is one of my favourite profs at the University. I know a lot of people who aren't a fan but he is so passionate about teaching and just expects people to put in the effort. He's accessible outside of class time and is always willing to help people improve.,1
"Doc Mac refused to give partial credit on test questions that he, as the professor, worded incorrectly. He is very vague at explaining things and doesn't like to have students correct him or question his lectures. Tests are fairly difficult and very specific on a subject that has no bearing on engineering and is a pre-req for nothing.",0
Rogol is a good professor.  Her lectures are interesting and easy to get through but her tests are tricky and are tougher than they should be but overall she's good.  Attendance is very important,1
stay as far away from her! she dose not know how to teach!!!! when students ask questions she just says every one is right and dose not give a complete right answer.... she dose not know what she is talking about and she forgets everything she dose and says...dont take her class you will regret! she is not helpfull and she is soo baD!,0
"Some people shouldn't be able to be professors. She is a lovely woman, awful prof. Everything is confusing and disorganized. Unclear what she expects and marks very unfair. She doesn't actually teach anything in class, spends 40 minutes talking about issues in the world. Just not a good prof, take someone else.",0
I dislike the way she grades papers. Instead of critiquing ideas and content she counts the number of sentences and spacing and stuff. The ideas and soul of the writing take a backseat to objectively less important things. It's possible to fail a paper for not putting a works cited page on a paper that only obviously cites one source.,0
She is too strict.,0
"The class isn't that bad but it'll put you to sleep. She speaks very slowly about very boring things. There are a ton of quizzes over really boring readings but she's a nice professor, if a bit long winded. ",1
"The homework was extremely hard for an introductory class. We went from hello word in the first week to calculating compound interest on a 10-year car loan by the 4th week. No extra credit, and NO late work at all. The class went from 280 students in the first week to 130 as of now. Seems like a nice guy, but this is a really tough class.",0
He talks way too much before each lab on content with no relation to the work he has you do. This professor also grades very specifically and is not fair/equal on his grading.,0
"Although she can be a bit unorganized and late to class, I truly enjoyed this course. If you take this class for honors, she will try her best to brainstorm ideas with you and find scales for your project.",1
This instructor lack clarity in her instruction. The class was on-line and the instructor seemed more concerned with making things convenient for herself rather then student success. When I would ask for help or clarification she simply offered sarcasm as if she was bothered by the fact that she actually had to teach. What a waste of time!,0
"Hi. Take Dr. C, you wont regret it. So accessible -inside and outside of class, personal or educational concerns! The class requires time and effort, but he goes out of his way to help students succeed. He gives you everything you need for the exams; so there is no way you can fail-unless you are trying. Module assignments are long, but helpful!",1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROF. It is impossible to get even close to an A on any exams or labs. She does not consider that you know the material it feels more like an English class. If you can chose, chose someone else.",0
"Professor Chase is an amazing and very passionate professor and love what he teaches. Though I took him 1 year ago, He really cared about his students and he loves doing his job and is passionate by far one of my favorite professors at MJC though I am not a good test taker I managed to pass Astro and learned so much.",1
Nice guy but his papers are crazy. He wants it a certain way and no matter what it wont be perfect.,0
Hes cool and very good at explaining concepts.,1
AMAZINGGGG! LOVE Professor Tyrel!! ,1
"I had Owen for UF 100 for Food Chemistry. Easy class , very interesting and he is excited to teach! We had a midterm and a final which were worth a lot of points, but it was super easy because he teaches you everything! There are iclicker questions which helps you get extra points. He has extra credit opportunities. Take him!!",1
"Great teacher, explains material clearly and has very do-able expectations for course work.",1
"Difficult to understand, abrupt attitude with students",0
"Wasn't the biggest fan of this class but she tried. Thats all that matters right? Basically, her class is all lecture based and most people dont learn well from sitting listening to someone talk (while also repeating themselves over and over using different wording) for three hours.",1
"It states that you don't need to know some music to take this class, yet I'd recommend you should. The reading was heavy and the homework the teacher gave was not clear, nor did he offer any correction for them. Tests were heavily weighted compared to homework.  I do not wish to take another music class for an extremely long time.",0
He is awful. I took pre-calc in high school so I wasn't too worried about this class. He says attendance isn't mandatory but if you want to leave he interrogates you. I have to teach myself everything.. The SI is very useful and she is the only reason I did decent on the exams. Save yourself the frustration and don't take his class.,0
"Professor Lozano was not tough because she wanted to better her students, she was just plain rude. She encouraged participation but if your comments were not up to her standards, she might scold you. Her PSYCH101 class consisted of mostly exams that determine most of your grade, be sure to study the book closely because her lectures are a mess.",0
She's hands down one of the best professor's I've ever had. She is energetic during lectures and she makes sure we understand the material. I emailed her a few times during weekends asking questions and she always responded within an hour. She really cares about her students! Thanks Professor Ladan for all you are doing for us.,1
"One of the worst teachers/professors I've ever had. No class materials besides the e-book he wrote himself. Poor excuse for a textbook considering it's just vague info with no sources in pdf form. Lectures are just him rambling and mostly talking about himself. Graded on 3 tests, but they're harder than they should be. 50 minutes, 60 questions.",0
Lectures are amazing in how little Dr. Whipple prepares or seems to care. He is respected for not expecting much of anything from students. And he is hilarious because it is shocking that his man still is allowed to teach.,0
Dr. Lorton is an amazing professor. I took him for Calc III and he explained the math in ways that were easy to understand. He goes through every step thoroughly so if you are paying attention then you will be able to understand everything pretty easily. Do your homework and study for the tests and you'll be fine.,1
"Nice teacher, took online. Very helpful. You will have weekly discussion posts, 3 Reader Responses (400 words) and 3 essays (800-2200) words. Lots of writing. She has a mandatory number of words for everything, even discussion posts.",1
"The worst prof I've ever had. He's a good guy, but not college prof material. Doesn't thoroughly explain any part of his lectures, and if asked questions, doesn't fully answer them. His exams are quite tricky and nothing like study guides he provides. Quiz everyday, exam every 2/3 weeks, 20 page homework once/twice a week. Save your GPA and run!",0
"So far, Sanda is the greatest professor I've had in this program. I had her for GD1 and it there definitely was a learning curve when getting used to her tough love style of teaching, but after a while all of things she asks you to do make sense. Sanda truly helped me evolve as a designer and I'm so grateful for the time I got to spend in her class",1
Sweet woman & great class!,1
I think this may have been the first math class I sort of enjoyed. I love Prof Keefe. She's so clear and engaging and hilarious. She gives lots of extra credit as well. Definitely recommend.,1
"Started off fine with lectures followed by a weekly lab assignment. Then about 3/4 into the semester, we jumped from writing simple linux scripts to installing a linux server on a VM, installing a new kernel, editing and recompiling the kernel with VERY little instruction. Class structure was rather sloppy in my opinion.",1
"If you get this professor as an undergrad you truly hit the jackpot. He relates everything back to his real life experiences. Although his exams are tough, he curves when necessary",1
He is literally the best prof on planet earth,1
Jill is a very nice woman but she cannot stay organized to save her life. She expects you to know the ins and outs of projects without ever clearly explaining them. Ask one question and she will go on rants for the whole class. She plays favorites but is always willing to add more to her list if you talk to her. I WOULDN'T recommend her overall.,0
"Dr. Dempsey is an INCREDIBLY tough professor for a required course. I understand if this was an upper division course for theology majors, however, as someone majoring in something other than theology with work-heavy courses aside from theology, I did NOT do well in this class. Also, don't expect to know your grade at all the whole semester.",0
Terrible professor who does not teach. She is easily the worst teacher Ive ever had in my life. Its sad that she s better than the other comm professor though. The T.A. Carter is amazing though. Her study hall is what gave those that could pass a chance. I dont think Ive ever had a more useless and pointless professor in my life.,0
"Great teacher, simplified things very well, and gives lecture slides. I would advise to go to class. Like said by other, his test are only multiple choice, but questions are confusing and wordy.",1
"Summer social problem online class, so much assignments, 2 big papers, 4 tests, and lots of activities and discussion board",0
"Difficult material and he wasn't much help.  Lab was really rough- no one ever knew what was going on.  He's too vague about what he wants.  He's looking for something specific, but he won't tell you what it is.  Don't take him if you don't like essay tests.",0
"This class is HARD. I studied hours on end, went to a tutor, and went to every class and managed to scrape by with a C. He's helpful and knows his stuff, but don't think you can get by with not reading the book. It's a HARD class. Be prepared to study.",0
It is difficult to understand him but his slides aren't bad. You'll have to do some self learning but there's plenty of resources that cover the topics. Lots of time to complete the assignments and he is very generous with extensions. The assignments are not too difficult but they are a lot of work. 3 or 4 if it were easy to understand him speak.,0
"Dr. Lee's class was an insane amount of work. Pre case quizzes, post case quizzes, case studies, reading quizzes, discussion posts, replies, and exams EVERY week. Meanwhile, my friends with other biochem profs barely had any work and got A's. Please avoid Dr. Lee's section--it's too much work when compared to other professors. Take someone else!",0
"Went to class twice, got an A. As long as you go over his 3 question practice exams there is no way you would fail, since he gives the same questions on the actual exams. Huge curve, even though everyone did great. If you actually do want to learn though he is actually a very good lecturer too. Take him, you won't regret it!",1
"hard to understand her the first time, but her devotion is amazing. she is dedicated. however her knowledge of american politics is slim",1
I just took the final and can offically say that this class was a NIGHTMARE! I studied so hard and I still didn't do well. He made chem so difficult to understand. I actually think I know less coming out of this class than I did going in!,0
"I have to admit, he knows his stuff but still he is a really****ty prof. I took his class last term and it was the worst class I had even taken (and the hardest). He is extremely boring. Very unhelpful and his jokes are ******* stupid. He laughs for no reason and dresses like a *****.",0
"Very friendly and cares a lot about her teaching, but isn't a very good teacher. She's impossible to understand in person and in writing. Assignments are full of spelling mistakes. The textbook, which she wrote, is full of spelling and grammar mistakes and is difficult to interpret.",0
So uninspiring. So boring. It was torture being in his class. He humiliated students whenever they asked a question. He offered absolutely no guidance. He speaks in a low soft voice and has major problems hearing. Avoid taking his class!,0
"NO NO NO! Long lectures are dull and redundant. Useless exercises. Horrible grader. He will destroy your work, even if you are a strong writer. Gives you a short time notice on an assignment and then takes forever to grade. Assignment for a paper worth 20% of our grade is unclear and honestly too difficult for a FYW class.",0
"The class was very challenging for me and I truly had to work for my grade. The Kahoots are awesome. Pay attention to the questions! Prof Staves is a great option for this class. Without him, I would not have gotten the grade I did. Go to his office hours! The week of finals, he scheduled a 1 on 1 with me for an hour and a half! 10/10 recommend:)",1
He takes the tests from various test banks online and he doesn't really have to teach anything. I think taking this course online is terrible since it can get quiet detailed and require some explanation from an expert. The course should be taught in a classroom and not online.,0
"Chester is very good at explaining processes, especially in the textbook. Lectures are easy to follow if you can understand his southern gentlemanly accent, homework is straightforward, easy to find reference for, and worth doing. Great class!",1
"Lectures can be boring and the papers are a drag, but the final is optional. Easy to get an A or B",1
"The class itself was very easy, I ran into some issues with the SAM site and when I asked for feedback it never came.  Overall the class was good but I had absolutely no interaction with the professor on her end. ",0
"His lectures are all based on history and history again! never teaches you anything such as grammer, new words, etc. you supposed to know everything. He has his own way of writing essays and can give all class same grade. He wants you to really study hard and keep getting bad grades again put in the effort and try harder. eventually you might get A",0
His test are hard  but do pratice test should prepare for test.  lecture is boring but great,1
"Prof. Rees is one knowledgeable man. Can't really find something he doesn't know of. I learned a ton from his course. Mini tests are not easy. Exams are somewhat hard. But he'll curve at the end of the semester. Got a C+ for the midterm and ended up with a B+. If he didn't curve, I would only get a B-. Make sure you take perfect notes!!",1
No comment. Nothing positive to say other than he really knows electronics.,0
"Need to read for every class, sometimes there are short quizzes. She tells you what exactly will be on the midterm and final. Attendance and participation are both graded. Not a hard grader. Lectures are a little hard to stay focused on because they take up most of the class time. Not too hard, not too easy.",1
"Maybe he's better in person, but his online course is awful. There are no lecture videos, no outside materials, nothing other than the textbook and a supplemental packet that contradicts the book, you're just teaching yourself. Leaves constant condescending remarks on turned in work. YouTube is better, take this with a different teacher!",0
Very in-depth teacher. Better as a teacher than a preacher. Hebrews and James was the best Bible class I ever took at PCC.,1
Cordon gives clear guidelines and objectives for Intro to Geography. His lectures are engaging and he posts the powerpoints and extra learning tools on Canvas. He offers extra credit and hosts study sessions before each exam. Highly recommend taking his class.,1
"Ernst is willing to help. her lectures are kinda boring but if you study your textbook, you will do fine on the tests.",1
"Despite being an unengaging lecturer, he's one of the most credible professors since he has his own Wiki entry. Lectures are useless on their own without asking him questions or engaging in general. For assignments, practice every day and keep doing the hardest questions, as his exams are two levels above his HW and Quizzes. Stay consistent.",0
"Due to COVID19, Donald sharpe cancelled all homework and gave us a straightforward lecture (w/ audio) to learn from. The best psychology prof on campus. If rate my prof let me add more tags I would.",1
Shes only given out one A in her entire career of teaching is her story on syllabus day. I don't know why I stayed enrolled but wish I wouldn't of. The classes are boring and a lot of reading. She has no enthusiasm as a teacher and drills you with homework and papers.,0
The absolute best Professor. She teaches the concepts in layman terms and makes sure you understand everything. She would not just let it go if you are confused. pleasant classroom experience. I would take her again in a beat. Clear set expectations and homework was not overwhelming at all. Reviews for test are excellent.,1
"Extremely clear, well paced prof. His decent sense of humor also helps. You really can't ask for much more. On a subjective note, I found the actual course content itself to be terribly boring, but that's not his fault... just my bad luck for having to take a course in which I have no intrinsic interest.",1
"Too difficult to understand. Very nice and his heart is in the right place, but he can't covey messages and meanings properly.",0
Dr. Baltakis is a great teacher. He actually cares about what he teaches and is very knowledgeable when it comes to history. I took 3 of his classes and learned a lot from him. Bring a computer or a copy of his power point presentations and fill in the missing information that he provides during class. He goes over the ENTIRE test the class before,1
"He grades so harsh. Not only that, but he also has such long lectures, which I felt helped with nothing. He expects so much out of you from this class. I get its an honors class, but he had no reason having his students read two books at a time, with articles 20+ articles. This class feels like your taking three instead of one. It is so draining.",0
Loved this course!  Dr. Pike is brilliant!,1
Erudite. Jocular. Interesting.,1
Some readings are confusing and most are boring and long. Not a hard class but feels like a writing class. 1 page summaries and an essay that make up most of your grade. Was excited to take this class but now just dread all the assignments. Nice prof. but wish there was more discussion & less writing that is graded mostly on grammar and not content,1
"Did not mesh well with teaching style, and failed the final after actually studying. My B- was the lowest grade I've ever received. Like ever.",0
Dr hauck was very clear in lecture and encouraged interactions outside of class in group sessions (even on Sunday afternoons). An A is very very possibly with Dr Hauck if you review notes outside of class before quizzes and exams.,1
"baaaaaah,  i cant believe ms marie is retiring.  i procrastinated and i want to take her speech class.  had her for intercultural studies   she rocks!",1
I know everyone has a difference of opinions about this teacher but I really didn't care for him.  Not very clear (partly because he is Korean and not easy to understand).  He feels that if you just do what he says you will  pass but his methods don't make sense.  I just don't recommend him.,0
"Very Boring and lazy , He basically lectures himself and rush things out, and don't bother to take any class with him",0
"I did not like the way she would talk to students. She is very rude for no particular reason. She wants things done her way, and doesn't understand that students may have a way that is easier for them to understand. If you are a type of student that needs to be interactive with the professor, I would not recommend this class.",0
"worst teacher i have ever experienced in my student life, very tough grader. He runs the autocode to run your program, so if you miss anything in the program you end up with 0 grade, thats  how he grades. no sympathy at all ... but unfortunately there is only one professor who teaches cs320 at csula. I dont recommend him at all...",0
"Never would answer a direct question.  Very sarcastic and hard to find when looking for help.  Good comments on papers, and nice about extensions.",0
Falola's class is really boring. His accent makes him difficult to understand and most of the lectures seem to be the same thing said in different ways. His TAs do all the grading and are really annoying. Attendance is mandatory but everyone just scrolls through FB during class. Really hard to be motivated to do the readings. Would not recommend.,0
"Vannier is a cool dude, but makes you work for your grade. 3 exams total, all pretty hard but gives you a serious amount of extra credit (like around 40 points) so makes it pretty fair. Takes attendance by having you do worksheets during class so don't skip a lot. Our homework was online quizzes, time consuming but easy (a lot of answers online)",1
terrible professor ever. Tons of reading and she asked you to do a lot of stupid things in class. You cannot learn anything from her class. Had to drop her class. Not recommended.,0
Way too boring!  Psychology is supposed to be interesting.  The only thing I looked forward to her good movies.,0
"I took her this semester the exams are based on her lectures so you better listen. DO NOT TAKE this class @ 8 am if you are not a morning person, please. Just STUDY and you will do fine :). I had her in person and online.",1
"maybe i am being too hard on him but he is super boring. his voice just makes me fall asleep and is very hard to pay attention. I swapped him first day of class with another sociology teacher instead. I need to do good, not sleep in class.",0
"On the first week, she slams her hand on a table to make sure we are listening. It's difficult to convince her on the exams you ""own the material"". There's also an essay due the day of the multiple choice final.",1
"Great professor! Very clear about what is expected from the students from day one, tests contain no unpleasant surprise questions, and overall the class was both fun and informative. A ""Goldilocks Zone"" class, where it is not so easy that your brain will shut off, but not so hard that it becomes a stressful experience either.",1
Worst professor I ever took this semester  she's disorganized and confusing ended up getting a D in her class BIG MISTAKE!!,0
She is hard and her lecture are hard to listen to due to the fact that she like to take rabbit's trails. But if you go to her office she will help you and just show effort and that will help your grade. this course isn't a easy A and Beware with that cup,1
This class is mandatory for anyone in CALS which is a bummer considering its a let down. Professor Mcguffey is knowledgable but cared more about burritos than he did teaching us. If you show up and do the work you will get an A but it leaves something to be desired.,0
"Syllabus scared me at first, but it was easier than I thought. He is great at giving the feedback you need to improve. 3 papers, 3 assignments, 9 quizzes, 3 exams, final, 4 discussion boards. Sounds like a lot but you are able to complete everything early. All answers are easily found in the book. For a WI course, it didn't feel writing intensive.",1
Very nice person. He teaches well. Helps a lot of people.,1
Not a great class at all. Quizzes are pretty hard and he never gives you enough time to finish them. Theres also papers due every other week and he grades harshly. He does grade stuff in a timely manner and updates your grade so you know what you have in the class. Wouldnt suggest taking this class if there are seats available in others.,0
"Her class is very boring she doesnt have a clue how to grade, assignments. I have her next semester and I dont want to be in her class.",0
"Terrible professor, unclear about her teaching method. She seemed very off, had to drop out to save my GPA. Id recommend you to take this class if you hate yourself.",0
"He's nice enough, but his slides are all awful (multi-coloured / comic sans) and he teaches so many irrelevant concepts that everything is over-complicated. He never stops to engage the class, and he never answers questions. However, he breaks up the lecture with a video, and homework is easy. Only take this class if you love and know the subject!",0
"Old school... in the sense that class is confusing and there is very little structure or elaboration if you are struggling with something. Really terrific guy, but his class just went right over my head despite great effort.",0
"I took this class online and the textbook was not absolutely needed as everything on quizzes, assignments, and tests was in the notes provided.",1
"Great teacher, great class. You would really be wise to choose this professor. He will help you and always answers the questions fully. the information was actually interesting and he made sure to teach everything really thoroughly. I love this class!",1
"Do not take this class. Textbooks were out of date and lectures were disorganized and unprepared. Often contradicts himself, the textbooks, or basic facts. Tangents can last for hours and not relevant at all. Exams are basically restating what he's said back to him, most of which is disorganized or plain wrong. Extremely nice in person but horrible",0
"The homework, exams, and lab could trip you up if you're expecting a blow-off class, but otherwise its great.  Looney is very enthusiastic and the course is full of interesting content",1
Pretty disorganized and lectures were not engaging to me,0
If you want to do good in 3MC3 don't take it with him. 20% of your mark is participation and its ridiculously hard to get a 70% in it. As long as you have a good group you should be okay but even so he's way harder than other profs. Just know if you say something stupid he will make fun of you.   ,0
"Lectures were a big waste of time, had to buy 5 different books - all of which were poorly written & uninteresting",0
I can not understand him which happens sometimes with professors. But his notes aren't clear and that is with using power points. He will not define terms on slides and words are spaced together. So if you don't understand him you are screwed. He also says itself a lot and tests are not multiple choice so good luck.,0
This was by far the best comp teacher I have had. Super helpful. I struggled on the final paper but that's because I am not a strong writer but I would definitely take this class again. An awesome teacher!! Not a ton of homework and everything is super clear on how to complete it all!,1
"If you get the hang of how he structures his tests, you'll do well.  Entertaining in class, helpful outside class.",1
"Chung is an extremely hard grader and participation is mandatory in the class. He's smart, but doesn't really know how to transfer the lessons to students who have no accounting knowledge or background. I think I got ulcers from the stress this class caused me.",1
"One of the best professors at UB by far. Keeps the material on a level that is easy to follow as far as tax goes but, it is a course that is definitely determined by the amount of work you put in.  Do what she assigns and go to class and you'll do fine.",1
"My favorite teacher at CCNY thus far. She gives great feedback and it's obvious that she wants the best for all her students. She's accessible outside of class, and depending on how much your class participates, she gives extra credit. Attending lecture is mandatory! Pop quizzes! But she's great and understanding as long as you communicate.",1
"Very interesting teacher, but can ramble on for all of class. He says, ""Yeah....yeah...I see....Yes....I see...."" a lot when you mention something to him. I only had to write four papers throughout the entire term with a mid and final, easy workload, interesting, an excellent teacher!",1
"Very nice person. She is willing to bend over backwards for all her students. Her tests are moderately difficult but she gives a study guide, which helps a lot. Her lectures include a lot of stories about her past teaching experiences, which end up being more useful than the textbook material.",1
"His class is very difficult, but if you ask for help he will do his best to try and get you an A in his class. After reading previous reviews I now understand what his ""violent outburst"" are. wow. Those are scary.",1
Excellent teacher!! I recommend her classes!! I learned alot from her. Her class is easy if you pay attention in class.,1
"She is a really nice person who is very passionate about her subject. She does lecture a lot, but she will slow down if asked. Even after taking a lot of  American history classes, I still learned a lot of new and interesting things in the class. You also watch a documentary in class to write a paper on. Discussion & attendance taken on Friday",1
"Fantastic professor. Had him for both 1st year math courses. Always willing to help. All midterms and finals are very fair and reflect the material on the assignments. A really nice guy, his little jokes and examples in class keep things interesting. Highly recommend taking his courses!",1
Dr. Ryan Hunt was amazing as always.  This semester more so - my dad had a stroke mid-semester and ultimately passed away.  Dr. Hunt was so kind in allowing me time to get work completed.  The night I came for an exam he told me I didn't have to take the exam that night I could have another week or more whatever I needed to study.  I took the exam ,1
"Moodiest woman ever...really nice one second and then next she hates you.  Class is unorganized, she jumps all over the book.",1
Super interesting course. Kramer knows his stuff and does a great job of teaching it. I only wish there were more film courses with him - probably the most positive experience I have had in either degree.,1
"This class is pretty challenging and he did his best to teach it. He held review sessions before all of the exams and was super willing to meet during office hours, but his exams were extremely difficult. The questions are not multiple choice and are all short answer, fill in the blank, etc. When studying, put emphasis on math problems!!!",1
"Judge Baird makes class fun, but he expects you to have read the chapters and know what is going on.  Participation is big in his class and his wording on the tests are a little tricky, but he is an awesome professor!",1
Very clear teaching style.,1
"Overall this prof is unreasonable, unwilling to compromise, and is inappropriate and rude to students. It is hard to avoid taking her classes if you are trying to get a psychology major at Brandon University. Her conduct as a professional reflects poorly on an otherwise good university with respectable professors.",0
Extremely hard grader. He is very smart and lectures the entire class. He gives breaks in the middle which last about a minute. very hard to follow and gives a ton of information. only take this class if you love reading the textbook every night.,0
"Amazing teacher, it's a really fun classI never wanted to miss one day. She explains everything so clearly.Don't miss any classes you might get loss with the vocabulary. I highly recommend her as your teacher!",1
"One of the most boring classes I have taken in my college career.  Test are very hard, and you must pay attention to the teacher in class but it is nearly impossible because he is monotone.  Last test had a 49% avg.  This class sucks no matter who you take it with.",0
"One of the smartest, most engaging guys I've ever met. Quite a bit of reading, but it's worth it because the discussions he leads are so dense and informative. Fair grader. Responsive to what the class finds interesting and brings out the most in your ideas. You'll come out of his class smarter, and it's a genuine honor to have worked with him.",1
"Great proffesor, knows his stuff, ready to help you at any time with anything...has various senior design projects and you can learn a lot  from them",1
I took her anthropology anth 0001 online class with her during a summer session. Her homework was not due until the sunday night of very week. Consisted of a test and discussion every week. It's possible to receive a fair amount of extra credit in this class helping your grade when you need. She cares about student and the class a lot.,1
Many things werent graded until after you took your final so you never knew how you were truly doing in the class. Emails took days to get a response.,0
How is this not the same person posting 5 times a day and pretending to be different people?  And why?,0
ok heres the deal. dont go to class... but stop by his office sometimes with a question... remember to leave ur name. DO PAST FINALS!! 3/6 questions come from past finals,1
"In the beginning you think what a great teacher...then he grades analytical essays that he makes you do all semester. He has very opinionated views and grading system. This shouldn't be a history class, more like a essay competition class to make him jump out of his seat but that won't happen b/c he thinks everyone sucks at writing except himself.",0
"Professor Jennings is a fun teacher for Political Science. Three tests, drops lowest, six quizzes, drops lowest, one paper, and participation make up the grades. He gives everyone  35 / 50 base score for participation, so prepare to be engaged if you want more points. There is some extra credit (2.5%) and he does curve exams sometimes. A good pick.",1
"Awesome professor and warm individual inside and outside of class.  If you make the effort to get to know him it will mean wonders to your outlook as a developing scientist.  DO come to class, DO ask questions, and DO attend the student lead study sessions.  They help a mil for exams.",1
"She gets real snippy and definitely has favorites. She is impatient and very negative. Amber definitely Does have favorites. Some people she jokes and laughs with, others she treats like dirt. It never ceases to amaze me how diff she'll treat one person from the next. She treated me real unpleasant, and some others too. But some poeple she loves.",0
"The most arrogant professor I've ever had. Speaks & answers questions so unhappily and abrasively. Attendance is CRITICAL, and she times your walking thru the door to the ""T"". MANDATORY reading. Disciplines & undermines students as if she'd forgotten she's there to teach UNIVERSITY level students. All about how animals learn but never humans. ",0
He was nice at first but he clearly wants there to be a hierarchy of grades in his class. It's like he doesn't want to give out A's to people that log on for class every day and TRY. He's rude & queeny and sometimes he makes offensive & shady remarks. His grading is very nit picky and he loves giving you a borderline grade. Take with someone else!,0
He is the best prof ever,1
"take her only if you can bear through not being allowed to go to bathroom at all and can write ingeniously like a hemingway. 50% of of the class received grades of D or less on, which is  simply preposterous. Regardless of how well you can write,she just grades you on a whim and  is extremely inconsistent. THIS CLASS WILL LOWER UR GPA FOR CERTAIN!",0
He is nice. But his class is really boring.,1
I hated this class. She is the most unorganized prof i have ever had! She just rambles and reads from the book. I never knew what was going on. She also take literally months to grade papers!,0
easiest class. literally impossible to not get an A,1
"Borg was harsh when you met him in office hours and unwilling to listen when you explained why you thought he was wrong. If you pay attention to his political views and write in accordance with them you'll do better, even if it's not what you think. Quizzes are hard. Ask him about your thesis before you write it. Midterm and final were graded harsh",0
"Tests are hard, homework is hard, curve is MASSIVE!  Trust me, you'll learn the material and how it is derived.  He is a very clear lecturer with good examples.",1
The best thing about Mary is that she'll challenge you without making you work your butt off. An excellent teacher and extremely helpful. She is a loveable person who cares about her students. I doubt you would regret taking her class.,1
"PSA: DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! I am only 5 weeks into the class and I hate it so much. I am a very responsible student and he is an extremely tough grader. I got knocked down a whole letter grade just because in my paper the class name and date were switched. This class is not worth the stress, take this class with another teacher or in person.",0
"After leaving Callahan's class, you will feel smarter than when you came in.  If you are at Kettering to learn, then take this prof.  You will learn a lot, and the class is incredibly interesting as well. Callahan is one of the best professors here.",1
"Workload is absolutely insane! I was stressed out for much of the semester. Be prepared to devote a whole lot of time to this class. That being said, the material is very beneficial and will change your outlook on many aspects of business.",1
Literally the worst professor I have ever encountered. Answers no questions and is beyond rude. Would recommend anyone other than her.,0
Cet course est horrible! C'est tellement plat car c'est enseigné complètement en anglais. Le prof prend plus de temp à enseigné la grammaire anglais que le français. Je ne recommend pas de tous cet cours! Je n'ai appris riens.,0
Dave is HANDS DOWN the BEST professor at AQ.,1
"Weidman is hilarious and kind. He genuinely cares about helping us to understand the material. He gives review sessions on the exam from the previous semester, and has office hours for extra questions you have. You do have to come to class, because there are iClicker questions every day, but you have 3 absences to use.",1
"Professor McCreight is great! He knows everything there is to know about Latin translation, poetry and culture.  He does great impersonations of a variety of characters that keep the class fun.  He is very helpful and goes out of his way to make sure every student knows the material being taught in class. ",1
"dr passwatters is probably the most interesting teacher i have had here at wcu. he's nice and knows tons of information... i suggest reading the book before the test, though... its the only way u can do well.",1
"This was the worse professor I've ever had.  I thought I would love Embryology, but she ruined it for me.  We started with 25 students, and ended the semester with 7.  Only 1 person got a B, everyone else got C's, D's, & F's.  After our final, we complained to the Dean, but apparently it didn't work, because from what I've heard, she's the Dean now???",0
"We are currently a month into class and I don't think the class as a whole is keeping up. We had a journal entry due today and when she asked who *didn't* turn it in, 80% of the class raised their hand. This is not a class problem, but a failure on the part of the professor to properly communicate what is due. already dreading the rest of the year",0
"Professor Masterson is, in my opinion, a terrible professor. He takes everything from the book, and he explains nothing. You pretty much have to teach yourself the course. He posts nothing to blackboard and you never know what your grade is. If you aren't the best at math, stay away because this is not the professor for you.",0
"Homeworks are graded the harshest I have ever seen. Very strict on grading and quizes. Doesn't really teach, has you watch youtube videos before class so you understand the concepts.",0
"You are graded ONLY on tests, but it isn't clear what he will be testing (if it is mostly on the lectures or the textbook readings). The lectures are long and jam-packed with information, and he goes fast in lectures. He shows lots of videos to show clear examples and cracks jokes often, but I would rather him be more clear of his testing methods.",1
"Summer Class - Lectures about things not on the test. Takes up too much times with experiments (even though some were fun, but meaningless). Emailed for help after D on first test, but only got told to study harder. Caters towards the ""Naturally Smart Students"" and doesn't help those that struggle with the material. Added work last minute.",0
"Completely unorganized. Had better conversations about the material outside of class than we did inside of it. While the material she selects is interesting, her lectures about the subjects were all over the place. The class itself is pretty damn easy, just zone out during class and keep up with the material and you should be fine.",0
He's nice but he's lectures are not at all beneficial. It's up to you and the textbook to pass this class. He doesn't prepare you for the midterm or final which are rather confusing and long even after you study. Good luck if you need to take this class; I barely passed.,0
Will is clear on what he wants you do to do in order to get full credit for assignments and exams. He can be a tough grader if you do not put in complete effort. You get numerous papers (some do not help with the class) and he is very passionate about math. I'm not a fan of math so he made it somewhat decent for me.,1
"Very nice man, if you go to his office he will help you with any questions you have. He is very intelligent but sometimes when trying to help explain things he goes too in-depth and loses you.",1
"best math professor I've ever had. His responses are thorough and easily understood. He goes out of his way to prepare you for the tests by spending his own money printing out previous tests and detailed solutions. Be sure to mimic the way her gives solutions to previous exams, If you do you'll get full partial credit.",1
She does not give feedback on what is missed on homework or tests to be able to study as well as doesn't even release grades unless begged for by students. Extremely unorganized for class and in general. If you have a question don't bother emailing her as she doesn't respond for days at a time. In short don't waste your time w/ her for any class.,0
"al, al, al. what can you say about al? well he's nice and all and pretty understanding, but its a guarenteed boring class for the most part. his lectures are a tad mind numbing, but its possible to pass this class without a TON of effort. try to keep up on plays or at least summaries of them, and joke around a lot with him, he's fun then.",1
"if you girls can stop ogling this guy, then you will learn a lot, cuz he's good",1
No one cares more about the student than Dr Lyon. He had us take an anon survey for feedback about the mechanical program. As a 4th year I can appreciate him trying to fix things in an honestly cancerous ME program. That aside he's your prof and not your friend expect some work. Assignments can be a challenge. Exams are fair though. ,1
"Al-Mallah is an awesome professor, and really cares about the success of his students. The class is very tough, and he grades pretty hard. He expects a lot of you and some of the sections are pretty boring. He only gave my class a final paper instead of an exam. Overall, he is a great professor but the material can be tough/boring sometimes.",1
"After 5 classes, he has nothing to teach. assignments are interesting but take lots of time. He only threw the homework to you and didn't give much help. I have to learn by myself or from other resources to finish the homework. I think he should find a better way to teach this course, don't read PPT.",0
Doane is probably the worst teacher I have ever taken since my four years of being in college. She is unbelievably boring!!! If you want to pass this class than don't bother thinking or forming your own opinion because it will not be accepted. For exams she literally give students what to say and if you don't agree too bad. TERRIBLE!!! ,0
"She is a very kind person, but her lectures are scattered and full of random movie clips. It isn't hard to do well in this class, but her grading seems completely random.",1
Worst professor I have ever had! Assignments were unclear and very difficult. Would not recommend!,0
"He does not go through any examples and just shows the answer. Rather learn on my own. Spends way too much time explaining concepts and its hard to follow along since he struggles to speak fluently and constantly says ""uh"". His lectures are the opposite of engaging you'll wanna just teach it yourself and wish you switched to another professor.",0
"not hot, and definitely boring and very sickly.....peace out",1
"Worst I've ever had. She doesn't give any bullet points for the tests, the material is extremely long with tons of new scientific terms. She reviews the chapters AFTER the test is taken, which proves her lack of professionalism. Gives you Ds and Fs no matter how well you do the homework and refuses to give clear explanaitons. She will ruin your GPA",0
"I had Scott for first-year seminar and he was the easiest teacher. we literally did not do anything and it was nice at first, but it got boring after a while. We just ended up watching videos the whole time and had class discussions. There was assigned reading but we didn't ever do anything with them so nobody read. He was really nice though.",1
The class is actually pretty interesting but he can get a little boring. Attendance is not required but the lectures definitely help. The tests are hard but the review sessions are very helpful. Prof. Wilson will also go out of his way to help you succeed in this class.,1
"Professor is smart and knows what he's talking about, but gives shaky instruction. Also, he assigns mountains of reading from books you download from his website and other web based books, etc. Lectures in class only loosely connect to the books but you have to know it all. Lots of paper writing (1200 words/week) and long, difficult tests.",0
"She's an easy A. Barely have class the entire semester because she cancels a lot. When there is class, she reads through a power point or puts on a movie. There was two big assignments but were an easy A as well. So take her of you don't want to do anything plus she's cool.",1
His class is hard but he is a good teacher.,1
Professor Mingo was such an amazing instructor. I felt that she really cared about us and she was very understanding. I took the course online and it was well organized. It's an easy class.,1
"She grades weirdly and words her questions/directions weirdly because she doesn't proof read. Also, she wants us to cite our sources but will give us a 0 on the assignments/discussion posts if we quote from them like what??? She expects you to do your own research in addition to the chapter reading for the test so you'll see q's you wont understand",0
"Great prof!! You do have to get used to his way of interacting with you. If you're not comfortable with him calling on you in class, let him know. He'll respect that, as much as he encourages students participating and asking questions. Really helpful in office hours. No excuse for a low grade except laziness.",1
"Yu is speaks well and is quite clear. However, the text book is essentially useless since the questions are much easier than his test questions. It is best to study off his past tests and he usually recycles a few questions. One of my tests had no past test, so there was little to prepare us for it. Be warned, ECO227 is a very challenging course.",1
"Prof makes big deal about how ""google doesn't know the answers"" but if you've got half a brain they're not hard to find. The only time I used the textbook was to find answers to the CA field guide questions, a little harder to google. Otherwise, I always looked up answers. Save mod vid links for exams & you can skim them for image question answers.",1
"Spacy doesn't even begin to cover it.  One gets the idea that this is what years of hard livin' could do to a person.  She always does everything the hardest way possible, and doesn't seem to have any sort of grasp on the material.",0
"He is not a very helpful teacher, so unless you can teach yourself the concepts from the book, I would take Stats with a different professor.",0
Horrible online teacher. Does not communicate well with students at all. Is not willing to work with students and most importantly she is very rude to some students.,0
"Dr. Oliver is a great professor. He is very kind, understanding and is extremely helpful if you are having trouble understanding anything. His exams are over the short stories/short novels that you read and discuss in class and they are all short answer over 10 terms which he will give you before the exam as a study guide. Great prof!",1
"Lots of content that I will think and talk about for years. extremely helpful if you put in even minimal effort, always available, lightning fast email responses. Answered questions with utmost patience and ALWAYS felt like he had our backs. Really tried to help out. I had no tech problems, so maybe it was not his end; shouldn't blame him for that",1
"The only good prof I had last term, I manage to understand everything by lecture alone, but my mark in this course suffered because I had to spent time focusing on other classes taught by incompetent profs, and missed a few lectures.",1
Professor was often disorganized and at times did not always directly answer students questions. Grading on test did not really make sense and handwriting was often difficult to read. I felt lost throughout most of the class.,0
She was a difficult teacher to have. Don't plan on taking her class if you don't want to spend all weekend long on homework. I'm not kidding. If you are really good at accounting then it would probably take less time. The homework is online and difficult to understand.,0
"Lots of reading. No test review at all. 3 case asmts which you have to put time and efforts into it and 1 optional case to boost your grade. Take this class for credit, didn't really enjoy much! Not Easy A  unless you work really hard to earn it! ",1
 Very clear in lectures and gives detailed examples during class which SAVED me! She goes through things many times so you understand. So I recommend going to class. Tests aren't the easiest but she prepares people really well. Everyone wants to attend her review sessions.,1
"Best history teacher ever.  Keeps you interested and makes class fun.  You learn through playing history themed games such as jeopardy and match game.  Has a bunch of quizes that are basically grade boosters.  Attendance isn't really mandatory, but I don't know why someone wouldn't want to go to his class.  Would take again.",1
"No HW, so you really have to study. Be active in his class and he will be very understanding with you, slack off he will make you feel unwelcomed.",1
"By far the worst professor I've had so far. Forget this being a 100 level class, or learning the fundamentals of politics. You get random abbreviated words on the white board and very little to no explanation of anything. There are three grades for the whole class, attendance, midterm and final (both essay style). I",0
"Wendy's assignments aren't clear about what she wants. She wants pretty code but doesn't explicitly say that in her assignments. She doesn't want helper methods in certain assignments, but doesn't put that in her assignment pdf's or on her website. Read the assignments carefully, make your code as efficient and pretty as possible and you might pass",0
"Doesn't really teach as much as give you difficult questions during lecture that leave you confused until he solves it for you. Tests aren't like practice tests, gives very little study materials/things to learn in the first place. Difficult to learn unless you're naturally good at physics.",0
"For the Computer Organization prof, organization seemed to be an issue. He has his laptop project to the whitescreen, a slide projected *on the door*, and then talked to the chalkboard, with intermittent slide changing. However, when you do get his attention, he knows what he's doing. If you can think like a computer, you'll relate with him fine.",1
My adviser would not let me drop the class. All he did was rant about conspiracies and the government. He briefly went over material before announcing that we had a test on it the next class. I love music and he made me hate the class. I was extremely disappointed that he gets paid to not teach.,0
This was the worst instructor that I have had. She grades arbitrarily and is partially knowledgeable about the subject.,0
"This was a condensed course, so the material was very heavy and full of irrelevant articles. The quiz questions  ranged  from confusing to obscure,  and even though I studied, I still scrambled to figure out what the profs were referring to.I don't recommend taking this class if you struggle separating pertinent material from LOADS of useless info.",0
"Mrs. Parker is the absolute best teacher I've ever had. She cares about all of her students and really makes the experience overall fantastic by good one-on-one time, as well as overall lectures in class. She is very patient and will work out any problems you have with you so long as you are willing to work hard!",1
"Reasonable grader, tough assignments. Somewhat challenging exams but not impossible. Interesting class but lost interest after a while in lecture since this past quarter it was a 3-hour lecture. Overall good class!",1
"This was my hardest class in college thus far. He is not clear and I was very lost during lectures. He's the only prof teaching Epi so you can't avoid if him if you're a public health major. I'm a good student and his exams were so hard. The authentic assessment project was INSANE. One day, he called us all ""mediocre at best"" Hated him",0
Eric is not a good teacher. He will have you do all your homework online and he gives a quiz every time your in class and they are timed. He's not helpful.,0
This class is easy if you do all of the work assigned (which is NOT a lot). She puts grades in very quickly and posts all of the powerpoints before an exam. ,1
"Best CS prof I've had at McGill. Lectures are extremely clear and concise, and Prakash really cares about his students doing well. He has stayed well past his office hours to help students in the past.",1
"accounting is hard. gabbin works with you if you work with him. again, accounting is hard. you got to read the book. 3 tests and a final, some grade fluff from homework and quizzes. after the second test, 25% of the class drops. accounting is hard.",1
"Do not take this class. 40+ pages to read, 3 tests, 3 quizzes, a 30 minute video and discussion board EVERY WEEK. This was the hardest class I have ever taken and it doesn't get easier. He's a nice guy, but a harsh grader. I am a strong writer and managed a borderline A in the class. This is a GPA killer unless you are dedicated!",0
"this class isnt hard but the course load is way to heavy for a gen ed. There's lot of assignments that involve visiting different places or interviewing people which would be cool if as a college student you had time to do that which many of us dont. Donner is ok, wouldn't take him again. books are helpful for midterm and final but thats it.",0
Ms. Con is a great teacher and she is extremely easy! You only have to go to class for like 2 weeks and then after that she'll tell you that you don't have to come anymore. TAKE HER!!!!,1
"Ok She's my academic advisor and she's awful she will talk over you,laugh at you to your face,make fun of your mistakes avoid her classes at all costs",0
"this man is so ridiculously harsh when it comes to papers it's unreal. i've literally never seen him give an A out. you could iron out as many mistakes in an essay and put your heart and soul into it and he'll give you an A- at best. he's utterly obsessed with ""conciseness"" but poorly defines what that means and often prefers dumbed down sentences.",0
"Horrible!!!! If you ask him how your grade is in the class, he will tell you ""you are doing fine"" when really your failing!!! Very unorganized and mean.",0
"Fun easy A, but attendance is mandatory. Mr Hughes is a fun teacher.",1
"Wouldnt suggest him. Very absent minded and unprepared for class. Also pretty unclear about what he expects for case studies and other projects, which makes the class way more challenging than necessary",0
"Its really not a hard class.  Just read all the material twice and you'll get an A.  Plus he recycles exam questions so mesorah is important.  I did all the reading on weekends.  Just don't fall behind.  Class is useless, don't bother going.",0
laid back. his lectures are hysterical.,0
"Mr. Holder is a good teacher. I love his stories of past experiences, and he knows his subject. He also is very entertaining.",1
He's really laid back. Easy class. Just study the handouts and go to class so you know what he wants to ask in the midterms and final.,1
"Do not take this Professor! She is terrible at communicating and, even as an expert in her field of Islam and Politics, is incredibly close-minded. She does not use the textbooks consistently and assigns online readings. In class, she asks specific, unimportant questions on the readings that you will not remember. she cares about her students tho.",0
"I don't recommend him, but unfortunately he's the only one who teaches this class. Rarely comes off as friendly, is quite intimidating, and refuses to answer assignment related questions 99.9% of the time. He also rounds the final grade down instead of up. Um, didn't we all learn the basic rules of rounding in 3rd grade?",0
"Really rude guy with a short temper.  Lectures make the information easier to understand than the book, but the tests are still hard.  Will make you feel stupid for asking a question/ not understanding the information DO NOT TAKE",0
"Dr. Rist is amazing! All ENGW students love her. She is kind, helpful, organized, clear, and incredibly smart. I wish she was teaching my Current Theories class right now. Go to her office hours, e-mail her, communicate your needs to her in some way and she will find any way to help you. Take her classes!",1
"Professor Schroeder is a great guy, but is unreliable. He missed class more than five times this semester which caused the end of the semester to be a serious crunch. He never answers his emails so don't expect too much help. He is extremely unclear about the second essay. He also took over a month to grade our first speech. His lectures are great.",0
"He really loves film, but he makes you hate it. He can talk forever and he can really put you to sleep. For anyone who loves to sleep, I recommend this class.",0
"Wow. When I took his course, he had a bad anger management problem. Maybe he's calmed down in six years...",0
It's a pretty interesting class. People like it because of the grading policy. Don't be discouraged on exam grades. Our exams tended to range from 5%-103% so pretty large distributions. The curve saves a lot of people.,1
Most monotone prof at Ryerson. You will 100% fall asleep if the lecture is longer than 1 hour. He can talk about the most boring topic on earth for hours and it will never be tested on. Powerpoints that he provides are different than the one he uses in class. Slides are almost the same as the entire textbook. Super boring 15-18 page report.,0
Not bad gave tremendous 10 point curves on all tests and curves your final average at the end,1
He's a good teacher,1
"I love Danny so much! He's definitely the best acting teacher that you can find in SMC :)Danny always says that he best actor is the most specific one, and acting is just reacting. Take him if you really want to be a good actor! <3",1
"My first professor at cpp and despite it being online, it was a great class. I am taking him again for HIST 3340 and most likely I would choose him for my senior thesis.",1
"Lots of people don't like him because his lectures can be confusing. He clearly likes to hear himself talk, but all his commentary is useful and often profound if you can piece it together. The connections he draws are also super helpful for exam and midterm.",0
Really a good teacher that challenges you to put your best foot forward even though I made a D. I think Mrs. Elise is a great teacher my problem was timing on the exit exam I struggled and I'm still struggling,1
Mrs. Elizondo has by far been my favorite professor! I took her last semester for Anatomy and am currently in her class for MIcrobiology. She makes the information enjoyable to learn and is extremely reasonable. Wish she taught physio! Incredible woman,1
"DO NOT TAKE CLASS WITH HIM!!  I am a straight ""A student who is struggling to keep my grade up.  He has a 1 week, three assignments rule, original posts must be made within 3 days plus 3 additional on 3 separate days will give you a 79/100 he expects you to go above the ""required"" in order to get a good grade.  I emailed and got a rude response.",0
Professor Trubatch is a nice enough guy but his class is the hardest I have ever taken. My entire class is failing due to a horrible textbook and unclear lectures. Quizzes are nothing like what we do in class. It is defeating that a class full of math majors are failing a math class. I have never put so much in without any results.,0
Out of all math teachers I've ever had in my life she is the easiest teacher. You'll pass if you show up and do the work. That's all,1
"He really tries to be an enthusiastic professor, but definitely didn't do it for me. 1. If you don't like clowns he does a scary clown voice 2. Automatic C if you give a speech with a trivial topic (ex: informative speech on a party automatic C). However, he is clear and tells you exactly what he expects.",1
this is an exellent course.,1
"Kazlow is a really tough professor. He uses MegaStatExcel for everything and during exams, he just thinks we know magically what to do . He's nice but he's so unclear on what he wants.  He made Stats so confusing to me, I failed. Doesn't show how to use the calculator for anything unless you ask him. You WILL be living in the tutoring center.",0
He's a nice guy and had a sense of humor but his lectures ate extremely boring and hard to deduct what things he's talking about that are actually important because he'll go off on tangents. After attending every class and then bombing the 1st midterm I stopped going to class and just studied my textbook. Only reason I passed the course,0
Dr. Ballard is the best professor at SUNY Geneseo.  The feedback that is provided to students is helpful.  She is more than Mediocre and it is obvious that she enjoys teaching.,1
"Absent and worthless if you have an issue. I had an issue with getting locked out of a test using the lockdown software she required and she refused to do anything about it, making passing very difficult for me. So lazy that she didnt even bother to post announcements weekly either. Do not recommend her.",0
Hardest class I've ever taken. She does not care about her student. She tries to trick you on her tests. Her multiple choice questions are the hardest mc questions ever. You should stay away.,0
"Fun and entertaining guy. Likes to scare first-years by telling them all the ways they'll fail, but genuinely cares about his students and wants to see them succeed. Would definitely recommend going to all classes, he's a great lecturer and often covers important information in class. Solid prof overall.",1
"She's a great person don't get me wrong, funny and super nice. But her lectures, she just reads of the powerpoint and her examples do not go in-depth. Her exams are so so so hard in comparison to her lectures. Read the book and know everything in detail before the exam. ",1
Enrollment is coming up! FOR FALL 2020! Do NOT take him. You will regret it!! Especially if econ isn't your thing and you aren't willing to dedicate all of your time to interpret his class. So intimidating. Sunday study sessions do not help. Class is a waste of time and doesn't make sense. I always went to everything. Office hrs suck too. DON'TAKE,0
I learned a lot from this professor and she was very flexible when grading assignments. Ms. Hughes gave lots of helpful feedback on how to help me improve as a speaker. She did a wonderful job giving the information we needed to complete assignments and be successful in our speeches.,1
Dr. Parker was the perfect prof for this class. He is energetic and cares about his students.,1
"Too opinionated and very unapproachable. Doesn't listen well to students in class, students have to repeat their question several times before he understands. His lectures are cheesey, full of rants and yelling. I felt uncomfortable in his lectures",0
Want his students to succeed,1
"Really heavy on lectures that are not interesting. He didn't really use the planetarium, maybe once or twice. You can go to class every day but still manage to end up with a low grade. The tests were really difficult. Its nice he really likes what he teaches but I still wouldn't take another class with the guy.",0
"STOR 435 is a hard class, so be prepared for that when you sign up with Pipiras. Nonethess, I personally think he does a great job. There are homeworks due every class that make sure that you keep up to date with what he's teaching. He also gives quizzes so there are lots of grades and not just midterms.",1
"Terrible teacher, horrible attitude...useless!",0
Zwier is a very nice guy and great teacher. You can tell he enjoys what he's doing. A lot of people struggled with this class but as long as you stay up to date with what's  going on in class you will be fine. He also will help you out if you go into office hours.,1
"Just don't. Worst professor I'd ever had. No clear grading criteria, his lectures were painfully long and irrelevant, just don't. Take someone else, ANYONE else. ",0
He just found out quizlet was a thing and is pissed. Now he's trying to get permission to give almost all of his students F's (I'm not joking) and having every single one of his students be investigated by the Dean and several other departments. If the students are found to have used quizlet they will fail and lose all of their scholarships.,0
The test are very difficult and require a lot of studying. His lecture is powerpoint based which has about 30 slides each subject and he goes through way too fast. there's no homework but still one of my hardest classes.,0
"He is completely crazy. Avoid him if you can. You can get a good grade, but he totally sucks. He is loony, stupid, and an absolutely pathetic teacher. :-(",0
"The subject is far from entertaining, but he knows to sprinkle some wit as he goes.",1
"If you like puzzles, then this class will make perfect sense for you.  The key to success on his open-note exams is a great ""cheat sheet""--a paper with literally everything on it.  Rewrite your notes, and you should be fine. A lot of people complain about how it's memorization of mechanisms--it really isn't--it's learning patterns.",1
Great class and a caring teacher.,1
"I am a senior and this is by far the hardest online class that I have taken. He requires a book and gives you notes but you cannot find the information for the exam. I have had to use google for every exam and it takes me approximately 5 hours to complete ONE exam! It is like he expects all of this to be common sense, will never recommend him",0
"She's a good teacher in the sense she knows what she's teaching. Her biggest downside is that her exams are much harder than her classwork, homework, and practice exams.",0
"Doesnt teach the material, then expects you to understand difficult problems that she doesnt even know how to explain or do. Avoid this professor she doesnt know what shes talking about or how to teach.",0
"Prof. Osoba is extremely knowledgeable about the field of Economics, and cares about each of his students. Your grade is the sum of 3 open-ended exams (and 6 optional Problem Sets). If you are not a strong test taker, I would not recommend taking this professor. (NO TEXTBOOK REQUIRED FOR THIS CLASS!)",1
"Almost easy A if you do homework ON TIME. Workload is heavy, but it is possible as long as you are not a procrastinator.",1
"Lab reports have crazy grading requirements, got 90% on all tests but probably averaged a b on lab reports",1
"He is a good professor. He tells you what you need to know for his test. study the power points and you will do good. He does use the book, but I have yet to use it, I just go off the slide shows and I do good on the test. He has one paper 3 pages, easy. Easy teacher, he rambles a bit but he knows his stuff. weird guy, but good teacher.",1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Not only is the man boring and lectures for the entire class, but doesn't teach out of the textbook, so you never know what exactly to study. His tests look like he copied and pasted questions out of a newspaper. Very confusing and uninteresting.",0
"He has good real world examples!The test are muli choice and come from the books test bank (study it to pass plus and the end chapt problems ALL OF THEM!) Your grade come from 90% test 10% HW. Teaching style is his notes which are more concept based. This class is hard, pass rate is 50%. I would take someone else, I got an A if different prof.",0
"greatest teacher ive ever had, will help with every aspect of your life, just ask",1
"Very funny, loud, fast talking teacher. He gives out very specific study guides and goes through most of them with you in class. Tests are simple and curved. I loved his class the first semester so I specifically asked for him for my 2nd semester of History.",1
"The only class where violence from the teacher means she likes you. I think the class is so difficult it isn't even helpful. She needs a KITA (but would that only be forward movement, or real motivation) I would be terrified if she was my belly dancing teacher",0
"Mr. Strange is the best professor I have had so far. He loves life, enjoys what he teaches, and has some GREAT stories. But I warn you, if you are looking for an easy A this might not be the class to take. If you do take this class be prepared to go to class everyday and listen and take down notes. But overall this was a GREAT CLASS!!",1
"She is a tough grader. Gives you a zero for the littlest mistake. Not able to get back to you on time with email. Overall, she is a terrible teacher. If you take her make sure to read and reread every single rule otherwise you'll be penalized severely.",0
"If I had a dollar every time he was condescending, I'd probably be the next Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos. He's very knowledgeable but lacks wisdom.",0
"Long pauses and um when students ask for clarification. He is unclear and hard to understand. He has high expectations when it comes to writing essays. He's looking for a specific type of writing... I do not recommend his class. Lecture does not help, you're on your own. ",0
"She's a good teacher overall, a nice person, but I rated her low because during lectures, I would have absolutely no idea what she was saying. I would sit in the front row at times, and still not understand her, all I could hear was mumbling.",0
"offers great instruction from an actor's perspective, not JUST a professor",1
"So awful. Worst professor you will have at UCONN. Her class should be for philosophy majors only, and philosophy IV or something. She grades everything so tough and if you complain to her via email she basically doesnt do anything to fix it. Take this class and youll want to die! If you have this class in your cart delete it before it is too late",0
"Great professor! Make a dry subject so engaging. Study for exams, go to class, and you'll be fine!",1
"Go to class, It's worth every second! I love his lectures.",1
"EASY A Take this class to raise your GPA. Show up and sit in the front row, converse with him as much as you can. He has amazing stories but this will also make you more likely to earn a high grade. Easiest classes I have taken and I enjoy him so much. I highly recommend world myth as well.   Do not buy the $80 book, the old version is fine.",1
almost through with the class and still dont know whats going on. not recommended! ,0
"She's just like they say - awful. I had straight A's before taking this class. Try to learn as much Java as you can before taking this class. Everything that was covered on the 1st test I learned online over the summer. But everything past the 1st test I learned from JD & that's when my grade started to fall. Rapidly. GOOD LUCK, you'll need it.",0
"This class so incredibly boring that I had to start bringing my laptop in order to stay awake and remotely pay attention. She's not always clear, but she's very passionate about what she's teaching and knows a LOT about it. Don't take it if you're not extremely into art history. Take a different course.",0
"Excellent prof.  Well thought out lectures, slides available online.  Clear website.  Speaks clearly.  Very professional.",1
His three and a half hour lectures are mandatory. If you leave during your one 15 minute break out will be marked fully absent. Lectures make no sense and he rambles on about anything and everything. Assigns readings late the night before assignments are due,0
"Prof. Bray is amazing, and very knowledgeable. Made sure to meet with me even though I couldn't make her office hours and was more than ready to help with my essay and research. Overall, really sweet.",1
"Do the assigned problems before the lectures, take notes, and create a thorough 1 page of notes for the tests. Jameson truly cares about his students understanding the material and succeeding. He has tons of energy in presenting the lectures and interacting with the class. He also gives extra credit opportunity and drops lowest test score.",1
"I had Dave for CN101 and absolutely LOVED him! He made jokes, used real life examples for the theories, and even helped us to connect theories to our own lives. He tells a lot of funny stories and makes his exam funny as well! Studying is a must in this class as a lot of information is covered and his exams are kind of tough.",1
"Don't listen to the Hertog-bashers.  He's a good teacher and a good guy who knows what he's talking about and who's full of interesting anecdotes.  People are just taking out the fact that they don't like Telecom Research Methods as a subject on him.  Furthermore, he's like amiable uncle!",1
He is by far the hardest physics professor in Kennesaw. He doesn't care if his students understand the material. Overall not a good teacher in my opinion and other peoples opinions as well.,0
Exams are hard.,1
"Really no tags apply to this man. The class was alright, a bit challenging if your're not accustomed to programming. But he is helpful and will answer any questions. Have your things turned in on time or he has a hissy fit. Some days he comes in that way though so just try to stay out the way. Most times he's in an ok mood. Do the work, you'll pass",1
"Hes super passionate about ethics and virtue. He keeps it real and helps you to understand whats really important. Loved his lectures. Make sure you go to class, most of the tests are based on what was said in class.",1
"This class was absolutely wonderful. Professor Evans is one of the most knowledgable and accomplished musicians I have ever met and he makes all of the concepts very easy to understand. This is a really great interactive class, you get a lot of time playing the piano, and we learned SO much in such a short time. Not many tests, easy grader.",1
"TV studio, this guy knows it all but tried to rely on teaching us practical skills using quciktime videos of older lectures. Not a good idea as they were unwatchable and we had to get him to actively assist filming homework projects. This guy is very late at collecting and marking homework and so you dont get a sense of progression.",1
The digital computataion class is not a difficult class. Only Hulls makes the class hard. I personally believe she enjoys failing students.,0
She obviously does not enjoy teaching. She sighs and gets frustrated EVERY TIME  you ask a question! She doesn't let you see your graded tests unless you make an appointment and go see her in her office (which i wouldn't mind if she didn't have such limited office hours). She refuses to answer any kind of homework or project questions. Avoid!!!!!!,0
Those who rate Vitoria poorly are those that do not show up to class and do not put effort into their work.  Yes she can sometimes be unorganized but in the end she tells you multiple times what is needed for each assignment and what is to be expected.  If you show you care about what you do then any class you take will be beneficial to your career,1
"CPSC 121 is a challenging course that covers a lot of material, and Patrice definitely knows what he's talking about. Assignments are quite challenging and often contain material that was not learned during lecture.",1
"Awesome professor! A very interesting class if you like science. A lot of reading but as long as you go to class, you will understand the material a lot easier. He is a very good professor and makes sure that everyone feels comfortable in his class. ",1
"Carlson chooses great texts, but there's A LOT of reading for every class. His handwriting is deplorable, so listen up to take notes - which you need to take A LOT of (final study guide had nearly 70 terms to memorize). Dry sense of humor and incredibly smart, but can be a little highbrow.  I'm an A student and got a B+ by the skin of my teeth. ",1
Doesn't explain anything. Just shows examples but doesn't explain how to do them. I DON'T recommend her!,0
"If you have any doubt or question, he will answer back with another question. He does not care about telling you the answer. Lectures are very boring too. The content of the class is good and the programming assignments are nice and challenging.",0
Not great. Doesnt always know what shes talking about. Got through this class using crash course videos. Very tough grader but doesnt explain theories well in class and is typically all over the place. Very minimal homework but tests are worth a lot and are typically essay exams.,0
"Favorite teacher at LC hands down! If you do not know what professor to choose for any of your English classes, go with slay! His classes are fun, he is easy to tak to, and the work load is not heavy.",1
"I'm telling you now, never write about abortion and race. Dr. Kelly is very opinionated. You know how most teacher are paid to grade you on content, well she doesn't do that. If you write about something she doesn't like, don't be surprised if she argues with you in a conference and gives you a C because you dont feel the same way. DONT TAKE HER",0
"Ahmad wasn't the worst professor I've had, but definitely not my favorite. She's super indecisive and constantly changes her mind on what she wants on assignments. The class consisted of reading short stories and writing about them. The final paper was a research paper that had to be 10 pages, and she gave no insight into what she was looking for.",0
"Worst professor ever. No review sessions, no sample questions for quiz. Had a quiz early in the semester that is multiple choice and either trick questions or obscure memorization of specific case facts. About 70% of the questions less than 50% of the class got correct, and several of the questions less than 30% of the class got correct. Bad class.",0
"She is very intelligent and obviously loves what she teaches.  She does expect a lot out of her students, but what are we paying for anyway?  I have learned the most in her class than any of my other spanish classes.",1
"I didn't think he was that bad. He's a genuinely nice guy who will help you if you need it. His lectures aren't thrilling and he says ""uh"" a lot (he also gets mixed up because of dyslexia at times), but he puts a ton of notes on the board that help somewhat. The exams were fairly difficult, the quizzes were easy but were made up by the TA.",1
"Darius Sollohub is the WORST professor to exist in NJIT. He will pick favorites. He is childish, immature, will fall asleep during your presentations, give you bad advice and get annoyed when you dont listen to it and still succeed. He will ruin your opportunities and try to screw up your life if you argue with him once. Stay away save yourself.",0
Great Prof! Very funny!! Made difficult material easy to understand! 10/10!!,1
"If you don't put in work for Felix, you're dead in the water. MATH210 is essentially self taught, since his lecture style is hard to understand. Exam questions are pulled from the homework, so as long as you do ALL of it (which is no small task since it is a ton) you'll pass. Only take him if you are confident in your work ethic and discipline.",1
"I have nothing against the person, but him as a TEACHER is horrible. Attendance is mandatory. His course structure is extremely unclear. No visual support (PP) in his lectures. Even if you are good in economics (I always had in the As), you will likely have a poor grade. Not available outside lectures. AVOID HIM AT ALL COST IF YOU CAN.",0
I'm a math major and my GPA was solid 3.5+. but after taking one class with him.. ughhhh no. just no. please no. my first time failing class in my whole life.,0
"Dont take her if you have a better choice, otherwise you will find out yourself keep losing points on something unimportant and irrelevant to what you have learned from this class",0
"She will tell you exactly what will be on the exams. Lectures are a bit boring though. She has a tough to e explaining several topics. I went to other's help sessions to get better explanations. Overall she's ok, and you can get a good grade, even if you don't understand the material.",1
"Absolutely horrible. Anyone who follows politics should not take this class. Anyone who doesnt believe in the 9/11 conspiracy should not take this class. If you're not on the radical left, you will not enjoy this class at all.",0
"The fact that I am doing this review in his class can't be a good thing... Boring doesn't even start to describe the class. As I look around one kid is watching Shawshank Redemption, another is on Instagram, and one is playing games on his computer. Be ready to hear a lot about ""yumans"", ""norons"", and ""yuuge"" or ""eNORmus trowma"".",0
"I completely regret having this professor. Math is already hard enough, for me at least, but she makes it 100x harder. She gives way too many assignments for anyone to keep up with. Homework, quizzes, tests, lessons, more homework, test reviews, and it never ends. I do not reccommend her unless youre looking for a challenge.",0
"The professor is always late to class by 30 minutes to 1 hour, and she just repeats ""client is the driver you are the SUV"" all the time in every class which is not helpful at all. Also she would not show up at the scheduled appointment for discussion on your paper",0
"Very unfair grader.  You can understand all the concepts in class and think you are doing fine, but fail tests.  You have to do things exactly has he wants it, and you will be his good side with grades.  He teachs the lessons well, but is such a tool.",0
"He is very passionate about the subject, but absolutely NO help to you whatsoever. He throws curve ball questions in everything. He covers material in class, and then quizzes you on something completely different. Meanwhile a quiz can cover 7 chapters of content! Exams have some quiz questions on them, that may be your only help.",0
This guy thinks that he's teaching something like CLAS 401 instead of CLAS 201.  I heard great things about him going in but instead got to experience 250+ pgs of mind-numbingly boring reading per week along with a challenging paper due five days before his final exam.  Would def. NOT recommend.,0
"Online class was well organized and straightforward. One assignment due every week, but self paced if you want to get ahead. Responds to emails quickly but grading was a little slow where you won't get your HW graded before the exam on that material. Focuses more on concepts - no memorizing names and dates. Overall good professor, I recommend her.",1
"Joy was a fun and pleasant professor. The course is difficult, but she was always available to assist with any issues. I feel she graded us fairly based on our abilities and effort. Be sure to incorporate her critiques to show an effort and you should do well.",1
She is so scatter brained. Her reviews are like 60+ slides. All tests are cumulative.,0
"Extremely boring, takes attendance daily, don't learn anything from him.",0
"Loved her class. She is open to suggestion and arguments in class (provided their productive), her power points were great. The book use will REALLY help, you could get by w/out it, but not very well. Her personality is absoltely charming. She also defines the difference between being a woman, and a lady. My fave prof to date.",1
His test is hard and never test on anything from homework!,0
"Good professor, makes you learn rather than memorize. Not naturally talented in physics, but he is always more than willing to give help if you put in the work",1
"His lectures are so frustrating: he just stands at the board and rambles on without actually checking if you understand it or not.  He gives a normal amount of homework which are pretty hard, but the test questions are always easier than the homework.  You have to put in a lot of individual effort in order to do well.",0
"Horrible at entering grades, kept blaming it on the computer. He is still entering grades and the final is tomorrow. Is very easy to get off topic and ranted about politics for most of the class. Grades hard even though he did not give us any feedback on our writing until after the fact. Avoid at all costs!",0
Dr. Lockett is very engaging and her lectures are never boring. She always relates what we are learning to real-life situations. She is very understanding and gives you the same respect that you give her. Put in the effort and you will pass the class. She posts on Blackboard exactly how she expects the homework so it is very easy to understand.,1
"Intro to Special Ed. - Hybrid Prof. Hutton knows a lot about special education & has multiple children with disabilities. There are 27 modules you have to do throughout the course, you can work ahead (recommended), they are easy but with a good amount of reading.  Study aids are helpful Gives good constructive feedback - rubrics can be wordy...",1
Clear in expectations and very caring for his students. It's a pity he's retiring!,1
"I loved this class! Dr. Butts is such a sweet lady and is always there if you need help.  Quizzes at the end of every chapter, so be ready. Two book assignments, three tests, and one five page paper along with a few other homework assignments. If you don't come to class, you'll fail, but attendance is not taken.  Don't get the textbook either.",1
one of the hardest professors I've had at Rutgers. Who not recommend taking him. Hard to understand a lot of the time as well.,0
"Dr. Wright was my least favourite prof for all of my first year courses. He rambles about nothing, and calls PowerPoint's ""a pathetic way to teach"". Completely unorganized, and usually late for class, with very little motivation. Overall terrible prof and should be avoided if possible.",0
"Overall decent professor, he does well communicating the course material and answering questions in class, but if you fall into trouble with your grade he is very sarcastic and rather unapproachable, he does not enjoy working with struggling students",0
He gives jokes every week in class,1
"I came out of an exam thinking I got a 100% on it. When we got it back, turns out i got an 80%. I definitely deserved a 100% but she is a really annoyingly hard grader. If you miss the word ""the"" she takes off 10 points. All tests are written, no multiple choice. Pay attention in class. Read chapter summaries!!!!!!",0
Great teacher. Definately need to pay attention to notes in class but if you do and study you'll do fine.,1
"Moes is a Plato scholar but a poor, uninspiring teacher. He uses PHI101 to teach Christian interpretation of Plato. He lectures heavily & does not take questions or engage in thoughtful and relevant conversations. Takes attendance, gives no homework, only three exams & an essay.  Need book, no clear syllabus, poor language. Take notes; easy A.",0
"So my class was originally in person during this year but switch to online since he thought it would be best for us. I didn't really enjoy the in-person version of his class since he would get off topic a lot. When online with his slides and lecture videos, he somehow found a way to get off topic during those. Nice guy, but not suited for teaching",0
"It was the worst class I've ever taken. It's supposed to be a com class about pop culture, but instead you watch films from 1957. I'm not quite sure how that is relating to com at all. You take a quiz on every movie, which even if you watch the movie you will most likely fail. It's a required course. So change your focus of com, like now!",0
"Nice lady, but she is not a good prof. Takes days to respond to emails, and it is very difficult in general reaching out to her outside of class, even when she has office hours. The group project is challenging, and I don't recommend her as a prof.",0
"She is the most helpful teacher I have ever had.  I did poorly on the tests but she helped me tons in office hours and after doing well on the final (thanks to her) I finished with a decent grade.  She really cares about her students and wants to see them succeed.  She does move somewhat fast, but otherwise she is an excellent professor.",1
"This is by far my worst mark yet, but macro is it's own beast. Study what he posts. Use different versions and study it so you know it like the back of your hand. STUDY THE GRAPHS. Review the multiple choice questions in the study guide. Yes there are like 500, know them all ! The text is very hard to follow so do the study guide questions.   ",1
"Extremely tough professor. No matter how much you try to understand by reading the text, you will still not understand. His exams are not even close to the book; therefore, impossible to study for. I have tried so hard to pass, and I failed... My average GPA is 3.7. I tried so hard to pass and without feedback its impossible. Do not take this class",0
"Her lectures are so hard to comprehend, she goes off topic all the time. If you ask a question during class, good luck. She rambles and forgets to answer your question. Grades solely based off midterm, one paper, and final. Doesn't cover everything on the exam in class. Do the extra credit though. She's very sweet and smart but not the best teacher",0
The worst professor of all time. Absolutely awful professor.,0
"I'm an alumni now, but he is the best professor I had. I loved his classes.",1
she is really knowledgeable but her tests are really hard she sticks to writing on one side of the board too many changes to the syllabus throughout the semester you will end up teaching yourself,0
Prof. Abdallah is an amazing lecturer and I cannot emphasize enough on his teaching style. His blended teaching style with the online system is incredible. He is very caring and accommodates to the difficulties we face very well. His marking is fair and is straight up the best prof ever.,1
"Difficult to comprehend sometimes, but clearly an expert and very friendly!",1
He knows the stuff and he is really good teacher. all you have to do is participate in his class. You learn alot of stuff which you can in real life. He is one of the best teacher in computer science. I wish i had him in other courses.,1
"Nice, but talks to her students a bit too much like a kindergarten teacher would talk.  She didn't put any of the quizzes on the syllabus which kind of sucked and in my opinion is unfair.  She grades hard on the paper...HELLO, it is a LIBERAL STUDIES class...NOT a WRITING CLASS.  She also makes it clear who she doesn't like at times.",0
"Lectures are long and you have to take a lot of notes. Exams do not cover everything, but can't ignore anything. Spends more time explaining the course with current events than any professor I've had. The downside is that there's not a super clear plan/prepared notes/decks. Very tough on work but also one of the friendliest guys on campus.",1
"She is a really interesting and fun teacher! Her class would not make you want to sleep or space out, she would make the her lecture really easy to understand and also would make you think about psychology and cognition. Not just boring lecture and you would forget about it. Take her class! ",1
If you like to read A LOT and be bored and confused. Take this class... I love Philosophy but she gives us complicated readings and even though she goes over it in class it's confusing and SO boring... Hardly anyone comes to class either. Shes a nice lady though? =/,0
"Walker is the way to go for econ. Clear explanations, and his tests are much more straightforward than Self or Olsen, who love to throw in trick questions. I had econ prior to taking this class, and thought he made it pretty interesting. Go to CL, do the workbook questions, and you'll do well.",1
Interesting course. She is there to help you. Attendance is a plus since she gives you the answers to her test. She tells you exactly whats going to be in the test. MUST BE AN IDIOT NOT TO PASS [with at least a B]. Gave 100 points of extra credit. Overall a kick bak class.,1
The worst professor I have ever had! Treats his 200 level class like we are all English majors taking honor/400+. I have never failed anything till this class. When I tried to approach him about it he brushed me off. He does not use Blackboard and does not make clear (in writing) what he wants on any assignments. Do not take as an elective.,0
Horrible class. Professor did not give any objective information whatsoever. We learned his own viewpoint on events and nothing else. He even renamed a war due to the fact that he felt the war was inappropriately named. Depends entirely on books and his TAs to do the grunt work. Worst class/professor I've ever seen. Avoid at all costs.,0
"Dr. Hamilton is the best prof I've had.  He is very helpful and his lectures are interactive.  He started the class by saying he wanted to teach it and made a point of getting to know the students' names.  His assignments all built on each other and at the end of the semester, you had made a console game.  Amazing prof, highly recommended.",1
"I took American Diplomatic History I first semester, and would have taken the second half of that course if it was not so early. It was an interesting class, very revealing. Dr. Manchester is very intelligent, knows her stuff. Lots of reading and awkward class discussions, but it is a good class. A couple of papers each semester.",1
Very strict professor AVOID him.,0
"Prof. Thoo is a great teacher, but his lectures do not correlate with what he tests you on. Given the short time limit, you're set to answer questions that require ""outside the box"" thinking. While they're still relevant to the chapter, it's not what was taught on the board. He's a very difficult teacher with not much room for error.",1
"Unfortunately, I agree with a lot of the other comments -- if I was going to skip a day of econ, it was always Marty's lecture. Attendance isn't really necessary; you can easily fly by using the powerpoints online -- even the reviews were kind of pointless. She is very nice and does offer a ton of extra credit, so at least her course is bearable.",1
She was a very sassy professor who was a very messy teacher. The things we did in class never made sense and never helped me understand things. The homework online is hard and not related to the class work and she often enter things wrong and has to fix it. Get a tutor and go to the mat center and you can learn it better on your own. & YouTube vids,0
"he will make your life a living hell if you dont read or pay attention in class. tests are hard. if you want to pass this class with an ""A"" good luck or take this with a different teacher",0
"Easy class, gives you a study guide that he wrote so all the questions are related to the tests that he writes. Go to class everyday, take notes, and do the study guide and it is an easy 4.0",1
Currently taking her summer online trig. class. Best decision I could have made on a summer course. Her material is organized & easy to follow. The homework is easy to understand and we get 2 attempts on quizzes. On exams we can take a note card with formulas. Do homework and you will pass the quizzes. Would definitely take again,1
I'm horrible at math and I did ok in the class. You definitely need to study and get passing grades on the tests. He returns the tests and if you correct the answers you missed you get 1/3 point. DO THE HOMEWORK! GO TO CLASS!,1
Not helpful at all goes through problems easist way possible not good poor way if teaching would not take again,0
Fair grader.  Makes you work.,1
"Dr. Nick is a very GREAT professor. Very clear about what was expected on the 1st day of class. The webwork was very helpful & also 20% of your grade. He sent out emails always informing students of exam dates, as well as where to go to get help (if needed). Come to class and take good notes & you're sure to pass the class. Very fair in grading!!!",1
"She talks about personal life more than she teaches. does not offer any help when a person is asking. she rely too much on student help. Her accent is heavy, so you wont understand what she says, and she don't repeat herself. I am not bad at math, its actually my favorite subject but she makes me HATE it. DON'T BOTHER",0
"Assignments are extremely easy because he practically gives you the answers. The later assignments get a little harder, but they are all doable. His lectures are extremely boring though and all of the notes are on the website. I didn't do as well on the tests because of not getting the material in class.  I hear he curves generously though.",1
"A funny and, to be honest, very knowledgeable prof, but EXTREMELY TERRIBLE at explaining stuff. Repeats simple things 1000 times, but skips the hard parts leaving it to you to figure out. Makes simple things even more difficult than they are. Also, a very tough grader and not approachable at all. Will never take again",0
"Professor Getty is passionate about her job as a speech pathologist but when it comes to teaching her students as a professor, she is terrible. The tests are formatted in ways to trick you which makes them extremely difficult and most of the students reflected getting low grades no matter how much studying. Plus just rude in general when asked ?s.",0
"I really enjoyed Professor Sherwood. She was clear of the expectations, helpful, and involved. So long as you do your reading and turn your assignments in on time, you will be successful.",1
"Really great professor! The class is really easy and there is NO TEXTBOOK!!! Really take this class, it is awesome and really fun.",1
"Class is easy, it's related to my major though so take that with a grain of salt. THIS PROFESSOR THOUGH WAS HORRENDOUS. Wastes class time by ranting about the liberals and NDP. All of which is just him yelling to the class about the government and how flawed our country is. His notes are on a projector and his handwriting is near impossible to read",0
Paul was one of the absolute best professors I ever had.  He thinks about and feels the experience of life deeply.  Having him as your instructor is a privilege.,1
"He doesn't value opinions on literature that don't agree with his own. He gets annoyed if you try to bring up ideas he didn't think of first. He picks a handful of favorites at the beginning of the semester and ignores everyone else. He's disrespectful to female students. And if he doesn't like you, he won't give feedback or answer questions.",0
"Arevelo is a terrible teacher. She has a very heavy accent which makes it difficult to understand her lecture, as well as making it easy to loose focus and interest. If you have to miss an exam the only time you can make it up is 2 days before the final(she will not budge with this even if you have a good reason). Test are very hard. DO NOT TAKE!",0
Exams are very difficult that if there was not a curve everyone would fail. Theres 3 exams including the final and homework and one paper that is really easy.,1
"BORING BORING BORING LECTURES! I'm not sure if he actually knows what he is teaching. All he teaches from the lecture are EXACTLY the same as the textbook but the exams were WAYYYYY harder. Exams were all multiple choices....it may seem easier, but it has no part mark. AND ITS HARD!",0
Do not take this professor unless you are a fulltime student and enjoy spending over 20 hours EACH WEEK doing homework. Expect work to be assigned every single day. That is not an over exaggeration. She has a firm belief in quantity over quality. I learned very little and her interactions with students are cringe-worthy and combative.,0
"BEST PROF EVEEEEER, as long as you do the work you will be fine, you actually learn with him not just to pass but for life, he is sooooo funny that makes the class interesting. Also if you need something he will help you he is very caring with his students. This is the first prof. I'm actually going to miss. TAKE HIM YOU'LL NOT REGRET IT!!!!!",1
"If youre debating on taking stat with seraphin, I recommend against it. Its doable, but your grade will suffer. For word probs on the exams, you must right EXACTLY what he wants or you get points off. The material itself is quite easy if you pay attention, but hes very picky and if you go to office hours, prepare for him to make u feel dumb!",0
"This class is easy.  He gives you take home tests which he uses the same questions on monthly in class tests.  There is a lot of report writing but only summaries of websites, usually just 1 page double spaced.  A little bit of work but you can pass with an A if you study take home tests.",1
"Dr. Du definitely your choice for this class! He starts tough, at least looks like, but he gives a lot curves on the exams after he found out the average is not that high. Class time is the most important personally speaking, he gives a lot using the class time. Plus review session and practice questions for each exam are must!",1
Worst professor I've ever had. Tried going to him for help but didn't help or care at all. Don't take him,0
"She was a pretty good prof. She knew her stuff - however, I really didn't learn a whole lot throughout the class. Sometimes she rambles on and on but she can be really funny at times. Tests are easy - open book, open note. Pretty simple, tolerable class.",1
"Overall, a bad prof. Every single lecture he goes off topic... talks about OJ Simpson for 30 minutes, then another 30 minutes complaining the previous professor did not erase the board. For the midterm, he didn't book the room and caused everyone to wait another 30 minutes, and then marked really hard. Final exam no help at all, and replies LATE!!!",0
Humans and their food seemed like an easy class but no it is not. There is so much reading and quizzes for all of them. Every week. There was a 6 page essay about a food memory and a 10 page SINGLE SPACED essay. DONT TAKE THE CLASS. But she is really nice.,0
"Liz is a smart, interesting person who is pretty knowledgeable in ethics. That being said, she is oftentimes unclear about what she wants on her tests and papers. Still, if you at least go to class occasionally you will do ok, as long as you can understand what she's talking about. The material is a bit tough to grasp at first in this class.",1
"His lectures were interesting and engaging. Midterm and final were easy, but he was very tough with the marking, for both tests and assignments. Assignments were challenging. Overall, great prof for CS 341.",1
"Bartoli is one of my favorite professors in the psych department. I've taken three classes with him and they are usually the highlight of my semester. Usually his classes are in the morning, but he's so energetic you won't mind going. His lectures are short, but his tests involve a lot of writing. Skim through the book and take good notes  A",1
He is a good. Thank you!,1
"I don't understand how a professor can ""teach"" a class like this. Essentially you're given a handful of PDF's, told to buy subscriptions to different services, and then left to complete assignments and projects with minimal instructions and examples. How on earth can this university accept money for this level of non-involvement?",0
She gets straight to the point. Classes are very short. Goes over the notes numerous times so it sticks in your head. Not a bad teacher but her tests include material that we never cover in class which screws you over because you never know what she might ask you.,1
Bayo Is an amazing professor! as long as you show up and pay attention i n class you will pass! He also ives to give out snacks on holidays and he loves learning about you as a student! hes also a great advisor! Love Bayo!,1
"Honestly, this class is very Biased. For one, she comes right out and tells you she's a feminist... She also imposes her beliefs on you in the most annoying manner. She's OBSESSED with women's issues and the concept of Millenialism. It's ridiculously boring and I just hate attending. Her tests are ridiclous also. Pass this class up if you can.",0
"DO NOT TAKE HER! You don't know what to expect on the exams because her study guides are too specific. And she does not explain the diagrams from the ppts very well which caused so much confusion. She talks too fast. Oh, and she does not attempt to adjust her teaching style in order to make the class easier to understand (even if you ask her to).",0
A little more difficult than Math 191 but I still made a high A. He makes it clear what he wants and has bonus points on all of the tests which he has a study guide for. He will also help you during office hours.,1
"She's a nice person but she's a terrible professor, the exams have nothing to do with the material you learn in class. She expects you to learn by yourself from the book and she doesn't help much outside of class. You could learn the same with only the book. She is not good at explaining the material from the book and I would never take her again.",0
"The man is the worst professor I have ever had.  Mumbles as he proceeds to read off of slides of code which don't really make any sense to anyone.  Useless if you ask him a question, he will just talk about something else.  Tests are impossible...class average is around a 60.  Don't take a class with him EVER.",0
"Very tough grader. If you dont do the work with the exact method he teaches he marks it all incorrect. Tests are way to hard, he does simple versions of problems in class, but exams have complicated problems. Would not take again. Do NOT take if you are not a math pro.",0
"Such a personality makes me think whether wisdom can be distilled from a prideful nature, or maybe the root of pride is some deep and unresolvable insecurity.  There should be no place allowed in the classroom for belligerent pride.",1
Not very helpful & unorganized.  Doesn't respond to emails or give clear answers to questions.,0
"My advice: Criticism is not a personal attack. It is a demand for you to raise the standards you've set for yourself. She demands excellence, but is looking for growth and potential. Most people will never encounter another person more interested in helping others better themselves. Be sure to communicate with her and your classmates.",1
"Avoid him, seems charismatic at first, but has an extremely stubborn attitude and refuses to listen to reason. Asks questions that cannot be answered using material discussed/taught. Obscure grading confusing question structure will make you extremely frustrated. People who give him good ratings don't value a fair professor. Funny doesn't mean good",0
"This man is the greatest teacher i have ever had. I love him so much. he makes the class fun, he's organized and he is just an amazing prof all over",1
"Bob is an extremely helpful professor. Not only did he help me with my writing as a professor, but has remained a mentor. I'd call him a friend of mine. He's wonderful at lecturing, gives great material to read, and leads the best workshops that I've ever been a part of. If you're interested in creative writing at IU, take his class",1
"Class is pretty easy, does iClicker. Lecture exams are easy, you don't have to study. You can find almost all the answers online. Lab is really easy but the projects take some time to finish. His lectures are boring but the videos he shows are pretty interesting and there will be some questions on the exams from the videos.",1
SMAD 251 AND 301. Let's just say I have a crush on him and I wouldn't be ashamed if he knew it. SMAD 251 is cool and a fun class but if you have written/read a script before then you don't really learn too much. 301 is late but only one day a week. Turner is deathly boring so take Reynolds. He really facilitates discussion and we look at clips,1
"This teacher is a great person, but not a great teacher. She did not teach this whole semester. All she ever talked about was her kids and her life. She only taught a lecture three times  the whole semester, and still expected you take quizzes over material each week. Get the book, its the only way you will pass.",0
"The lecture is hard, unclear.",0
"Tate, is great! the people who complain are complaining about hard work/having to figure out the answer for themselves.Tate is a professor who will push you, learning how to be an individual who takes guidance but is their own leader, and he likes it when you test him that is the point to see how strongly you hold to your own thoughts and ideas.",1
He teaches things pretty clear but his exams are really hard.,1
HE IS A HARD PROFESSOR YES! BUT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE A TEACHER AND THEY ARE TOUGH IN THE BEGINNING AND THEN THE LOOSEN UP AT THE END? WELL THAT'S HIM. THAT IS JUST A FRONT. HE WILL MAKE YOU WORK FOR YOUR GRADE BUT IT'S WORTH IT! HE DOES SHAKESPARE JUSTICE THE WAY HE PERFORMS THE CLASSICS. HE WILL GIVE YOU A GOOD GRADE EVENTUALLY!,1
"Klaus' lectures are dry and extremely long- couldn't stay awake. He can be nice, but he was extremely rude when I emailed him and showed he didn't care about helping me at all. If you go to class, are on time and take decent notes, you should be fine, but that being said he marks tough on the exam. The textbook is often more helpful than the prof.",0
"Do not take this class if you are not confident in your math skills. He works example problems on the board, but he skips the small mental math steps which can make things very confusing. I had to go to the tutors every day after class. If it was not for the tutors I would not have passed the class.",0
This teacher was the worst professor I have ever had.  She belittles and talks down to students on a regular basis.  She also never teaches until the end of class and refuses to help students  when asked for help.  People like her should retire before they stop caring about their students as she does.,0
Horrible person in general she doesn't care about people,0
He is incredibly specific on what he wants and will grade accordingly so be careful with tests and quizzes because you will flunk them if they are not worded properly. He seems nice but he is all over the place and in class you will constantly be jumping back and forth between subjects.,1
Mr. Randolph was extremely knowledgeable and helped us understand the content. He's reasonable but doesn't like you to not pay attention or be on your phones-typical professor. You'll enjoy his class.,1
"Nancy has a way with words. By that, I mean she gets up to her lecture podium and performs lectures in the style of ""rap god"" by Eminem. The textbook will be your best friend in this class, but the lectures are worth going to know what is up. The weekly quizzes come with a difficulty I cannot describe - they're essentially impossible.",0
The best and the kindest professor in the world .. yes in the world .. she will make sure you get the materials. Take her and you will love her for rest of the life .,1
"Looking back, i feel like the material for this class was way overcomplicated by Hines' teaching. He went way too fast and messed up more times than I could count while solving problems. I highly recommend going to Johnny Prints and picking up the slides used in class. Get ready to teach yourself this whole course.",0
"Solomon likes to talk about himself a lot and carry on lectures. The class is definitely an easy A and I recommend it if you need a boost. Attendance is mandatory most of the time, but it helps boost your grade. Also, posting on the blog is a pain but really is necessary. The guests are more interesting then him.",0
"Difficult and very time consuming. Explains basically nothing, so be prepared to work it out on your own or ask the TAs. Tests were brutal, requiring you to hand write code with little to no reference.  Lectures boring, and only sometimes worth attending. Might as well require stackoverflow as the textbook.",0
Very helpful professor and was extremely insightful. Really seems interested in teaching and was verty helpful with problems. Definately see to it that you have him as a prof at least once.,1
Mr. Lobdell is overall a good teacher to have for this subject. He uses the book and summarizes it in his lectures. He only has two tests and a take home final. It is highly recommended that you attend his class each day to help when coming to tests. Give yourself a few days to study for his exams to help get both book and lecture notes down.,1
"Dr. Miller was an easy A, but his class can be very boring. He tends to go off topic a lot, almost every week we would have a class discussion about President Trump even though it didn't have to do with the class. We watched two movies and some videos. One presentation on anything you want, and a 1 page final paper about the class. Easy A.",1
"3 tests a semester, plenty of notice given and you only need to read the textbooks to get examples for tests. sosa is always available to talk, and tries to get a discussion going but never calls on you.",1
"This professor has made two of my classmates cry, one of them on multiple occasions.  She very obviously plays favorites, and is not open to views other than her own.  For example, you are wrong if you dont agree with her.  She is by far the worst professor I have had since being at hope college and will avoid her AT ALL COSTS in the future.",0
"This was the most challenging online class I've ever taken! Notes- don't have much info Tests- Not easy to understand (75 Qs, 15 Point), most of the time the notes didn't even have the answer Exercises- long and really confusing (3-5 pgs, 1 point) Discussion Qs- 5-6 Qs asked, you answer 2, long and time consuming! 1 point Save yourself #Honest",0
"I took this course during flex term Spring2016 & finished a month before the end of the course. There were 6 exams,2 case assignments, &1 optional case assignment. The exams could be tricky, but mostly common sense. The case assignments were very easy as long as you clarified your position. I got 50/50 on all case assignments. Very easy, nice prof.",1
"I choose this course only because it is entirely ONLINE. There are two weekly lectures and lots of things to remember. Although the lectures are interesting, I am not going to recommend it. I spent lots of time and worked hard for my paper but the grade I received was sooooooo bad.",1
"R. Gay was the man, what up big dog",1
"A terrible professor. Topics were not what you think you'd learn about in this class. He is hard to reach, doesn't give you a mark until the very end of class. Many students felt similar. He is unclear about what he wants. Topics are not appropriate",0
"he is not very good at explaining the material.  gives chances to ask questions, but takes the whole class time to try to explain, and you still leave confused.  he does assign homework, he will check it all before the test.  doesn't grade for right or wrong answers. if you take this class be ready to learn on your own.",0
"Not as good as other reviews say but is the safest bet to pass statics. Quizzes every week, exams are hw problems & in class ex. Class time spent doing ex. as he walks around checking, group activity & working on the board. you cannot cram the night before you WILL FAIL, go to tutoring his lectures are vague. Gives partial credit on exam problems.",0
"Don't buy the text book. You will not use it. His grading is ridiculous. He was absurd with grading, he would do one on one sessions for your essays, make corrections, then mark you down on your final draft once completed. Even though he made those changes. Hes absolutely hysterical. Just make sure you're a unicorn in your writing to get just a C",0
online class: Can be really easy if you read and study. Make sure you complete all assignments. Teacher is really nice!! Can be an easy A. Always responds fast to e-mail.,1
"Exams are very tricky. The ""study questions"" in the slideshows don't help very much and have almost nothing to do with the exams.",0
"Awful grader. Takes off points for not doing it exactly as he instructs although you understand the problems and your work is in general correct. Don't take him, he will ruin your GPA. If you want to have a good experience at SMC with math professor you need to join the scholars program, otherwise you'll get professors like Mr. Konya. Unfortunately",0
"he is extremely hard for no reason and when you try your best, he makes you feel like a failure. i do not recommend him at all.",0
Nicole Henderson analyzes her students and tries to find what is best for each and every one of them. She genuinely cares about the well-being and success of her students. I sat down with her and she outlined exactly what I needed to do to achieve what I wanted and I am forever grateful for her encouragement.,1
"he is one of the worst prof i've ever had. i cant understand his accent. give me c for no reason, even most of my answers were right. avoid him.",0
"Everything besides the audio from the lectures was awful. He never helped us improve from paper to paper, the tests were super hard and the study guide was WORTHLESS, basically just chapter headings which you could find on your own. Impossible to make an A. 13 of the class droped. On my paper I spent 50+ hours and he said they never give out 100%.",0
"Good, interesting lecturer--don't miss a class and write great notes, and you can pass the quizzes-be detailed. I like how he doesn't let stupid, thoughtless comments go by and makes the idiot attempt to explain him/herself. Book list was ok.  Oh, and he's a hottie. :)",1
Her lectures were extremely important. It didn't always make sense because she did teach a lot in terms of variables but she made up for it by including examples and provides realistic practice problems. She was a great teacher and was really trying to get feedback from students and help them based on the feedback. Tests are straightforward.,1
She has a Phd in genetics but that doesn't translate well to AP. She is almost as confused by the material as the students. Test questions may be randomly plucked from the text. Only 8 students out of 24 left from all the course drops. Massive amount of material. I study every night for 2 hours or more for the A I currently have. You will struggle.,0
"SO BORING. Mostly you have to teach yourself with homework and reading the book because the actual class time is useless. Also, not multiple choice exams.",0
"Om is an interesting breed. he teaches mathematics, not engineering, so you'd better be ready to learn things the proper way. his tests are insanely easy, but somehow people fail them anyway. Very funny also, but sense of humor is quircky to say the least.",1
"Decent lectures, she stops and tries to get people participating which is nice. However, it is so tough to understand her labs and homework assignments. It is like reading Shakespeare. I feel bad for all the international students in the class who have poor English skills.",0
"Tries hard to make class understandable but uses examples as old as him. Notes aren't good because they're examples he came up with. Grade is based only on midterm and final. SUPER Stressful when there's not much to study. Goes over past tests to better understand but still hard. If I graded him, I'd give him a C: acceptable but could do better.",1
"He knows his math.  Teach yourself.  Tough grader.  Hwk assigned but not graded, grade based entirely on 3 exams at 22% each and 1 final at 34%, UCSD summer math is similar.  Teach yourself or fail.  For testing.... no calculator, brief notes on unit circle stuff provided, YOU need to memorize a bunch of other unnecessary references.  Don't take!",0
Flage is such a sweet old man and really funny. But he's just not a good professor. The subject matter is hard as it is and he is really bad at organizing/conveying information clearly. He might be fine in other classes but this is not the class he should be teaching.,0
He's really good if you already know math and could have tested out of the class. He doesn't teach anything. He just does problems on the board without explaining much. Good guy but not a good teacher.,0
"Had her as a TA. Was not enthusiastic, constantly has an attitude, and is not helpful. Seems to want to get through the lab as quick as possible, and has high expectations for students that she can't live up to herself.",0
"If you're looking for a teacher who will actually teach you the course and not sit up there and read a dull textbook- take this guy. By far one of my Top 5 best professors I've had at this school. Not an easy class, no HW or papers but quizzes everyday but doing well will boost your average! Great about office hours and meeting outside of class!",1
This class is very hard. Do not listen to the other reviews.,0
"Absolutely awful. She grades Aplia by average so you get lower grades than what you deserve. She also won't even bother clarifying questions through emails (because it's ""too difficult to explain"" through email) and keeps pushing phone meetings when I clearly stated I don't have the time. Would not recommend!!",0
No answer for all the sample exams.,0
"I CANNOT say enough good things about her! She is very knowledgeable and intelligent. She gives amazing feedback and really helps you grow as a writer. I had to withdraw from another professor's English 102 class, but this class is manageable with her! You learn a lot and her class is so structured. Uses canvas, so that's a plus.",1
Lectures are PAINFULLY boaring. My best tip is to not even attend the lectures and just go to the TA reviews to get the information you need and then study study for the tests. If you can memorize you should be fine.,0
Biased and unorganized. Very repetitive lectures.,1
I took her class in the summer and she was very rude to me and many of the other students. She will call you out for the smallest things and does not take the time to help you learn when you go to talk to her. Her exams are difficult and must be word from word. Definitely wait or take it with another professor!,0
this class was not structured enough for me.  i did not think that it covered the math criteria that should have been necessary.  i thought there were poor teaching skills and not enough interaction between the students and professor adams.,0
"This guy got me hooked on philosophy.  I ended up getting a minor.  I had him for business ethics also, interesting stuff.",1
Professor Boulding is extremely sweet and enthusiastic about the material she teaches! iClicker questions during lectures were easy if you listened and she always encouraged students to visit during her office hours. She also set up midterm and exam review sessions.,1
"One of the best lecturers I've had.  Very funny and he does a good job at keeping students awake during 8am classes... He basically teaches through the use of modern analogies and this is extremely helpful.  Very fair.  No unit tests, only mid-term, final and 2-4 quizzes.  Strongly recommend western civ. for a ""P1"".",1
"One of the most knowledgable, entertaining/funny, and respectable professors I've had in college.",1
Only wouldn't take again because the class was so easy & dont feel that I learned anything during the class. If I had just read the book & not shown up to a class I could've still passed with an A. She's so kind & a lovely person I was just looking forward to learning in this class and was disappointed. If you're looking for an easy A here it is!,1
"I had to write a review after all the not-so-flattering ones that we posted about Greta. She's an amazing teacher, who is nice, accessible, wants to help, and is easy to talk to. Go to her office hours and she'll tell you what to write for your essays. No homework, to tests or quizzes, no mid-term, just 5 essays. Take Greta :)",1
"Class is interesting and Thad is good guy.  He will you out.  All the projects are in LISP and are very time consuming.  If you aren't experienced in LISP, you sure will be.  Tests are long and difficult but open book/note.  You will have a rock-solid grasp on the fundamentals of AI after this course.",1
Hardest class Ive ever taken. He lectures the whole entire class and the tests are so hard no matter how much you study.,0
Exams and assignments are ridiculously difficult.,0
I had Polanco for Public Speaking and I never dreaded going to her class. Her grading criteria is exactly how the syllabus states. If you have perfect attendance she gives you a great amount of bonus points at the end of the semester. Speeches are not graded too hard. Expect to watch videos outside of class for homework. Quizzes are simple.,1
no.,0
I loved the way he related personal experience to the class.,1
I didn't look at her reviews before taking her class. I think she is average overall. I could have done soooo much better if I put in more effort. She teaches and appears to be very available outside of class. She offers extra credit so that was nice. I recommend going to all classes because she lectures every day. I wouldn't recommend her.,1
"This class is a mixed bag. The material is very difficult, and his notes are all diagrams so it's not a good idea to miss class. However, his tests are all long answer and he's a fairly lenient marker. He WILL show up 15 mins late every time, but he's absolutely brilliant. Also - he will mention his work at Stanford every lecture. I kept a tally.",1
"I took his History of Christmas class and let me just say, if you like Christmas do not take this class. He will ruin it for you. 2/3 of the semester was spent on memorizing the nativity scenes from the bible. He skips around a lot and brings in a bunch of unnecessary info you need to know. Tests are hard. Doesn't let you use the bathroom.",0
"Brilliant man.  Had him for Orgo I and am retaking his Orgo II class after I dropped it two years ago.  This class is incredibly difficult, but we are all learning how to think. He will give you a hard time and you might want to die sometimes, but it's all worth it.  Do not bother taking him if you aren't going to work, though.",1
"Ian has some very depressing, hot takes on literature and he often gives uninspiring readings that make it difficult to analyze any given text further. He has a sense of humor but frankly he expects his class to be on a much higher level than they are, he marks participation, but is extremely eager to shoot you down in class.",0
"Easiest class I've ever taken at BSU, show up to class and do homework for other courses to fill the void of how dreadfully boring this course is. He's a nice guy, but not a suited professor. Very lenient when it comes to homework. Minimal homework as it is, it'd be impossible to do poorly in this class. Gives exact answers to midterm/final",1
"Jill is an amazing teacher.  You can tell from the first day she loves teaching and being a nurse.  She's always willing to help if you need it, will tell you when you do or don't need something, and will explain stuff in ways that will just make sense.  I'd pay extra to have her teach every class",1
"Professor de Looze is AMAZING, period. Sometimes he forgets what he's saying, but I honestly think he's racking a brain filled to the brim with sheer KNOWLEDGE. He. KNOWS. EVERYTHING. Extremely helpful and friendly if you approach him with a question. Ties everything together. Looks like James Woods.",1
"Mark Kelland will spend most of the class finding way to brag about himself. The good part? You don't have to show up and you don't have to read his book (Yes, he wrote it. It gives him an opportunity to talk about himself more) just memorize his worksheets. Each quiz is word-for-word off it. Truly a fail in education.",0
poor poor poor,0
"Quite self-righteous teacher. She takes words very personally. What she thinks you said is more important to her, not what you really said. If she doesn't like you, your time in class will be miserable.",0
"He has 3 exam and a final and that is what your grade is dependent on. So if you are not a  GREAT test taker, I wouldn't recommend taking his class at all. It is very boring to sit through class and pay full attention. An A is not ""easy"" to get unless you REALLY work for it. But a B is totally doable.",0
"The workload isn't crazy but she's picky with your papers. You write 3 stories and you'll need to interview at least 2 people for each of them. No book, online quizzes help your grade, the week before a paper is due you don't have class but you go to her office instead so she can look over your paper",1
"nice guy, very unclear. he will tell you to read the textbook, then tells you it's wrong. notes aren't easy because he flies through the slides like a bat out of hell. i'd say don't bother taking notes and just  do the reading but all reading is contradicted. no matter what you're between a rock and a hard place.",0
Professor Hall is truly the best professor I have ever had at UBC. His lectures are insanely clear and easy to grasp all while making the class as interesting as possible. The labs aren't difficult and the exams are very fair.,1
Absolute worst teacher I have had. Grades extremely hard and will only put the hardest possible questions on the test and quiz. Also the longest test has been 6 questions so very little room for error. Literally every test the average score for the class has been failing.,0
"This class did not feel like an intro class. 4 exams and 3 papers, and worksheets that were basically quizzes in discussion. The material he presents was very, very heavy and a lot to process. Gives study guides for exams but it wasn't much help. Exams were tough! goodluck",0
Professor Ren is great! She has a strong personality and isn't afraid to clap back. Can be forgetful but she is very quick to correct things if reminded. Makes this class fun.,1
"Very confusing. You only use the notes you take in class for about 4 different extremely difficult tests throughout the semester. They will do you no good on the weekly online quizzes. I thought he was okay as a person and he seems to know his stuff, but hes not a good professor.",0
"Seems like she doesn't want to be there. Homework is online (extra $40). Acts annoyed if students ask questions. Complains about the dept. head w/ another instructor during lab. As long as you have something scribbled on your lab report you'll get a 10/10. Tests were very hard. I'll be retaking the class, wish I had dropped. Waste of a semester :-/",0
"She gives prompts that are TOO vague. She made us write too many papers, and have graded only one. She dropped the rest because she thinks ""we going to work way more the second half of the semester."" She uses Grammarly for grading... gives us no help in our writing. I couldn't switch our of her class :( do NOT take her class.",0
"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! It is nearly impossible to study for his exams because he makes up his own questions in the most unconventional way possible. He rushes through most of his lectures. If you want to feel dumb, please take this course with professor Chu. He will make sure of that. (Word of advice, if you do take his course, STUDY EVERYTHING!)",0
"Kaufman is my favorite professor! I was not excited for philosophy but he made it fun! His lectures are hilarious, and you get out early almost every class. Only grades are your 5 exams, which are all online, and open note. He gives you about a week to do them and all the answers are in your notes. Super chill guy, but you do have to go to class",1
"Marty is great.  I always looked forward to going to his class.  He is one of a rare breed of professors: funny and cool, but also extremely knowledgeable.  I was laughing and having fun in the class, but learning a lot at the same time.  That doesn't happen often.  His tests are pretty easy if you do just a little bit of studying.",1
"Worst prof ever. He's a nice guy, but his class consists of loosely grouped factoids from his life at Hydro-Quebec. Hard to understand unless you pull the answers from him. Avoid at all costs, but then again he's the only one teaching AEI so you're doomed no matter what, or take it at Concordia.",0
"I don't agree with most of these comments, and neither does anyone I know in this class. She's a good teacher but the quizzes every Friday are HARD. Average score for the class is usually a 6 or 7 out of 10. Midterm seemed okay, but I ended up getting a C and so did all my friends. I'll probably get a B- when I thought it would be an easy A..",1
"Dempsey is very knowledgeable in his field, but that doesn't mean he should teach it. Despite it being an online course because of covid, he barely used eclass. All classes were synchronous. The syllabus didn't provide enough information of how tests would be done or how assignments should be handed in. The class was unnecessarily difficult.",0
"She does not record lectures and only posts lecture notes which aren't very helpful if you don't understand the concepts themselves. She is VERY unapproachable and will openly criticize your question if she finds it dumb. Very theory based, and the theories must be written the way she does. Not sympathetic to technical difficulties. RUN.",0
"horrible teacher, no office hours and tutoring center didn't know the answers to the review sheets. in class there is no interaction between him and the students, no practice problems nothing. hard grader and mark is based off only 3 tests. i have attended every class and still don't know anything, not clear. keeps you past class time long lectures",0
shes so helpful and concerned with her students. I recommend her 100%  =),1
"Horrible professor! Do not take classes with this professor.  She is an unfair grader and not an easy teacher to get along with.  I agree with the other commenter that she is definitely gender biased, and I'm a girl! Take at your own risk.",0
"I would honestly take any course offered by Dorter. I swear he knows everything. In my final year, I made my schedule around a class he was teaching.  He is incredibly knowledgeable and considerate. Great human being and even better professor. Big assignments, but hugely rewarding.",1
"Dr. Phelps loves art, and it comes across in his lectures. Come prepared to take lots of notes. The information he gives you in class is what's on the test. You'll have to study for the tests but I have learned so much in his class. Don't doze off, don't skip a class, and do take notes! Art book not really necessary if you take lots of notes.",1
One of the best profs I've ever had. She cares & does want you to do well. Super helpful. Love her to bits. You won't regret taking her class. It does have more writing than other psych classes but I didnt even notice it.,1
"I was nervous knowing class participation was a must and we had to sit in a circle but because it was mostly discussion it was so much more interesting then other courses I have taken. This class was too short so the papers and workload ended up creeping up quickly, but this class maintained my interest...I enjoyed it!",1
Attendance is mandatory. If you miss more than 5 or 6 classes you will fail. Discussion boards and quizzes are easy but she grades harshly in the 500 point APA paper. She gives very good feedback and gives you time to complete it. She's very kind and shares her experience as a clinical psychologist throughout the course.,1
"Anderson is really easy as long as you show up to class. I had him for 1001 and 2051. The only issue with his class is that he does not teach the higher levels of latin. If you have to take more than the first two sections, be careful of who you get for the other sections! Going from Anderson's class to a different professor is a hard transition!",1
"Absolute class act.  Does not push an intellectual agenda on her classes like many professors do.  It's so refreshing to have a rhet/comp professor that does not suffer from the siege mentality that plagues so many scholars of the field, and instead situates herself as an interdisciplinarian.",1
He does not assign homework or give a study guide for exams. He will let you take the test as many times as needed but will keep changing the test. You must pass four tests just to get a C. He gets irritated easily if a student does not understand a topic right away.  Some students took the first test 13 times and failed.,0
"Professor Halliburton is a pretty chill guy. His lectures are boring and just talks about the topics/readings that you are suppose to have knowledge about. Just have the required book and teach yourself the material to pass the exams, you'll survive.",0
one of the best teacher I have ever met,1
"Geoffrey is very knowledgeable and passionate about the subject but ultimately I would not recommend unless you are a political science major. There is a very heavy workload and he makes it clear that it is a difficult class. If you work really hard, you will do well. He also has a 65% max policy on essays with more than 1 grammar error/pg.",0
"Way too much work, especially during a pandemic. She's a nice person, though. We were doing 2 projects at once which was stressful, both due at the end of the semester. There were DQs due for one of the projects and for the class in general. I don't think she graded too harshly.",1
"He's a bit controversial amongst students because he is a little off.  I think most students that find him boring probably aren't interested in philosophy.   If you find the subject interesting, even if it's just a GenEd, he presents fascinating material that is moderately easy to digest, giving how mind-boggling the material is by nature.",1
Wonderful man full of annecdotes. If you work hard you will get the results. He is extremely approchable and a real nice man to speak with.,1
"She is an extremely nice lady.  It is almost like having your mom teaching you economics, that is if your mom knew economics very well.  Do not miss lectures, they are extremely helpful.  Tests are all multiple choice and there is not very much homework.  She also offers extra credit which is roughly two extra points to your overall grade.",1
so useless,0
"If you're interested in astronomy, this is a wonderful class. While some weeks do have a lot of assignments (I'd warn against taking this as an accelerated course), the professor is always available to help with questions and is very forgiving on assignments so long as you put in the work. If you need a science class, definitely take this one!",1
"She's an awesome teacher. I am definitely a person that loves math, so English is not a strong area for me. She definitely pushes you to work for your grade. Any questions that I had she helped me with all the way. It is a lot of reading but if you do exactly what she tells you to do, ask questions and reach out to her. It's a WIN!",1
"Per knows what he is talking about, but his tests are about NOTHING he covers in lecture. The problems are ridiculously hard and irrelevant to his lectures. You could probably not go to lecture and be on par with someone that does. If you get the answer wrong on the test it is automatically 50% off. Very hard professor, I did not enjoy this class.",0
"The class isn't bad, but it's definitely not good. The first 4 projects are pretty simple, but project 5 is rough and not what you want to be working on going into finals week. Quizzes are every week, tests are every few weeks and lectures are an hour of Chen reading 40 slides from a powerpoint.",0
"Love him or hate him he truly knows everything there is about current space propulsion tech. This class will either click with you or youre going to struggle through it. Homework is absolutely the worst possible thing ever, but if you trudge all those derivations and the confusion you should have no problem on exams which are so much easier.",1
"Everything in this class was very easy, with the exception of the exams. The exams were over TRIVIAL INFORMATION from your notes, the PPTs which are not on Blackboard, and the in class videos which are also not on Blackboard. Show up to class and memorize every word of your notes and you will do fine, seriously every worthless fact in your notes.",1
"He is the best professor in my life!!!!!! so much fun with him, like him soooooo muchhhhh, he is awesome, he is the best!!! He engage me!!!",1
"Explained concepts very clearly, and repeated things that he knew would be more challenging for us to understand. Used objects to explain events in terms that were easier to imagine and remember. Was very enthusiastic. I would definitely take another class that I knew he was teaching.",1
"Personable professor but the way she teaches is awful. Did not have a course outline, made up assignments along the way and did not stay on course topic enough. Always late and was a tough grader in a course that was meant to be a grade booster. She asked us what we wanted to have for assignments during the class. Multiple things due at same time.",0
"This guy is pretty boring.  Don't get me wrong, he's very excited about what he teaches, he's just boring.",0
"Professor Bailey is an extremely kind woman. She is very caring and understanding- responds quickly and truly wants to get to know her students even in an online setting. It helps to get to know her in return, she will help whenever she can if she feels you are really trying. The content can be difficult and you teach yourself sometimes!",1
"She is a very honest person, you know if she doesnt like you, what she says is not accurate. Shes a horrible prof.",0
"Dr. Georgedes was my least favorite teacher my Freshman year. At the beginning of the semester she was easy to get along with, but she started to seem insecure, based on how she acted as if we all hated her. She started giving heavier lectures and made the second two tests very difficult, and wasn't understanding of students' sicknesses.",0
"Hes one of the easier professors for Eco 4000 because he teaches it differently than most professors. His exams are purely based off his notes & what he says in class so make sure you pay attention. Also, make sure you do the ungraded exercises he posts on BB since theyre kind of similar to his exams. 45% midterm, 55% final and 5% project.",1
Had to stop going to class after the midterms because his explanations in class weren't of any help. Avoid Prof Buss at all costs. ,0
"JUDITH IS AMAZING. She is first off: BRILLIANT, and totally helpful!! She makes you feel like you can do anything and brings all of her experience to her teaching!Take a class with Judith! Any class! It doesnt even matter what it is, if she's teaching it; take it!",1
I could say so much. All I'll say is just sit there and try not to fall asleep. Try not to take him too serious bc he's old and VERY closed minded. I have no idea how he's been teaching philosophy this long. (&he's soo rude) ,0
"You know the saying: ""those who can't do, teach"" - right ? She has to be the worlds best do'er. Too idealistic and can't separate the wheat from the chaff in her lectures (you had better be good in this skill).  I usually ignore reviews - but I should have not ignored these. They were right for once and I urge you to choose another instructor.",0
"I have taken many Honors English classes and I found this ""basic"" class to be very difficult. The directions for assignments were unclear and when Dr. Lewan would send an update regarding the assignment, the criteria changed. I thought her grading was very harsh.  She is certainly a stickler for the dynamics of writing and no creativity is allowed.",0
Professor Oakley makes this class harder than it needed to be. She takes pride in how hard her tests were. Truthfully you have to study for hours to get a C/B. The one perk is that she does provide study guides and 3% extra credit for your total grade. No homework and group projects will balance out failing on tests.,1
"The class itself is not too bad but the problem is that Petra often removes the lab rubric and REEDITS them after the lab has been introduced. Sometimes she doesn't even inform us of this. So for my lab report, I was missing sections that were not EVEN mentioned in the rubric I had and lost points.",0
"I mean its physics so you have to study a little. Go to class take notes and listen to him and he will answer all of ur questions. His tests a re a little diffictult but he curves each one like 8 points so there not to bad. One howwork assignment a week which are kinda easy adn bring up ur grade. Final is easy, just study the test.",1
"Asks test questions like ""What kind of world can our children expect?""",0
"Brown doesn't teach anything, he just tells stories the whole class. Don't even bother coming to class, you end up teaching yourself everything by reading the textbook. By the way, the final is 20 multiple choice that is 25% of your grade. Do not take him",0
I dislike her so much because she is late to class and has an attitude.  Disrespect to students and very conceited. Material taught in class does not reflect what is tested on midterms/finals.  Avoid.,0
"I went to every single lecture, took notes, and probably spent around 20 hours a week studying for this class. Tests are super hard, and he will tell you everything you have ever heard about nutrition is wrong. I personally did not enjoy his teaching style for a 105 class, so I would suggested changing professors ASAP.",0
"Easily the best professor I've had so far. He's extremely understanding of students having lives outside of his class and school, has an incredible talent for remembering student names, and he's great at splitting up lengthy lectures to keep us engaged. I'm going to try to take as many of my INFO classes by him as I can if I get into the major.",1
"If you have background you can take him, otherwise you have to teach yourself (thanks tutors and google). He is good person but doesn't teach that much. I was so worry that i am not going to pass, at the end I was surprised I got B+ . He is easy grader, you can skip classes, give you more time for assignments.",1
The guy who talks about negative marking must have failed Stats. He is not going to give you a 50 just for writing your name and marking every answer as true.,1
"She thinks that she is better than everyone else, when she is truly not! She thinks that all the attention needs to be on her, and does a good job trying to make people feel bad.",0
"Absolutely horrible. Been at Housatonic 3 years and was the only professor I hated. He is combative and will humiliate you then explain why it makes him a good teacher. Talks about his opinions all class and theres absolutely nothing to keep you focused, just lectures on about his life. Im ashamed that this school keeps this guy as a professor",0
"This rude lady suck! Half of the class dont understand her ""English"". You wont know what you do in class. Give you suprise that she never taught you in class during final exam. GRADE STUDENT ON HER PREFERENCE.",0
His class works better&faster than a sleeping pill,0
"This course was disorganized which added to the difficultly. Recorded lectures were posted late and assignments+essays took a long time to be graded. This course was so much work, and was not that rewarding. There was 10 group assignments in the semester which was difficult, especially being online. MIDTERM ESSAYS WERE GRADED BY STUDENTS?!",0
"So, the saving grace of this class is that an A is 85-100, B is 70-85, and C is 55-70. He has a thick Russian accent but his English is very good. Webwork for homework and usually one quiz per week. These will make or break your grade. He does practice tests, but only about 40% of those same problems end up on the tests. Super nice guy though.",1
"Great prof! Very Passionate, enthusiastic, motivated, outgoing and experienced. He knows what he's talking about. Grades are determined based on your performance, attitude and effort. Highly recommended !",1
Online class in which the professor was not required to grade anything. Would not answer questions or offer ay help whatsoever.,0
"Take for a multicultural requirement or breadth! The 2nd class we went over the course and you have options as to your syllabus, CHOOSE AN OPEN SYLLABUS. I literally wrote a paragraph or two on what I planned on doing in this class and stuck to it for the semester and was able to grade myself with an A! No hw, no exams, no attendance, still an A",1
Very nice professor. Lots of reading. Fair grader and VERY helpful with midterm and final studying. Brings candy and food in all the time. Felt like a book club.Lots of talks about use of literary devices. Taking her again!,1
"This classed literally killed me. Bio120 was horrible. I missed lecture once a month at most, and I am still failing. He refuses to compile a review or an outline for exams, which stinks because it's the only grades you get. No hw to offset bad exams. The exams don't pertain to anything you learn, last exam everyone failed well below a 40% ",0
"I realize there are already several bad reviews about Pr. Lewin this semester but still wanted to write because that's how bad she was this semester. No communication, lots of homework, grading criteria isn't clear, wants you to do everything perfectly and will give you a zero but then her quizzes are consistently messed up and that affects us.",0
"I felt that his class was a bit more difficult in the sense that he taught a lot of things that were not included in the textbook, but more like for upper years. He expected his students to know more than first year stuff. But at the same time, he made class dynamic and interesting. His tests was hard but because he demanded more, exam was easy!",1
Dr. Persaud is a wonderful professor! She's very thorough and it is impossible to not learn from her. Go to class and study and you will definitely pass her class.,1
"Best teacher at JJC. He really knows his stuff and takes the time out of class to have students understand. You only have 3 test, no homework and the final is not mandatory unless you want to retake one of the test.",1
"Seemed to pick favorites.  Not very interesting, but to his credit its hard to talk evolution with someone badgering every 2 minutes about the bible.",0
He is gorgeous and caring. He is super smart and nice!!! I low key admire him��,1
"Textbook is mandatory, lots of homework, and tests aren't difficult. He will give u a worksheet in the beginning of class and u could work on it alone or with a partner and then he'll go over SOME questions. If u have  a hard time understanding the way he teaches, he'll tell you to ask for a tutor instead of helping you get a better understanding.",0
He grades his essays and paper really hard.  He is really nice but not a great theacher.,1
Really easy class but his lectures are boring and there often aren't slide shows so you have to pay attention. Get the textbook it really helps with the study guide. He uses UD capture and there is never any homework. He isn't a hard grader but its hard to pay attention in class.,0
"I really enjoyed this class. He is extremely knowledgeable about philosophy. Your grade is 50% midterm/50% final. Homework is optional, but help lectures make more sense, and he goes over the answers everyday. Both exams are a majority homework questions. I did the homework, participated everyday, got A's on the exams. Easiest class I took.",1
"Dr. Schommer is a wonderful guy and very genuine. However, his class was awful to take. It may be I'm not much of a math person, but he did not help very much when it came to those who were struggling. I taught myself most of the material, but his lectures were long and monotone too. The tests weren't horrible and neither was the homework though.",0
"Easy class if you do the study guides. Test questions are given on the first day for the whole semester. Gives great examples and is willing to explain more if needed. Always goes over the readings very thoroughly. I would take his class again. Has a preference for the students who speak often--if he knows your name, you're in good shape.",1
"Took this class in Fall 2018. Extremely lecture heavy, will post lecture note on BB but only titles and no contents. Every lecture is like a note-taking test. Textbook used, but basically useless, only in-class notes are relevant to exams. Graded by only three tests, fail one and you're doomed. There are other options for PSY201, PLEASE AVOID HER.",0
"If you want to know about history, Professor Zellers is your man. You will definitely walk away from his class with a deeper understanding of American History; however, you are going to have to do a lot of reading (including all of his handouts) and you are really going to have to pay attention during his lectures. Two 3 page papers and 2 tests.  ",1
"The prelab quizzes are made to make your grade go down. Even if you understand the exercise and session completely, it's almost impossible to get them right, which forfeits a percentage of your grade every week. You will not do well in this class if you have no previous experience using Excel.",0
great and fun,1
Prof moore is genuinely such a good person and actually cares about his students. love him so much and trying to take as many classes as i can w him before i graduate,1
"He lacks of the background in R and tableau, which made students confused about the class. and the grading criteria is very vague, but he is a ok grader. I got a B+ at the end, and paid ok effort into it. I won't recommend his class but sometimes there is no other choice since there are only a few instructors at MIS department.",0
"My favourite prof of all time--bright, fair, and completely approachable.  She makes classes interesting so you actually want to go.",1
Simply a cool professor. Works in the field. Loves the Wall Street Journal. Tests are curved really challenging.,1
"Class is all substance - no bs or political views. Tests are hard, but graded on a scale. Take him, but go to class and study",1
"He is a nice person and cares about his students, but he is very disorganized. We were never exactly sure what would be on exams. He didn't explain things well. He doesn't use blackboard and hardly ever communicates outside of class- even when test dates changed. Even though the class wasn't hard and I got an A, it was stressful and chaotic.",0
"Unbelievably good. A natural teacher & an extremely hard worker. Demands a lot but puts it all back in, too.",1
If youre trying to pass do not take this class! Shes a very hard grader and bases a lot of her grading on her own opinions and views. Very long unnecessary lectures and you have to be there. Most of the time you wont even learn anything from her,0
"Prof. McBride is chill. If you want an easy history class, here it is. She's an extremely easy grader, it is no problem to get an A in her classes. Highly recommended.",1
I took her online Pl180 class and it was useless. I took it for a liberal& I wish I would have never. I would read the book& do her study guides and still end up getting D's on her test. The exams are dumb and you think you've done fairly well until you actually see your grade. She also doesn't know how to spell or word things. Dont take this class,0
BRUTAL final questions on midterms....argh,1
He doesn't explain material well at all. He lectures heavily then he gives out hw that is confusing and takes forever to do. He knows a lot about CS but he doesn't translate that knowledge well to the students. Also literally told us to google a certain method instead of TEACHING us how to do it.,0
"Talu is very excited about the material, but sometimes I think the depth of her knowledge of the material doesn't extend beyond what she states in class. She seemed easily confused by the slightest of advanced questions. Lectures are boring and hard to sit though. Not and 'easy A'. Avoid unless you like superfluous work.",0
"I tried giving Professor Saudino a chance throughout the semester even after many people were telling me how awful she was. Believe me, Developmental Psychology is an amazing class with so many interesting concepts, but Professor Saudino is rude to her students, makes the class difficult for no reason, and has ridiculous policies.",0
"I will never take a class by this professor again, nor anyone associated with him. He entered grades once two weeks in and hasn't since, you have to guess your current grade. If you're sick and in the hospital doesn't matter, you have to turn in his weekly essay (approx 5 pages minimum) does the absolute bare minimum, he shouldn't be a teacher.",0
"Dr. Roberts was one of the best bio professors I had. Her grading criteria was very fair and if work hard your grade will come thru. Recommendations on getting an A: make cerego doc, redo quizzes/ worksheets, read corresponding chapters and take notes, rewatch lecture, make one-page study guide for each presentation (helps for the final)",1
The class is hard and boring. He murmurs to himself and you cant hear what he's saying.,0
"The class is pretty clear. It is full of homework, but what you expect from on-line class. You will have to watch movies as well. Overall, the class is nice and doable. I am not sure about grading criteria, but nothing scary. ",1
"I really enjoyed this class, mainly because it covered topics I had never been exposed to before such as Native American literature. A lot of people complained it was too much history, but I found this aspect interesting. You need to attend ALL classes because she gives popquizzes which if you read the material you can get a 10 on.",1
"Very nice professor, but I HIGHLY do not recommend. Unorganized, makes mistakes in her assignments and instructions, and expects you to know material and spends no time in class teaching any of it, please avoid.",0
"I think Tip may have had some stuff going on this semester, but he never grades our assignments and is not clear on instructions. The grade is mostly based on speeches and we are almost done with the semester and he has not graded any of them. The assignments he gives are long and tedious. Would not recommend this professor.",0
"Unorganized. Objectives a joke of a study guide. Prepare for 75pt exams that turn into 250 pts because she can. Writes her own exams and questions are tricky. She is nice to your face but u can tell she enjoys making everyone squirm. Read your book and answer questions in lecture, she will ask a lot of them and will grade you easier if you answer!",0
Mean. Extremely critical of my work.,0
"HARD CLASS. He tries to explain it best as possible, but the material is tough. Exams are tough and require a deep understanding. Don't take it unless you actually like biomechanics.",0
useless class.,0
"She is great at explaining, I like the way she taught as in she wrote the points on the board. One thing that I really dislike about her is her attitude. She is looking down at bad grade student, and try to avoid your appointment. not welcoming at all. Her exam is medium, if compared to CPA level. Be prepared to not understand her english accent.",0
"The ""course"" is a compilation of random snippets from 10 different textbooks which he puts onto several PowerPoint presentations. During lectures, he will shuffle through the presentation slides randomly and never explain anything. He will most likely ask his 4th year students to deceive the 3rd year students to convince them to take his course.",0
way easy class!!! very nice guy with a good heart and he is very eager to help student out....although the class was hella boring we sometimes fell asleep!!! lol,1
"Class is as boring as it gets, loves to hear himself talk. Then he turns around and grades all tests and essays extremely specific with his tedious and time-wasting abbreviation sheet that you have to keep going back and forth to. Grades papers as if he was reading a real philosopher's writing. Really just infuriating.",0
"I found this class and its subject (Italian immigrants) to be quite enjoyable. Easy-going English requirement for premed. The readings are interesting and not too difficult. To avoid awkward silences in class, I would recommend at least going some basic ideas of the assignments to prepare. Easy grader; assignments are clear. Highly recommended!",1
He was a great teacher! Easy class...I received over a hundered percent with all of the extra credit oppurtunities in that class!!! Take him...you wont regret it!,1
"Book is so difficult to understand if you don,t understand what book is saying how are you supposed to write 40 pages essay. There should be exam as well. Not only writing.",0
"Most boring professor at JMU. Kraenzle goes on 45 min tangents on containers on ships. Every class is a lecture that teaches you no information. If all you do is read the lecture slides, skim the mandatory readings and do the assignments its an easy B. Assignments are so nit picky, ex. font size and sources and margins on papers. NOT AN EASY GEN ED",0
did not understand a word he is saying . you will understand when you drop the course . not trying to be mean but his classes are deprissive,0
"Mr. Bruestle is an excellent professor. You can easily understand the subject and you learn a lot about the culture of Germany, and some of Europe. He makes the language very easy to catch onto. You will need the book, as you use it every day in class. You can share books with friends. Buy t he workbook too, since you turn it in on the final day.",1
A very fair proffesor who's assessments reflected what went on in the lectures and homework. Also marked very fairly and was clear in what he expected during exams. Also hilarious during lectures!,1
"Professor Zuidervaart is a really great professor. There is mandatory class attendance every week. Her workload is pretty average and she gives you a couple of days to complete it. She has three big papers which includes small assignments to help keep you on track. Overall, if you stay proficient in her class you will get a good grade.",1
Worst prof ever.,0
"Dr. Irani is a great professor of an awesome subject! She is actually a practicing psychologist, so when our class would meet, we would have great discussions rather than ""lectures"".  You are expected to read the chapter on your own.  You definitely need to have discipline to complete the online work on your own, and the tests can be difficult.",1
"Brian Blais is interesting to say the least. His classes aren't THAT bad and you're basically guaranteed an A, but this man is mental torture. He doesn't believe a single word that you say and thinks he is the smartest person in the room by far. I do not understand how anyone can love this man.",0
Terri is awful. Went to every single class just to get the 5 extra credit points to salvage my grade to a FREAKING D-!!!!!!!! Hardest tests. Very knowledgeable about this but refuses to share with students. Not willing to help students and talks to you like youre stupid. Doing this instead of studying for the final bc its a lost cause at this point,0
"He is terrible. The class is fairly easy, but overall he is really rude and mean. I turned in an assignment that had 2 parts. I turned in the first part and emailed him the second part because it was a picture. He then told me to submit through canvas after I had already emailed it to him. A month later, he tells me to email it to him NOW. so rude",0
"If you have 40 hours of free time and go to www.db-book.com (which contains slides created by the book authors) you can definitely learn the material better than when he teaches it.  The only reason to take him is if you need it for a co-req for CISC474 and there is absolutely no other choice.  Bottom line: avoid not for difficulty, but for sanity.",0
"Awesome Class, Lobdell is one of the best teachers there. Friendly, always understanding, informative. My goal is to take every class that he teaches at pierce.",1
"One of the best design profs that teaches in San Antonio. He does push you to your limits, but in return you gain so much. Your comprehension of design and Architecture will greatly improve. Make sure to take him and TRUST his process. He absolutely knows what he is talking about.",1
"Francis is very knowledgeable in his subject area. Though, he is not a native English speaker his ability to impart knowledge to his students is very rewarding. You will find his class very lively if you have some High School math foundation. He provides many worked examples, which are very helpful for the midterm and final exams. ",1
"Honestly Hill wasn't as bad as I thought he would be. He's a fine lecturer for the course, and as with any bio exam, gotta work for the grade but they're fair and still not as bad as the exams you'll get for genetics. His Q&A sessions are extremely helpful too. I did get a C though, but that's only because of my disinterest in ecology in general.",1
way too hard. boring. dumb policies.,0
"She's a great teacher, extemely smart.  Her tests are hard, so you have to study.  I learned alot in her class.  She's also very laid back and is extremely fair.",1
"He is a pretty good prof, cares for his students if you put in the effort and can keep your attention. His derivations do become messy and his board use is atrocious. His messiness was much more apparent in 112 rather than 111. Can get pretty mad, sort of randomly, did more than once in 111, and 112.",1
Wish I could have taken her for every class I took at West Chester!,1
"I was a slacker, did all my hw, didn't study much, failed my essays and thought I failed the class. But I was 20 pts away from an A. Never liked history though. Easy class but boring. DO YOUR OUTLINES/HOMEWORK!! It will save you! Tests = essays. Extra credit available.",1
"Dr. Chen is a REALLY bad lecturer, but at least his class is really easy. Tests and quizzes were not too complex. Go to recitation/studios, do some studying on your own (watch Sebastain Fernandez' Diffeq videos on YouTube) and you'll be straight.",1
"His lectures and notes aren't clear on what you are learning and what it applies to. Wasn't good at explaining things. However, go to the super tutorials and you will pass this course. You just might not learn anything.",0
EGR 289 is a very easy class. Dr. Reffeor gave great feedback on resumes and cover letters. She also gave great advice on finding a co-op,1
Her lecture material does not prepare you for any tests or exams. Questions are randomly picked from a test bank and are simply memorization questions of unnecessary topics. Overall in order to get a good grade in the class you must memorize everything in the entire textbook and prey.,0
He focuses on proofing and theories but explains things very well. he will prepare you well for later statistics courses. He is also a funny guy but his tests won't be easy.,1
"Three test are the only grades. One test average was a 67 and he would not curve it. I had a lot of trouble with this class and he did not seem to care. Participation is important, reading before every class, and test are long with a lot of information. I would not take him again and I think I am failing. He does give a lot of extra credit though.",0
"she only provides 4 grades that ACTUALLY make a difference and everyone fails one paper horribly with no way to make it up. daily writing prompts and small pop quizzes with study guides. honestly she just is smart on the subject herself and can't transfer the information to students, nor help them correct grades they've done poorly on. no recommend",0
"Allen is NOT a ""liberal.""  He is an unabashed communist/nihlist. His diatribes and belief structure would be laughable if he wasn't the dept chair and exercised so much power of the curriculum. In some sense, he is the soul of entire UMaine faculty. He is worth taking only to see and better understand the #1 enemy of free thought on our campus.",0
ughghghg....boring,0
Dr. Summers is very passionate about the topics he teaches and expects you to follow the story line he presents in class on exams and papers. If you go to class and pay attention you will do fine on the exams. Make sure you do the required readings well in advance! He is happy to host review sessions but you have to ask for them in class!,1
I was scared bcuz math not my strong point but She explained concepts pretty well The test were not too difficult Allows you to use an index card of notes on test I would definitely take her again But make sure you study a little because after all it is math but she makes it alot eaiser. Super cool teacher and willing to help and i suck at math..!,1
"Awesome class! At times, it can be boring but as long as you study a little bit, you can't get anything lower than a B. He's an awesome pianist too! Three short concert reviews, three tests, and he even has a nice ""Kosnik Surprise"" Extra Credit given out, too! I'd definitely recommend him if you're in the honors college, too!",1
"She really is a good professor. Nothing bad to say! The only reason attendance is necessary is because every answer will be discussed and written down in lecture. Most, if not all, of her answers on the study guide is on Quizlet.",1
He is a hilarious professor. Long and short of it. Does everyone have their bearings?,0
Really knows history. Sometimes he blabs on about things not needed to know for that class but it is interesting if you love history. Use the book and pay close attention to his notes inorder to pass his tests. Good and passionate instructor!,1
He talks about working in tech the way it was 20 years ago. This guy has been away from the industry (has he ever been in the industry?) for far too long to be teaching this class.,0
"I'd try to avoid his class if you can. Lectures every class, confusing homework assignments, difficult tests. The textbook helps you teach yourself the material. Even though I didn't miss one class, I really didn't learn anything from him. ",0
So politically biased towards the left that it strongly takes away from learning what actually happened in American history,0
Professor Hess was amazing! I'm pretty good at math and his class was an easy A. He made assignments very clear and reiterated that there were multiple resources for people who needed help. Would definitely take him again and recommend him to everyone.   ,1
DO NOT take class from this professor. He was the worst instructor I have ever had. I had to teach myself all of the class content from the text.,0
likes to hear himself,0
he is the greatest prof. he is so funny and his lectures are always interesting. he makes the material easy to understand and you enjoy learning it. i was always excited to go to his class. fabulous guy.,1
"I loved Tom Smith, even though he was a republican. Easy and helpful, but you still learn a lot. Definitely the best speech class...don't miss out!",1
"Scary, hard grader,  material easy. Not nice",0
"Anth of Reproduction is clearly Dr Mitchell's speciality. She enjoys it, the class is lively, and the material is clearly presented. Mitchell has a fun sense of humor in the class, and makes everything really approachable. That being said, go to lecture, it was THE most useful aspect of her class for passing the tests.",1
"Thorngren is not friendly. She teaches the class as though it is the most important thing in the world. If you have to take Geography as a GE, take this online. The grading material is clear, but there is a lot. 10-15 modules with 3-6 sections each, quizzes and exams too.",0
"WARNING: DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH TISHA IRWIN!!!!! I enrolled in this class for the credits and I left with many gray hairs. This professor is rude, unresponsive, and says she likes to help the students but when a question is asked, she immediately shuts you down and talks to you as if you have an IQ of zero! Ridiculous",0
"Awesome professor, you can tell he knows what he's talking about and he genuinely wants you to be better. Can be tough on grading if you don't give a project your best effort , though.",1
"Ok, Granted he loves and knows what he is talking about but he tells stories more often than he can stick to whats on the agenda. Basically you can teach yourself in this class or get help from a dependable classmate",1
"Super easy one credit class if you are missing credits, super nice and brings food here and there!",1
Even though I went to most lectures I feel like I learned a lot more from the book than lecture. He's clearly a smart guy but lectures just weren't super engaging or organized (I had it at 8 a.m. which didn't help). Start reading early so you're not left reading an entire textbook the night before the test. Grade based only on midterm and final,0
"Very interested and knowledgeable in the subject.  Is very nice and willing to help.  He's a bit absent-minded, so he forgets things, and he is very busy as he does a lot of work for the department (which you would think the chair would be doing).  Class is entirely too early though.",1
"Not very knowledgeable.  Makes stuff up.  All style, no substance.",0
"I'm sure she's great for upper level classes because I can tell she's caring & intelligent. However, this was so much work for a 100 level class. & I don't think she planned her lessons. I was stuck listening to directionless ramblings twice a week. Take someone else for ENG 104, especially if you've waited until senior year to take it (like me).",0
"Go to class folks!  Man, it really helps with the grade.    This guy obviously loves to teach.  Tries to get us engaged.",1
Sweet professor. Difficult course.,0
"Don't buy the really expensive textbook- most if not all of the short stories can be found online for free. Honestly, a Wikipedia summary is enough to past the quizzes.",0
states at the back wall while giving his lectures,0
The guy needs to take ENG 1001 before he can teach a university math. His midterms are confusing and his sample packets do not match to the material on the final exam. Avoid at all costs.,0
"Dr. Kroll makes you work in this class. On the flip side, you will learn a lot from it. Numerous homework assignments every week, weekly discussion boards, weekly quizzes, a mid-term, and final. Be prepared to be inundated with work. This is one of those classes that if you don't devote all of your attention, you're going to sink very fast.",1
"At first, Bellamy seems awful. Discrete is a pretty tough subject and he is unorganized as can be. He writes out long boring proofs that you can pretty much space out and ignore a lot of the time. However, even though his grading scales seem super weird, if you put in a decent amount of effort in it is actually fairly easy to get an A. ",0
"Brian Jones is the most caring professor I have ever had. He purposely tries to create the class so everyone can succeed, and wants the entire class to receive As. He offers a smaller breakout section to students (he absolutely did not have to do that), because he knows some students struggle in big lecture classes. Can't recommend him more.",1
Do not follow his syllabus. He is the top guy who monitors other faculty in the department. An young professor was changed from 601 and 602 to other courses after a student whispered to Gerlach.,0
"Didn't enjoy the class at all.  The professor wasn't very helpful at all, but in the end, it was an easy A.",0
"This was my third time have Professor Williams. I knew what to expect in his class. SF 341 was my favorite class. I recommend it. You learn about Airport Management, Airport Security, Airport Safety, Airport Inspections, How to run the Airport, and most importantly keep the Airport Safe. If you take this class, study! study!! study!!! Always helps!",1
She is a very helpful lady. No need for book in health and wellness. Highly recommend to take with this professor.,1
Professor Shelly knows her history extremely well! No textbook required but a few reading books you will need to actually read to do well on the paper. Take really good notes and you will excel on exams,1
I understand now why so many negative comments. I wish I listened to them. Negative attitude in class. Negative way of responding to questions. No real help (is he ever in his office for office hrs?) Does not seem to care whether we learn or not. Hope to have a different professor for 102!,0
"Tough class, but she was always available to help me. If you are willing to put in the effort, you can really get a lot from her.",1
"Must attend classes, but lectures don't help much as he reads off a Powerpoint. Ignore him and read the textbook. Overall not a good teacher; he gets angry when you ask questions and his attempt to answer math- related questions only causes more confusion. Avoid if you can",0
She's super sweet and the course was an easy GPA booster.,1
"There is no clear grading scale the entire semester. Every time we took an exam, he would tell us where an A starts and ends, where a B starts and ends and so forth. He never told us the grading scale for our last exam so we never knew what our current grade was going into the final. He's also very rude and not personable.",0
Great professor. He made lectures interesting and had good demonstrations. Make sure to write down everything he writes on the board and you'll pass the class no problem.,1
"This class is a waste of my time. The book he uses is biased, as is he. You go to class so he can tell you exactly what you read in the book the night before. He is disorganized and never really seems to know what is going on...nice man, though.",0
"He is a great teacher, you don't even have to go to his class to get a decent grade. You want to go to his class because he is very amusing! He is the best teacher for this class, he can play the trumpet like no other!",1
"I really liked the structure of the class, you watch the video lectures, and complete a weekly quiz/exercise, which helped with the understanding of the content. The assignments were also really straightforward and clear. Some of the material was already taught in CMPT 125, but I felt like he explained the concepts better..",1
"Professor Corcoran is the best! He is passionate about his teaching, and even though his lectures are long, I looked forward to them every week! He expects you to read the material and write a response paper each week. He is hilarious and incorporates lots of class discussion into his lectures. I highly recommend his class!",1
She is one the best lecture professors at CSULA but she is brutal when it comes to her tests and assignments. Her tests are multiple choice and rest is scenario questions. She will combine every thing she lectured into one question multiple parts. She does curve but depends on the highest grade in the class. She is very helpful during her office.,0
Prof. Kirtland is really cool and he makes math fun.  I used to hate math but now I'm in the Math Club with him!,1
"He is a sweet guy as everyone says and he totally means well. HOWEVER, I'm afraid his memory is going because he would repeat himself several times during lecture and would always forget if he told us due dates/test dates!! Honestly, you'll have to teach yourself out of the textbook if you want to pass because I couldn't learn a thing from him.",0
"Professor Saxonhouse is  finest professors that I've had the privilege of learning under. If you're interested in political theory and you attend the University of Michigan, you would be doing yourself a disservice not to take her class. She's erudite and witty; she also puts together a diverse reading list for the course. Attend class and read!",1
"His tests are kinda hard but he scales them. Also read his textbook, it provides lots of nuances and extra material that is useful to his class. Overall an awesome teacher",1
EXCELLENT PROFESSOR,1
"Pros: Tons of studying material to choose from No final exam if you don't miss <2 weekly test Explain things in detail Cons: Since his class was so big, so he couldn't answer private message. However, TA was always available on every lecture Note: You need to attend every lab since the test is on lab hours and occurs every week",1
"By far the worst professor I've ever had. Horrible lecture notes that are extremely convoluted and full of integral after integral with jargon-filled explanations. You can barely listen because he just reads off his notes and I take in no information from lectures. In our MC test, he made it so that we get -1.3 for every multiple-choice wrong.",0
"I had so much fun in her class. She is a great teacher. Take her if you are actually interested in gaining some knowledge, but do not take her class if you are looking for an easy A. She is lenient with grading I think.",1
"I respected Elizabeth Hanson for her intelligence early on in the class. But I disagree with her unethical equation of politics with education and teaching literature. She makes highly politically insensitive comments, and often has difficulty finding her point/purpose in lecture because of this.",0
"If you take Jasmin for Orgo 1, you will not learn a thing. His class is very disorganized, the syllabus dates for exams are not correct so you can never plan ahead. His due dates are random and he's very hard to understand in lecture. Dont get me wrong, he seems like nice guy who wants to see you succeed but everything about this class sucks. Avoid",0
"Funny enough, I took this class because of the rave reviews I saw on here. The reality of it? This instructor hardly respond to e-mails or discussions, it takes around 4 hours to listen to a lecture, study the material, and take a quiz, and in addition, you don't get much time to complete quizzes. Very time consuming, I would not recommend...",0
"The material is easy, and this instructor does everything she can to make this class the opposite. There are more assignments than anyone can keep up with. This can lead to some half-effort work, but more or less she'll always find a way to take points off a lab report/worksheet. The most nit picky grader you will see. She is not the best choice.",0
"He will not, ""he will not..."" round your 69.15% to a 70.00% even if you are were close in passing the class. Find other Professor that is more considerate. He will not answer your email or ""will just say grades will be out soon!"" You been warned to not take any of his classes. Dont say you never read this... good luck finding a better professor.",0
"Nice guy. A little too all over the place. The class is really hard. He wants to help, but he is so high-strung and spacey and not very good at explaining things. He was SO understanding, though, when I was having trouble and needed extra help several times a week! Always willing to meet you outside of class if you need help which is a plus!",0
"Prof is unorganized in that she never has a plan for the day so she wastes a lot of time deciding on the spot. Also, she is incredibly boring! The course materials are as outdated as her hairstyle. I earned an ""A"" and only showed up to turn in major assignments, which was great, but not once did I feel challenged to even try.",0
"This was the start of my disillusionment with philosophy. Searle is self-absorbed and not an original/creative thinker. I was really excited about this class (judging by the title), but he let me down.",0
"Andrew was one of my favourite profs. While he makes you work for your mark and is a tough grader, he made me a better English student and writer. He was very easy to get ahold of, he gives the class his cellphone number and is willing to answer questions at anytime.",1
His speaks very softly and almost monotone so it can be hard to follow along. he knows his stuff but lectures don't seem to go over everything on the tests. His slides are not useful unless you are in class listening to him explain otherwise you might just end up confused.,1
"Professor Huffman is an amazing professor who is very knowledgable and passionate about Italian literature. She requires you to buy a lot of books for her class but don't even bother because she did not even have time to get through all of them. Overall, she is a very nice professor but sometimes the class gets a bit boring.",1
So far the best professor I've had at this school. She is hilarious and very clear with what she wants in terms of attendance and assignments. Straight forward.,1
"Lecture every Tuesday, worksheet handed every Thursday and both the hw and worksheet are due the following Thursday. Practice exams, slides and study guides all available online. Lab work and lecture are useful. Book not needed except for hw. Really nice teacher. Get a hold of the past exams because she just changes the numbers..",1
"Marini is not great. She knows the material, which is important, but she really does not teach it well. Too theoretical. She presents Linear Algebra topics with skewed organization, spending way too much time on complicated vector space proofs that most students can't follow. I did well, but did most of the work on my own. Hardly did Eigenvalues!",0
"Really helpful prof. Hands down best prof in Computing and Software department. Easy tests and assignments, excellence at communication skills",1
Easy class. The test questions are exactly the same as the study guide in the back of the book. Class can get a little boring sometimes but its mostly because its a 3 hour class. She's funny and her accent is great.,1
The Worse professor Everrrrrrr thank God he retired !! i hated him!!,0
"Boring teacher, likes to fail students.",0
"Failed to stick to syllabus, changed due dates frequently, posted quizzes and tests late.  Dropped some assignments. Even after final grades were due to be turned in, no final grade was listed on Bb.  Blamed me when I told her I was confused by the due dates she changed several times.  Found her inflexible despite her own lack of consistency.",0
Genetics can be a pretty tough class....do lots of reading!,1
"Not a great professor at all. Teaches class more confusing concepts rather than calculations needed for success on exams. Hard to understand what he is saying at times because of his strong accent. Although not the best at getting his students to do well in the class, he is a good person. Personally, I would not take chemistry with him again.",0
"Absolutely one of my favorite professors and friend. Dr. Prior instills in her students a little more love of English than when you first walked into her classroom. Her insightful discussions on our current Christian world are both controversial and very fun. Class is filled with intense thought, laughs, and worship through literature.",1
Dr. Moody is such an interesting man. The lectures tend to wander from the subject. Overall an easy class that he can make quite interesting at times.,1
"Probably most confusing course I've taken! We spent half the semester doing tutorials that don't teach you anything and then when we moved into the independent work, his grading was arbitrary, subjective to his opinion and flat out slow. Do your work and you'll pass but he'll give you a headache 98% of the semester ",0
really boring.... no will to come to class,0
I found Professor Morgan to have a huge heart. He wants his student to do well but you have to work for it. I suggest the math lab. Yes some have found him hard to take but it is you that must make the effort. Nothing worth while achieving is going to be easy. If you do not know ask. Just do not sit there and blame the professor.,1
"Horrible!! Requires a lot of work, is never clear on what she expects or even what assignments are due / when. Not even the syllabus will help you because she often changes it without clarifying. Does not care about her students - will embarrass you in class and often goes on long random rants about her political opinion.",0
"She doesn't really teach. When she does teach, she doesn't really know what she's talking about. She is really nice though. If you can take this class with someone else, do it.",0
"Great Professor.  If you put in effort you can definitely get a good grade if not an A. Book used is clear and interesting as well. A discussion based class, so be ready to talk! I'd definitely take a class from him again.",1
Dr Dyer does not seem like he wants to be teaching this class and only uses PowerPoint presentations. It is very hard to take notes because he quickly moves between slides. The slides are posted 2 days before the exam. All the test questions are specific details from the book that he may or may not have covered in class. Overall a bad professor.,0
"The teacher is really great, probably one of my favorites so far at Tech. She'll work with you on anything you're struggling with and if you want an A you'll most likely get one.",1
"Professor Honts is a very respectable man with a ton of knowledge in his field. However, his lectures feel much like a one-sided conversation and he loves to ramble. Your grade is based on 3 bb quizzes and 2 exams which include questions that are worded to confuse you. You must read several peer-reviewed articles (30+ pgs) before each class.",0
The class itself is kinda a joke but Dr. Brecke is very cool and super smart.,1
"I have taken Dr. Collins for two courses and really enjoyed her. If you take her in person she gives you the opportunity to earn extra credit for coming to the board and solving a problem (doesn't have to be correct)! She does give homework in some courses, but it's graded on effort. If you do the study guides you should pass the test.",1
He did not post the solution for practice question and coming to class is the only way you can study and pass the course. You can not review your practice question and if you have no friends there is no way you pass the course because he will not explain again,0
VERY EASY.  Just show up to class.  A couple busy work projects but other than that there is absolutely no work outside class.  All tests and quizzes were take home.,0
"Ecosystem is the sweetest class at SMC if you like the outdoors. Field trip to mountain tops, lakes, bogs once a week. Lab reports are long, but he's VERY helpful. Tests are moderately difficult. If you don't like ecology, don't take the class. Otherwise, it's an awesome time.",1
"For the online class, his exams are poorly written and I'm almost positive I get a majority right according to the material provided, but I end up getting a bad grade. He isn't clear in any of his explanations or instructions and his work is shotty. Very unimpressed with his teaching style and disorganization.",0
"Tom is a great guy! Very fun! However, the tests are somewhat difficult and you dont really learn any textbook material during the class periods. The class is more about memorizing definitions and ideas than it is about actually learning. If you do an extra credit then you still will get a good grade.",0
She is very opinionated and tries to put her own spin on history. If you prefer to learn facts and not a biased retelling of history please consider taking this class with another professor. The class itself was very easy but it is irritating to hear a professor add in details that do not exist.,0
"Terrible teacher, simply reads slides and then seems to enjoy killing students with the difficulty of his tests",0
Best professor ever! He is so funny and loves what he does! Would deff take him again:),1
"Avoid this professor at all costs! Her lectures and demeanor both will cause you to hate history. I genuinely believe Xavier should fire her and hire someone who can effectively connect to students. At best, she is a mediocre educator.",0
"CONS: Took a slow pace, thus consequently less time for more challenging concepts at the end. Lectures were nothing to write home about (unless in frustration). Grades updated only after midterm and final. PROS: Slow pace could be good for some. Good guy, funny, cares about his students and clear knows the subject. OVERALL: Easier than expected",1
I had the pleasure to have Mr. Saxe as my pols professor during summer. It was 5 weeks but his class was easy. Make sure to attend class to take notes since its lecture based. Hes hilarious & cares about his students.,1
"Chet is the sweetest man on the entire planet, most helpful teacher Ive ever had, he makes math fun and uses adorable terms to help you remember material. HIGHLY RECCOMENDED",1
"An excellent prof who tells you exactly what you need to know and takes his exam questions almost directly from the problem sets and in-class examples. If you put the time in, this is one of the easiest courses you will ever take.",1
"This class is was simply write a paper, grade it, that is your grade. Seriously, you write a 5-9 page paper she grades it and then puts it in the grade book. No test. This can either be really good or this can be really bad. And GRAMMAR is a huge thing for this professor!",0
"Awful doesn't begin to describe Professor Knocke's teaching style as well as his overall conduct of being a professor. Constantly changes project expectations and grading criteria. Never gives student's a page with project expectations, just rambles about them during class and changes them every other day. Extremely unprofessional, waste of time.",0
"she's awesome, by far the best instructor in the department.",1
"If you get the chance, just take this class. Shes super understanding for the most part. Obvs youll still have to work but she helps out as much as she can. One of the better professors at Lehman.",1
"She is a nice person, but her teaching method is horrible!  She goes way too fast and is dependent on Excel, Megastat and Powerpoint...and all the exams are manual!  If you need the prof to explain the concepts clearly, Quinn is NOT recommended.  Her class failure rate is VERY HIGH.  'Nuff said.",0
"A very fun and interesting class! She tells a lot of stories about her time as a psychiatrist, and they're always fun to listen to. Very unbiased and friendly. There are only three tests, not counting the final, and she drops the worst grade.",1
"Dr. M is a really harsh grader, but that helps to know what he expects on tests. He used a grader--strict legend, no leniency. His tests always throw you a curve-ball, so be sure you understand the concepts and the assumptions. Some of his verbiage is confusing, but he will always explain if you ask. His responsiveness is what helped me pass.",1
"His notes are lack of examples, even some of them are not completed. Most of the content are definition and hard to understand. the assignments are so tough without a clear definition list or a lot of examples. he is not a good choice for math classes.",0
"DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE! This professor is arrogant, condescending, insulting, and down right LAZY with his teaching! I have never stressed as much as I did with this class. I studied hours upon hours for his exams and never scored higher than a C. He is the WORST! His exams do not match his lectures or what the book teaches. Avoid him at ALL costs",0
"I had him for lab and thought it was very easy, but his lecture was the exact opposite. He is a nice guy, but his tests are very difficult. I felt as though a lot of the material on the tests we never discussed and wasn't even in the book. You do need to read the chapters but he won't assign it. A lot of kids from our class withdrew.",1
Takes forever to grade things and takes FOREVER to respond to emails. The layout of the course is super confusing. I got an A from literally writing all the study guide on tiny index card for midterm and final. The rest of the stuff I did mostly copy pasted stuff on Google. Text is difficult to understand and totally useless. Don't take if you can.,0
"Pros: Teaches the most basic parts of Molecular Biology Cons: The class is supposed to be about the deeper subjects of Molecular Biology, which he tests and quizzes on without teaching. He is disrespectful and berates students for asking for help avoid like the plague. Heck you'd learn more from getting the plague and asking your doctor questions",0
Favorite professor since I've been in college. I'm actually taking another class of his next semester.,1
he's a know it all that runs through material faster than even a smart person can keep up with.,0
"I really like Dr. Pike as a person and she is very intelligent, but this class was so disorganized and unclear, it drove me insane. Our grade was based on 4 assignments, which all had incredibly unclear criteria, and whenever you asked her about it, she would change something. Has potential to be such a neat class, but not executed well.",1
"She is so vague when assigning essays. She'll tell you to do 3 different things, but if you do what she says throughout the ""writing process"" aka following her through her craziness you'll do ok. I don't recommend her but some did like her so I guess she's a love/hate type deal.",0
"She was nice, but graded quite hard in some of the speeches. I never miss a class, and I still cant receive full credit in Participation, she wanted students to speak a lot in class. Overall, she cares about her student, but grading is not clear.",1
interesting and energetic guy,1
"He will make you work, but I found him to be interesting and a good teacher.  Willing to help outside of class",1
"Be prepared to teach yourself the majority of the material. The tests are ridiculous and you are put on a very tight time schedule. The class does not relate to the real world. In my experience, your boss will not tell you to complete 3-4 complicated math problems within 1 hour. Unfortunately, this is a mandatory class to take.",0
Dr. Malkawi is one of the most amazing professors I've ever had. His lectures are so straightforward and easy to follow. He really cares about you as a learner and I learned so much. He is fantastic. If someone didn't like the class they definitely didn't take the learning process upon themselves enough and seriously.,1
There are alot of lectures that you need to pay attention or you will struggle through the course. He is a bit boring and monotone at times but tries to be funny sometimes. All homework is online and you can turn the homework in late with no penalty and if you get 75% on the online homework he counts it as 100%. Labs are straightforward,1
"He's okay. Seems like a nice guy at times and at other times is unexpectedly irritable. The class is interesting enough and he seems to really know his stuff, but is prone to long-winded rants about student shortcomings (when it comes to paying attention or arriving on time) which can be understandable but feel misdirected/passive-aggressive.",0
"she is very helpful, and a great teacher, she is always motivated the students to go ahead, she asked you all the time you understand? If you not she take time to give you all the explication  that you don't understand she is great and she have a charisma to teaching she love that she don't wants the students fail class,she is reminded each time.",1
i love dr. spener.  he is such a nice man and is truly passionate about what he teaches.  he's not too hard either.  take spener's classes!!!,1
"Awesome teacher, highly recommend to anyone.  The class is very hard but he is extremely helpful and stays in office late everyday.",1
"Was my instructor for a course in 1987 at U of T. At the time, he was a graduate student and taught CSC324. 
 Many years later now, and with time to reflect on the past and to take things into consideration, I have to say, he was one of the worst teachers.
 Briefly, I reached out to him for help.  He proved himself to be a despicable person.",0
Gives great birthday gifts.,1
"Look, Dr. Heffernan is smart and he's a good poet, but he doesn't even use Blackboard or email, or make a syllabus. He doesn't take roll, he doesn't even teach any real material. I had him for poetry and it was the biggest waste of my time, and I'm an English major. Huge disappointment and was only graded on one paper that I luckily made an A on.",0
"Tells great stories, explains concepts in clear, rational way - I'm glad I took the class",1
Let me put it to you this way. Do not follow the happy faces associated with this teacher's ratings. Misleading. This is a man who displays favoritism early on in each semester. Your grade outcome is predetermined the first two weeks of class. Does not focus on Axonometrics as needed for Vis.com.Do not take him.Unfair and always taking class breaks,0
tests & papers back to back. readings are kind of boring. asks about the smallest details on tests so be prepared. gave a pop quiz. a lot of group work during class. overall nice teacher. would take again.,1
"He spends half the class period making fun of students, so you won't really learn much. You'll basically have to figure out everything on your own. It is obvious he enjoys that power that comes with being in front of the classroom. I'd avoid taking his class if you can.",0
"Don't do it to yourself. Doesn't care about failing the whole class. Nothing makes sense. Nice guy, though.",0
"Prof. Stewie is a very difficult prof. indeed, but so is Research Methods in general. He however was always available to help and invests time in the success of his students. His humor is a bit sarcastic but he is pretty entertaining. During his class my friend and I would often chuckle about the chest hair that would always pop out of his collar.",1
One of my favorite professors so far while attending GRCC! I took this class not knowing anything about philosophy and ended learning a lot. Chen is a caring professor who tries to engage the whole class even at 7:45am on a Monday morning. He is very passionate in what he teaches and it shows. The class is super easy with very few assignments.,1
"he is a hard guy, he is very tricky, and he like to fail the people. he is so piggy and he judge you based on nonacademic stuff, if he like you then it is for you to pass the course otherwise not. he care about quantity. avoid him if you can but if you take the course avoid talking to him, just go to class and do the assignments. good luck",1
"This prof is amazing, hes perhaps the smartest man in the world....and hes human too!!!",1
"Homework is completely useless. Nothing like the tests or what he teaches in class. The tests are extremely hard, and does an awful job in lecture doing problems like them to prepare students.",0
"Prof. Draper is one of the most supportive, flexible instructors that I've had at this school. She goes above and beyond to help students and teaches with such clarity and genuine empathy. This pandemic has been stressful for a lot of us; having an instructor as fair and caring as Dr. Draper makes this all so much easier. Highly recommend.",1
He's great,1
"He teaches the course at his own pace and in whatever order he feels like teaching when he comes to class. Notes are extremely unorganized and often incorrect when he writes on the board. I really found it hard to stay engaged in the information he presented in class, yet that's what his midterms would solely be based on.",1
"DON'T take him, you will go into the MREST blind not knowing a thing cause he won't teach you anything you need to know in class. Graded presentations way too hard, he even records you to show other classes in the future what you did wrong. Even puts his political views on the test which just isn't mature. Pick someone else!",0
class was fun. usually has chocolate for her students. her tests always deal with her lecture and whatever the book has to say. yo dont have to read anything else.,1
Hes just a bad professor. He doesn't explain how to do problems he just does them then moves on. Not only that but he hardly goes over equations he goes over concepts.,0
"Not a very helpful guy. The first day he makes the class seem interesting, but it is far from it. Pretty difficult.",0
Seemed uncaring when discussing concerns. Emails came off disrespectful and or rude.,0
"She is one of the best professors at GVSU.  She is a fair grader. You have 4 papers, essay midterm, and essay final. She is very interesting and fun. She is very passionate about what she teaches.",1
"Very difficult. This was the first class in my college career where I have done everything and still received a poor grade. Tough grader, very blunt. She knows her material well and seems to like what she does but I feel she holds unrealistic expectations.",0
Highly recommended professor.,1
"He is way too smart. It almost seems like he should be doing research in a lab. Hes a really nice guy and tries his best to help, but he makes the material more difficult than it probably needs to be. Study his notes and do the weekly homework assignments. Lab was cool, we made soap and root beer!",1
"He is a great person, but not a great conductor. He doesnt know what words to use so he just kind of sings in gestures instead of saying ""phrasing goes to here"" or something like that. I have never gotten a comment other than balance issues, nor have I learned anything from his teaching.  He is slowly leaving out beats more often because hes old.",0
"I really cannot understand the people here complaining about his notes! The most organized and complete course notes I have ever seen, covering everything you will need to know. He cares a lot about teaching and the ""hard testing"" is completely fair game since the material is covered in class. Inspirational and brilliant. He makes you love Math!",1
"Taking her class during covid- she's ok. She doesn't give any feedback on papers. If you want help, I would reach out to the fellow. Follow her syllabus religiously as it has the essay requirements. The writing exercises and reading responses are easy but stay on top of those as they really add up.",1
The lectures were rough. He doesnt teach as much as he just talks.,0
always referred to us as kindergardeners. was not helpful at all. Wrost professor of all times,0
"Great professor who really cares about his students. He's willing to help anyone who wants to put the work in. That being said there is a lot of work, but it's chemistry, so if you need to know the material it's all for your benefit. 4 exams, 1 final, and labs graded out of 10 points weekly. No graded homework. No power-points. Take good notes.",1
"What can I say, a lot of the students that he had in his class were people that were in there several times. And I see why - he is not clear nor is he very helpful. You have to have some idea of what you are doing in his class, or you will fail.",0
"okay whoever said jeri is bad is an idiot. shes not the head of the art department for nothing people. shes compassionate, caring and ALWAYS makes time for people. she helped me get my art program up and running. im so happy MU has her, and shes the head of the department. great professor, great person.",1
Hicks seems indifferent about teaching undergrads.  He's better off doing research and not teaching as students don't learn much with him.,1
"He's a bit snooty and pretentious. He has sometimes discredited film as ""art"". The philosophy book you have to read is super confusing. He is also a bit extra for an assignment where you have to write four sentences (ie it's not even an essay or anything), we had to print it out as apparently handwritten is not good enough for him.",0
"She really knows her ballet and is passionate about dance. She is sweet and encouraging, but will never hesitate to correct your alignment or turn out if it's off. Take her for Ballet 1.",1
"Shes alright, but shes really strict about grading. You really need to follow her instructions otherwise youll get a bad mark. Make sure to use the student learning services before you hand in your paper.",1
"He knows the language and etymology well and a lot about Germanic cultures, but it is difficult to do well in the course without any prior experience. Practically no homework and it is never taken up. He spends most of the class working through the exercises in the textbook. I do not recommend him. But he's not the worst either.",0
Sondra Ricar in my opinion is not an excellent instructor because she has negative opinions about students and quite frankly she doesn't try to help students succeed in the course and if you do something wrong when you know you didn't she accuses you rightaway and is a terrible judge of character.,0
He is completely clueless about teaching. He is extremely difficult to understand and does not explain what he is doing or why he is doing it. He just reads what he is writing on the board without explaining anything. Avoid at all costs. You will need to seek out external resources to learn the material on your own. The free PDF textbook is awful.,0
"Arlene Casiple is such a sweet lady, and she would do anything to help you. I don't know if my difficulties were because she moved really fast, the fact that I suck at math, or the fact it was online. It was definitely a rough time at some points, but she is very willing to help you. She does go fast, and her accent can be heavy sometimes.",1
Ice age earth class was super easy and he makes a subject that seems boring super interesting. He is funny and down to earth. you HAVE to attend class or you will be kicked out of the class because you have a quiz every day. The quizzes are super easy though and if you do well on them you will get an A,1
"She is one of the laziest teachers i have ever had at any university. Her ""lectures"" are just her reading random points from the book and telling us what the test questions will be. She puts absolutely no effort into class and then is confused as to why none of the students want to participate. I would avoid her at all costs if you want to learn",0
"This class the bomb diggity if you need to take care of those pesky honors/core reqs.  Take it and you wont regret it.  A laptop is a must.  Class has no bearing on any work, but it is interesting sometimes. I could pass without attending a single class i think.  Steer towards this class if you want to chill and piss out an A+ on those dirty cores.",1
"BEST Hearing teacher, Just do what she says!",1
"There are two midterm exams, one non cumulative final and 10% is participation. Anatomy is a difficult class overall, so you really have to read the textbook/do the questions in the textbook if you want to do well on the exams and retain the information. He gave review questions before each exam that were very helpful and held a review session.",1
"I really liked Tim-sensei, he's a great professor, and he knows how to teach Japanese very well.",1
"Took LFS250 with him, and thought that was the worst he could do. Prepare for LFS350, cuz he would give you even more unorganized course websites, even more confusing wordings in online quizzes, and assignments that are totally waste of your time.",0
"FOR A COMMUNICATION CLASS, WE HAD NO COMMUNICATION AT ALL.  SYLLABUS ARE CONFUSED. I WOULD NEVER TAKE IT AGAIN.",0
"Love her, love her, love her.",1
"He gets very upset when students ask questions, he goes through his lessons very quick and writes pretty terrible on the board. The worse part is he grades each student differently. You and another person could have made same mistakes but only one gets credit. Easy A because his tests are same as his practice test just different numbers. ",0
"Prof. Kowallis is awesome! He's very good at explaining concepts, and making class fun.  I thoroughly enjoyed his class.",1
"Class is not nearly as hard as the other reviews you see here. I only studied for 3 days prior to the exams. The key is to do all of the exercises she assigns and take notes of what you get wrong, while also paying attention to tricks the questions use--she puts the same tricks on her exams. Overall, not bad, final is pretty easy, got an A on it.",1
"She is a nice person, but not a good teacher. Her examples make absolutely no sense with the way she presents them (just writes on board and does not explain it, constantly erases things while writing the example and jumbles it all up). The content itself you can learn on your own because frankly, she doesn't teach it well.",0
"This is the hardest class you will take as a microbio major. Sears earned his PhD studying immunology- this is what he was born for. You'll be in awe of his genius by the end, but God help you if you take this class lightly.",1
Awesome teacher! I took a lot from this class! Highly reccomend :),1
"This professor is almost impossible to pay attention to in class, he is quite hard to understand when he is explaining complex topics and he uses notes provided by other professors. He always appears to simply be reading the notes from the slides and makes me wonder what I am paying him for when I could just get the same thing from reading myself.",0
"This class was one of the funnest classes I have ever taken. Learning how to make different videos and editing them is amazing and it is no pressure, everyone gets a chance to do it. The teacher is very nice and accessible outside of the classroom. One thing is that you have to TRIPLE check deadlines because they are not always 100% clear.",1
"IF YOUR LIFE DOES NOT DEPEND ON YOU TAKING THIS CLASS, DO NOT TAKE IT! TA sections more worthwhile, but still extremely difficult for non-music majors and NOT WORTH the aggrevation :( HATED THIS CLASS",0
"BEST CHEMISTRY PROFESSOR AT USC! Very clear, answers all questions, fair tests, and extra credit! If you do all of the homework, you'll make a good grade.  Very understanding and easy to talk to.  Don't take anyone else!",1
"Joyful, suave, insightful",1
"I would not recommend her to anyone. She was rude when students asked questions and does not seem to care at all about her students in general. Exams are really difficult and worth 30% each. Every time a student voiced concerns she seemed to ignore them completely. Overall, I had an extremely bad experience.",0
I really enjoyed his teaching style. It allows you to be a bit more independent and not have to study for quizzes or tests. He's funny and welcoming. I definitely recommend him,1
"Dr. Ilvento's class was online and super easy. The class is divided into 4 sections, each with 2 quizzes, 2 guided exercises, 2 assignments, and an exam. You have about 3-4 weeks for every section and once exams are online, you can take them any time within a 3 day window. The class was an easy A. Definitely take Ilvento for STAT200",1
"Very fun guy, and interesting discussions in class. Class typically lasts only 30 minutes. first half of semester is reading short stories (very simple) then just talk about it in class. I only had to write 2 papers (only 750 words) the whole semester. second half of semester is reading short poetry (simple). It really is just a discussion class.",1
"Great guy! Makes the class interesting. If you read the book the tests are super easy.  Come to class and utilize what he says and the sales presentation will go fine! Great prof, i would recommend him to anyone! marketing major or not!",1
she's really knowledgeble and interested in student's learning and acheivement,1
"Martha expects us to do way more work than a full 5 course class load student can handle. Hundreds of pages of reading per week on top of a different book used for writing a book report. At least 4 worksheets due every week, and expects us to finish the long, dry chapters in a few days. She calls on random kids in class, so read the material.",0
"Terrible at teaching. If you are confused about something and ask her a question she will get mad at you and then tell you, you should have taken better notes. She is also very Rude to students and is not good and conveying the material. Avoid at all costs.",0
Talks really fast but really nice and helpful. Somewhat difficult.,1
"The friendliest professor Ive ever met. He always walks into the room bright and cheerful. The entire class is filled with discussion about the readings, he makes it engaging. Gives out question sheets which really help with the reading. Essays were tough but hes at his office to help. Be sure to be ahead for the final, or it can sneak up on you.",1
Dr. Brown is very funny and uses real-world experiences to help you understand the material better. He's very real with his students and has a wonderful class atmosphere. His classes are easy if you study properly. Outside of class he goes above and beyond to open opportunities to students in the EHS department.,1
"While Professor Schlortt is very knowledgeable in his subject, this is by far the worst teacher I have ever had. He fails to communicate clearly outside of class. He fails to provide tools to help you succeed on quizzes and tests in a timely manner. He is antagonistic with his feedback. The list could go on forever, avoid this excuse of a teacher.",0
"Dr. Wiseman is very strict and has no patience for students that have families. He does not make try and meet the needs of a student that is going through a hard time. And also as well, he does not narrow down what to study before an exam.",0
I dont usually do this but this guy is just too soft spoken to be a professor. You can hardly hear anything he says.,1
"I may not like her but I do respect her. Good teacher, thorough explanations and applications of the material. Certainly has an attitude and will not hold your hand: pay attention to the syllabus and assignment descriptions. She's the only professor I've had who I felt held us to college standards, not high school standards.",1
"Excessive workload considering it's a 100 level class. Tutorials and Lectures felt like two different classes, didn't connect well together at all in regards to assignments. Nice person, but speaks much too quietly and slowly resulting in boring lectures. One book was hardly even used. Not recommended.",0
"Actually a great class, the lectures are very intriguing. Ivor is a funny guy in a quirky way. You need to attend the lectures, he does not use a powerpoint and the outlines he sends out are very limited. Do the readings, they're necessary. And most of all prepare for the map quiz, it is most definitely worth it",1
"Fantastic prof. Had her for ""La France de l'ancien regime"" a few years ago, hope she's still teaching. Engaging and entertaining lectures, gives good feedback, and is quite easy to communicate with. Really makes you interested in the subject and I left the course with a lot under my belt. Would 110% take a course with again.",1
The hand writing skill of this prof is terrible!!!!! I have to doubt that he has some both mental and physic disability!,0
"She was frequently unprepared for class, and lost her temper easily.",0
"I had him this summer, hes very helpful but his class is hard and when you ask him a question he always go around the question which confuses you",1
"The class is passable but the structure of the class was frustrating. The guys powerpoints and lectures are little to no help for the weekly quizzes. The tests are full of typos and extremely specific questions. There is a 30+ page pager, which is actually around 50 because there are so many required sources. The class is a waste of time.",0
I had Dr. Rogers for advanced calculus and real analysis.  What an amazing teacher! He cares about his students and tries to make the math in these classes relevant to real life.  He just wants to make sure you know what you need to before you leave his class.,1
"Very nice guy but learned next to nothing in this class. He made sure everyone's grades turned out alright with 4 take home quizes, 2 take-home exams, and an open-note test but feeling like I'll be spending lots of time in the tutor center for CHM 102.",0
"Rude. Interrupts students while they are presenting & tells them they are wrong (how embarrassing for them). Never clear with what she wants, will mark you down for things she claims she said was required but never did. Call her out on something, she will become a total B. Such a BORING lecture, tells lame stories, explains pointless things. SUCKS.",0
"This class is bogus. Katz's lectures don't correspond with the homework/tests, so even if you pay attention 100% of the time and do all the required work, you aren't guaranteed to be able to figure out his homework/tests, which are more about trivia than they are about physical science.",0
He's extremely condescending and you will not be respected what so ever in or outside the classroom. Often embarrasses and shames you in front of your peers for just asking a question. Mathematical errors happen more often than not even on study guides and tests.,0
"Seemingly disorganized at first, Mr. Hellman's style soon appealed to me. He is old school and tries to push away from the current generic style of lectures. He is immensely knowledgeable about his subject and always encourages discussion and questions in class. Its been a pleasure taking French history with him, I will look for him as a prof again",1
"She is a very fun teacher who does not look down upon students, especially shy ones. She understands acting out in front of others is hard sometimes. therefore she walks the class through the exercises. The midterm and final are in project from that require some outside classwork with others. There are a couple mandatory play reviews and attendance",1
"Bibza gives amazing lectures filled with Snapple facts and funny (or dry-humored) jokes. He gives amazing lectures and tries to cover hanging questions about controversial Bible topics. Extra credit is available in all of his classes, so if you take him multiple times in one semester, you can turn in one extra credit for all of his classes.",1
"Dr. Teekell is extremely passive aggressive. She sounds really nice but her comments are quite rude in class. If you are sensitive I would not take her class. She assigns lots of reading and says that she realizes her students are overwhelmed and burdened by the amount of reading, then assigns more. It feels very insensitive when she wants grace.",0
"The test have nothing to do with lectures. Test are all on the reading and they are not covered in lecture. Very rude and unprofessional. Laughed at multiple students who were having hardships in class. Calls out students during lectures, brings up their personal issues, and laughs. Not understanding at all.",0
An extremely boring and redundant professor who really doesn't seem to care too much about the students. Will avoid classes that name him as prof.,0
"never read a thing or watched more than 5 lectures, still passed. there's 5 exams, many weekly assignments, some learning checks after each chapter. answers for odd # are in the back of the book, just do the work somewhat right and she'll give you the credit you need. you need the book. could've had a better grade if I tried more but I'm lazy.",1
"Kate is amazing. I would highly recommend her! Gives you credit for doing artwork, you do not have to be an artist to get good grade.",1
Was not good at getting her ideas accross.  Very tough grader on paper.,0
"Awful! Just awful! He gives out take home tests and hosts help-stations which are nice but no help or clarification. All he does is nods his head and expects way too much. Plus, all he does is write on the board exactly what the book says that he wrote himself and doesn't explain much. Do not take his class unless you really love teaching yourself!",0
Awesome person and a great teacher! respected.,1
"I should have dropped.  doesn't keep office hours, wouldn't speak to me after class, grades unfairly",0
"Randy is a good prof & explains the material very thoroughly. The only thing is that he reads from a paper and doesn't show it via slideshow, or post online. This makes the class extremely difficult only b/c he speaks fast and its hard to write down everything. Tests are difficult b/c he expects way too much and will give you 0.1%. GIVE EXAMPLES!!!",0
"honestly, if u have no background in programming.. don't even think about it her.. unless u have someone else going to help u during the course.",0
"Great teacher and very helpful.  Knows spanish like none other.  He should be teaching at Harvard or Yale, not at USC.",1
"he didn't really teach me much, really just personal questions that don't include the terms or much criteria. he did not prepare me for the exam, but passing the class was not hard because it was all based on easy questions about your life",0
I had yang for 5 MATH and CSCI classes. The subject matter is always hard but if you go to class you'll do fine. In class he sticks to the slides for the content but does examples on the board. The assignments come from in-class examples and test come from assignments. Very willing to help students and flexible on due dates if you need extra time.,1
Super nice guy!! Super confusing guy!! Didn't get any grades returned after Sept but still came out with an A. Goes off the subject completely and uses some in-depth math. Usually left class with no idea what had been taught. But.... very helpful if you put in extra time to go see him during office hours. Loves robots!!,1
Expected WAY TOO MUCH for a 100 level class. She's a good teacher for Latin but she is terribly for beginning Greek unless you spend a minimum of 7 hours a week on her homework. Completely unreasonable.,0
Dr. McBeth is not an easy grader at least with the grad students. I have taken three courses from him and he provides detailed feedback on all papers. I improved over time in his classes and you learn a lot. I have also never seen any graded group projects in his classes.,1
"if you have this teacher, don't even try to pay attention, just read the book.  That is all he does in classto teach anyways.",0
Extremely boring. You will hate your life for the hour during which he speaks,0
"He was incredibly boring and vague.  If you ask him a question about the material, he will just tell you what is already on the slide or give you an author who explains it.  His amount of eye-contact is creepy too.  Exams are average.",0
"Hilarious & out-going; course itself is a bit difficult if your new to programming, but as others mentioned, the assignments help very much.",1
"Our class gave him the nickname ""Swag Master Jones"". He is really quirky and funny, but you get used to it. His lectures are really interesting and easy to follow. Just don't interrupt him during a lecture. He hates that.",1
"Im surprised I don't see comments about how inappropriate and problematic this professor is. He talks in circles and his lectures become redundant after week two. He uses awful examples in class to explain his points. Most of his examples are centered around race, politics or class. He also likes to talk about sex, how did we get here again? AVOID.",0
"Not really a class that is worth taking. I took this class because all the other English professors were full and this teacher was open. Now I know why. My two other friends taking English 1A at the moment don't even have finals, one of them is going to a breakfast with his class. For the amount of work we do, and the grade we get, not worth.",0
"If you skip class, you won't pass. He gives quizzes EVERY class and they are each 5 questions.... (on a good day)  He won't help you out with your grade and doesn't teach. He lectures, but lectures over things that aren't even on the test. It's your responsibility to know EVERYTHING with no help.",0
He is one of the best professors. He will help you learn and is very easy going.,1
"took over for our physic teacher half way through the semester because he was ill. Completely changed the lesson plan. skipped 5 chapters of learning because we left off at chapter 11 before spring break and came back on chapter 16... and then tested us over 11-15. Nice lady, but her homework and lesson plan could use some work",0
"Pretty good class when he lectured and super helpful when you ask for more help. Pretty cool guy too, super passionate in general.",1
"She doesn't respond to emails, the textbook is really annoying, professor is disorganized, often forgets to post notes on blackboard before class",0
Barhi is by far one of the worst professors at Rider. He is extremely unclear in what he expects and uses abstract examples that actually make the material more complicated. I do not recommend taking him at all.,0
"One of the worst professors I have had. He is a respected professor but he just shares his views and finds a ""philosophical"" way to invalidate those who do not agree with him. Grading criteria is unclear, and he makes you read A LOT. He has made some gross and questionable comments in class. Overall, would NEVER take a course with him again.",0
"I cannot believe he is teaching at a university like UMBC. He is nowhere near a qualified teacher. A teacher is someone, who loves to be asked questions when something is not clear to students. When you ask him a question, he will make you seem like you are the least clever person in the world. Old school boring lecture and not enough time on tests",0
"best teacher ever!!!!! she will help you no matter what and she makes you smile everyday!!!! teachers and i do NOT mix, but she's the GREATEST!!!!!! If you get her, thak GOD!!!SHE will help you to understand anything!",1
"Probably one of the easiest classes Ive taken. You get discussion assignments per chapter, along with quizzes per chapter. Quizzes are straight forward. We had 2 groups projects, 2 major exams worth 100pts each, again pretty easy and straightforward. She gives feedback on assignments which is great because it allows you to correct any mistakes.",1
"excellent teacher. judith is passionate about her own work, and brings that passion to class. 
 easy?- no- if you want easy stay in your garage!
 she is a professional, and i found she valued imput and one's genuine creative process as long as she could sense it was sincere and dedicated.definitely a valuable addition to york's often bloated staff.",0
"Makes you work, but he's great. Any mistakes are your own to make.",1
I find that staring at paint drying is more interesting than Professor Hulsey's class. She gives nothing but dry lectures and hardly engages the class with anything useful. Most of what I learned came from using McGraw Hill Connect which will be essential if lectures aren't your thing. Content is tough to be fair but tests were online and fair,0
"Dr. Reznikova is a hurrble teacher. I don't recommend her.  She's so rude if you ask her for help, and her lectures are boring. therefore her exams are tough. I acutlly hated her class. I wouldn't take her again ever.",0
"Clever, funny, comprehensive, capricious, unfair, inconsiderate. Recommends students take finals week off from work, the workload is so murderous. This is good advice. Class size is so big (mandatory class) that she pushes the incredibly subjective (""you don't need a grading rubric, you're in grad school"") essay grades to her TA, which can cost you",0
"Its simple; If you are NOT GREAT at math find another professor. If you are Great at math this class will be great for you. Good Professor, just not helpful for those new to Stats.",0
"I would NEVER take her again. Only ended up with her because the professor we were supposed to have got bumped to another class. She's the most disorganized professor I've ever had, losing student assignments and faulting students. She tells her students that they are ""too good"" at spanish resulting in bad grades. If she doesn't like you good luck",0
Soft-spoken,1
"Attendance isn't ""mandatory,"" but if you don't go, it's like hell trying to catch up. He was slower teaching the curriculum so we were always behind. However, he was willing to help if you were desperate enough to ask. He's a good guy. Just an overall challenging class.",1
This class was horrible. She grades on however she wants and doesn't give back any comments. Her scantron tests are not even covered in the book.,0
"Loved this teacher. Wish I had taken her for ECO 252 as well! Shah has the best ratings at Wake Tech for a reason, that being SHE IS EXCELLENT. If you are looking to take ECO 251 and ECO 252, try and get a seat in her class. She is highly flexible, will work with you, and treats her students like family. This professor is a true gem.",1
"Absolutely horrible teacher!!! After the second week I started getting only 7/10 on my assignments...and no reason why. His only guideline was that it be 100 words and I met that requirement. When I emailed him, he said there were hidden requirements he never mentioned. Terrible grader. One of the worst teachers I've ever had.",0
"If you have a short attention span the lectures are very long and can get boring since he focuses more on the history aspect of it rather than the actual reading. You could get away with missing lectures. The prompts are not difficult plus he post a ""study guide""/prompts for the final exam but the grade you get is rather dependent on your TA.",0
If you want to learn C++ or whatever language this bum is teaching don't take him. Easy A if you just copy the assignments and study the previous exams but if you actually want to learn then avoid like the plague.,0
"Hardest teacher i have ever had. She teaches a intro class like a 400 or 500 level class. She is  a very hard grader. she knows her stuff, she is just not made out to be a teacher.",0
"Great guy, knows what he's talking about and loves what he does. The tests are hard, and he grades hard too, I am usually a high B-A student and this class was tough. I didn't hate it though",1
Professor vendetti was amazing. Took her evolution class over winter and it was a breeze. I actually learned a good amount of information and didn't forget all of it immediately after the semester was over. Overall a great perso and very knowledgeable. I'd definitely take again !,1
He's an awsome professor.  Not to mention his accent helped me concentrate in class!:),1
"Hybrid. Unclear with his expectation, expects class to complete group assignments within 2-3 days. Weekly quizzes are found online and as long as you complete it, you get credit. Midterm & final are EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE QUIZZES. EASY A, but you won't learn anything. He makes everyone hate group work even more. I did not buy the textbook.",0
i hated her... really ****y and plays favorites,0
Horrible teacher. Never admits shes wrong. All she talks about is the steelers. She needs to talk about going to the gym because shes super husky. Overall weak teacher that gives women a bad name,0
"Terrible incapable teacher, totally unclear, vague as hell. Half her class has gone missing since the term began. Learn more from the book than from her.",0
She is awesome !!,1
Amazing professor!!!!  You do not really need the book as long as you come to class.  Only 2 tests and four mini papers.  Easy A!!,1
"How can someone so narrow-minded and ignorant get hired to teach a college class? Believes wholeheartedly that he, Plato, and Socrates are gods and every other human is a mindless dog",0
professor green is hands down one of the best in the econ department. he knows so much about the material and you can tell he really cares about it too. on top of that he is both likeable and personable. i recommend this class to anyone interested in economics because it offers insight into issues that many other mcgill econ classes dont.,1
"Easiest class I ever taken at CMU. Make sure you do the online quizzes and discussion boards. Don't bother going to class, just do the study guide before the Exam and you will do fine.",0
"Teacher is nice and very knowledgeable of the subject, but when it comes to teaching techniques he's lacking. Also he goes really slow on simple topics, then when the tough ones come near the end he goes quick. I understand that this a intro course to programming, but if you believe you know basics, best to just go over power points by yourself.",0
"This class was easy since, at least, half of the students weren't English majors. I've also taken  ENG 4650 and 4635 with Jackie.  I just want everyone to know that these are all ENGLISH classes, so yeah you're gonna have to read. But, she's a great lecturer, her grading criteria is fair, and if you're having a hard time just talk to her",1
Excellent in every way.,1
Shes an amazing professor. She cares about her students and she explains material when you need extra help. She also gives out extra credit at the end of the semester.,1
Dr. Finelli let his class do his work for him. I was most frustrated at the peer reviewed assignments that determined my grade. It seemed as though my randomly assigned peers would sometimes not even read my essays and arbitrarily give a mediocre grade. Many noted a lack of detail about certain things that were actually clearly shown in my work.,0
show how math can be used in many different areas and was helpful with our projects,1
"Took comparative cultures - had nothing to do with that. She just talked about her own research about environmental issues in the Amazon (where is the comparing of cultures??) and completely missed the point of the class. Completely turned me off to anthropology. 0/10, professor didn't read syllabus about what class should be about.",0
Pharm online was super easy. I studied exactly what she put on the study guide and got all As on the quizzes. Follow exactly what she ask for with discussion post and you will get 100. Take this professor for whatever classes that you can !,1
Hes honestly my favorite professor from Suffolk. I had him once before in seminar and loved him so much. Everyone talks highly about him and the class is interactive and hes always around to help you whether its by email or face to face. All his stories are hilarious and everything applies to what hes teaching. You really have to try to fail.,1
"Dont do this to yourself. There are even math majors that withdraw this class. If you decide to take this anyway, bring a sleeping bag and prepare to make the tutoring center your new home.",0
"Jason Levy is a great prof, a really smart guy, and teaches you all the essentials you need to succeed.",1
"I can see that the honors profs or studs have gotten together to improve the ratings of the worst profs (see hares-stryker too).  Sorry nerdos, mcdaniel is still not a good teacher. She may be smart but she doesnt know how to teach.",0
UI100 is a blow off class but Shonta makes it unnecessarily busy with all the unneeded homework. Other UI100 classes are much easier.,1
"Dr. Mattson is alright. He comes off as very knowledgeable and nice, but if you go to his office hours, he is quite rude and condescending. His tests are stupid hard, class averages are never higher than a 65, be prepared to work for your grade.",1
"It is so unnecessary to make a class difficult and confusing. The guy asks of so much when it comes to the discussion board part of the class that it becomes confusing. 20% of the total grade. that's how ridiculous he is. Also, Three written assignments and a research paper. Do not take it unless you need to.",0
"I didn't believe what people wrote- thought it would be interesting to have a prof with different ideas.  I was VERY very wrong.  Boring, arrogant, creepy, and cites incorrect facts. Teaches Buddhism, not humanities. DONT DO IT. I wish I could find a way to get this man fired. Tests are based on what is said in class and supplemental readings.",0
Would not recommend,0
Professor Sanchez-Bello is cool and helpful. She does have an accent but you'll be able to understand and get the concept of the course. Her reviews are great. I wish more professors were like her,1
"Do NOT take this class online. Dr. Furman was extremely hard to get in touch with and he rarely responded to emails. When he did respond to them, he made you feel stupid and he was mad that you emailed him in the first place. If you visited him in his office, he made you feel like the biggest inconvenience to him and he was often very rude.",0
I was VERY inspired by Shavval!! I also really enjoyed peer editing!!!! She really cares about her job and she TRULY believes that ANYONE can reach their goals NO MATTER WHAT!!!!!!,1
"I didn't think I'd do well with Paszek but his class was actually really easy. He is monotone but everything that he says shows up on the tests so take good notes. You really can't miss a class if you want to do well because of how lecture heavy the class is. Overall, Paszek is a great guy and a solid choice for a prof!",1
"Shelvey is super passionate about the subject he teaches, although sometimes he emphasizes too many things making it hard to know what's vital. Take notes, read the text and TAKE THE STUDY QUIZZES ONLINE. It's sometimes hard to ""read his mind"" when it comes to assignments and it's not always clear what he wants in paragraph responses or essays.",0
"Although Linda is helpful and her assignments are easy (4 projects and 1 two-page paper), she doesn't warn you that you will be buying 90% of your materials. Many of which are VERY expensive! Takes attendance at the end of class so you have to stay the whole time. If you are a baller on a budget, don't take this class. Otherwise, have fun.",1
What a dreadful instructor. He clearly doesn't care at all about whether the students understand the material and spends all his time outside of class trying to be some kind of talking head.,0
"Great professor and easy class. Although it was an online class, we had zoom sessions and he had guest speakers. Amazing lectures and extremely helpful professor. Easy class.",1
Dexin Shi is the best professor I have taken at USC. His lectures are very clear. He does take attendance but his lectures will help you learn the material easily. Super helpful inside and outside the classroom. 10/10 would recommend taking him. There are four tests and the final is optional. Homework is similar to tests & no Friday classes!!!,1
"The professor is inherently a nice guy, he is has those sweet grandpa vibes. However, being a good person and a good professor are two completely different things. His lectures are dry and hard to understand. The topic itself is introduced quite blandly and the essay topics are boring and are hard to formulate deep analysis of.",0
"I would say professor Olsen is fair and tough at the same time.  He cares about his students and loves to engage in discussions.  He has a vast amount of business experience that helps students learn by using real-life stories with a variety of examples.  He expects high quality work, yet is forgiving if you follow the rules and communicate well.",1
"Pay attention and you'll be fine. 3-4 tests make up your entire grade, so make sure you do well on each of them. He curves heavy if he feels you earned it, so step up your game for the final.",1
"Potentially the worst math prof I've had in 4 years.. I have no idea why he has such a high rating. I guess because tests are easy, he copies exact questions from homework and practice tests onto the actual tests. Does absolutely no review of calculus or linear algebra. Pulls things out of nowhere without explaining. You will be so lost in class.",0
"This is a pretty easy class to make an A in. His lectures aren't super interesting but if you take decent notes you should be able to make an A or B on the tests (all of which were online.) He randomly takes attendance but I missed a couple and he still gave me a 100. 3 tests, 1 group project, attendance.",1
Do yourself a favor and DO NOT take this course. She is rude and extremely unhelpful. Her tests are ridiculously hard. I work my hardest in that class I am an struggling to get a high D.,0
"Absolutely the worst class Ive ever taken, every single person Ive talked to in the class has said theyre failing or close to failing. Each journal is worth 1 point, one page reports are 5 and the mid term was 10&15. Low point class and unclear prompts, she later says that shes ACTUALLY looking for whatever. Also she wrote the textbook",0
"Her class was easy as she uses semi-generic test questions. We had only 2 essay tests and her final was an interview of someone that was born before the 1970's. Easy class though the test used multiple sources ( videos, textbook, powerpoints) which was a bit annoying to follow but with an hour to take a 20 question test you could look up stuff.",1
"Hard to understand his English, makes ANYONE who asks a question look stupid and gets angry when someone doesn't understand something. He's been using the same notes for years and doesn't even bother to fix typos on the math work and expects us to notice typos in his notes. He's rude and reads straight from notes he made years ago. Not a good prof.",0
"Excellent in teaching Fourier optics. Working in his group requires prior knowledge in the subfield you are supposed to work on. Very helpful professor, often willing to help his students accomplish and reach their career goals.",1
"Brother Lenhart is a really nice guy. If you want a class that you'll learn a lot in he's probably not the guy for you, but he is so nice and tries to make his classes fun and interesting! He is very easy to work with and gives lots of extra credit. His class was the most chill one I had this semester and he is not strict which is super awesome",1
Don't. Just don't. I am the type who does not get scared off by bad reviews but this is the first time I regret it. Heed my warning (lol),0
The professor is great. He is easy to understand and his explanations are easy to understand. H you don't need any textbooks because he gives a lot of handouts. Also his sylubus is super easy to understand and follow.,1
"I anticipated A&P being difficult, but was pleasantly surprised. While definitely not an easy class, tests are only on the information presented in class. If you go to class, read your textbook, and do the assignments, you will be fine. Professor is approachable and will show you your grade if asked. Very knowledgeable and a great professor!",1
"His online course is ridiculous. He says any edition of the book works, but we must check the lec. and topic line up (when we won't know what the topic is). His tests are barely relevant to the material and he won't use Canvas. His lectures are 10 min and extremely vague. Resources are not clear on what to use them for or when they are needed.",0
"Don't take her. If I hadn't taken Physics in high school, I would not have passed. She does a horrible job at explaining things. I bought the textbook and have not opened it all semester. I was honestly only attending class for iClicker points, because I was teaching myself the material on the internet.",0
"For someone teaching about equality and fairness, her grading techniques are far from that. She grades your assignments like shes an English professor and more so based off her opinion versus content. BE WARNED. Class was a piece of cake, dealing with her contradicting grading, she is nowhere near consistent or grammatically perfect herself.",0
I hated this class. Dr. Chisholm took 6 weeks to grade a 1 page double spaced assignment worth 300 hundred points and the same amount of time for a 2 page single spaced assignment worth 500 points. Has unrealistic expectations for the Doc. analysis. He wastes time in class with useless information. Wouldnt recommend,0
"This guy knows his stuff.  helpful when you ask questions, and he has a quirky sense of humor",1
"A lot of the course is very advanced for an intro course. Especially being a computer science major, you need to practice these methods a lot in order to do well. The lab tests are difficult. Projects are rediculous for an intro course. The course goes from 0-100 real quick.",0
"Would skip over multiple slides at a time and say we already talked about it. Information we discussed in class didn't really go with exams. For a general bio class, he made the concepts really hard to understand",0
"As a grader I found Black to be impulsive and hypocritical. He would often give an assignment and then change it...a few times. His expectations were unclear and he took a long time to grade papers. I never knew how I was doing in his class until I got my final grade. There were no exams though, so at least there was that.",0
great class!,1
"Price is a hilarious, but a terribly harsh grader. His assignments are also VERY unclear. It feels like he takes more time coming up with jokes than he does being clear with his homework. The homework starts out simple, but gets to be extremely tedious as the class moves on. Not neceasarily difficult, but tedious. Wouldn't have him again.",0
"She is one of the best professors I have ever had. she is extremely nice and very helpful.if you ask her for help she will get out of her way to help you.Her class is hard and she will not just give away an easy A,however if you work hard enough,pay attention and do your HW,you will get an A.Take her if you really want to learn.",1
Over-complicates everything and is too proof focused. Did not learn any actual math with numbers.,0
"Pretty difficult, even for a beginner level chem. lectures are dry and boring. Most of the tests are from the book, so don't overly rely on lecture. Just spend a good chunk of time studying from book and you'll do okay.",0
She does not explain anything clearly. We had a research paper due and she spent like 2 minutes explaining it. Very disorganized. Since she doesnt explain things well it would seem as though she would have handouts. She always gets off topic. I got a C+ and I was a teachers pet !!,0
"His classes are the most intellectually stimulating ones I have taken.  If you like professors that just want you to regurgitate what they tell you on tests, he's not for you.  If you want a professor who will challenge your ability to think and teach problem solving skills, he's your man.",1
"The person who gave the most recent review could not be more accurate! Big emphasis on the fact that she's passionate and knowledgable, yet condescending and disorganized. While her notes are hard to follow, she doesn't give you unnecessary information to write down, so it's manageable. She doesn't take attendance but going is so helpful for tests!",1
Hard classes but very helpful and interesting. Tries to make classes interesting by interjecting personal stories. Best Prof so far.,1
Mean and enjoys messing with students heads. If you have any other classes mine as well drop them because you will be able to do nothing but meet with raj every day of your miserable life. Does not teach how to program. Assignments are horrible and test are horrible. Ruthless grader. And you must pass both parts or will fail. save yourselfheartache,0
"She is very nice but you are going to need to teach yourself. You will pay for HLS and do practices/mini quizzes almost every night. Youll have chapter quizzes every week. In class she will not go over anything you taught yourself, she will only do word problems or talk about future lessons. Very nice, just be aware you are on your own.",0
"She is awful, I went to her hours and she did not even help me with what I was struggling with. Just made me feel even worse for how I was doing in her class. Its online, its A L O T of material to understand and i suggest taking Dewitt in class.",0
DO NOT TAKE HER. Worst professor at the school. Did not know how to effectively teach a single student. Treated everyone like they were graduate accounting majors and if you didn't understand there's no hope for you. Acted like a genius when she hasn't worked in accounting industry at all. No help from her beyond lecture at all.,0
Fantastic teacher if you're enthusiastic and willing to learn.,1
"Dr. Gitomers class drove me to post on here for te very first time. Workload is inexplicable. Ive had 300 level classes pertaining to my major and they dont even compare to whats expected from you in this class. 15+ hours a week is an understatement for this online course. Im not trying to major in Buddhism, nor do I want to learn it all in 10w",0
Emailed them to put me from the waiting list to the class roster for financial aid reasons. They replied saying they could register me on day 1 and email my advisor. First day rolls around & I email them 1 hr prior to class for the zoom link since I noticed Im still not registered. No response. I email them again the next day & still nothing.,0
"Honestly, I found her to a fair professor for the most part and I took both micro and macro. While it was online, she gives lots of extensions and answers her emails fast. The tip I would suggest is to read the textbook to do well in the class and really review for her exams with the mock exams she provides. You can get an easy 70% with effort.",1
"Good prof., but the whoel wang-to-english subtitles are required.  Carleton needs to understand that clarity is a big part in the success of a student in a class like this.  If we can't understand what he says, then how can we learn anything at all?",1
"SHE SUCKS! DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! I studied for hours and still struggled because her exams are stupidly difficult and attendance is taken for EVERY lecture and discussion. I learned nothing, was stressed 99% of the time, and hated her 'teaching' style.",0
"It's clear that the prof is a nice guy. People say that he's not the best teacher, but csi/elg/seg 2911 does not have much to teach. Midterm is 80% common sense. Biggest issue is the obscure instructions and rubric given for assignments.",1
"Completly biased with her grading, unclear on anything she writes, ungodly hard and long exams, read power point to you and can't understand her own examples if they are even hers...",0
"Dr. Maher is one of the coolest guys I have ever met. He shares his travel storys to India and knows everything about religion. You must read the textbook and go to class. Very interesting and I would advise not only taking him, but getting to know him.",1
"You will rely heavily on the TAs to get you through this class, as the professor completely confuses everyone-- including the TAs occasionally. He definitely knows his material but fails to effectively teach the course. I should also mention he denied a student's disability accommodations to record the (online) lecture in front of the entire class.",0
"The boringest teacher I have ever had in my entire life. Unless you are super interested about Eastern European stuff this class is whorrible. Our entire class can't stand him, I will never take him again. Hard extended essay test, with a study guide that dosn't go with the notes",0
Really easy class!! Tests are from hw problems so just put them on your cheat sheet (allowed). Really nice guy but soft voice. Take his class if you want a good grade!,1
"I loved Allison and this class. I learned a lot of things that I actually will use in my future. He does not take attendance, but he does not post the lectures online so you basically need to go to class if you want to do well. He is very passionate about this subject and gives really good advice to help us in the future.",1
"She does not care about anyone but herself. LOTS of readings, LOTS of homework. She claims everyone thinks my course is easy which is not true she gives you lot of work and poor grades.",0
"Professor Elliott is a very sweet lady. Like with any English course, the material can be very dry at times, but she facilitates great class discussion. She also offers many extra credit opportunities so take advantage of them, because they will come in handy! Tests cover a lot, but are not impossible. Prioritize the time spent on writing essays!",1
"The content that this course covers is interesting, but professor presents it in a way that is rather complex and jumps right into the lectures without providing a backdrop to allow students to understand what exactly he is reviewing and why it matters. In other words, he can be a bit unclear. Overall, nice personality & prompt in replying to email",0
Didn't learn much. Wasted time about out class topics.,0
"She's lenient with grading the lab's but when it comes to quizzes they are just horrible! She would give you a random species that you have no information on a few days before the quiz and then expect you to become an expert on it in a few days! Her lectures are just horrid, she usually joins and talks about how hard her second job is mostly.",0
Very lecture intense class and do not leave once you've shown up - a girl did once and he stopped class to rant about students leaving. Somewhat hard to know what might go onto a test as he talks about so much during his lectures.,1
"Good Professor, work is easy, however be prepare to do a lot of assignments.",1
Took it online  Better idea 2 take in class if u can Alot of material 2 cover More time U spend more u learn  She gives EVERYONE the opportunity to pass if u do the assigments and even gives u extra time if u need it  Had 2 go 2 tutoring for a few labs  I'm glad I took it and she was fair and polite Thank you kindly,1
"West has the most challenging class I've ever taken. He makes it so much easier than it is, he is clear with his thoughts, always willing to help, explains things very very well, and is the top teacher I've ever received schooling from. He is very clever and talented, and I would recommend it to anyone who needs a challenge.",1
"For an evening MBA class with mostly full-time workers, he assigns a ridiculous amount of reading. Quiz material is way too specific. His instruction contradicts how he grades on writing assignments - tells you to do one thing and takes points off for it. Would not recommend.",0
"Very rude, very mean. It is very most important that you do not take class with her. She will not teach good and she will get out of from here. It is very most important you avoid her. WORST PROF EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
Avoid this prof if you can! His lectures are nonsensical and his expectations are very unclear. He goes off on strange tangents during lectures and then says to pay attention because everything is fair game to be tested. He often rambles and can say some pretty offensive/strange things. Only advantage is the high percentage given for attendance.,0
Many of these comments on Professor Miller are based off the fact that Chem in general is a harder class. He is a great teacher that is willing to help you with anything you need. ALEKS is used which is annoying but a great tool for studying and if you get most of the topics done its worth 25% of your grade. Quizzes and tests are not bad at all.,1
"A horrendous experience, really. I scraped an A, but only because he gave extra credit & the test questions come straight from lectures & HW. If they'd come from anywhere else I'd have been toast cause this man can't teach at all. He'd be bad at explaining things even if he spoke a word of English, which sadly he does not. Avoid if possible.",0
This class is giving me more work than me other 5 classes combines. A little bit extreme. He's way too into it and expects all of us to want to know everything about security. Class median is sitting at 62% as we speak. ZERO after completing assignments/labs if you do not include sources..Will I still be interested in the 3rd yr optional? Heck NO.,1
Great teacher. His lectures are clear and the tests are fair. If you do the homework he assigns you won't even have to study that much for the test.,1
"She's very sweet, but it's hard to get higher than a B in this class. The material is tough, and she blows through it. 2 midterms, a non-cumulative final, and a random ""subjective"" 10 points for a total of 100 possible. Go to class, it helps! Don't buy her lame, hard-to-read custom textbook. Buy a used full version for less. No +- grading.",0
study study study,0
Professor knows her subject. Tests are HARD! Gives opportunities for extra credit - take them because you're going to need it. Do all homework.,0
"As a Chinese, I don't even understand her accent.... Too much information for memorize and she only test on 15% of them. Do not try to run away during break.",0
"did well in the class without attending any of his lectures, attending tutorial and doing the reading questions are enough to get a good grade. overall this class is useless and all the material can be learnt via SparkNotes",0
"I mean.. i thought she is very easy at first because i took her class before and then i passed easily. However, if you slack, you can fail. Because she gives you very confusing feedback on your paper. She always says your creative ideas are really good but, she can fail you on very end of the papers.",0
TG is very helpful and actually cares. She makes the material easy to understand as long as you are willing to learn which means you must do the homework and seek help if you need it outside of class. MESA and Math center helped me polish up before class on test and quiz days. This is what a math class should be. No quirky nuanced prof. Just math.,1
"Professor Roth was one of the most amazing teachers I have ever had. At first, her class seemed difficult and was frustrating. However, her care and devotion towards her students is truly refreshing to see and if you put in the work you will be rewarded. The way she teaches you to write is very useful for the rest of your college career.",1
"Terrible feedback. Tough grader. Choices in reading are okay, but she tries to make you think HER way, not critically. It's only HER interpretation & you have to guess. Makes a class that could be great miserable. Contradicts herself; is all over the place with the syllabus. Take this class with another professor! Not worth the aggravation.",0
"Great class, all material was relevant.  I use everything he taught.",1
Like other professors in this program - this professor promotes a horrible double standard in which some groups are glamorized and cannonized and others are described as evil immoral perpetrators of injustice.,0
"Good guy. You have to put the work in throughout the entire semester - I didnt and had a tough time with the final exam. Teaches accounting in a unique way, which helps you stay focused on an otherwise mundane, difficult subject.",1
"I am conflicted. Even though I had experience with HTML coding, it was dated. I found the course very difficult. That is okay I like a challenge. But it seemed to me that there were 2 types of students - expert and novice with not much in between. Dave answered all my questions in a timely manner and even met with me in person which was v",0
very easy class....not many tests or quizzes so study for them....the midterm and final were very easy,1
"This teacher is one of the best I've ever had. There is a reason why he won teaching awards. He is very enthusiastic about what he is teaching and cares about how well the students are doing. He also like to joke around a bit which is a nice change of pace once in a while. Take this guy if you can, you won't regret it!",1
"Does not know the industry and often leaves out the most basic but essential stuff about equipment, editing whatever. Totally here for his own ego trip. Would not hire him to even PA on my set!",0
No,0
Was so excited to take this class. She just talked the whole time and went on tangents. Wasn't helpful at all and winded up hating the class. Don't suggest a class with her.,0
"Zimmer's life drawing class is super chill and easy going, mostly just graphite work but some projects have room for different media exploration. He'll draw on your paper, but always asks for permission first (let him, it actually helps). His hw never stressed me out much, but expect to have to make time to go to open model sessions on Fridays.",1
"Her English is good, but you need some time to get use to her accent. She knows what she is talking about, but just lacks this persona of a teacher because she almost seems mad at students for asking questions at times, and is always pretty sharp. No textbook to this course, and the entire outline is a mess. Wait for another prof if you can",0
Dr. Butt is amazing. He knows his stuff and is very interested in sharing what he knows. Pay attention and participate and you'll do well. Loves talking about Brexit and European history. Cares about you and will work with you.,1
Warning! Prepared for un replying emails and other very important issues unsolved for the professor in this course. She will wait for a very long time with no reply to her students' emails. Do not waste money on this course.,0
"Dr. Sharif is a very passionate professor who really enjoys teaching and it shows. Her lectures are clear and concise which is very helpful. She is full of knowledge, and she really cares about your success in this class (Health Promotion) and your improvement. She's awesome !",1
"Very, very difficult professor. Took his online lecture, and lab on campus. His midterm and final were unbelievably difficult, and even when the entire class told him they couldn't finish with the time given, he wouldn't budge. He is a very kind person, but when it comes to his class I would stay away if you want a high grade.",0
"Mook is one of the worse professors I ever had in UB. He had failed to provide bare minimum requirement of the contents for the course (ie competent notes, and lecture recording). Avoid this guy at any cost.",0
"Her tests were tough, with many open ended questions.  There were multiple writing assignments each week, so don't take this class if you aren't prepared to do a lot of writing.  Also, there is a large partner project but you have the whole semester to work on it.  The subject was very interesting, and the information was easy to digest.",1
DO NOT TAKE SALIMIAN. He is a horrible teacher that confuses his students. He is not a fair grader he only boost the grades of students that he likes. You ask him a question you will not get a straight answer at all. I regret taking his class. Honestly he should not be allowed to teach.,0
A good professor. Easy A as long as you stay on top of your weekly assignments. I didn't really get a feel for her as a professor as class was online with little input from her but yet I feel it was designed well and I learned quite a bit.,1
"Don't get me wrong this class is not hard at all. If you do all the chapter reviews, online quizzes and papers you will get an A in the class. The midterm and final is easy. I never went to class because the professor was mono tone and not engaging at all.",0
I would take every class Dr. Lombrana had to offer!,1
"Very sweet and knowledgeable professor. She's definitely an acquired taste as far as lectures go. Several times she's gone off topic, which can be quite funny but we fall behind on material. Very few one-page papers but be ready to read a lot. Opinionated and semi-tough grader. Not too sure what I took away from the class but it was okay.",1
Laurence is very enthusiastic and entertaining. He manages to blend literature and linguistics in a way that keeps things interesting. Unfortunately he has a habit of going off on tangents; his test questions are fiendishly difficult but he is a fair marker.,1
"I have no idea why this guy is still even teaching at Marist, why no one has come across what a horrible teacher he is, and why students come out of his class learning NOTHING. HE DOES NOT EVEN TEACH. I don't know who in their right mind would take him. AVOID!!!!!! He will KILL YOUR GPA",0
"Professor Jacobo provides studentsclients NEGATIVE ENERGY. Read ahead and don't procrastinate. Your educating yourself with this professor, because she provides zero support.",0
"Very interested in assuring the students do their best, and very available to help students learn as much as they can. Did not explain much of the material as was needed, and was a bit dis-organized.",1
awww i heart bob!,1
"Professeur qui a une manière particulière d'enseigner, puisqu'elle n'est tout simplement pas préparé ! Laisse ces questions et vidéos  inutilement trop long guider les cours et répète identiquement le narrateur de la vidéo, ce qui complète le cours. Elle se trouve très drôle et dévie du sujet constamment. J'ai jamais eu un professeur aussi ""plate""!",0
"Watch out, if you can try to take precalc with an easier professor.  He grades you as if you are a graduate student who wants to pursue math for a living. All exams are written, some essay type.",0
"For a first year class there was a lot of reading (we're talking at least a novel a week). Additionally, you have to listen to his unedited 2 hour voice lectures online in loo of in class time, which would be fine except it often has nothing to do with the weekly assignments given, and there is minimal (if any) feedback given on those assignments.",0
Professor Ruiz was nice but I felt as though the setup of her online course was a bit confusing and there were conflicting dates on there. She responds to emails and is helpful and always offering for you to go to her office if you have issues or questions.,1
"There is a tendency for the class to be really boring, but course research and assignments are really helpful and interesting.",0
"He lectures very fast and always ends up off subject. if you want to be able to read what he's writing on the board, sit in the front. If you can teach yourself, this is your class. If you do the homework you will understand everything but the test and quizzes are the only things he takes for grades so you have to do well on those.",0
"For a stats class going through equations step by step aids in grasping concepts. He simply reads off of the slides and explains each equation in only words. Very condescending in saying that the concepts are easy and ""even your grandmother will understand this"". I used a textbook from a different section and taught myself everything.",0
Awesome professor! Enjoyed his online class. Puts out all the work and you may complete it before due date working at your own pace. Take him you wont regret.,1
"Definitely a bad teacher. Found out about this site too late, so had to take him. Unfriendly, not at all helpful; sends you to the TA. Lectures are unclear & hard to follow; tests & essays extremely hard. Be prepared for a lot of reading, some of it irrelevant and unnecessary. Avoid him if you can for this class; don't take Joyner for TA either.",0
"this was a great class and he really made learning the thought process enjoyable. he really puts forth an effort to teach the class how to think through the logic of a cell biologist. oh ya, and he is my hero!woo hoo",1
BORING! not very helpful with writting papers!!!,0
"IL EST GÉNÉREUX DANS SA CORRECTION. MAIS, DONNE À PEINE DES EXPLICATIONS EN CLASSE. IL PARLE DE TOUT ET DE RIEN, AUCUN CONTEXTE!IL NE FAIT MÊME PAS UNE DÉMARCHE COMPLET IL ÉCRIT PLEIN DE CHIFFRE EN EXPLIQUANT VERBALEMENT. PREMIÈRE FOIS QU'IL DONNE L COURS. CONNAIT PAS LE FONCTMNT DE TT LES CALCULATRICE,PAS FAMILIER AVEC LES EXERCICE DE LAB. MOY:54%",0
"She has an accent, but I never had a problem understanding her. She seems to genuinely enjoy teaching and is clear about expectations.",1
Both incredibly dull and thoroughly unclear. Attempting to actually learn in this class is frusterating. His only two assessments (counting for your entire grade) had unclear criteria and were unfairly graded. KILLED my GPA when I worked my butt off.,0
"genuinely rude professor, make sure you not only speak during discussion, but that you also are prepared because he will make you feel horrible otherwise. class is moderate difficulty, lots of assignments are written unclear",0
"My time with Professor Gross was absolutely terrible. He wasn't considerate at all, and instead of encouraging students to learn and show them how to do certain things, he just calls them out for not knowing what to do. Here's a reality check for ya Professor: Math isn't everyone's forté so stop bringing people down and show them what to do.",0
"He is great. Make sure you go to class for the in-class quiz things they will help with the tests and count as participation for your grade. Tries to keep it exciting, but most of the jokes are terrible. Study a lot for the tests. Taking pictures of the slides is also a good idea. Book not needed goes directly off the powerpoints.",1
"Prof Klimchuk is VERY energetic and enthusiastic in his lectures, and he makes the material interesting and easy to understand.  Some of the marking on essays seemed a little arbitrary, but the exam was very easy.  Overall he is a fantastic prof - take his course!",1
"Super amazing women and super easy class. Theres rarely any homework and the midterm and final were both open book/open laptop. Easy A. Plus, Prof Marshall is an absolute sweetheart. She genuinely cares about the students and wants them to learn. She shows a real interest in our lives and education which is awesome. ",1
Professor McCall is an excellent professor who makes a complex subject understandable through his great examples. The textbook is really tough to read...I relied heavily on taking great notes during his lectures because he does a much better job of explaining the material than the text does. Take thorough notes and attend every class.,1
"Thibodeau is quite enthusiastic about accounting.  He teaches the basics very well, the group work is helpful in understanding material, and exams are challenging but very doable.  I got fired up in class and enjoyed it thoroughly.  How about that!",1
This course is extremely easy. Do the assigned homework. Use the practice exams he provides to study for his tests. Get A.,1
"This class is so easy. But the prof is horrible. His style of teaching puts you to sleep, so picky about the essay assignment, and his content on brightspace is all over the place.",0
"He seems like a very nice dude. However, he said he hasn't taught this particular level class in ten years. I believe he thinks we all know the basics of java, so he never really explains answers to anything. If we ask him to explain, he says we should already know the information. I am not a comp sci major and I needed a tutor to pass the class.",0
She is a good professor. Not a hard class a lot of reading though. Some have sparknotes some don't but they are not super hard and kinda interesting. She cares about what she teaches and is pretty nice.,1
The most approachable professor I've had. He cares about students and is even willing to help outside of the class. I would recommend him to other students.,1
Terrible prof. Doesn't care about students who need extra help. He just reads of the slides and expects you to understand it without any lab practice.,0
"Getting a B can be done with minimal work, but if you want anything higher, its going to require a lot of work. 9 quizzes that aren't easy if you don't read, grades the group presentation pretty hard. But always looked forward to class cause she's a pretty chill person. ",1
"Took his intro to Humanities course online, the class was very simple. You just have to listen to 3 audio lectures online and do a short writing assignment for each,and there are 3 tests. As long as you read the book for the tests you should do fine.",1
Martin Hillard is a great professor. If you want to learn the beginnings of law than I highly recommend this class. Attendance is a mandatory if you take the 3 hour class because he gives weekly quizzes. No exams other than the final and one written assignment. He uses helpful examples and always willing to answer questions even of the topic,1
His lectures are very confusing. Tends to be unorganized and his accent makes it more difficult to follow.,0
"He sometimes is excessively literate, meaning most of the time no one even can comprehend what he is saying. Although, he is a very good person and respectful of everyone's wishes.",1
"What a ridiculous class. It is unnecessarily impossible because Linda doesn't teach anything, and doesn't have a textbook for the class. The powepoints that she would rush through do not have the answers for the labs, so nobody knows how to complete them. You're forced to try to look up the answers online. Ask for help and she will insult you.",0
"lots of work, but you learn tons. grades papers really tough,and he likes daily pop quizzes on 40 pg. reading assignments; he's an officer who doesnt let the mids off easy",1
"Super clear in teaching, posts ambiguous and long homeworks, midterm was too long for the designated time, and I don't recommend taking courses with him unless you don't care about your grade.",1
"Great guy but not a good teacher. He taught easy problems in class but exams are hard. 4 tests and final exam are 50%. No extra credit so theres no way to increase your grade. He doesnt have A-, B+ either so your GPA will decrease a lot. I taught myself by watching videos but he was very strict about students doing the problems differently.",0
"He was very picky about work, you would ask him for feedback and he Rufuses to email you and tell you what you are doing wrong. all my assignments are 70 and why I don't know , he hasn't told me",0
"Dr. Mock is a tough grader. I feel like I tried so hard to do well on his tests and could never get over an 80. This was the hardest class I have taken just because of that. With that being said, hes still great and very, very smart. Just pay attention and dont skip a lecture. He gives NO extra credit",1
Very good teaching styles. Keeps students engaged and interested,1
"I took this class because I had to for MCOM second year. I took it CUTV and ended up dropping it after 2 lectures because I could not stand listening to the man. I would literally pull out my hair the next time he said ""uhm , uh, uhhhh""... Props to all of you who actually learned anything. Im just not that patient. He is a cute old guy though.",0
"Kate has an interesting personality. Her comments are always super funny and maybe not very professional Id say lol but it keeps the class entertaining. This class is truly NOT hard. SO many projects but mostly EASY! No book, but plan to spend about $100 for supplies thruout the semester! Always willing to help. Pro: her pups in classroom! Yay!!",1
Dr B is one of the best conductors I have ever worked with. The people who didnt like him probably didnt give him a chance to get to know them. If you worked hard for him and came prepared to his rehearsals then he would make it clear that he was grateful for your hard work. If you didnt then he picked on you. Simple as that.,1
This class is hard. If you have questions just look in the book. He is going to direct you there any way. I would suggest reading the book and outlining it. All of his test come from the book databank and not necessarily from the lectures. He does curve which saved the whole class.,0
"You do not have to go to class.. EVER. They are absolutely unbearable. I went to class only for the exams. Literally treated it as an online course. Just do the Wiley Plus assignments, and use them to review for the exams. Make sure you go to lab, and get there on time because, they do the project for you. I got a B because his English is TERRIBLE.",0
"Profesor Dudek is bae. Shes like the cool mom that will always support you with everything. For my PSC 132 class, it was a small class of 8 kids. But she made sure that it was fun and intimate. The course has 3-4 MC quizzes consisting of 10 questions. 1 mid term, 1 research project and 1 final. All of them manageabl. PLEASE DO TAKE HER. She da best",1
"Dr. Woods is initially intimidating, but you'll learn she is not as scary as she seems. She is knowledgeable and helpful for grad school applications or future careers in the psych field. She wants her students to succeed. She is not super warm but blunt and helpful. I really recommend getting to now her and taking her career development course.",1
"The class was exhausting for me. It's very difficult not only to keep up but also to understand what he is saying even if you were at the whole lecture. The exams are the type that have a crazy curve because they are so difficult. On multiple questions, I wasn't sure where to start yet still seemed to preserver. Never again though!!!",0
"I think Scordilis is a GREAT professor, but I think his teaching is tailored to people more interested in circuits. Hes very quick, so I recommend reviewing your notes from the previous class before getting there; he likes to ask questions. Do the sample tests and KNOW how to do the homework, and you should be solid. He is the more difficult prof",1
"There is no homeworks, midterms, or finals. Just four opinion essays and each essay is 2 pages long and you have 2 tries. Easy A in the class",1
I took an Oprah class two semesters or so ago. It was a weird experience. I got the feeling that the class was offered to bolster falling enrollment in the English department. Since when is Oprah an arbiter of literary greatness?,0
I found this class quite confusing. The lectures never seemed to match with the tests and seemed to be mostly a distraction from the subject matter. A vocabulary lists words and definitions that are surprising since most are never addressed in class.The links to Wikipedia prove especially annoying since I'm not paying to have Wikipedia teach me.,0
"This is the professor you want to take for ENGR 101 and ENGR 102.  She will help you with anything you need.  Very nice person.  She tells you exactly what is going to be on every test and quiz.  No pop quizzes.  You use the textbook once or twice in ENGR 101, but very often in ENGR 102",1
Prof Cameron's class has been one of my favorite so far. He is engaging and explains the topics thoroughly. He encourages respectful discussions during class.. There isn't much homework beyond readings (which are tested by 3 pop quizzes) and the tests were easy as long as you had studied. He seems to genuinely want you to do well!,1
"Heavily example-based lectures, just like 1082. Make sure you actually do the comp. labs on your own. Coriolis will mess you up big time if you fall behind Overall solid prof who has some hilarious stories to tell. I loved every course I've taken with him",1
Dr. Record was an amazing teacher considering that he was teaching a completely online format. He was extremely well-organized and made sure due dates were very obvious. As long as you keep up with the assignments the class is an easy A. Would highly recommend!,1
"Roger Sayre is great, a little unorganized at times, but awesome none the less. He's a cutie, too.",1
"Prof was not good at all. Assignments were ridiculously long (most answers were 10-15 page pdfs), exam was longer and not completable given the 3 hours. He is hard to understand and unenthusiastic. Often gets confused by his own slides and coughs often making him harder to understand. His slides are also often hard to follow and skip steps.",0
"I personally really enjoyed Molly's class and I'm taking her again for 242. She is very straight-forward and you know what to study for the tests. Yes, the class is hard and you have to study A LOT.. but Cob 241 is hard in general. Also, she prepares you for the final! I got a 96 on the final and an A in the class. I recommend Mollz.",1
I just straight up hate biochemistry but Thorpe is an engaging lecturer. Make sure you do all the practice exams before your own exam.,1
"super knowledgable but lecture is just that: him talking the entire time. if you like linguistic anthro, be ready for way more ling than anthro in this class. readings are heavy, but not all are needed for the papers. had a great time doing the papers (your own research) and there was no final or midterm exam besides those",1
"Chew teaches straight from the book. Little explanation involved. Hard to hear handwriting hard to read. Stubborn and old school. When you go to college in 62 in 2011 its hard to say he has changed. Rough grader to some extent. Marks off on the littlest things. Different steps will be wrong. Keep to memorizing his steps, it's probably what he did.",0
"sure you could get an A in this class if you keep cramming chapter info in three to four class days… but realistically who has time for that? the class is in high demand, goes over slides too quickly (not enough to write notes), at least one quiz per week, overall made us give feed back on last test so she can change her bad teaching habits",0
"Joe is hilarious if you like him, and you have to choose to like him. He's extremely laid back, kind of snarky, and isn't going to beat around any bushes.",1
"He is such a great professor that I would swallow anything that he offers, and I mean anything.",1
"Campbell is an easy prof however he doesn't teach at all. His lectures are super boring and i would recommend that you skip his lectures. His lectures are  literally copy and paste out of the textbook, so even if you don't go you are set for the midterms and finals if you just read the book,. Final is easier than the midterms.",0
Mr. Dean is the coolest teacher around.  The only people that don't like him are the dorks that want to just cruise through and have a degree handed to them without having to work for it.  Last time I checked this is COLLEGE MATH!!  Its supposed to be hard,1
Not exactly sure why Bushey gets poor ratings? Chem isn't for everyone so rating him poorly because you didn't understand the material is unfair. Bushey's class is straight forward and organized. All the lecture notes are online ahead of time and all of his quizzes and tests follow the notes perfectly. He does a lot of practice in class as well.,1
"Take Ms. Roeder for 202! Class consists of 3 tests, participation and a group project (worth a lot of your grade).  Very clear grading criteria! She genuinely cares about her students and wants them to do well. She is very personable and approachable outside of class! Love her and I hope to have her again as a teacher in the future.",1
"She is not a very good teacher, if you expect to come to class and have her teach it to you think again. Instead go home and teach yourself because she will just sit at the chalk board and throw stuff up there. Her explanation for everything is ""you should know this"" then when you say you don't she gets upset and says ""well, you better study it"".",0
"Easily my favorite professor at MSU! I have gone out of my way to be able to take him again. He's fascinating, hilarious, down to earth, philosophical, and makes you fall in love with the readings. He has so much advice to give, he easily gets off topic, and I Iove it because I love hearing his life lessons. If you don't take him you're missing out",1
Went over the most important part of the course too quickly. The first 4 assignments were based on that and exam is mostly that. It's a lot of work and I had to learn OpenGL and lectures all by myself. The second part of the course were applications and higher level stuff which are hard and not too useful. Lecture notes is vague and not coherent,0
"Panar is a great prof, however it it important you show up to leture. 1/2 way through the semester many people were missing, and thats a no no. Panar posts ntes online, and is easy to acesss outside of class for help. I reccomend him",1
"Professor doesnt make himself clear.  Grading is nonsensical. Dont think you're taking an easy film class either this one was really hard, avoid if possible",0
I took Cultural Anthropology and Intro to Anthropology with her. She's very passionate about anthropology and teaches the class in a way to get students engaged. You get flexibility with what you want to research for the major papers. Not grueling if you show up to class and do the work. Very nice lady. Highly recommended. ,1
Very difficult if you do not know your stuff prior to coming to the class.,0
"I'm an easy student, homework and essays don't bother me. Most of his reviews state that his class is lecture based so if you pay attention you'll be fine. So I'm not really sure why he did not make a single lecture or even a PowerPoint for our online class due to Covid. Simply did not teach and was condescending with all feedback.",0
"I felt like this course was appropriately challenging. The focus is obviously on writing and rhetoric, so it's very paper-heavy. There's an outstanding amount of freedom with the writing assignments so it's easy to get confused sometimes, but I always ended up getting A/Bs. It's a big change from H.S. with everything being vague. Final is easy pts",1
"Mr Shirley acts like he cares about his students, but he really doesn't. He is not understanding at all, especially when it comes to certain situations that are literally beyond your control (such as being an international student and missing one day of class because of your flight, and it takes two days of traveling to get to Tampa from your home)",0
"Exam review is a joke. The exam was the hardest thing i've ever done, even though it's online and you have your notes with you, they will not save you! There were three components she graded us on, midterm, essay and final all heavily weighted. Discussion board is mandatory but there is no participation marks for it.....",0
"Do yourself a favour and don't take a course with this professor. But if you're into holistic and spiritual approaches, you may actually enjoy it. She has a very condescending attitude towards people who don't agree with her. Her course is HORRIBLY designed and I learned ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Even the textbook is a better teacher. Unresponsive aswell",0
"Keith's lectures can be long at times, but he loves to make jokes which makes them worth coming to! He's very understanding - he offered our class a rewrite of the midterm and was flexible on the due date of our paper. Tests are easy as long as you read the text and he gave good feedback on our papers. If you can take him, do it!",1
My FAVOURITE prof!,1
"The most annoying human being. She has a nervous giggle after every. single. sentence. No help at all, requires enormous amounts of reading between classes and unclear in assignments.",0
"She was really wonderful, and she was very helpful in everything we did! I really recommend",1
Wouldn't suggest to anyone,0
"Mr. Watkins does a great job teaching. He is a well-versed, well-traveled former businessman who loves his job and will teach anyone who is willing to learn. His classes are challenging, but can easily be accomplished with study groups or studying in general. His tests are multiple choice, T/F, & maps. Great class, Highly recommended. No book.",1
Great professor! He is super funny and gets to the point with his lectures. He normally ends class early and gives everyone time during class to work on their group projects.,1
This class is basically if you could understand his thick accent or not. His tests are heavily on what he says in class. If you don't understand him then stay away from him. His test curve is only 5 points which he thinks its really generous.,0
VERY BAD,0
"Assigned seating, ridiculous amounts of homework, Problems are extremely long and difficult, designed to waste precious time. DO NOT take her. Awful teacher at UNT. The math department at UNT is the worst.",0
The best CBE teacher I've ever had. Do HW and practice exams that he posts and you should be fine.,1
Prof. Dunham has a sense of humor and likes to tease. Honestly thought he had something against me at first. But he is actually supportive and there for his students. He gives one on one conferences on papers to make sure that everyone is on track and doing well. He's understanding and easy to talk to. Highly recommend.,1
"He is straight up a tool. He lies that he gave solutions to practice problems in class. Also doesn't care one bit for students. His exams are very unreasonable. Stays on the phone with someone while a student is in his office. His final exams are all ""pass the final to pass the course"". You see, this would work if he was actually a good teacher",0
"The only thing I did not like about this class was that it was a 6-9 so the lectures dragged. He tried his best to make it exciting but 6-9 classes are hard to so that with. Definitely is passionate about the course material, makes you think about things in different ways to broaden your knowledge. Great class.",1
"One of my best professors at OU. Always helpful, make sure that you are working up to your potential.  The workload is heavy, but she makes the class fun.  Dedicated to teaching. ",1
Very Very tough if you are not an english major.  Do not take this guy lightly.  He definitely helps you write for the reader.  If writing is not your strength DO NOT take his class.  Otherwise he will improve your writing dramatically. BE ORIGINAL and interesting!,1
A very strange man but very smart his grading system is had to figure out but he stops taking role after about three weeks going to class seems almost pointless and you really need to read the books that he assigns,0
"She's a good professor. I enjoyed her lectures, she usually has interesting stories. Try to get the same exact format for the outlines as in the syllabus and make the changes she suggest when she checks your rough draft. For the exams just memorize all the stuff she tells you to memorize or mentions in the review. Overall pretty reasonable.",1
"She will write one word on the board and then stare at the class waiting for a discussion to spark. Also none of the readings will relate to this discussion so may as well skip all of those. Then the tests will be graded by her ta who isnt at discussion. The entirety of the tests are on the discussions, so you will be marked off for reciting her",0
His class is very interesting. He is very knowledgable and passionate about what he teaches.,1
Very tough class and lecture material easier than exams,0
By far the hardest class I have ever taken. Never have liked his attitude. Don't be fooled by his niceness on day one. He belittles students in class for asking questions. LOTS of papers due that take tons of time. Be prepared. Worst teacher I've ever had. You won't feel confident in your work. Does not encourage you and makes you hate  the subject,0
"Her classes are different from all the sciences courses I've taken (and as a 4th year, I've taken many). Expect to be challenged heavily on your (science) problem-solving and integrative thinking skills. She will not be expecting you to rote-memorize ANYthing, rather she's training you to think like a laboratory researcher. ",1
"Doesn't post notes, extremely boring",0
"Apparently his traditional classes are totally different. But I took his online course, and it is the most unorganized online course I ever took. Assignments and announcements from past semesters all over the place. I do not have enough characters to fully explain how horrible this online course truly is. Stick to seated courses with this guy.",0
She is the worst professor I have had to deal with. She gives SAU and Psychology a bad name.  She is incredibly unclear on her expectations for assignments.  She is very arrogant.  She does not grade objectively in the slightest.  Awful person...even worse as a professor.,0
I was supposed to have a hybrid class but because of covid he didn't make attendance mandatory so you don't really need to go to class. The essays are a lot of work but he gives you all the resources you need. The rest is worksheets and discussion board tests. Not to bad and he seems like a nice person.,1
"SO disorganized and unclear about what is important and how things are graded.  Hilarious guy, but frustrating.  Read the books!!!  Talk about how great the French and Germans are and he'll be your buddy.",0
you have to do learn smart!! its just a lot when your taking 4-5 classes. tests are not easy at all each questions talks about 2-3 different topics so its confusing at times ... GOOOODLUCK WITH THIS PROFESSOR U'll need it for anatomy 425,0
"DO NOT take ECON 110 with Kearl. He is a great economist but a terrible teacher. He hates interacting with students and his assignments are unreasonably hard. The final worth half your grade is only offered at 7am on the first day of finals, so you will not be prepared for it. Do not take Kearl's course unless you want the odds stacked against you.",0
Dr. Bennett unfortunately made ECON 103 at GMU difficult. He said that all assignments and exams would be average instead of adding up all earned points out of the total earned points. Wouldnt recommend him for ECON 103 and other ECON classes he teaches at GMU.,0
"He is an alright teacher, giving it was his first time teaching here. Exams were a bit tricky to me, but I probably just haven't studied it extremely well. Covers a lot of material in this class. His writing on his notes is bad, but legible to an extent. Do well in your lab reports and you will do fine in this class. ",0
"Mr. C is really cool. Pay attention/go to class, and you'll get a good grade.",1
"She's a terrible professor. She only teaches to the people who have no prior experience. When you get your homework, she doesn't allow you to do things in your own style, you have to go by exactly what she has, therefore everybody has the same homework. Very boring class as well. Avoid this professor.",0
drop this class...do not take this class...did i stutter or did your brain skip? do not take this class,0
Dr. Davis is too pompous for his own good.  Horrible professor,0
"Literally the worst professor Ive ever had. Does not provide any kind of information through emails. Does not reply to them, also very vague on her instructions to do a task. Worst ever.",0
"Classes are relatively boring. She mostly reads from her powerpoint slides. She loves showing pictures. If you show up to class, take notes, and read from the book its definitely an easy A. Her tests are fair and you can do well as long as you study. Overall it's not a bad class and Dr. Matson is very nice and helpful.",1
Prof. Giordano is an extremely tough grader and there is a lot of lectures. She requires use of the textbook but will repeatedly say how you need to write down what she says because it is not in the book. You MUST take notes of everything she says because it can possibly be on a test. You will have 3 exams and need extensive notes to get through.,0
Super interesting in class. she teaches it like a story so it is easy to follow along. tests are multiple choice not hard at all. you must go to class and get notes because the majority of the test questions come straight from the lecture.,1
I had this man for 2 different courses. He is intelligent but is absolutely atrocious at teaching.,0
"gives way too much and NEVER clarifies his questions. is very vague and only explains the discussions AFTER theyre due. would not take again, extremely difficult to understand what he is asking most of the time",0
"A great class, and an excellent professor!  Insightful and well thought out.  Definitely take this class: you will not regret it.",1
"I really wanted to like this class because the material was so interesting. However, the professor was very unorganized, not posting assignments until the middle of the week that they were due and very unresponsive to emails. I wanted to be understanding due to the pandemic but people told me she's always been this unorganized.",0
"Dynamics is a very difficult topic, but Quinn teaches it about as well as he can. He clearly cares about his students. You should probably get Chegg or else you're in for 12 hours of homework a week. The tests are based off the homework and are all about working fast and getting partial credit. The curve is very generous, and getting a B isn't bad.",1
"Amazing class, helps you get your life together. No homework, attendance is mandatory, and tests are a bit tricky! But if you study you should be okay !",1
Brings up controversial topics a lot. Does not control class when topics get out of hand. Does not allow for differing points of view. I learned nothing new from this class. She is a fair grader but monotonous during lectures and class discussions got way too argumentative. Also homework was not always clear. Should really focus less on discussion,0
"She talks about current events and wants to push her political opinions in your face every class period. During a speech, if she doesn't agree with you, she will debate you. Only two speeches, and speech content receives far more critique than speech delivery. She wants to make herself look good and make you look bad if you don't agree with her.",0
"This is the first time Zelikow has done this class, and it's... challenging. There is a TON of reading for each class and supplementary reading quizzes. You MUST read for the two Midterms. Lectures are neither bad or good. If you're in love  with History, I suppose it wouldn't be awful, but otherwise the readings are overwhelming.",1
"I took Professor Ford's MUS110 class just to earn the credit. I'm not a super big fan of music and I didn't think that this class would be that hard. For an elective class, there is honestly way too much work. You also have to be careful about deadlines or you'll miss assignments completely. It wasn't the worst class, but I wouldn't take it again.",0
This professor is horrible and terribly lazy.....He doesn't give much for you to do so that way he doesn't have to grade much...He's never around except on the days he teaches....It seems his heart is not in it....Time to retire I would say!,0
"It's such a boring class.  I went to all the classes up to the midterm, got an 82 on that, and haven't gone to one since.  His tests are the of the ""memorize every word I've ever said and typed"" type.",0
"Long boring lectures with a somewhat uninterested prof. He told us he never actually wanted to teach. Easy online quizzes for grade boosters. Tests are somewhat hard, you must study, but not too difficult to get an A. He seems nice, just not for me.",1
"Worst prof. ever. Made the class extremely difficult. Doesn't know what he is talking about. Not clear, not helpful, just a all around D!ck. Made sexest commments which he thought nothing of. He should be fired before given another class to teach. If you want to fail take him, if you want to pass and understand the material, stay clear. DO NOT TAKE",0
Great prof! He is the best math teacher ever! I would definitely take him again.,1
"When he says he's going to test the basics he actually means the specifics. he doesn't explain things very well, definitely read the textbook.",0
Dr. vohs is more focused on getting through the class rather then making sure we no the material. If you try to get help from him in his office he  seems rushed and annoyed. Take this class if you already know everything there is to know about chemistry because he isn't going to teach you anything,0
"Dr. Angley is the kind of professor you will remember for the rest of your life. She doesn't just teach, she inspires. If you're looking to expand your horizons and become deeply involved in what you're studying, take Dr. Angley. She is truly wonderful.",1
POP QUIZZES!!!!!,1
"I've done more homework in this class than I have my entire life, literally 22 years and I have never experienced anything so horrific. I have accidentally ran over animals on the road and haven't felt as distressed as I do in this class. Expectations are unreasonably high. She would rather see you fail than pass. 0/10 would never recommend.",0
I loved this Professor. I took him for design 100 and 101 and if I could I would take anything else from him that he taught. He is clear with what he wants but also very flexible towards your creativity. Over all very helpful and inspiring,1
Never has exam grades added up and does them fast before hands them back.  Both my exams were added up wrong so far this year and had to track him down to get them corrected. Tests you on things like calculations that he has never taught you how to actually do in class.  Never returns class case study assignements so we dont know our grades,0
Very hard! We always have surprises in quizzes.,0
"He is a funny instructors and an easy marker. However, his materials is a bit outdated with the current technologies. Lectures are shorten as most of the notes are self explanatory. He shows many SQL scripts and explained properly but doesn't run the codes in the actual environment to see the output.",1
If your education and your grade is important to you also if you are new to chemistry then then AVOID this professor AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!!!!,0
"Prof Schipper is a nightmare to me. If you went to class on tuesdays and thursdays, 75 minutes felt like 5 days. He gives out 3 books (all of which are extremely boring) and grades stupidly. He asks for 7 journals every 2 weeks which I found hard to do because of other courses. He also expects the books to be done before he tells you to start them.",0
"Professor Noimann's children's literature class was my favorite this semester. I found myself not wanting to leave the class on the last day. Her lectures are very eye opening, she made me look at children's literature in a whole new way. I strongly recommend her for anyone who is in a teaching major! Thank you professor Noimann!",1
"This prof doesn't post any content, and during her lectures, she chooses not to actually teach anything. She is the least helpful professor that I have ever had. When marking assignments, this professor does not give any feedback, and she is nearly impossible to get in contact with. Avoid at all costs.",0
"Three main exams, she takes the best two for your final grade. Your attendance is weighted in grade, and she really likes people that participate in class. If you don't get to know her in the beginning of the semester, you may feel ostracized for the rest. One online homework assignment a week; DO THEM. Saved me from getting a C in the class.",0
he's from ****ing oxford!!!,1
"Worst prof, he studies out of a little booklet and reads case studies from 2000, so boring and doesn't teach anything",0
"I am not being dramatic when I say this. I thought NMC was perfect to do my transfer guide into CMU or any other University for teaching (Elementary/Special Education) until this class became the problem.I revieved a 4.0 in all my classes. This teacher is crazy, and will not help her students! When you ask for help, all she says is you should know.",0
Dr. Too is a genous... but definitely not a great teacher. I'm a student with a 3.8 GPA but I struggled in his class. Just be ready to study and do a lot of work on your own.,0
She's by far one of the worst prof. I had to work with. She's really does too much. Like her online math class and how she wants the camera set up is just so annoying. And she will not give you one extra point and won't let you makeup work. I just missed one assignment and everything else messed up. She's just plain worse!,0
Great professor.  One of the best I have had and he has the best stories,1
"Really great guy. Highly recommend taking if in honors as it is an easy honors section. Tests come right out of the powerpoints and assignments, and are very easy to do well on if you study a little. The class is slow at times, but overall it wasn't too bad, definitely worth it",1
Goes straight from notes and gives extra credit on every quiz and test.  I took her online/on campus class and loved it.,1
"The course content is not difficult, but the online exams question descriptions are extremely vague and the length of the exam is just crazy.",0
"She is a wise woman  and I loved her creative fiction class. Even though she does take things very personally, she is a great teacher, easy grading, easy assignments. Don't take her if you don't have an open mind about things, because she is very opinionated for sure.",1
"Lots of online homework, unorganized lectures, and written homework. Tests are only 3 questions and weighted very heavily so they are hard and extremely easy to fail. He gives one extra credit opportunity. He is the nicest man alive though.",0
"I had dawn for GH 125 and thought she was amazing, a lot of our class loved her. It's not hard at all if you show up and do the work. Im amazed with everyone posting how horrible she is. Yes she allowed for a lot of stories from others which drove me nuts but she is very straightforward. Again-PUT THE EFFORT IN and you'll do fine!",1
"Be ready to not learn anything at all. He will not prepare you for the classes that you will have to take in near future. Rather, he will show you how an algorithm is solved on board or through youtube video which is useless because he do not show you how to implement it and he will not even encourage you how to implement it.",0
"Terrible. Changed everything last minute, didn't grade a single thing, expected students to do more than what was initially stated. Very unorganized.",0
"Professor Nelson is one of the most thoughtful and caring professors out there. For our class, he decided to not give any tests and place the deadline for all assignments in December. He also cut 42 points from our final grade. This may not happen to future students, but it was a rare opportunity, and it helped my GPA a ton. Professor Nelson is a G",1
"Was a very difficult class. When some students gave him criticism, he gave them attitude. His handwriting was difficult to read, asked him what it said, told me to figure it out. Challenging professor, if you want to challenge yourself for the first year go for it. You'll sit there for 3 hrs all confused bc he babbles about one thing to another.",0
She is a really hard grader. If you take her class be prepared to  do a lot of studying. There is a lot of reading and her tests are hard. Attendance counts for quite a bit so don't miss any classes if you can. I wouldn't recommend taking her class. I won't take another class by her. Other people in my class also found her to be a tough grader. ,0
Sporadic and unclear. Can grade harshly. Very hard to understand and follow along.,0
Dr. Bosak's class was the worst experience of my university career. Poor quality and unorganized lectures. Not engaging whatsoever and just sits and mumbles personal digressions that have little relevance to the course. Refrain from taking a course with her.,0
Looks like he's knowledgeable but does not know how to reason in his lectures! Makes people guess during tutorials and when attempting practice problems most of the time.,0
"I can't quite understand why people are saying she is a good professor and then comment on how they never had to go to class. A good professor will teach unbiased, important, relevant material that will inspire a student to  come to class and want to go above and beyond the curriculum. - Terribly boring, irrelevant class laden with her opinion.",0
"Her lectures are very boring, and her low unenthusiastic voice makes it hard to pay attention. Tests are tricky; never really tells you what to study just tells you to expect everything that has been covered so far. Sometimes would be tested on things we didn't learn. You'll have quizzes and assignments done in class also count towards attendance.",0
Excellent professor! Take her class. You will be very happy.,1
"I have no idea why he has a 2.5 rating. He is a very good professor. Even if the class is hard, if you go to his office hours, you will understand more. He is really helpful and realy nice. The course material is not hard.",1
His exams are irrelvent and unclear. He writes his exam questions in the most confusing and unnecessary ways. The class average is normally failing or nearly failing.,0
Prof Leonard is kind but VERY STRICT when it comes to grading. Lots of real life examples. Don't forget to read before class if not you'll get lost. He doesn't really explain much of the theory and doesn't prepare you for the exams. Study on your own. He takes attendance at the beginning of the class and after the break. Wouldn't recommend him,0
"She is knowledgeable, but she goes very fast under the assumption that we already know what she is teaching. When asked to explain, she does so but not in layman terms. She does not make it easy to understand. The homework is frequent but I found it easy to keep up with, if I already knew the material or went to other online help resources.",0
DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!!!  The woman plays favorites and makes everyone else suffer.  She expects you to be perfect and participate 24/7.  Just because she doesn't have a life doesn't mean we don't either.  It was the worst class I have ever taken.  The class would have been good if not for her.  Just save yourself and don't take her.,0
"I took her in first year for my intro psych credit and she was fine. However, I took her a second year in a row for abnormal psych and she is so clearly unqualified that her notes at times were identical to the ones from the year prior. Stick to intro, but she's not really able to teach beyond that. Everything she relates back to herself as well.",0
Its very hard to get an A on his essays even a B. He takes attendance everyday. He's a very nice prof very caring.,1
"He likes to ramble on and on about his favorite plays, but his assignments are copied from another professor. So, basically, you're paying a thousand dollars for someone else's effort. Not a good professor. No care in his work.",0
"Great guy, funny, class is not horribly boring. Be prepared to do work tho. It's managable but not the easiest",1
"She is the best Prof I have ever seen. If you are in her class, you are a lucky dude!",1
Very engaging Professor. You will learn a ton of information. Make sure to never miss an assignment and you will pass. Be ready to read the whole semester. The way the semester was broken down was very helpful and she allows the students to engage with each other.,1
Hardest class I've had at OSU so far. And it's not cause she is a great teacher and trying to make you think. She explains everything in a confusing fast way. The text and all the quizzes and exams labs and pre labs are worded terribly. Spent way to long on pre labs even though grading is all in the exams and quizzes basically.,0
"everyone should know that HE IS THE CHAIR PERSON (DEAN) OF THE SOCIOLOGY DEPARTMENT,so he is hard and expects a lot. I honestly tried so hard in his class and didn't do to good. but if you can read a chapter and take notes and memorize it, then you should do fine on his daily quizes. he's also very sarcastic and annoying!",0
"The worst teacher ever, ifyou see your going to take a class that she's teachong... RUN AWAY! RUN AWAY!!!!!!!!!!",0
Not always nice. Maybe because he loves music and himself too much.,0
"The material of the class wasn't hard itself but the way Dr. Elkind set it up made it difficult to correlate the textbook with her lectures- I felt like I wasted my time reading the textbook. And she only lets you take notes with paper & pen. I liked Dr. Elkind though, she was thoughtful & passionate in her field, but maybe her class wasn't for me.",0
Very rude and not helpful. Purposefully blows off questions and does not ever give full answers. Disorganized and does not go by the syllabus. Not a class to take if you want an easy A or if you aren't genuinely interested in theatre and fine arts.,0
"He'll walk in, smile, say good morning until he gets a grade school like response then turn around and be degrading towards his students.  His labs are will take way mopre than the alotted 3 hr period and are barley worth anything.   He is intimidating,acts like you are attacking his knowledge when you ask a question.  Generally useless.",0
You will Fail. Plain and simple. His standards are absurd. He is borderline impossible to understand and has a horrible habit of blocking the board with his body and erasing notes right away so you will not be able to learn anything short of having x ray vision.,0
She is an awesome professor.  I highly recommend this class.  I took the course as an elective.  I worked very hard and I am sure I did well.  The money I invested in learning was a successful ending.  I recommend this class.  It is a lot of work and you have to work hard but you LEARN!!  If that is what you want to get out of the course.,1
"Very accommodating. Provides LOTS of extra credit. Clear grading criterion. Lots of parts to your grade, but all relatively easy. Fun teacher. Really easy going.",1
"I'm not one to complain about a professor just because their class is ""hard,"" but this lady is crazy. Condescending towards questions, unhelpful even when you attend her office hours. The department seriously needs to get another professor to teach this courselab. ",0
"Horrible. You will not end up learning anything. No study material, no leeway. He will grade you EXACTLY as outlined and subjectively.",0
IMPOSSIBLE PROFESSOR. MORE THAN HALF THE CLASS FAILED. UNHELPFUL. MAKES PROBLEMS UP FOR HIS EXAMS. Exams had 4-5 problems each and they were each worth 22-25 points. no extra credit.,0
Tough but helpfull must read book,1
I feel like I learned a lot in this class. It is a fairly tough subject because its solely computer program based. Dr. Smith is funny and approachable. He is willing to work with you.,1
Professor Robbins is an very difficult professor and he isnt nice either. I encourage you to take another BA350 who will give 3-4 exams and pass you. He has one difficult group project that is due towards middle of semester that isnt helpful and 2 exams that wont help you either. Please stay away from this class,0
"I took Calc in HS & got an A+, and got  a B- in this class. I'm in Calc 2 now and I learned more in the one week of review than I did my whole semester of Calc 1. He's a nice guy but his teaching is really all over the place. He doesn't explain anything in full and skips many steps assuming that we all are following his thought process.",0
"He was pretty cool.  He really does want you to learn and he doesn't want you to just breeze through the class, but you are there to learn and he will help you get there!! TAKE A CLASS WITH HIM!!!",1
omg she can't pronounce anything!,0
Do not take this class if you're a first-year student. He doesn't use D2L or powerpoints. He stands there and lectures for 2 hours without any hints to what is significant. Only graded on 2 papers and a take-home exam. This is a very confusing class if you're not aware of the history of politics. Would never take a class with this prof again.,0
Excellent and fair professor!,1
I took him online for Com 2 and overall he gives really good resources to help with assignments. He prepares you for essays so you have at least a base using discussion assignments. I found it a little difficult to meet his standards and often got points off on things I thought were small.,1
"He is very smart but he doesn't know how to teach a room full of students. His lectures only consisted of reading the textbook to the class. He wrote his own book, there is errors on almost every other page. He doesn't curve but he set the grade percentages slightly lower. Would not suggest unless can teach yourself and are willing to work hard.",0
Amazing professor! Makes it clear that he doesn't want his students worrying about grades and that this school focuses too much on them. He just wants you to understand and do the readings which are very interesting. TAKE HIM!,1
Great Spanish professor!,1
"Professor Halaka is amazing! I will say she does have a pretty heavy accent and it's hard to understand sometimes, but she always goes over the work on the board and is easy to follow. She actually cares about her students and will help you with any questions you have. She gives a reasonable amount of work and her test are super easy. Def recommend",1
This teacher is definitely the worst I have ever had going to this school. I took this class online and it was nearly impossible. The homework and test questions did not reflect her slides or the book. She was amazing at pulling questions out of thin air. She also would answer emails asking for help with snide remarks. AVOID HER IF POSSIBLE!,0
If you need someone to make slides from the book and only give you examples that are clearly defined in the book then this is your guy. He is boring and was horrible at teaching outside the book.,0
"Professor Elmendorf is the most impressive and kind and wonderful and spectacular human being you will ever meet in your entire life. She is an icon. We all love her. She is a tough grader, but she explains concepts so well and is always happy to help out extra. You definitely need to go to lecture to go well, but she keeps them fun and engaging.",1
"Took him for business writing, and everything that we did in that class, I can use in a real business setting. He's very clear and uses a lot of examples. One of the best professors I have ever taken. TAKE HIS CLASS!",1
A lot of busy work-- reading and writing answers to questions every week. But you don't have to do it all- she doesn't really notice if a couple of things are missing in your portfolio. Nice but crazy crackhead lady. You have to google image search her. Those pics are the epitomy of Jane. hahaha.,1
"If you want to be a journalist, get the degree at a different university because Beery will make you hate journalism.  His lectures are awful.  He loves busy work.  All exams, exercises, quizzes come from the book.  He comes up with next to nothing of his own material. Awful professor.",0
"Was very easy at the start but got more difficult. 3 exams and drops the lowest one and a final at the end. Some exams will be hard because you won't know how he will set it up since in stats he doesn't allow calculators and laptops on exams so you will be like ""So what will be on the exam"" Got a B in class. A lot of HW but not very hard.",1
"Seems like an incredible prof, provided it's something besides 3k, which is hell no matter who you take it from. Parkes is a little worse than most in 3k because he's so smart and the class is so dumb. Thus, high expectations from crappy material. He's a sexy man, though, and my TA was also pretty sexy. :D",1
"Don't take him .This class was  stressfull, difficult  ,and boring , with no help  .I was studying so hard , and at the end I got   a C  but for a moment a though I will not pass this class .I'm not going to see this professor  again .",0
"Anyone who likes this guy has actual Stockholm syndrome. He doesnt teach a single thing in class and then expects PHD level work. His formula is simple: show up, make some jokes, give a vague, disorganized, unhelpful lecture and then basically ask you to build Google. He is also incredibly rude and lacks basic social skills and manners. Worst prof",0
love love love her... such an interesting class- tests are easy! paper is worth the bulk of the grade.,1
"calc 2. I see many like him but I had a horrible experience. He grades extremely harshly for an already hard class, and he explained things poorly. He also didn't allow graphing calculators and made us do everything by hand, so a lot of long tediuous work unrelated the material, then you lose big points even if you learn what youre supposed to",0
"I think Professor Triplett is not being portrayed the right way here. He's down to earth, friendly and doesn't rush the class- he stays with the tempo of the students instead of forcing forward when the students aren't grasping the info. His personality makes you comfortable to say hey Im not getting this. He cares and for Math that is essential",1
"Now I read all of these comments and none of them were higher than Algebra. I had him for Discrete Math and Number Theory in one semester and he was my favorite teacher. He pushes you to do the math, he wants you to succeed. If you don't want to help yourself, he won't help you. He is beyond Medaille. Very intelligent. Listen to him about everythin",1
Connie is so sweet and so understanding. She is very ethical and very professional. She is such a good person and she really cares about her students and does all she can to help them succeed!,1
Howard is one TOUGH grader. But his passion for history and his interesting lectures make up for it. Make sure to visit him outside of class--helps a lot. Clear expectations for papers and exams. 2 midterms and one final. Would take again!,1
"english 2, class wasnt hard.  run of the mill english class, nice guy, tries to work with u if you have delimas, presented material very clearly.  i would take his classes again.",1
"Class time consisted of reading problems and clicker questions. The easiest way to do well is simply to show up to every class having done the reading, and actively participate in the clicker questions. Professor Murray is a caring dude who will answer everyone's questions and makes himself available outside of class for help.",1
Great prof! Very funny guy too!,1
"His little jokes in class were funny and entertaining. He is a really nice prof who is there if you have questions, and he explains everything fairly clearly. The midterm and final were fair! ",1
"Love this man so much, tests are easy and he's hilarious. This class requires minimum effort and he'll let you out early sometimes. I strongly recommend taking his class if you need to take BCIS 3610.",1
"I have fun in Ms. Lewis's class. I am so sad that the semester is almost over. She is funny, but at the same time, she actually teaches you things that you really need to know for a college algebra class and future math courses. She responds to emails if you follow the correct format she gives you in the subject line.",1
"First an easy midterm, then the drop deadline, then a killer second midterm.  But I wore the tin-foil hat, like he says in the syllabus, and did OK (thanks to a great curve).  Besides tin-foil, he has a thing about headlamps.  I didn't wear one of those.  Don't waste your time on the field trips, really.  ",1
"He kinda works like a really difficult customer when it comes to turning in projects. You work on them for weeks, he tells you he doesn't like them and to revise them 800 times, but in the end you have a great piece of work for your portfolio. One of my favorite professors.",1
"I would not recommend this proffers to anyone. His power points  are outdated. He does not give ANY extra credit. Your grade is out of your 3 best tests from 4 plus a cumulative final.  No paper reviews. The only ""review time"" is at the beginning of each class. In which you can ask questions you may have. That's it. ",0
Very poor communication and doesn't make expectations clear. Thinks she is superior.,0
He is a very passionate and knowledgeable professor. His tests are 50% lecture and 50% textbook. He does not post his slides so you must go to his lectures and take good notes. His tests can be tricky but he curves the class in the end and also accepts extra credit. He also does not assign homework. I recommend him if you truly love to learn.,1
"Take my advice,  you  DO NOT want to take this class. However if you do take it pass/ no pass, it's easy to pass the class but not easy to get an A.  Don't bother going to lecture unless you want to be lulled to sleep by Sweeney's monotone voice. He posts lecture notes online and there is no iclicker. Oh a bonus is that there's no final!",0
"Such a nice guy, really helpful with comments, especially about lesson plans. His course objectives are clear and does his best to make math interesting. Really wants students to do well.",1
"Calc 2 was terrible and Shepherd made it way worse. I would tell her that I didn't remember stuff from Calc 1 and she would reassure me that I could figure it out- but didn't help. She grouped us with Asian kids that knew how to do the work, but had 0 interest in doing their homework AND teaching me how to do mine. 4-8 hours of homework every night",0
"Although he has a monotone voice (which can be a drag in an evening class), he is a very enthusiastic professor who cares for his students. Just do your work and you'll be golden. He also gives out a few extra credit opportunities.",1
Boring material. Come to class and do the readings and you'll be fine.  Easy work.,1
"Worst prof ever, he just reads notes word for word and I find myself having to search up the theories on my own because he skips key parts of them. Never ever take him.",0
"Yes, very boring-but he analyzes every passage that we review. I had him 2 semesters, did not do 1 single reading assignment, and still got an A. Listen to what he says in class, write it down directly into your book, and you'll be fine. He's a nice guy with good intentions, just boring material.",1
"Horrible at explaining content. Specifically says that a certain topic won't be on the quiz, yet puts that exact topic on the quiz. Very confused throughout the course.",0
"Let me preface this by saying I majored in Math and have gotten A's on all previously math classes. I took his Calculus III online math class in 8 weeks, and it is downright impossible. His ""notes"" is just copy/paste from the textbook, and that's it. It really seems he has no idea about Calc III, and conversely, his students have no idea either.",0
"You better do exactly what he wants on your assignments. Even if you get the right answer on a question, you had better write out every little detail on how you obtained your answer, no matter how unnecessary. If you don't, prepare to be criticized when he checks your homework. ",0
very helpful but I had to teach myself a lot of the material,1
"The course I took was a summer course. Lots of reading due to being 4 weeks long, however, she graded fairly, gave great responses to our work, and was enthusiastic. We had a mandatory field trip to Chicago, she gives multiple days to attend a field trip. Overall was a fun course though and would take her again",1
Read the textbook and go to lectures. The class is at 9:30 but you probably should go because she puts inclass activities on the exam. Mini quizzes are not too hard if you read the book. The exams are made from the book and inclass activities. The final is made of half previous exam q's and new ones. Go to class near the end for extra credit.,1
Very difficult to undserstand over his heavy accent. He's overally a nice older man but not good at explaining things to you. Class is pretty difficult if you dont know computer lingo. It's basically like taking a language class and the professor doesnt help much. ,0
"This guy was my introduction to university, and he made me want to drop out. We got very little feedback, and much of our work wasn't returned to us. His teaching consisted of reading slides of the textbook. I did learn a sort of important lesson from his class, and that was that I would have to teach myself a fair amount of my university courses.",0
"Fuchs is by far one of the best PE teachers at our school.  I had him for self defense, dance, and 255. OUTSTANDING!! his classes are easy and you learn a lot at the same time.",1
"I'm so sad this is my last class to take with her :( AMAZING professor! I was fortunate to have taken her for BIO 1 AND 2. She makes lectures interesting, she's super funny and helpful. She has the greatest personality.I've never seen her in a bad mood! Shes very respected by her students. Dont hold back on taking her, Her classes fill up QUICK!",1
"Since it's a communication class I thought I'd be able to talk and express my pov, I was so wrong, this lady don't let you participate, she is the only one who talks, and talks and talks. boring class, take it is needed.",0
"RADIO VOICE!! Dr. Andersh by far is the best professor I've had at Bradley. Incredibly clear and his lectures are an experience. Extremely nice and can be funny. He's constantly trying to improve his technique by reading chemical education papers. The material can be hard, but it is organic chemistry after all. If only he taught CHM 256 as well...",1
"very boring, literally fell asleep through all his lectures. If you don't want to spend money to see the two play required for this class forget about taking this course. find another class that isn't so boring.",0
"Know his stuff, but has serious anger issues! Yells at students in class and insults them if they do not do well on a test. Very rude and frightening.",1
DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS. DOES nOT ANSWER YOUR EMAIL Questions. Discouraging.,0
"Bonaffini is the man !!!! Best professor out there. Weekly discussion boards that must be a few paragraphs, midterm and final. Have to put in a little work but the man loves his Italian literature.",1
She is a good at accounting but not necessarily teaching but she can be rude sometimes especially if you're late or aren't showing up. I would not take again.,1
He is the most AMBIGUOUS and CONTRADICTING teacher I've ever taking. He'll say he expects one thing and you ask for clarity so he says something else but then in the end he really meant something else. You never have any idea of what he wants. He is very difficult to figure out and changes his mind on what he said very often. NEVER AGAIN,0
"Easy course but the professor is incompetent, inarticulate and does not know how to communicate with students.",0
never take his class never!,0
"Dr. McVoy passed away on April 2nd, 5:30 pm.",1
Bill is funny and charismatic but he spends almost every single class talking about his own work and who he knows.  He doesn't offer much guidance in semester projects and gives zero feedback on assignments. He's also very hard to get a hold of out of class  and doesn't honor office hours as scheduled. I learned very little in his class. ,0
"This guy... He is really good if you really don't care about truth. He takes the school's position and finds some way to justify it. He is really interesting and He'll make you laugh. I like him as a person, and I think he's a nice guy, but I wouldn't take another class from him until he promises to stop twisting the Bible to fit PCC's Theology!",1
"awsome prof.  can't say enough great things about the guy.  he's nice, his lectures are funny and cute and he really, really will take the time to talk to you.  i studied hard for his class, but he made studying easy because lectures are so clear.",1
Professor Gilbert gave us lots of homework and never graded it in a timely fashion. It wasn't until the day of the final when I was finally getting feedback on homework I submitted 2 months prior. My peers and I sent endless emails obtaining our questions regarding the homework and we never got responses. We didnt do work since it won't get graded.,0
"For anyone saying that Professor Fernandes is ""hard"" probably took PSY 100 looking for an easy A, but that's just not how this classroom is run. She actually cares about the material and cares that her students actually leave her class knowing the material. Of all the adjunct professors I've taken in the psych department, she is by far the best.",1
Great teacher for English 2030 for Summer Semester. She has a few assignments due each work but they are not hard. If you put in the work you can pass easily. Her homework assignments are in order so when you do your final paper you understand! make sure you ask questions as she responds to them and helps you become a better writer! Good luck.,1
"Professor Gaston is Unlike any other professor, he is extremely wise! I think every person should take at least one of his courses. He is a tough professor but because he cares, very tough class definitely a challenge, but a challenge worth taking. One class of his will give you a deeper insight to life! Be ready to be mindblown!",1
"Awesome professor. But sometimes unclear when it comes to explaining essays of why its bad. Energetic and upbeat professor. Barely any work, just read and do the essays if needed.",1
"I haven't even completed the semester with Becker so far and already I am sick of his lectures. He has an incredibly negative view of the US government. IN ADDITION, he only looks at and believes very far, left wing conspiracy theorists. Keep in mind I am a liberal person, and he was too liberal to the point of laughable in my opinion.",0
Maureen is the best teacher ever! Her class was very easy to get an A in and she's so nice.,1
this prof is so cool. he is so helpful and approachable. i didnt really like language when i came here but now i am definitely taking more spanish classes. i hope i get him again!,1
She gives a lot of reading and very long videos to watch and u have no time to do it because there is another assignment given in 3 days. She opens the assignments 3 days before. I advise you not to take this class while you are taking 3 or more other classes. She doesnt give good feedback and asking her about your grade is a waste of time.,0
Easy class for being 300 level. He is a very smart guy but extremely disorganized. I was disappointed in that I did not learn as much as I wanted to. But the tests are not hard and he offers extra credit. Go to class b/c he tests you on his opinions (which is stupid in my opinion). Generous curve.,0
good professor. hope he comes back. ,0
"This guy is awesome. He understands that the majority of students take the class for pre-recs,so he tries to keep the work minimal. The tests are really easy if you study. He actually gets to know his students and is the only prof I have had that learned names. He's pretty funny as well. You can tell he loves what he teaches. I will miss his class.",1
"Super hard exams even though they're open book/notes. Lots of info in lecture, take good notes or you're dead. Some lectures were interesting, others not so much. More focus on history rather than doctrine, which is fair for this class. If you're looking for doctrine, take it from another professor or a D&C class. Final project is a piece of cake.",0
"Cannot convey ideas properly. If you ask her a question, chances are it won't be answered. Lectures and examples are not a good representation of what the class actually covers. Pray you have a good TA.",0
He graded way harder than it shoud've been and ran through material fast. The exams were nothing like the study sheets.,0
"professor rombo is horrible, lecture slides have no information on them so if you miss one class you wont know what was going on that day. gives 3 tests including the final. ridiculously hard grader when it came to projects and assignments, she wont tell you what she wants but then will fail you if you dont magically give her exactly what she wants",0
"We had total of two exams before the final. Averages were 85 and 88. Is this class hard and tiresome? Those people who complain, probably didn't come to the class at all. Now you do the math",1
"Justification; Easiness: only the midterm was easy but too long to be done in 50mins,big0. Helpfulness: try to ask for mark review and he gets you to write a long appeal and then answers with no,big0. Clarity: no word can be understood from him,big0. Interest: I don't know what this means but just in case big0.Text: doesnt contain the material big0",0
Professor Lasalle is a great professor I would take him again if I could! He barely ever writes anything on the board so be prepared to take notes. He is honestly a great professor overall he cares about his students and explains everything really well. His lectures are interesting and he ends class a little early most of the time.,1
"This professor is the worst professor I have ever had in my college career.  I had a near 4.0 GPA before taking this teacher, I did extremely well on her test, even getting a 100 on one of them and an A on another and my WebWork grade was a 100 percent.  Yet, I ended up with a C in the class, DO NOT TAKE IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR GPA.",0
"Dr. Courtney is a great guy, but a bad professor for someone who is taking geography as a minor or elective. He expects to much on his assignments and bombards students with work. For example there can be a test in a week or a paper due in 5 days, and he will throw an excel assignment into the mix. He must have a lot of time on his hands?",0
"Hossain is the type of Prof who knows a lot about the subject matter but is horrible at teaching it.  His assignments are so vague that you rarely know what to do, his exams are the same.  Avoid if possible.",0
SSSSSuper good professor. Makes BA210 so easy to learn.,1
One of the best teachers in U of M. Her enthusiasm in teaching the material is contagious and has definitely sparked my interest in pursuing medical anthropology.  ,1
"Ugh, stay away! I felt like he was speaking Chinese the entire 4 months. He knows his stuff, but has no idea how to teach it. He will come across as a cool dude, and he is, but your GPA will suffer. He gives review sheets, but on the exams, you get something totally different. Very misleading. Do not take him if you are not good at math naturally!",0
easy 4.0 if you do what she tells you. if not then goodluck.,1
"very unclear, lacks personality.  avoid him if possible! his tests are long, graded very unfairly and tedious.  The projects aren't bad if you go to class and try to listen to the way he wants it done.  If this class is a must, make sure you do good on the tests, cause they are difficult",0
"So, if you have no clue about programming, he was great. If you could touch type, you probably didn't want him though. The main reason was that he taught Turbo C++ with the lens that students had the maturity level of a 10 year old. He stepped through problems as though some students couldn't read. I took this course in 1996 (Course Code 94.166)",1
Roman is an awful professor. He scared kids away from class by cold calling hard questions. The marking scheme is ridiculous. Enjoy.,0
"I had him for comm 30, and he gives great pointers on group projects. All you have to do is do the work and participate and you will get a good grade.",1
"Brilliant!  Turned me into a better writer, because there is no ""great writers"" according to him!",1
New professor,0
"He didn't always explain how the concepts would be used in real life. But, he gives opportunities for extra credit every week. 2 HW's due each week + 1 Quiz. 2 tests and the final (not cumulative). He had review sessions before every test and had either himself or a TA available for office hours everyday of the week. Overall, he's pretty good.",1
"He only give his outline, never have lecture notes, class average is very low, and he never reply emails.",0
does not do a whole lot of teaching. just reading off power points. expects us to know stuff she hasnt taught and isnt in the book or on slides.,0
"Overall a good teacher, although the Exams can be tricky they are do-able as long as you study adequately.  She knows what she is talking about and is very passionate about her field.",1
"do not TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU RESPECT YOURSELF! intro to film class, it is an INTRO class, the course load is unbearable and I don't think it is a good way to get students excited about film. 7 films a week. INSANE! Forget a job and other classes. Because you have to write discussions and papers . Also films all sucked maybe 1 or 2 were ok",0
Very understanding Prof.  Knows his material and presents it very well.,1
"He is not an easy professor, but he is very straight forward and willing to help. He may seem mean at first, but as long as he sees you trying and working hard he will do anything to help. His lab test are very straight forward and as long as you study you'll do well!",1
"Very knowledgeable, but not a good teacher.",0
Ed is a boss. Funny guy and great class. It isn't an easy A he demands a lot of detail on the exams but if you pay attention and take good notes it's very easy. Tests are very easy to cheat on but most people that rely on cheating do worse than the people who put forth effort. Class was interesting and fair. Definitely take,1
"When everybody in the class got a bad grade on the first exam, he said do better. Not very respectable and cannot explain things very well. You learn mostly through the online homework.",0
"I hated this class and the professor. Worst professor I've had at Midd. Other people think he's amazing but if your learning style doesn't match up with his teaching style your out of luck.  Also, the midterm is a test of how fast you write, not knowledge. I didn't get anything out of this class.",0
Professor Long offers a ton of assignments to ensure you succeed in her class. She offered a study guide prior to the tests. Most of the assignments are very easy and only take minutes. She cares about her students and wants everyone to do well in her class.,1
And I though my attendance record was bad...,0
"He's a nice guy, but save yourself the headache and don't take him unless you have to.",0
Not sure why so many awful reviews but honestly his lectures aren't too bad. Quizzes are fair. Assignments are difficult and long but there is enough time given to complete them. He's a pretty average lecturer,1
"He's a nice guy, the class material is interesting, but mega-depressing. The class is not easy and you have to participate in the class discussions. Also do the moodle posts because its worth a large portion. Other than that the class is horribly structured, if you like a well structured class, this is not for you.",0
Very hard marker.Almost failed everyone in the final.Exam questions were easy but don't know what happens when it comes to grade.Lectures are boring.,0
"Dr. Giabbanelli takes down his rate my professors when they are bad, even though they are completely true. He is the most disrespectful professor I have ever had. He wanted graduate-level work in an undergraduate intro class. Do not take this professor if you value your time and mental health.",0
"He is not an easy professor, you have to take a 3.5 hour test and then a quiz as soon as you walk into class. His quiz are very hard, 95% of the class fail them. You have to memorize 3 to 4 chapters and lectures. He is very hard headed and the questions are created to make you fail. He admitted he enjoys making people squirm. Don't recommend",0
"Avoid this prof if you're taking his online courses. Takes marks off for seemingly very little reason on assignments, comments and feedback are often condescending. Lectures are helpful but his grading is so picky it makes it very very difficult to get a fair grade.",0
"Professor Denman, she discourages her students with her comments and her grading. She always comments about your weak points. I have never heard anything from her that motivate me. Although I spend too much time on her assignments, unfortunately, I always get bad grades and bad comments from her.",0
"I had english with Dr. Stephens this spring, and she's ok.  But make sure you hand in all your work, because she has a tendency to forget things and blame you for it.  Her midterm and final had nothing  to do with the classwork tho...",0
"She's great honestly, I think she is an amazing Professor. I'm so glad I got the pleasure of meeting her, if you see her name anywhere for classes take it I swear you won't regret it. She's kind, and cares about her students, loves her job and pays close attention to everyone. Take her course !",1
"Dr. Rose is in love with anatomy and makes it as interesting as possible. Lectures would sometimes be hard to sit through, but it wasn't his fault. The constant tests are nice because it keeps you on top of everything. Lab is a joke, super easy. Harder than 309 because you have to think about concepts, not just straight memorization.",1
"So some people say that those who don't like Roman just weren't ready to work for a good mark, which is fair for some. But as someone who went into the final with an A+ and feels as though it went well, I can still say he is bad at his job. He doesn't teach the course well, just reposts old lectures. Basically had to teach myself everything",0
This guy was amazing! I actually looked forward to his class,1
"He is great. The tutorials are said to be discussions when they are not. However he is a great explainer with passion, and if he is wrong or misunderstood he admits fault instead of pulling the authority challenge. Amazing and an OG of sfu communications",1
"my class was converted to online which made the class a lot easier. Every sunday, we had an essay due, the essay prompts weren't hard. The prompts were based on what we learned in class. Coming to class is mandatory because he uses it for extra credit at the end of the semester. Overall great teacher, like you won't have to stress out aboutHisCLASS",1
"Prof Campbell is arrogant and scatterbrained. Obviously smart but can't explain ideas at all. He rambles and makes no sense, I just ended up skipping lectures and studying out of the textbook ... I'd stay away from his classes if possible, never taking him again.",0
"Lectures kinda sucked but whatever, Groza is a funny guy. DGDs were more helpful to pass the tests, make sure to attend those or review the problems on your own. Midterm and final were challenging but fair. The labs were cool but ruined by useless TAs.",1
"This was one of the worst classes I have ever taken. I am fairly certain I will retake it, not because I didn't pass but because I didn't get anything out of it. I don't feel like I have any better understanding of the subject. DON'T TAKE THIS TEACHER! This was a disaster of a class.",0
A really helpful professor. Posts recorded lectures & notes online before class. Definitely recommend,1
"Jackson...unavoidable Jackson. Her lectures are 'ok' (powerpoint), engages students some, goes on tangents, unclear about quiz material (or even if she counts them). Not too bad though, then again I have no idea what my grade is...fast paced w/readings, weekly quizes, one large paper. luvs diagrams",1
He is not only handsome and fit but also a fantastic person and a knowledgeable proffessor.  I've never been so comfortable with a teacher that knows so much about all the mucky mucks.,1
Awful teacher all around. Confusing lectures and very little enthusiasm.,0
"Tough but fair. Mark sort of simulates the pressures you'll face in the real world and forces you to get used to it. However, he's a great man and a great friend, always willing to help you out, whether it's with schoolwork or getting your car started.",1
"He is a very fair professor.  Great at responding to emails, and very helpful in that way.  However, if you make an appointment, you will have about 10 mins of his time at most.  So emailing is better.  He wants you to do well, and is entertaining in class.",1
"Entertaining and entergetic but very hard to understand if you have no econ experience. Expects you to learn everything you need to know from his lecture, out of class help is hard to come by unless you're failing. Quizzes every Friday with confusing/trick questions.",0
"Pretty unprepared usually and unpredictable every class. Does things last minute constantly and gives no time to prepare for anything. Review sheets prepared arent close to what is on the test. I always felt like like I got the gist of what he said, but if it wasnt word for word, expect points taken off. He loves stochasticity a little too much.",0
"Extremely rude, and egotistical. I had not completed assignments in a timely enough manner, even though they were not due yet he reported me as being a student who he was concerned about not going to be successful in the course. After emailing him and addressing some concerns I had, he sent a very condescending response that was overwhelmingly rude",0
Professor Freed is easily the worst professor I've ever had. She teaches like a kindergarten teacher but grades like a grad school professor. She's useless at getting information across but she will grade your papers impossible hard. I'm an english major and I've never had a professor who grades like Freed. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASSES.,0
"Multicultural Literature for Youth: Mary was exceptional! She is very passionate about her subject and it shows in her teaching! She cares about everyone. Go to class and read all of the books, make sure to keep up with the reading responses! There are a few projects to do, but they are easy as long as you put the work into them! Mary's the best!",1
"Mrs. Bone is a great lady but her class is totally pointless.  With all the heavy work having to be done in the accelerated courses, this class is, simply, a lot of busy work.  I'm not sure why it's required.",1
Worst class I have taken. Super long and boring lectures that have nothing to do with the book reading. A  pretty hard class for a Gen Ed. I would not recommend this class to anyone.,0
"I enjoyed having Professor fields because she was approachable, but she didnt get back to me on a few emails (or took 3 days). The class was kind of difficult, honestly. Reading the chapters was a breeze and the information wasnt hard to grasp, but the homework assignments and tests were pretty difficult. I barely got an A and had to work HARD.",1
She is one of the worst teachers i've ever had in my life. She doesn't know what the hell she is talking about half of the time and repeats herself constantly. Very disorganized and you never get out early!!! She always talks about her family and when she lived in spain. Don't take her class she is HORRIBLE!!!!!,0
"Sol Gittleman is the one professor at Tufts whom I found to be truly inspirational when I took an accelerated german class from him about 45 years ago. It was a privilege and a joy to be a student of his. As a consequence of my taking his class, I spent my Junior year at Tufts in Tubingen. It was an experience that I will never forget.",1
"Amazing. Peter chooses great books and has great style, so it's never boring. Plus there are films, etc. integrated into the class. And he manages to make anything relevant to the reading. It doesn't really feel like a class, I always look forward to it so much. A lot of fun, but even though it's laid back, it's definitely worth your time.",1
Alisa is a wonderful professor. She is extremely helpful and goes out of her way to make sure that her students succeed. I was afraid of Math until I got into her class!,1
"Amazing professor, really nice guy who cares about his students future. Loved his course! Recommend to all.",1
"He's a 300 level music theory professor so the history of jazz class was more music concepts than history. decent lectures and did learn a lot though, just not what I expected. Tests are every memorization heavy and expect to know more than just the songs' titles and artists.",0
"This class has been the death of me. Not only is it impossible to get in contact with Professor Blose outside of class (don't even bother emailing him he will not respond) but he made being lectures miserable. The class was constantly correcting him for mistakes in examples provided, and he seemed to always think it was funny. Please retire.",0
"She does not know how to teach or outline material in class that we are going to be tested on. If you have an idea for the group project and it's not something she likes, she won't help you. Her lectures are scattered and disorganized and I regret not dropping this class when I had the chance. Take it from everyone else, do not take her class.",0
One of my favourite first year profs. His lectures are interesting and hilarious at times. Easy to follow. Carleton is lucky to have him. He lacks political correctness in some ways - a fantastic quality for a professor. Take his section!,1
She wants you to get a good grade. Lenient in grading and wants you to learn. Encourages in class participation and goes over material clearly before exams. Great prof if 211 is your last Spanish.,1
Prof. Cato is a grate teacher this on-Line class open my eyes to see the world differently.,1
"I had Professor Sharp as a Freshman in the fall and spring 1986-1987 School year. He was a great professor and because I did well in his class, he really looked out for opportunities for me. It turned out that we lived in the neighborhood down the street from each other and I would often drop by his home just to chat and hang out.",1
Very difficult tests. No real assigned homework but don't get behind. Not very  personable and won't bother to learn your names.,1
Great teacher.  Helps everyone.,1
I have a music background so I was able to breeze through the first half of the work book with ease. It's an online course so time management is key. Clear criteria for how the class works. Probably difficult for those with little to no music background. It is a hard subject! Knapp is accessible and knowledgeable but voice is monotonous online,1
"He really knows his stuff and cares about making you into a great teacher.  Yes, the quizzes are a pain, but the rest of the class was really useful.",1
"He doesn't care for students! Didn't do any accommodations during pandemic ""because it's online class, we continue as planned"". Poor lectures, just reads slides and puts up recording. You have to teach everything yourself, tests are 5x harder than review, and no curve. Homework is mostly theory and statements, while exam is only problems. GPA Kill",0
BAD,0
"He gives A LOT of quizzes...a LOT. they are all online, but you gotta keep up with them. His lectures are ok, he just mumbles. You'll need an iclicker for this class and you'll want to study the textbook to learn what he doesn't teach well in class. when people talk in class he just leaves which is stupid for the people that are there to learn.",1
"Amazing teacher who makes learning the material fun and easy. Complete the homework assignments and you will be fine. Tests aren't hard, and the final exam is simply a powerpoint presentation. Looked forward to going to her class in the morning and having banter back and forth. Would definitely take another computer class with her.",1
"This class taught me a lot, but a lot of it was useless. It requires a lot of work outside of class, including several papers. You have to pay close attention to the lectures or you won't do well on the quizzes. Be prepared to listen to an hour and fifteen minutes of mostly uninteresting discussions.",0
"His accent is horrible. It's a VERY DEEP Russian accent. His test are graded by student graders and if you get the answer wrong, the whole answer is wrong. You have to go up to him to get partial credit. No homework and he writes on the chalkboard which you can barely read. Majority of the class only shows up for the review.",0
She is not helpful at all for a graduate course I had to take.  Does not have the  SME of anything but very good at shuffling paperwork required by the school.  Provides very harsh comments in an untimely fashion.  She assumes you will fail from the beginning.  You are better off to go to any other online schools for your graduate degree.,0
Perhaps in person he is a better teacher - online class with him was a nightmare. Expect tests that are ridiculous in difficulty on material barely brushed over in class. Entirely over reliant on Flipit (which itself is hard to learn from). Only saving grace is that the class is graded on a *heavy* curve.,0
"Super easy A but you won't learn a thing. If you want to actually learn something for the 3,100 the class will cost go for a different prof.",0
very good instructor. do your work and you will do great in her class.,1
"The professor is very helpful in clarifying assignments, if you are unsure about them. He is easy going, not a very hard grader. He works with his students if emergencies arises, you just have to make sure you let him know; and talk to him he is understanding when it comes to situations like these.  In my opinion he is the best professor at Lee.",1
unapproachable ice-princess. disrespectful and rude. Does not realize she is teching college and not highschool.,0
Professor Strong is the best professor I have ever had. Theres not a question that you can ask him and he doesnt know. He made me work hard and it paid off. I was a mother with a full time job and he pushed me all the way to the end. He would come in early or stay late just to help. He really cared about his students and his children inspired me.,1
"Don't take this class if you would like to 1) have a life 2) enjoy physics 3) maintain a good gpa. This class was the bane of my existence. Dr. Freedman gives out a ridiculous amount of homework and reading, and it counts for NOTHING. The entire grade is composed of mostly the midterm and final, which are impossible. Avoid at all costs.",0
She is a very lazy teacher. Did not respond to questions in a timely manner. Takes forever to grade her papers. Makes you write an 8 page research paper (APA Style).,0
BEST PROFESSOR AT BROWN!!!!!!!!,1
"Incredibly tough marker. My english profs cared less about APA in papers than Steve. He is a very knowledgeable prof, however he holds students to a very high level of understanding and mastery. APA matters just as much as content, at times it feels like it matters more. Text used in class was also very difficult to read. Very fun classes though!",1
Dr. Bailey is intelligent as well as passionate. She writes books about crime mysteries and really enjoys sharing her knowledge to the class. She uses videos and diagrams to ensure the understanding of the material. Wonderful professor!,1
"I liked him,though i did miss quite a few classes cause it was an early class. His study guides suck, but the tests weren't real hard or real easy.",1
"He's a really nice person and does care. Midterm and final were very fair but he marks very hard on the assignments which are worth 45% (15% x 3). Not an easy class, and very disorganized lectures. He goes all over the place and it's very hard to follow him. Start those assignments early, he shows no mercy on them!!",0
Horrible Horrible professor. He knows his stuff but cannot teach it worth anything. Gives tons of homework that is online( which by the way you have to pay for) does not explain things well and only gives a couple examples that doesnt even help a ton with the homework. Hard to get to help you outside of class. Doesnt care if you fail.,0
"He made lectures interesting with personal experiences and fun background stories that made things easier to remember. He was clear about what he wanted us to know and did great reviews. Attendance is a big deal, brought my B to an A because I only missed one class! Great personality and fun to listen to.",1
"He starts class late and ends early. He goes through the material too quickly. His powerpoints don't have many words, but I found out halfway through that he has notes in the notes section on the .ppt but not .pdf version of the powerpoints. He test on minutia and likes trick questions. He's hard to hear sometimes. Nice man though. ",0
"Like another review said, Marek is an overall good person and a good engineer, however he is an absolutely terrible prof. As said, he's a very nice person and will answer your questions if you have them. But that's where the good ends. Pointless lectures, constantly stutters during those lectures, mind-boggling grading criteria and so much more.",0
"he does not explain anything. i pay to teach myself. his tests are ridiculously difficult. honestly, he should get fired. he gave me the hardest time in calculus and i just don't need to be struggling in this class because the professor cannot teach",0
Terrible professor. Doesn't give any partial credits when checking your work. Absolutely has no idea about how a homework should be checked. The work load makes it hard to study for other classes. She doesn't take attendance but will lower your grade if you skip. Basically you have to teach yourself. Tests are totally unrelated to the class. AVOID.,0
"Jane Teel is a beautiful breath of fresh air. Her class is challenging but you will learn so much. Go to class to get participation points. Tests are not terrible but you will need to read, take notes, and pay attention to what she says in lectures. The project is a lot but she is willing to help. Such a sweet lady! One of my favorite teachers!",1
Joe is a great teacher/mentor. If you dont agree with him on something speak your mind and defend  your position. He respects that. People dont like him for his personal life and his candid critiques. This puts off people but its a great way to learn. He is a great asset to this school.,1
"Good prof, he gave us the articles to read too, but I still got an A, the articles were tough to read, but the exam was mad easy. Petkanas is the man",1
"Very boring, no tests only quizzes. Group final project",0
This teacher was the most unclear professor that I have ever had. She was never avaliable if you needed help. YOu could never get a hold of her. She told me I was getting one grade then ended up with another. I know a few people she did that to. My thoughts are they could find someone better to teach an education course.,0
"If you enjoy submitting assignments and being deducted points for your PDF quality, then this is the course for you! Prof. Schap is your typical tenured professor: could care less about his students. Tests are super hard and do not reflect the material taught. TAKE THIS COURSE OVER THE SUMMER AT OTHER INSTITUTIONS!!!!!!",0
"Seems like a nice guy, but that means little when 90% (his #, not mine) of students fail his classes. He moves quickly, and you take TONS of notes. By the time you finish writing something, he already moved on. I know everyone makes mistakes when doing math, but we have to correct him 8 or 10 times a day. He uses ambiguous wording on tests, too.",0
Great professor in terms of teaching but tests and quizzes are insanely hard. I would recommend taking his class if you intend to pursue further math but not if you only need one class like for Business.,1
"SOOOOOOOOOO boring, I wanted to die with this class. Lectures are long and homework is hard and he basically never gives A+'s",0
This class is only hard if you don't use the resources available to you. If you complete his review sheets and ask for feedback you'll be successful in the class.,1
Best Professor I've ever had. Not even a political Science major and still was my favorite class. His lectures got pretty intense. ,1
I've honestly never had a worse professor than this man. He is so rude! One time he literally began arguing with a student when she was asking for clarification about a problem. He expects everyone to know everything and hard to understand. Please if you need to take any math class don't take any with him unless you can teach yourself everything.,0
"WORST PROFESSOR. SHOULD BE FIRED IMMEDIATELY. THE fact he is still a professor makes me reevaluate my decision on coming to University of Tampa. Very unreasonable. if you have to take him, take the class another semester with another professor. Information is not understanding the concept by memorizing random things from the book ...",0
always available for extra help and she is a great motivator,1
"Terrible band director when dealing with competent musicians. Knows how to make a high school band sound good but uses same tricks with collegiate ensembles. Makes everything sound like a marching band. If you like ""forte-piano-crescendo""'s on every long note and cutting every note-value in half, this is the director for you.",0
Cool guy but he rushes through the lectures and expects you to know what you're doing.  Gives a lot of extra credit and assigns little homework. The test are basically the study guides he provides you. Does not prepare you for final. Don't take him if math isn't your strong suit. *heavy accent*,0
Learned so much!Tough classes but if you review the notes (100% of the test) & do questions at the back of the book you'll be fine!make sure to keep up with material.and do well on lab quizzes (1 bonus point on each one. Prof Ruehlmann made anatomy fun and easy to learn! definitely recommend,1
He never refers to the textbook however the exams are solely based on it. Read the book thoroughly all he does is ramble.,0
The worst of the worst!!! He could definitely be the winner of the gold berry in my 3 years of college carrier!! U really wanna weist ur $$$? Go Chad!!!,0
"She's extremely entitled. She says she is 'strict' under the guise of just being relatively self-important. I say this because she doesn't listen enough to her own students & demeans them. In a speech class, where students have to speak even when they have social anxieties, why is a professional in the subject demoralizing and degrading them?",0
"Be sure you use APA formatting, even for answering book questions.  Directions aren't very clear, so you are left guessing a lot.  Does not grade quickly.",1
"She cares about your improvement but she certainly makes everything way too difficult for the first ENG class you take in college. I thought I was a decent writer until this class. I definitely learned, but at the cost of enthusiasm and good moods. She's not very encouraging. Wouldn't take again.",0
The worst professor at UMaine.,0
"Dr. Bolkovac is an inspirational professor who taught me a lot. He's strict, and sometimes he takes things out on students who don't deserve it. Nevertheless, I believe that he is well intentioned. He knows a lot about choral music, and I think he is sometimes simply frustrated by students not putting in the same amount of effort he does into class",1
"Her online class is literally to just read the textbook and fill in the reading modules. Textbook and Tophat are mandatory - expensive! Her lectures are useless, don't have anything to do with whats on the quiz No interaction with prof - just read the book and take good notes and you'll be fine Marked on 4 quizzes and a final, all multiple choice",1
"Not a bad guy, he just doesn't know how to teach. Seems as though he doesn't even care, he's gone over some of his powerpoints twice and hasn't even noticed. Very difficult to sit through his class and pay attention. Goes on a tangent every 5 minutes. Avoid this prof. if you can.",0
Professor Knott was an amazing source of knowledge. Her ability to provide constructive criticism enabled a lot of growth as a writer. Professor Knott teaches many tools that will prove useful in later courses!,1
This was supposed to be an entry level class and felt more like an intermediate one. She was extremely vocal about her political views in class and what she thought about people who had different views then she did. My advice is to not have an opinion and agree with whatever she says and you will get a good grade!,0
Very passionate about the subject and knows a lot. Uses  interesting stories to emphasize what we are learning. Very upbeat and easy to stay interested for a three hour class.,1
"Great guy that cant know any less about how to run a class. The class was disorganized, unclear, and full of work that we didnt know how to do; I could go on and on. Its obvious that he is a smart man, but be prepared for constant frustration if you get him. Easily the worst class I have ever taken. Avoid his class like the plague.",0
Professor Wenstrom is the best math teach I've ever had. Her energetic and happy personality makes this class so much fun! If anybody has a question or an issue she is always there to help them. I highly recommend her!,1
"Kam is such a nice prof and will try to help you if you go to see him, but I found it very difficult to understand his accent. Classes were pointless because his lectures were all over the place and didn't make much sense. I had to teach myself the entire course through the textbook and his very vague notes. Would not recommend.",0
"Awful. STAY AWAY, you will thank me later! Poorly structured course. all over the place.... very stressful situation",0
"Barnhardt was low-key awful. His lectures are too boring he doesn't have much grades and you HAVE to show up to class no matter what. He doesn't curve his test even if ""78% of the class missed number 12"" like what the?!?!?! he does however give out extra credit each unit! oh and get ready for a lot of corny jokes",1
She was a waste of time as a professor. She liked certain students. If you fall in her not likes category then don't even bother approaching her. She can be rude too! Oh well I did my work and made an A (no thanks to her) Hooray for me.,0
"Dr. A is one of the best professors I've ever had. He has a great teaching style and he his happy to help you. If I were you guys, I would definitely take this professor because he is very kind and would want you to succeed.",1
Tough Grader. Great feedback doe,0
"Best professor I've had, but don't take him if you're lazy. If you actually want to learn and work hard, take him. His lectures are AWESOME if you put in the work and read the book before class (it's college, stop complaining about reading a textbook). He really cares that his students are learning and not just regurgitating. Loved this class.",1
"Neimi is by far the rudest professor I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with. His attitude toward the class seemed in the beginning like it was going to be great, as he has written some books about film. However I can honestly say I have learned nothing in his class, I have only added a couple of movies to my list.",0
He is really easy. Just make sure that you do the reading.,1
"Dr. Rix is a great professor, he is really passionate about his subject. If you know his interests, you can get him on really fascinating tangents that stall the class a bit but you learn a lot.  -Lots of Blog Post -Lots of reading -Lots of interacting",1
"Not my cup of tea. Assigned a ton of reading, expected really high level in class essays. I say stay away from her.",0
Hard grader,1
"Absolutely intolerable. He is very aggressive, inconsiderate and unapproachable. Forget asking him questions ABOUT ANYTHING right now because he has no interest in answering them. He does not provide any guidance on assignments; he assigns them and gives a due date and that is all. It is up to you to correctly guess what he is grading. Stay away. ",0
"She is nice but doesn't seem very helpful. In my opinion, she doesn't explain things very clearly. There were many times in class where she would call on students for answers, they didn't know the answer, and then kind of acted like we were stupid for not knowing even though it was her instructions that weren't clear/didn't make sense.",0
"The most boring and monotone professor ever. Super nice guy, but hard to stay awake in his class. Tests are crazy hard but he gives extra credit if you come to lecture. Also, his graduate student, Muhammed Ameen that teaches lab is the worst lab instructor ever. Speaks little english, doesn't make assignments clear or concise and very boring.",0
"I will never understand how such easy material can be presented through a course in such a difficult manner. Non-test takers beware, tests are worth 50% of your grade with no extra credit and webcam mandated. Every ""almost 4.0 student"" has that one class that dropped there perfect score... this is it. Proceed with caution.",0
Class consists of a lecture for 1 hour and farming for the rest of class. Jorge is soft spoken but extremely knowledgeable on farming. Every week there is a quiz online along with a post and pre quiz.  There is one 1 page paper and a participation grade but that is it. This class is a farming class though so expect to get dirty.,1
"this guy is Anti African, he hates africans to death,the only Africans he deals with are the ones who will offer him stuff and make him feel superior.I cant imagine a sch will continue to have this guy teach.He deosn't know how to teach,he laugh at you when you ask him a question its becos he doesn't know.He allows certain students to retake quizes",0
"He is the department chair, and he'll be happy to tell you about it.  He asks for class discussions, yet he tends to belittle opinions that do not coincide with his own.  His exams test how fast students can type, rather than what they've learned.",1
"Save yourself.... Law is a trash course plus this prof makes it even worse. Boring, hella hard marker, just no.",0
"I took him for history because everyone told he was great...very wrong in my opinion and my friend's opinion. He is very unclear and not direct when you ask a question,  I thought he could have been a lot better teacher",0
"Great teacher, plenty of real world experience.",1
Be prepared to be extra specific (I mean specific!!) on your papers and 15+ page project even after his feedback/comments are given. Some of the handouts were outdated and contradicting. Very hard to get full credit. For an English teacher I expected him to have proper English without typos and very rude in his comments and replies.,0
"I had her freshman year for honors english. A lot of reading but only 3 formal papers and a group discussion you have to lead. No final. Its tough to get the A on papers but if you work hard a B+ is pretty easy to get. She made the class really interesting too, never really got bored. Work hard and youll do well with her. Shes pretty hot too",1
"-new professor to chemistry -doesn't know what she's saying half the time (not prepared for lectures) -unclear, confusing -not good at time management when it comes to lectures (will start a new topic like 10 minutes before class ends) -doesn't really answer your question- she'll just confuse you -she is nice though, I respect her for trying",0
"Definitely not the best prof. I took the DE course and he did NOTHING. Doesn't grade, notes are useless (tbh non-existent), just incredibly frustrating. 0.3/10, i don't recommend. Avoid at all costs.",0
"The reading in this class is really hard, or at least for me being a science student and unaccustomed to reading logical arguements. The content is somewhat interesting, but the class is lacking in real discussion.",1
"He's a nice professor, he does happen to make a mistake every class and you need to repeat yourself so that he can hear you. I didn't think this class was difficult, the professor is very willing to work with you outside of class. If you review the practice tests you will do well on the test. He also grades every test with a curve.",1
"He's the best prof at Blinn. He's extremely experienced, very intelligent, and very hilarious and kind. He made me love the topic and I learned things that will stick with me for a long time. Cares about animals, cares about his students. I can't say enough kind words about him. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1
"Dr. Rutledge is a super cool guy, but his 1120 class is ridiculous. He is so general in class, and then asks the most off the wall questions that literally NO ONE knows. He is always saying we ""might need to know this for jeopardy one day."" He is really nice, and his lectures are easy to sit in, but his tests are horrible.",1
I took Charles Link for the Winter Session (5 weeks) as a breadth and he was great. His class was asynchronous so you should watch his lectures and he has a good organization for his exams. There are 4 exams the last one being cumulative. He offers a chance to bring your grade up through his system that can count your final heavier than usual.,1
"Oh my god... where to start... horrible tests with misleading questions, multiple correct answers per question...If you can only pull of a 78 on a test with the textbook in front of you and having studied, there's something wrong. He's probably the rudest prof I've ever had to deal with, very unhelpful and UNPROFESSIONAL. It's time to retire buddy.",0
"One of my favorite professors I've ever had. Very engaging lecturer and makes the material very clear and easy to understand. Instead of just dumping a bunch of information on us, he breaks it down into main ideas that are easy to grasp. I enjoyed his teaching style a lot, no textbook, just 3 novels to real which were all pretty interesting. ",1
"Love Dr. Schneider. Great teacher and is willing to help in any way he can.. especially if you go to office hours. Tests aren't too bad. Just study the packet and CPA questions, and you'll be fine.",1
"I usually get great grades in math classes but this class was horrible. He will have you do homework from the book, which is optional, but even if you do the homework the tests will be different from it. My class took 3 tests and 1 exam and they were not easy. My advice? Don't take this class. If I could go back I wouldn't have.",0
"She was below mediocre, very tough grader and not much help for improvement. Better luck taking it with another professor",0
"Professor Marr is horrible to take.  But you have no other option.  You will fail his tests, but it seems like everyone does so he curves it to some degree.  Just be prepared to have no idea what is going on, read 4 different books, write 200 pages of commentaries and outlines on them, and give up any reasoning to believe in free will.",0
"P.D.J. is terrible, he screwed up my grade and gave me a C when i had earned an A and after 3 months he finally returned an email saying he had changed it, overall this class has very little, if anything to do with engineering and makes me wonder how this was even a class, he didnt even know what we were going to do in our sylabus, steer clear!",0
"DO NOT TAKE HIM FOR PHIL 250 if you need to fulfill the BA requirement. I am so frustrated. Took this online. Did every assignment we had, which is just quizzes and exams. Nothing else for points. The exams and quizzes are hard. If you don't read the textbook good luck. The lectures are awful and he doesn't really go over anything. DO NOT TAKE HIM",0
"Grabowski was a tough prof. This is a weeding out class. I took him twice, but retook Orgo 1 after I had him to get a B+. My frame of reference is based on what I learned from the other teacher I took- Hudson. Everything was much clearer through Hudson, walked through, broken down. Grabowksi was frustrating- but if you do your work you can get an A",0
Not a hard class with a really sweet and nice teacher. Really understanding and overall a great teacher. If you don't take her for Spanish then you're missing out.,1
"Dr. Lin is one of my favorite professors of all time. I'm not even a psychology major but she made everything so easy to understand. Her lectures are clear and tests are straightforward. If you put in the work, she will recognize that.",1
Professor Kroll is great! His lectures are very easy to follow and as long as you take the notes and study you should pass. He usually has one homework and one a quiz a week which is great for grade boosters so just make sure you study for those. Also go to his office hours and he will help with anything you don't get!,1
I love Mr.E I would 100% take him again. He really wants his students to succeed and is an easy grader. He is respond to emails fast and will go into detail to help you understand thing. 100% recommend him,1
Makes Bio lecture more of a lecture on his life story. Rambles on about nonsense for little over half hour before he actually starts to teach the subject. He's confusing to understand.,0
"It's most important to copy down your notes word for word to get good grades. He's a very nice guy, he's just too smart to be teaching an intro class, which is why he can be boring. He's much better in upper-level classes. I honestly don't understand how people don't pass - the powerpoints make sense and if you know those, you're set.",1
He was an excellent teacher.  He had high standards of what his class should get out of his lectures and e was not afraid to tell students that they weren't as smart as he had anticipated.  I missed a test and he helped me out on my final grade.,1
"Terrible. If you even sneeze in the wrong direction, he reduces your course grade. He runs a survey-level history course like a drill sergeant, and doesn't even do a good job at actually teaching it. Lectures are all over the place and will put you to sleep at 8 a.m. Take any other history course.",0
"DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS. He just rambles and makes you very confused. Only 2 tests, a midterm & a final. Midterm was very difficult. Over half the class failed. He tries to be cool by using a lot of curse words, but he just gets annoying. Bottom line, don't take his class!",0
"She is a very sweet professor who is looking out for the best in everyone and always wants to help if she can. Sometimes, it does feel like we are treated as if we aren't in college, but these introductory music classes also have that sense to begin with. She provides a lot of help and gives a lot of feedback on quizzes. She is a great professor!",1
"I wish I started taking his classes sooner, he is very good and knows his stuff.",1
he is an awesome teacher.  the class is fun and he likes to bust on people.  Take him when you can.  AI is a great class.  Dr. Bob rocks!,1
"This lady is the BOMB! The first day of class she said that she does not believe in homework, that our time was our time. I learned a ton in this class via her passion , empathy, and teaching style. She is a Jedi mind trick teacher; I learned a ton and did not even know it because it was so fun and easy. Open note quizzes and tests. great lady.",1
"freakin AWESOME teacher. he was great. everything he went over made perfect sense, he is by far the best math teacher i have ever had",1
"Not what I expected in a Children's Literature class. The work assigned was not hard just too much. It was hard to follow her syllabus as it was not updated to the textbook required for the class. This professor was the worst at grading, and forget about getting a response back if you had any questions. I do not recommend taking her class online.",0
Good lecturer but very unforgiving. Left me with Economics ptsd.,0
"He is a very good professor with efficient teaching methods. if you want to get a good grade, just understand the material he gives to you.",1
"Mr. Ross is a great professor, laid back and jokes around. His class is easy if you show up for lecture, as he explains the content thoroughly. There are four unit tests (he allows cheat sheets!) and homework is due on test day. This was the only book I actually used, because he gives so much homework, but as long as you try, you get full credit.",1
just bad,0
"Professor Matthiesen is a great professor if you would like to hear the tales a the astronaut who didn't do anything. His lectures are irrelevant albeit entertaining if you find enjoyment in having no idea what you will be tested on. To be aggressively blatant, this is nothing more than a philosophy course where you take chemistry exams",0
worst prof in existence,0
The class material is very simple especially if you have taken health in high school. The key is to read the book and take good notes. Other then that the class is very straight forward. Sutton is annoying but you'll get though it just put your head down and do everything thats assigned.,0
he gets off topic way to much. lectures are a drag but he does post them on bb. study that and youll do fine.,0
"Please. If you enjoy accounting, take anyone but him. You deserve to learn instead of memorizing rules endlessly without understanding anything about them. Take anyone. But not him.",0
Absolutely amazing! Love her!!,1
"Harsh grader, makes non-helpful comments. Her artwork is cool... much cooler than her personality",0
"Will never forget the endless stress and exhaustion this class gave to me. Doesn't teach well, assumes students are dumb but in reality we're just completely lost and always says to ""google"" if you can't find an answer. -_- Takes aways 10% of final grade if you are absent once and was consistently late to class. Don't take unless you know coding!",0
"This is the worse professor I've had, extremely rude. I emailed him to clarify information, his first response was to read the description. I sent him another email because I was still confused. He responded extremely rude and angrily, making me feel like my only choice was to drop the class. Take a different class if you like to ask questions.",0
"He is generally a nice guy, but sometimes he just ramble on and on. If the topic is interesting, you can follow; oftentimes it isn't. So just be prepared to drop down everything he puts on the slides and try to make it through the lectures. They can get REALLY boring.",0
"Dave is the greatest teacher I have ever had.  He turned a passive interest of mine into a passion I will pursue for the rest of my life.  Whatever your level, he will push you to the extent of your abilities and instill a sense of accomplishment and meaning.  I greatly respect Dave, and pray he doesn't follow this whole retirement nonsense.",1
I took him for post colonial lit. and thought he was a great Professor. The topics we covered were really interesting and discussion was great! He is also extremely helpful and willing to help you as much as he can! Take him you wont regret it!!,1
"Zero clarity whatsoever, she gives confusing instructions that change almost daily and right before the project is due. Her grading rubic and her final grades make absolutely no sense",0
Pro Barry don't give us any homework and only have three test: two quiz and one final. No review sheet only PowerPoint can study.,0
"Syllabus is misleading, dates are constantly changed. Students are flooded with 5+ chapters of information to retain for 1 test. Information on quizzes are based of off the book, and supplementary videos he posts (however 1/2 the class cant access). Makes information too complex for students who do not have prior knowledge. Would not take again.",0
I took her for psyc 316 and psychopathology. Her lectures can be a bit boring at times but she is the most patient teacher I have ever met. She will never get tired of explaining something if you don't understand it. Seems like an amazing therapist and gives real examples on her experiences in the field during lectures. Exams are tricky,1
"Thank god I don't have to take Arch 382 (Hist. IV)! That would be another semester having to deal with her at 8:30 in the morning and having to take those horrible quizzes!! What a pain in the ***!!! Excellent professor though. However, she treats this class more as an honors course.",1
Knows his material inside and out.  Can always count on his examples and anecdotes for a laugh.  I learned more from reviewing his slideshows individually since he does like to go quickly.  LABS: these take a long time - do them ahead of time and register for one later in the week cuz sometimes he hasn't gotten to the required material in time.,1
"RUN... FAST! Doesn't teach and expects you to know very advanced materials in a beginners class.  Will not help you, but will instead ridicule you and belittle you ... very condescending!",0
"The class isn't the easiest, but she's the best professor to take it with.",1
Dr. Blanchard is one of the hardest professors Ive ever had. If youre a science major at kutztown steer clear of organic chemistry with Blanchard. He is more concerned with getting the notes done than making sure the students understand. He gets very annoyed with questions and turns to rude comments when too many questions are asked.,0
"He is a tough teacher who at the beginning tells you what exactly he is expecting you to do to actually pass the course. The wording of his tests are advanced. If you're  in for the challenge go on ahead, but besides that I would suggest you to find another teacher. In order to get some points at the end you have to speak up and answer questions.",0
"He makes me feel like a total idiot sometimes, but he is truly a good man. I totally agree with the quizzes and exams not looking like anything you had covered recently but he typically puts it in difficult words to understand! He is actually quite funny when you talk to him. Just difficult to understand.",0
"Worst professor Ive ever had in my entire life. He barely explains how to do the assignments, he reads the textbook to you in the most monotone voice youll ever hear and is very rude to his students. I have straight As in all my classes and studied for all tests and still received a bad grade in this course. Do NOT take any courses with him.",0
"In his class you?ll learn to renormalize the phenomenology of narrative space, resolve the dialectics of metaphorical thought, collectively redefine and reify the paradigm of the parable of the model of the metaphor according to Baudrillard, Derrida, Lacan, Lyotard, Saussure, et al. Really. Ain't that sumpin'?",0
"Very professional,inspiring and knowledgeable.",1
"If classes are remote for fall term I highly recommend to not take this class, he is not flexible with the time requirements for the speeches, it is really not a public speaking class if it is online. He takes weeks in order to grade speeches and the midterm exam. Lectures relate to the class but I would wait on taking the class if things go remote",0
"Quirk is concerned with promoting his own ideas, political agenda and wants you too see how smart he is. He was very condescending to me when I would ask questions. He assumed that I was just some lazy college student but the fact is I love psyc. and usually excel in all my classes. Unless you are a stats genius take someone else!",0
BORING... be glad he retired.,0
"She was ok. I felt that her direction was not very clear in the grading and course work. She did more english than history for the most part. I felt she got thrown into this class because they needed a professor. We watched a lot of fictional movies of World War 1, though nice , completely irrelevant.",0
"If you do the work, you'll get an A.  Her class discussions were pretty depressing, and it was sometimes hard to know what she wanted in an assignment, but overall it was an enjoyable class.",1
"DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS! Although she is sweet, nothing is graded. We wrote multiple essays and we only received one essay back before finals week. Assignment instructions are always unclear, no matter how many times she explains it. Stay clear if you care about a decent GPA.",0
"Dr. T means well but expects so much from her students and grades very harshly/unreasonably. Speeches must be PERFECT under her standards in order to get an A, very subjective grading. Overall not a terrible class, but not the best teacher for it.",1
"Her test are meant to confuse you, she is a hard grader, she will not tell you whats to expect on the final, shes a heads up learn the concept and the statistics. I was very excited for this class oh well. I learned nothing.",0
"Read the Textbook and go to the bathroom before hand! Do not take for lab, the below comments are pretty accurate.",0
"It's a hard class by nature of the material, not the professor. She's a working professional in the field so she definitely knows what she's talking about. Despite her busy schedule, she's always around for extra help if you need it. Tests were hard, but there were always EC options to help. Really sweet person and makes her expectations clear.",1
"He does his best to be as personable to the younger generation as possible. He's pretty awkward, but he is very nice.  Academically, he does very little in class. I lived and breathed from the textbook. The only thing he did in class was discuss questions that pupils got wrong on tests or quizzes.  Homework is online. He takes attendance as well.",0
"ANTH101 is not for you if you don't like reading and learning about culture. It is a challenging course, but extremely engaging and you will get out of it exactly what you put in (do not expect grade inflation or an ""easy A""). The quizzes are not impossible if you do the (many) readings - in fact, they are quite clear and easy if you prepare well.",1
"I did this class over the summer in six-weeks, very intense. It was very hard as I didn't find the textbook or practice materials helpful for exams. There was really no interaction between Prof Hamilton other than automated messages sent out every Saturday. She did give extra credit however, which was needed as the exams/assignments are very hard.",0
Worst professor I've had. Nothing he teaches in class is on the exams. He always has to curve the exam like 12% and we all still get Cs and Ds WITH with curve. Apparently he used to be good but doesn't care anymore. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS.,0
"Prof Quinn's course on the Psychology of Religion was the most intellectually and academically dishonest experience of my educational career. The class does not cover the psychological, sociological or biological origins of religion, features no references to research. Quinn relies heavily on Jung to encourage magical thinking among his students.",0
"OMG!...hated this guy, stupid machines, give em up buddy...couldnt stand him, so i didnt go to classes...still prolly did better without him",0
"One of the coolest people I have ever met, excellent teacher. He cares about his students, willing to help you inside and out of the classroom if you have any questions, very approachable. Nothing not to like about Mr. Lyons!",1
Very difficult class. Lectures are very dry and boring... Honestly made me dislike biology a list.e,0
"Genuine, kind, very intelligent, and very helpful. He taught the Geneticsevolution portion of Bio 2. Stop by his office if you need help and sit at the front of the class so he gets to know you. He'll call you by name and remember you and what you've discussed when you see him around campus. Wish I could take more of his classes!",1
"FUNNY, NICE, CLEAR, HELPFUL, LOVE HER!!!",1
"Horrible teacher, makes you feel small, rude, treats you like a child. Would never recommend him. Makes you think and ask questions but never truly answers you, he just asks other classmates what they think.",0
"Super easy class, just come to every class to get the participation mark. His practice tests are literally the exact same as his actual tests. He's very monotone and boring. You can literally learn everything by yourself using the textbook.",0
Did not enjoy this class. It was tough to make good grades and I did not feel like I was learning much. Group work every day.,1
"Worst professor I've ever had. His method of ""teaching"" was awful, as he expected us to know how to do everything and didn't really teach. Upon emailing him and asking him about my grade in the class because the grades were not posted to canvas, he insisted i consult his website which was an external site from canvas. Would not tell me midterm grad",0
Tests are just like the homeworks this is usually the case for lazy professors. However he cares a lot about his students. Gives excellent lectures.,1
Best teacher I've ever had! Him and his TA were amazing this past semester! They truly care about all their students and give everyone the chance to do well! They are quick to help you with anything you may need and are super easy to communicate with! 100% would take any class again with Rick!,1
Over half the class failed....nuff said.,0
"Seems to get flustered while she  teaches. Kind of knows the material, but doubts herself if she copies something down wrong or a student answers differently than what she has. A nice person, but struggles with teaching in general.",1
Brother Hammar is a very difficult teacher to like. He is much older than other professors here at BYU-I and so he just doesn't remember things a lot and his tests are really hard. I felt like the questions were based off of his own opinion. He is a nice guy but not a good teacher.,0
please. for all that is holy. do not take this women in any class ever. I got an A and I would get an F if it meant I never had to take this class. Don't do it guys. There's better out there just don't do sonntag. please please don't. Tests are cruel. She is cruel. There are a lot of better profs at dearbon. Shabeb walla ma tekhdoua.,0
The worst class I have ever taken.,0
"Demanding class for non theology majors. Can be extremely disrespectful of other religions besides Christianity. Full attendance with diligent note taking is a must for comprehension. If you need to take a theology class for Aquinas and are not interested in theology or are nto religious or Christian, I would not recommend this professor's classes.",0
"Professor Thomson was a great online teacher. I took him for POLS 105 and HIST 151 online (7 weeks). It definitely was a decent amount of work. For POLS, you have long discussion posts every module and assignments every other one. A lot of writing, but not difficult. The only hard thing about HIST was the 10 page paper at the end. Would take again!",1
This guy might as well be a walking Liberal Party banner. All he does is preach for the Liberal Party.,0
"I had Bernadette for PSYCH 1A online and it was a very pleasant experience. She gives detailed instructions and is available through email to clear up any confusion. No pop quizzes, multiple tries for at least 3 of the tests, and quite a few opportunities for easy points or extra credit.",1
"I was making an A in her class, she even told me that, but my gradecard said F!",0
"A very caring and happy professor. Puts real value on the grades his students get and their well-being. If you don't get a good grade the first time on a paper, he'll sometimes let you submit revisions. Class participation matters a lot, he takes note if you come in late too much or obviously didn't read.",1
"I am taking his online class and it has a lot of work to it however he is very unorganized, does not respond to my emails if you have questions, and very unfair grader when you put a lot of time and effort in your work!",0
"Assigns soooo much work, even during this pandemic. Every class is a new project to do, and his instructions are always really confusing and contradicts what he says in class. If you have a meeting with him, beware because it will last hours, he will stay up until 1am for a meeting. He also screamed at our class because we wrote too much.",0
Goes way off topic. Brags about his race (African American). mentions irrelevant things. Talks about provocative things and grades ESL students like it is their first language.,0
"All around one of the best teachers I have had at Clark College. She is so sweet and loves to talk to you about her dogs or vast collection of typewriters. Gives excellent feedback, has a clear grading criteria, and lets you makeup one essay and one quiz. No tests, just 3 essays make the majority of your grade in this class.",1
"There is a quiz every Friday, but those are not hard. You take the quizzes and feel confident about taking the exam, then the exam is completely different from anything you were taught. She also rarely teaches you. She wants students to teach themselves or have your table group help explain. I would never take this class with her again",0
READ. THE. BOOK. or you wont pass. Tests are really hard and he does grade group projects easy but the discussion boards he grades hard.,0
"I literally learned nothing in this class. He only talks about himself and is very narcissistic! I got A's on every quiz,essay, and the final and yet he gave me a B! He makes up his own grade for you. If you're major involves social work or sociology do not take him because you will not be prepared for other classes. Easy but does not grade fairly and you learn nothing!",0
I don't like this professor very much. She made us copy a lot of notes and she goes through them way too fast. I tried to keep up with copying all of the notes but sometimes it didn't work out well. So I had to borrow one of my classmates notes to finish copying them down. Her tests were very hard let alone the final exam which was a lot harder.,0
"Teaches information very clearly. Once you understand his teaching style and the basics, the class is very easy. Textbook was totally unnecessary. Great prof",1
She is absolutely my favorite teacher here at Loyola. She does give pop-quizzes but they are very fair as long as you read. She's hilarious and extremely helpful if you need to see her outside of class. I'm by no means a philosophy major and I still greatly enjoyed her class.,1
"A great chemistry prof, cares about his student, lots of office hours, provides feedback on exams very fast, explains the material very well, and helps prepare for tests. Would 100% recommend him for this course, as this course is extremely challenging, but he truly helps you understand the basics, and gives a good background to applications.",1
"Mr. Parker is a great instructor. Even though he doesn't necessarily lecture or teach the entire class, he has always been very helpful whenever a student did have a question. Very easy to get along with and will allow absences if you absolutely need them without hurting your attendance.",1
"The syllabus was great! The course was heavier in terms of reading apart from assignments. Assignments for this year included a close-reading, midterm exam, final essay and final exam. His lectures are very history based which I personally didn't find useful at all. However, he does reiterate important themes and concepts for the exam.",0
miserable person. would make your life miserable.,0
"I was so lost in this class the entire semester. He skims through the slides without hardly explaining them, he just didnt actually teach anything. Only take this class if youve taken stats before or if youre good at math, otherwise youll be screwed like me!",0
"Erin is late to every class, never responds to emails, and if you need help for anything after class or outside off class in general you cannot count on Erin to be there because 100% she will not be. She means well but if you have the choice to have a different professor do it. Guarantee your grade will be 5-10% lower because she is the prof.",0
"Dr. Corson is hands down my favorite professor here at NW. He is my advisor and I'm taking Homeland with him now. He is hilarious, expects a lot from you, and pushes you to be a better student. He is a great person in general, definitely a man you want to get to know. A humanitarian homie through and through! He's definitely got your back.",1
"I took his online class during the summer and it was alright. If you read your material you'll do good on the quizes. There were only 3 tests but they were really easy. If your confused on the short essay's you can always contact him and ask, he is really good at answering back.",1
"Nice guy, but his tests are harder than they should be. Most of the time, they are not like the practice problems. I took this class as a 5 week; DONT DO IT. My 4.0 ACCT GPA GONE because his tests were harder than he made them seem. He ""helps"" by giving hints in the lectures, but are sometimes not there. Also, his ""curves"" are usually 1 point.",0
"You do graded activities on things you haven't learned yet. He says he cares more about ""understanding"" than grades, but somehow there were over 2500 points in this class. Just reads the formulas off of the board. Have fun teaching yourself the entire class because he sure won't. Deserves to be teaching high school physics, not college physics.",0
Julie is super helpful. Takes a hard class like stats and makes it interesting and easy to understand. She's also super nice and relates to students. ,1
"Expects brilliance. Pushes you to max if you don't let comments/grades discourage you. Picky. Cocky. Rarely gives compliments, but when you get one, you really earned it. Provides tips on writing you'll keep for lifetime. Writing papers (65%) is whole class. No readings! Still lots of analytical thinking. Ask for help even when he it's not offered.",1
"She is a nice person, but I understood little to nothing of the course. She expects every bit of her lectures to be retained by all students, and teaches and quizzes on material that is not covered in the textbook. She expects students to study over holidays and gave a quiz right after thanksgiving break. its an incomprehensible and difficult class",0
"Some people like him a lot, but I do not. For a class entitled rehtoric and great books, we didn't read a single book, only exceprts from many different books. There were no quizzes, and the only exams consisted entirely of writing assignments. He is a nice enough man, and tries to help with papers, but his help is not very useful.",0
"talks really fast but otherwise easy to follow. also goes through most of the stuff in the workbook, which is very helpful for assignments/tests",1
Interesting materials but the explanations in the lecture were very unclear.  I had to use lectures from other professor to understand the materials.,0
"Lectures are interesting but the pacing is so slow it gets dry. The midterms and exams arent difficult as long as you attend classes and review notes. The averages are usually Bs. Hw is light and is either problem sets, which are graded for completion, or myeconlab, where you get many attempts.",1
Definitely a great professor and class. His quizzes are very easy. He lectures but makes them interesting. I would very much recommend taking him!,1
"This class was the most life-changing and wonderful experience I've had at Queen's. Dr. Carson is engaging, directs discussion easily, and time flies. We had such interesting assignments and he adjusts his class material to suit the mood of the seminar. So approachable, with a fair workload and really fair marking. Take EVERY class you can!",1
Woke up a student once that fell asleep in his class. Helped me some outside of class. Lots of home work,1
The textbook is easier to understand about his lectures.  I've realized that if I actually want to learn anything I need to hit the books hard.  The class average on the 1st test was a 75.  If it wasn't for the student presenations that we are quizzed on I probably would stop attending class.  Not worth the commute! Sorry!,0
"Great guy, makes difficult concepts easy to pick up. FREE FOOD if you go to his class, so like why not right?? the one guy who actually connects math to real stuff ",1
I took her class twice and found out there was other people in the same class that took her class twice. I notice people dropping her class with complaints I truly thought I was doing great in her class to find out I got a D at the end of the semester now I have to retake the class before I can take any other my classes ,0
"Such a great guy. Although I hated giving a presentation due to extreme social anxiety, he made me feel relaxed and comfortable. Dr. Meagher is an incredible teacher.",1
"It is impossible to tell how well you are doing in his class because of his curve, but his curve saves your life. Read the textbook chapters from day 1, and maybe his notes. His exams are difficult, but not as difficult if you read the textbook thoroughly. Work with the TA for the paper, and do the homework and you should do well. But he is hard",0
He is a great guy tons of enthusiasm. between him and his appointed people there is a ton of help and study groups. take part in them. the classes are hard but it is organic chemistry expect it. clarity is rough there is a lot to know. takes a lot of your own effort but overall i wouldn't ask for a different teacher!attendance not required but go!,1
"Can never contact him and if you do, good luck reading it. Never received any help when it came to emails and waited until a few days before my exam to receive a midterm grade.",0
"Used slides to teach the course. Before midterms, she spent like hours reading two lines.. after midterms, she rushed like a chapter a day. Hard exams but eventually she curves them if avg is low so its all good.",0
She's SO CONFUSING. Very difficult to follow. Be ready to teach yourself EVERYTHING.,0
"Lectures are long and terrible. She gives no guidance, she just flies through them leaving little room for anyone to even comprehend what the heck she's doing.  She also gives NEW material for the test on ""review day"". Her tests are hard. Don't expect any kind of extra credit or help with your grades. FIND A DIFFERENT TEACHER. ",0
"AMAZING CLASS! show up and participate and you will get a A. She defnitely knows the material. I came into class not knowing about mass incarceration etc, and I came out truly inspired. She's lovely and she brings snacks to class! You can use your notebook for exams and she offers extra credit!",1
"Nice researcher but never knows how to teach. Only his notes are useful, you'll never know what's going on with his lectures",0
"Prof does show up late to class and grade late, but makes up for it because the lectures are informative, important stuff is revisited, and your input is encouraged. As long as you can add the info from lecture into your papers you WILL do fine. Many people admittedly did not show up or pay attention in class online themselves, yet they complain.",1
"I had her in a first year history class, a pretty general class about the history of Europe and she was able to make it very interesting. She is a very corky and funny person who has a very interesting 'story-telling' voice, however she is a tough grader so you will need to study in advance and make sure you understand everything from the lectures.",1
"Ed is the most awesome teacher! He gets to know you on a one on one level and actually can make American Literature interesting. Never any homework, one paper, a midterm and a final all for which is extensively reviews and doesnt make you feel nervous. Hes a funny, caring guy who always makes the students laugh. DEFINITELY take this teacher :)",1
Take good notes during lectures. Tests were essay style. Three grades the entire year. This class is easy if you take good notes and listen to lectures. Write down everything so you can study for tests. Never really used the book. Watched a lot of videos. ,1
"I thought she was a good teacher. Some students complained of her accent, but I had no problem understanding what she said. Her tests can be difficult, but if you go over the powerpoint slides AND your textbook (read every single thing in the chapter) you should do fine. I enjoyed her class and I would take her again.",1
"I love Carolyn! She is an amazing teacher. I took this class from 6-10 thursday nights but I think that Carolyn was the reason I looked forward to it. If you get to know her a little before or after classes you will be in her favor forever. She is funny and like my artistic soulmate. If you're into theater, art, and movies you'll love her class! :)",1
Very Good instuctor,1
seems like he is bored teaching this class,0
"Professor Makover is probably one of the worst professor I have ever come in contact with, barely explains stuff in class and runs over it very quickly with no examples. He refers to our knowledge and compares it to 4th and 5th graders, even though I have heard him say multiple times that ""Our knowledge is probably better than his.""",0
One of the nicest teacher's you'll have in Seneca. You will get an A without a doubt. Who else gives a binder check worth 10 percent of your final mark awesome teacher. Finished with a 97 % in her class ! (:,1
"DO NOT TAKE BIOLOGY FROM RISA COHEN! She is the absolute WORST teacher I have ever had in my life. I am an 'A' student and I got a 'C'. Her tests do not reflect anything she taught in class, she gives pointless homework/in class assignments, and she is boring. She is not the least bit helpful and she yells/embarrasses people when they are tardy.",0
"Judy definitely has the tendency of reading from her slides.  However, she is so intelligent and very genuine to everyone.  Some classes she was teaching just had dry material regardless of the professor so I think if you give her a chance she's actually a pretty decent professor. Her tests are relatively easy as long as you study her slides.",1
"Best prof I've had in my university career. Lectures are interesting and effective, labs/ exercises are helpful, and tests are fair. Wish that every prof was like him!!",1
Just got done with 120 during summer right after taking 100 hybrid with Debbie. Excellent teacher who really cares about her subject and can be down right inspiring sometimes. Take time for the homework and this class can give you a leg up in 120.,1
one of the most terrible online courses I have ever taken. Got not full understanding the course and the assignments were not clear. For working assignments I got just about  50%.,0
awesome person. really tries to explain and you can tell she has a passion for what she is teaching. i really really love her class. TAKE HER,1
"Extremely clear in lectures, helpful on assignments. She seems very serious and it is a bit intimidating, but she's actually very nice! The level of difficulty of assignments and tests was fair.",1
"Awesome class with an awesome professor. He knows his stuff and gives great examples. Also, there's a movie night. How cool is that? Definitely take Rasheed for 107. Few things are graded so make sure to copy all of the Powerpoints and study those and you should be set.",1
Insanely terrible teacher. In my four years of college I have never left a review on a teacher until now because that is how bad he is. Has a terrible accent where you can't understand him. Most of the class cheats on the exams and they still fail. Do not take this professor.,0
"worst marker ever, although he is funny, he does not help students at all, brutal.",0
"He is a great teacher. Gives great examples on the material and ensures that you understand the material. 3 tests (last one is the final, cumulative) , 3 online quizzes, 6 problem sets (he just checks for completion not correctness).",1
"This class can be challenging for individuals, but I found the way that he presents the material to be very effective and easy to understand. This was asynchronous and so trying to cram half a unit into a couple of days is stressful, I did it many times but I don't recommend. He always gives you feedback and it VERY organized on blackboard!",1
Great professor for ENG 102 highly recommend. Assignments are easy because she tells you exactly what to change to get a high grade.,1
"Take all your lame chemistry jokes and barium. I can't express my frustration with him in 350 characters, so just take my word that you'll be better off with another professor.",0
"Horrible. Absolutely horrible professor. The worst professor/teacher I have ever had as a student EVER. She is very confusing, stubborn and rude. She constantly cuts students off when questions are asked. Words cannot explain how bad of a professor she is. Do NOT take her classes.",0
"I cant tell you how much I loved this class. Half of the semester is costuming, half is makeup. For makeup, we learn cuts and bruises, old age, etc., and she lets us have a lot of creative license. Shell give you notes and youre graded on how you listen and respond to the notes and how it shows in your work. Plus you get to keep your makeup kit.",1
This class is terrible take another one. Class has no direction the lectures are a waste of time and boring have nothing to do with the tests. Just an awful awful awful awful class and professor. Lazy no direction just terrible,0
"Very difficult course, speech barrier is there from his European background, however he speaks English well.  Homework will confuse you almost every time, example are much simpler than roughly half of assigned problems.  However he gives good feedback and will work with you if you ask.  Overall a good man to learn from if you love chemistry.",0
"Not a very strong teacher.  Seemed to try to portray the real world with every mistake he  anyone ever made in class, but it never made sense.  never gave us a clear understanding of why we were there, and the class does not even count towards the major. overall it was a huge waste of time. Don't take this class.",0
"The class was easy, made some friends but learnt nothing.  feel that I could have gained more from the calss but  this teacher did not teach the material. At all. Just spoke on random tangents and did not teach. Do not take JRN 202 with this teacher.",0
"Don't listen to the majority of these reviews, Vroman does a decent job. Yes, tests are on the harder side but I had no problem being well above the curve on every graded assignment. This class will really tell you if you have what it takes to major in ECON or if you are just joking yourself. TAs do a lot to clarify her teaching, can be confusing",1
"since you HAVE to take speech you HAVE TO TAKE IT WITH TOM! He is really funny, there so little work and he does not care about attendence! Something is wrong if you dont take his class",1
The test was irrelevant to both lectures and labs. Try to avoid.,0
"Dont lisfen to all of the good reviews on this guy, hes impossible to understand, he doesnt exaplin anything, he prints notes but you cant read them, we got a replacement teacher towards the end and it was the first time i had understood anything in the class all year. The only upside to him is that hes a math teacher that actually speaks english.",0
"Professor Mellow is very personable and nice. She treats all students fairly and is very understanding. Listen to her lectures to learn how apply the knowledge you acquire reading the textbook. This class was interesting, which is saying a lot considering I took this class online!",1
"Jaycy is an amazing lecturer with a great personality, however, her exams are killer. She purposely makes them hard, but she provides extra credit! 1 midterm, 1 final, 13-14 discussion questions, one group project, and a final paper. Participation matters, so go to class. Getting an A in this class is not so easy, she makes you work for it!",1
"I agree, pointless busywork, she does talk well, but really!! nothing worthwhile.",0
"Hansen is a pretty good professor. She always answers questions in class. She doesn't prefer to correspond with students via email. She is very casual in class, which doesn't bother me. I have taken 2 classes with her so far. She can come off as mean at first, but once you get to know her she is easy to get along with. Her exams are tough.",1
I had to drop this class because his constant personal attacks were giving me chronic depression. 0/10 would recommend this man,0
"Mark is a great guy & a great lecturer. He is knowledgable and knows how to apply course concepts to real-life scenarios to help students understand. However, he was very unclear on what he wanted for the midterm and exam, and that is where many students seize to like him. Although you believe you may have gave good answers, you will be surprised.",1
"Really nice guy and means well, but his class is annoying. Workload is not bad, just a few questions for every subject but the research paper sucks. He never gives clear instructions and often leaves you confused. Doesn't use ECampus and rarely answers any emails. Tests are easy because he gives you the questions beforehand but is a tough grader. ",0
Dr. Harvey is a great teacher. The material is EXTREMELY difficult but she knows exactly what she is talking about. This class is not an easy A though. You really do have to put a lot of time into it and go to her office hours for guidance. SHE IS VERY HELPFUL. Lab gets really tiring and I wanted to cry 50 times during experiments. Have fun!,1
"Dr. Dwyer is exceptionally insecure. She is hostile to feedback of any kind (e.g. ""I think there is more than one correct answer to this question"") and will not even read such feedback, though she requests it. She also does not seem to care about whether her students succeed so long as they respect her authority. It's all about her.",0
Joe tells the myths in an AMAZING way. He is super friendly and entertaining. Going to lecture and listening to the podcasts definitely helps to understand the myths and learn all of the characters. The exams are easy if you pay attention in class and know the myths! Weekly online quizzes (can retake until you get 100%) and 4 exams.,1
"Sara is one of the most amazing women that I've ever met! She is so passionate about what she is teaching and you can tell that she really cares about her students! If you have a little bit of background, you don't have to attend class to get a good grade but I found myself excited to go to class because her lectures so interesting.",1
so funny!,1
"Pro. Igor is very unprofessional & condescending. Idk where these reviews came from but believe me, he gives an UNREASONABLE amount of work, his quizzes are more like mid-terms, his modules are disorganized, he calls procrastinators losers & he explicitly conveyed he thinks your a baby if you have excuses. I highly advise you NOT to take his class",0
"This woman should not be at Fordham in any position of power. Petty, vindictive, and incompetent are the nicest things that I can say about her.",0
He misgendered me every day and I quite literally couldn't parse a single response question he assigned. If I could give him a zero I would.,0
too much reading,1
He is a financial guru!,1
"Worst class ever. She's the best of the three professors and that's not a good thing. Her english needs improving and she often has to ask the class how to pronounce words, using up time. Her lectures are hard to understand. It's impossible to get a good grade, all the profs and TAs pride themselves on being hard markers. Avoid!!!",0
terrible.,0
"Easy, fun class. You learn a lot and it gives you an idea of places to travel in the future. You have 3 big tests, but you just need to do the study guides and you will have no problem passing.",1
gotta love the clothes..,0
"Professor Dunstan is adorable. She explains chemistry really well- takes it down to simple terms and constantly asks if anyone needs clarification. She gives 4 exams and a cumulative final. She gives 4 take home quizzes also. And there are 3 extra credit point options on every exam. Pay attention, take good notes, and you'll do fine.",1
"not easy but the information is useful, if you are going into the field of theater or film.",1
"Very unorganized, things that are talked about in lecture do not show up on what you are tested on and is impossible to get in contact with.",0
"Nice lady, aweful class. You are required to comment every day, which leads to a lot of stupid comments (especially from Freshmen). She tries to teach too much instead of getting down to the essentials. T/F quizzes, but not really easy just do extra credit. Midterm and final are essay ?s but the ? is given beforehand and you discuss it.",1
"Dr. Scobey is very interesting. A nice guy, but as a prof he would rather argue with students than help when they do not understand. A lot of his test questions are written to be deceiving rather than to test knowledge. Expects you to know things he did not really teach and expects you to basically teach yourself. Practice/study lots on your own.",0
Raudenbush is the man!!!!!!!!,1
Lectures are very organized and tests are very similar to practice exams.,1
"A very intelligent man, but not a great prof.  The lectures are mandatory as he doesn't provide any notes and the textbook is unrelated.  His lectures can be interesting but they are very scattered and it's hard to keep up.  The exams are hard but fair.",0
"Subjective grader when you have an Oral, there is no rubric. He isn'tt an easy grader like the lower levels. If you have something right & miss a small thing in a section on a quiz/test its automatically wrong.  He is very unreasonable at times and is discouraging.  I would not take him.  The class would have been easier if he were more helpful.",0
"Overbearing, pompous, and shortsighted. That's to say the least. I work twenty five hours a week off campus and was unlucky enough to have two bouts with MRSA, and she still gave me a bad attendance grade, regardless of my ER papers from the hospital. She's abrasive, very hard grader, and unrelenting. Do not take her unless you are a masochist.",1
"Doesnt respond to email, and is so rude to students. Its like she expects us to know everything already.",0
"So so so hard!! I can't keep up! She is brilliant but has a hard time passing her knowledge on to the students. For nursing students, I recommend the lab. I didn't take it because it isn't required and right now I am regretting it. I wish someone would have told me that the lab would be helpful! She asks questions on exams that she didn't cover!",0
"I absolutely hated this prof. She asks for opinions, but your opinion is always wrong. She asks lots of questions and if you don't give her the answer she wants, she will belittle you. She made me so frustrated that I almost dropped out of Honors, just to get out of her class. Know everything she says word for word on the essays or you will fail.",0
3 mc exams on definitions found in the textbook. 5 easy hw assignments. he grades on participation and attendance but as long as you show up you'll be fine. he doesn't allow any electronics. you don't need to pay attention long as you memorize about 50 terms each exam. he's approachable and always willing to explain more. kinda boring lectures.,1
His lectures are decent but due to it being online my interaction with him was minimal. The questions in exams did not accurately represent the calibre of questions in the mylab econ study plan and it was a whole lot of self learning. It was the worst online course I've taken. So much for inclusivity and understanding with exams at midnight.,0
"This class was SOO boring, but it's easy. You don't need the textbook and your don't even have to go to class. I don't think I listened to any of his lectures, but I got an A in his class. He talks so quietly. The whole class is based on presentations and 2 online exams.",0
Extrememly easy! Cancels class ALOT! Do all the homework assignments! Guaranteed an A!,1
"Her class is too confusing, even went to her office to get help, I asked her a question, she pretty much just repeated what I already knew, and did not explain my question! I went to a tutor, tutor explained it in 5 mins. I understood it completely. Considering dropping the class!",0
"He is an amazing teacher who makes lectures interesting and funny. Occasionally asks to make sure that everyone understands hat he has just written down. The grade is based on weekly assignments, a midterm, and a final. The final was very hard and was a large part of the grade so study lots for it, but the assignments and midterm were easy.",1
A little boring to have at 8 in the morning with his monotone voice and corny jokes. However he was a very good professor who explained every problem step by step.  Has quirks that make the class fun like his comments about sports and his funny stare that he always gives,1
"Pédagogie pour des enfants du primaire. On lit 2 pages, vous testez si on a lit. On lit 2 autres pages, vous testez si on a lit. Vous devriez faire évoluer votre pédagogie professeure levesque, on est à l'université et non au primaire! Cours débile!",0
"If you're not familiar with the topic, I'd recommend going to EVERY lecture (even though attendance isn't mandatory).  If you're consistent with learning the information it's an easy A! Do the textbook questions, and DO HIS EXAM REVIEWS ON SAKAI!! Puts most of the review questions WORD FOR WORD on the exam, that's how I got an A. Don't cram.",1
"His voice is soft, and hard to hear.  Cantow is lazy, so when he grades, he grades real easy.  Funny guy, too.  Really wants to get done with the lab.  I'd recommend him for lab, easily. (=",0
"Evil! Evil! Evil! She makes me hate spanish, we have no other alternative to her, which makes things even worse! She's mean and never really gives you an awnser. She expects people to understand the first time, and never has any patience.",0
Easy class if you do the work and show up every class. Grading scale makes it easy to get an A.,1
"Great prof, lab work will ensure that everything you need to know, you will. Sometimes assumes you know stuff from other courses such as math topics not covered yet but is more then willing to help you understand what it is you have to do.",1
"I love Dr Crane. Hes a very nice man and gives great examples. He explains concepts really well. We have weekly quizzes that if you take notes during lecture, youll ace. 2 major papers. Be extra careful on all your citations on the papers as he does not take kindly to anything cited incorrectly & will drop your grade significantly.",1
"She is the sweetest lady ever. She cares about her students, and she understands the hardships and the struggles that come with being a college student. She is very helpful and reasonable.",1
"By far and away the best teacher I have had at the three schools I have attended: BYU, UVU and University of Chicago.  His commitment to you, the student, is simply amazing",1
"A very good class.  Rushed through because it was a summer class, but the prof is very knowledgeable and entertaining.  He really knows his stuff and presents history using a variety of multimedia (video, internet, photos, etc).  Makes history come alive!",1
hes the worst prof ive ever had. Super boring classes its a waste of your time but he makes you to come to classes by giving 2 pop quizzes thats worth 20% each of your final grade.  Midterms are fairly easy though. ,0
Worst math teacher I have ever seen.,0
Professor Ross isn't great. When I ask more than one question he tells me to stop talking to let others talk which leads to awkward silence since nobody else wants to speak up in Zoom classes. He doesn't assign much HW but instead wastes class time by doing HW in class. We spent the entirety of week 3 watching a youtube. WASTE OF TIME. Don't enroll,0
"This class was a gift, should be required for all students",1
"I wrote down most things that woman said, and typed them up and saved them to disk...as her insight, experience and honesty will be tools to use not only in my professional life, but in my personal, emotional and spiritual. Three cheers for Judith!",1
Demonstrates absolute NO consideration to his students. Threw a PhD leveled project to an undergrad class because he wanted someone to help his Ph.D student to code her project. COPIED AND PASTED a MIDTERM from another university and used it as his own in another class. This person has neither ethics nor skill in teaching... avoid at all cost.,0
I simply asked him for help instead he bullied me into posting one of my discussion boards onto the class public forum and asked other students to pick me apart for extra credit. he refuses to give help. Do not take him unless you can some how get on his good side. I dropped his class because he was going out of his way to fail me.,0
"Class is mandatory in the MSA program, so you have no choice but to take it. However, I will say that she is a fair grader and gives partial credit. Tests are not difficult if you pay attention in class, do the HW/projects and read the textbook. However, they can be tricky especially since it is not an undergraduate course. Workload is manageable.",1
"Very pompous and arrogant. Believes he is smarter and above the students. Extremely boring lectures! Even when the subject matter was interesting he just rambled on in a monotone voice. I was very lucky to have a great TA. If you can stay awake in the class, you?ll do fine.",0
Grossman is a clown. He rarely explains what he is doing and often just copies onto the board the example that is given by the generic powerpoint provided by the book. The good part is that as long as you do the homework you will understand the class and do good on the exams. Attendance isn't required and I don't go myself. He gets off topic easily,0
"ONE OF THE BEST TEACHERS I HAVE HAD, BECAME A PERSONAL FRIEND AND HAS PROVIDED GUIDANCE FOR ME THAT HAS BEEN WORTH ITS WEIGHT IN GOLD FOR MY LIFE. HE IS PASSIONATE ABOUT LEADERSHIP AND GRADES HARD IN THAT CLASS, BUT IT WILL MAKE YOU A BETTER LEADER AND GET YOU GROWING AS A PERSON",1
Parente is an atrocious professor who lies to his students to get them out of his hair if he cant explain something to you when you come for office hours. Hes a subjective grader so make sure he likes you or you wont do well.,0
"Class was so confusing that I forgot who I was, where I was, and what I was doing -- it's a great stress reliever.",0
"Professor was hospitalized during last 2 months of term and had 3 surgeries.  Nevertheless, she still answered emails and helped students.",1
Dr. Liu is an outstanding professor. He has a genuine interest in your grasp of the material and makes sure you get it before moving on. Definitely more interested in how well he teaches the material than how much. Never rushes through things. I'm an engineering student and this is the first time I've gone into every math exam with no worries.,1
"LOVE THE COLONEL. A lot of work, but manageable and easy. Best  professor at Marist. Favorite class by far",1
"Bill has high standards and is a tough grader, but as an art major I found his advice incredibly helpful, and my art has improved dramatically throughout the semester. As long as you're willing to work and improve, what he teaches you will prove valuable. Really nice guy, I definitely recommend taking his class if you're serious about art!",1
If you do not have prior experience in a French immersion setting do not take O'Hagan's class. His primary focus is grammar. Extremely challenging to do well without a solid foundation in French (above and beyond high-school/college level exposure). Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.,0
"I wouldn't take this professor and take someone else immediately!! Please listen to me and hes not helpful, always gives away prizes that doesnt even connect to the subject and lecture!! He has a problem with some students like me Iwant you to take somebody who cares about exam scores, and also your effort too. He has 2 exams, hurts your grade.",0
"Very tough marker, very funny, instructions not very clear for assignments and labs.",0
"I would 100% take another course with Dr. Sabol. His tests are take-home essay, which you get more than a month to prepare for each. He is extremely knowledgeable and makes class interesting. His lectures are full of information that really explain what the reading is about. There are abstracts that are also graded. Best professor.",1
WORST TEACHER I'VE EVER HAD. Avoid him at all costs. He is the most confusing professor I've ever listened to. His lectures don't make sense at all. He doesn't teach anything. He is so monotone and boring. I've had to teach myself everything and work EXTREMELY hard for an A.,0
Professor Hilevsky is amazing. Extremely knowledgeable and has amazing experiences he shares with the class that inspire everyone. POL397 is never a dull class. Would recommend!,1
"Not helpful whatsoever. Teaches everything but the topic, has terrible office hours. Doesn't expect too much, just expects the irrelevant. Should NOT be teaching, period. If you don't enjoy idiotic professors who don't care about you, find another class.",0
"The only way to pass this class is to have prior knowledge. He expects you to know the information and his lectures are very long due to him repeating himself over and over. The first five weeks of homework are extremely long and we had three midterms and a final. He is also a bad communicator, I emailed him many times and he never once responded.",0
"Best, BEST professor I've had here at Suffolk hands down.  Not even an art history major or minor, and I loved it.  Highly recommend taking his class.  Great guy!",1
"Really nice professor. Will help you if you do not understand material. Group reports are a plus! Take him, because he does not require you to do a prelab for ORGO II LAB, only prelab questions. I did not even have to try because the lab only counts for 1 credit and still got a decent grade. Also, pick smart people to be your lab partner!!",1
"She doesn't care about her students, not even a bit. Taking the course with her is the worst experience.",0
"Professor Bennett was the kindest and most respected professor from my first year. She works hard to ease the transition for first year students and is very thoughtful with her feedback. She makes herself available frequently for one-on-one feedback and tries her best to learn everybody's name. A real class act, you want her as your professor.",1
"Professor Leikind is a nice guy, who is really passionate about science. He knows his subject very well, but let me describe why I would not take him again if I had to. You need to do 2 quizzes every class even on exam days and read the chapter before class, which is about 15-25 pages. If youre not really interested in physics, its not for you.",1
Shes a nice woman and its a fun class but there was a little too much sharing opinions and stories not enough quality learning for me.,1
"She taught the entire course on slides, which made it very difficult to follow. She went super slow before the midterm, then went way too fast after. She tried, but her explanations were too thorough and made everyone bored, and frustrated.",0
Worst teacher I've had here.The course has no pre-requisite but he acts like you should already know a lot about music. Goes way too fast and gives a lot of work. The textbook is way too hard to understand. He knows a lot but is very snobby about it and if your opinion doesn't agree with his then it's wrong.,0
"Read some of the reviews before I took his class and thought how hard could it be? I was so wrong, whatever you do avoid having him as your professor. If you do take him make sure he knows who you are (go to office hours, raise your hand, ask questions, etc.)",0
"I was scared from all the comments on here, but I didn't think her class was all that bad. I was severly struggling and she worked with me and helped me through the class. Also, she changed the way quizzes were counting because too many people were cheating!! You can't fault her for that.",1
"Dr. Cote's the worst professor I've ever had. She's arrogant, rude, and a horrible teacher. She just reads off her slides and does NOT engage with the class. She gives problem sets as homework but never goes over them. Be prepared to spend hours teaching yourself EVERYTHING. WPUNJ should fire her, as she puts the school down in every lecture.",0
"Excellent lectures, very useful.  Some difficult tests.  Time consuming projects",1
"However 'brilliant' Parkes may be, I never saw an inkling of it. I felt the class was pretty easy, just a pain in the ass and completely useless.  I can honestly say I learned nothing from this man.  I tried listening to some lectures, but his comments are so mundane and obvious I just started bringing my own books or activities to do during class.",0
"If you are considering taking her class online, dont. Completely unorganized, changes deadlines on assignments and tests all the time. Unclear instructions about everything. She takes a whole month to reply to your email, or doesnt email you back at all. The semester ends this week, and barely any grades are in. Just avoid this class if you can.",0
"Probably the best Hospitality prof I've had. She's really helpful, and wants you to succeed in the industry after you graduate.",1
"""If you don't pass this class, you'll end up working at McDonald's for the rest of your life."" - Prof. Dewan There's 3 exams for the class, the final is 45% of your grade, that's huge! Prof. Dewan isn't the best a motivation so expect a daily roast when you come to class. Although, I will say this, if you work hard for your grade you'll get it.",0
"Professor Zimmerman is the worst teacher that I have had at UMD so far. She reads straight from the power point lectures, and makes what could be potentially interesting information, boring. She is also unorganized and completely useless when it comes to using any online tools for her class. Avoid if possible.",0
"The best teacher ever, maybe later you can go to the bar and tell someone how great he is. I plan on taking a class again for fun",1
"Although there was no textbook use, there were short snippets to read which really help understand the project and terms used in the class. Prof. Yves is really good at giving feedback and cares earnestly about helping you with your 3D design projects. Such a solid choice!",1
Great teacher and also funny.  Funny how he tries to be funny too.,1
"Worse Prof Ever... He will give you very hard time, after all of a hard time, you will get bad GPA.",0
"She is an extremely hard professor! Mainly the wording of her test questions, but she is amazing, I have learned so much from her! This is my 2nd class with her! I enjoy her teaching style although the fill in the blank quizzes can be brutal. She makes sure you are learning the information!",1
"He is ok. Bad lecturer - true. But! He wants his students to do well. You can get a good grade in his course if you do the assignments and read and understand the handouts. It's university, NOT high school - you are expected to learn a lot on your own.",1
"Very easy class, finished 4 weeks of work in 2 days.",1
"I luv this prof!did teo courses with him,easy exams if u study well!",1
No textbook. Papers and exams were extremely reasonable without being easy. They require some effort and time (as they should) and I was genuinely interested in the content of my projects. The first two exams are all written and can be challenging to finish if you write slowly. 10% final quiz on last day of classes. Excellent!,1
"The group progect was a nightmare. JP decided to be a ""bad customer"" on purpose and make it as hard as possible for everyone to get it done. His tests are also much harder than they need to be. Be prepared to bring every slide he uses on your notes, maybe you'll get a good score then.",0
"Helen is a great teacher and can really help people with math phobia. She's ""not here to stroke your ego"" and will tell you this directly. She's engaged, enthusiastic, and knowledgeable. Her classes are always full because people know she's excellent. Do yourself a favor, take her classes if you need math. You're going to have to work for it!",1
"Professor Johnson is a very passionate researcher and a very kind person. You can tell that she sincerely wants her students to succeed. However, she is very specific in her tests and can sometimes ask questions to which answers are only found in lecture. Grading is tough and you really have to study hard and embrace small details in this course.",1
pretty terrible,0
"The class is quite simple, games are usually being played everyday. attendance matters so if you are planning on missing a day just email her before hand. There is a big projects and two-three other major assignments that counts but thats pretty much it shes a good person.",1
"This guy is hilarious. Not a bad thing to say about him. Easy A. Nice guy! If you are waitlisted, show up the first day and he WILL give you a permission to add code regardless of position. One group project, few little assignments. Easiest class I've ever taken. DO NOT MISS CLASS THOUGH! ATTENDANCE IS MANDATORY!",1
"Funny, energetic, helpful and just awesome. Best instructor at Humber, or anywhere for that matter. I hope he gets his 25 year pin :)",1
"This class was awful.  Not only was it a huge Freshman class, but it was taught by a professor whose main intent was to scare his students and wasn't concerned with teaching anything.",0
"His classes are mostly useless and you have to learn off of the textbook for everything. Just take this class in english if you can. If you are good at learning from a text book go ahead, but if you want a prof that properly teaches you the material this is not the class for you.",0
"Difficult class and subject material but Professor Grange did a good job of teaching it.  Requires a lot of homework and tests are difficult, but you learn a lot.",1
"Professor Santiago is an amazing professor. She knows her craft and she expects excellence. I do believe that she gives just way too much work even for herself to handle when grading. If you like to read lengthy articles then take this class. If you are taking a lot of credits, don't do it. Overall, this is a high-quality class with a lot of work.",1
"Favorite Professor I've had here at RVCC. Show up to class and participate (DON'T MUMBLE), and you'll do just fine. He is a hilarious guy and makes his lectures entertaining while being a great teacher at the same time. If I could take him for every Econ class I would. I highly recommend him.",1
"Really great prof. Go to class, know the stuff on the powerpoints, participate every once in a while.  Use the book and do the study guides, he gives you everything you need to get an A.  Really slow talker, but if you get past that he's excellent",1
Terrific course.,1
DO NOT TAKE HER! She gives a lot of assignments and takes a long time to grade them. She doesn't explain anything and never responds to emails. Plus a lot of presentations.,0
Best prof at X. Has a really dry sense of humour but the more you hear it the more hilarious he gets. If you have multiple classes with him/ go to office hours/ engage in class discussions life will be easier for you.,1
"computer science program is not that good, wasn't eager to help students, laughed at questions, and most notes were unclear",0
Crowley is a good instructor but I don't think his classes are designed for off campus students. His homeworks are extremely detailed and takes lots of time to do. I have a full time job and it took me over 40 hours to do for each homework. He also doesn't test the homeworks he gives on the server you need to complete the homework on.,0
"I can't even begin to describe this nightmare experience. Boring lectures. The tests are ridiculous, 75 questions but she didn't actually read the book. Mostly made up in her head. Second half switched to online due to covid. Refused to use canvas. Deadlines changed with no notice and all through her AOL email. Such a mess. AVOID at all costs.",0
Kelly Young is a great teacher. She has a way of explaining things that is simple and smart.  quizzes every class but they are open note and one answer comes from your homework.  The way she sets up her class is very organized and she is good at staying on schedule,1
"He is unresponsive to questions on piazza, doesnt post solutions to practice questions for assessments, refuses to post past finals with solutions, rushes through the material every lecture or leaves questions blank without even caring we understand or not, never curves marks when they are low, doesnt post solutions to any practice problems",0
I had him for 131 and I loved the way his class was structured so I decided to take him for 270. Never failed to make the class laugh and he is such a caring person.. He honestly wants all his students to pass the class and gives out occasional extra credit. You have to show up to class to get points and he basically only requires 2 major papers.,1
"He is such a sweetie. He likes to tell stories, he's great to talk to, and he often mentions that he doesn't wanna wake up early in the morning either so he'll let you go early to ""get coffee"" as he likes to say. Wait till the first class to buy the books. Definitely need the Blair Reader.",1
Tells you what you need to know and holds you to the syllabus requirements. Quizzes often; every two weeks. Also required reading of weekly news stories that were relevant to class. Very smart guy who has travelled the world and experienced in person most of the stuff he teaches . Need to work for an A but a B is very possible. Very engaging class.,1
"Her tests are all based on opinion, I memorized everything with none of it on the tests. Listen to her opinion thats all she cares about. Her lectures consist of random tangents. She has something against Christianity. If you are genuinely searching do not take it, if you need an easy A do not take it, if you can take anything else do not take it.",0
"Really nice guy, interesting class, long lectures, and he can be borderline stereotypical on some things which is really off-putting. That's the easiest way to find out who the immature students in class are. Otherwise, no big deal.",1
Very hard unless you read and work hard.  But he is one of the coolest profs i have had and is definately the most flexible and understanding.,1
"She's a super tough grader, and the exam is WAY too much to even handle. The best way to describe this class: anxiety attack. save yourself and your sanity. DONT TAKE HER",0
"Dr. Pietro by far has been a dream to receive lecture from. He is so passionate about his field that you will feel no other way than to love it just as much as he does. Unfortunately, that's as far as it goes. If you do all of the textbook homework without much difficulty that's fantastic but it doesn't cut it. Tests and exams are gruelling.",1
Paula was the best professor I have ever had. She was always involved in everything. She did not require a lot of work but she did expect you to be up to date on your reading.,1
Sharp is funny in class and has some good chemistry jokes. He only basis his grade on exams and quizzes which can make this class tough due to the low amount of points. It is math heavy class. He is helpful when you need it and provides you with equations.,1
"The class and I did not get along. I found the professor to be somewhat rude and uncaring. The course material was taught in a way that made it hard to balance his workload with other courses. Some of the readings (which there are a lot of) are lengthy and boring. Don't get me wrong- some of it was interesting, but wouldn't recommend the course.",0
I absolutely admire him so much. He's a really great guy and the class was not even that hard. All you do is do your assignments and boom you'll have a passing grade. The only thing is that there are 4 exams and you only need to pass 3/4 and they are a bit rough but you have time to prepare and you have his lectures so its time consuming but okay.,1
I was very impressed with Valor's knowledge and for everyone that had the class with me they will understand what I mean when I say I was also impressed with his Baddassary! Thank you for making this class fun. I would certainly recommend just take notes!!!,1
She is a great professor who makes it easy to succeed in a difficult subject. She shows you different ways to do things including how to do almost everything on your calculator and gives formulas on tests.,1
She is rude and talks to her students as if they are two year olds.  If you'd like to be in a constant stated of frustration and anger she's the professor for you!,0
"Olson's class from what I rememebr was my least favorite. And Im a history person. No color, all boring books, superficial explainations, weird hard tests. She NEVER would call on me.I hated my TA. Were graded ONLY on what we would absorb from the book. Hey is this college or like something else?Rambling, boring lectures about everything.",0
"If you have other hard classes, DO NOT TAKE HER! Absolutely too much work!",0
Professor Darby was a fantastic lecturer. He makes you learn. His repetition of important terms makes you realize themes and ideas in the readings that you never saw before. His course actually made me think more carefully about the things we take for granted in our world.  %30 grade was tutorial participation %30 final essay %40 final exam,1
Anne is a great professor that any and every English student should learn from at some point during their time at this school. She loves engaging in classroom discussions and is never unclear about what she expects from her students. She makes the classroom fun and is always looking for feedback from her students. She is a great professor!,1
Most amazing class - he is the most eloquent prof I have ever had. Attendance isn't mandatory but you do not want to miss his lectures. ,1
One of the most intelligent professors I have ever met. Slides have clear logic for students to follow. Definitely should take it if you wanna gain some real perspective in bio.,1
"If the class is in person, she provides clear lectures and goes through everything step by step. I actually enjoyed class. However, when class was switched online 4 covid, she completely changed. Completely uncaring and inflexible. Regardless of platform, there is hw every class, usually 3-5 questions, but each question has like 5-10 subquestions.",0
Professor Martin is kind and funny! She is energetic and not boring at all. She is understanding and makes you feel comfortable. I took her in Fall 2019. She reminds me of a fun aunt. There's not a lot of work she assigns but a couple of quizzes. You will have to work in groups sometimes and present speeches in class.,1
Awesome professor. Makes the material very interesting and gives clear criteria for grading. This is the best class I've taken so far.,1
"By far the best teacher to take Spec Mind with.  Hard to get a class with, but is well worth waiting 2 or 3 years to get.  Expect A's on all tests, but rougher grades on papers.",1
Professor Aronson is an extremely knowledgeable professor who will not only teach the material but incite and encourage thoughtful discussion on the subject matter. He explains everything very clearly and is more than ready to stop and explain in further detail if asked. He gives great lectures and has a great sense of humor. An overall great guy.,1
"The homework assignments are open all semester so you can do them all well in advance and save yourself some time. Every other day you go to the lab and do ""projects"" where you complete task on powerpoint, word or excel super easy. The textbook is not needed so save yourself some bucks however the cengage online program SAM you need for about $90.",1
"i dont recomended this teacher . a lots of student drop out end of the semester . his exam is out of book . no book uses in class . sop confusing the style of teaching. too much assignment . if you are talking more than two class ,don't take this teacher .",0
"SUPER easy!  You only have 2 exams and 2 short papers, so you must to well.  However, he grades the papers easily, and he reads the exams to you the day before and you get to have a notecard to use on the test.  Unexcused absenses mean you lose a letter grade, but just email him if you can't make it to class.  Highly recommend!",1
He is a rude teacher . Don't  take his class .,0
Professor Cooper is one of the best history teachers. He's well-read and knows what he's talking about. Quite a bit of reading but not terrible. Participate in class and you'll do fine. He can be blunt with students so know what your talking about when u raise your hand. He's a good teacher and and enjoys class time with his students.,1
Good Professor. Nice clarity. Very Good course to do. Go for it.,1
Horrible preparer for the future. Often made us figure out our own problems.,0
"The prior rating is not true. Prof. Is caring and if she doesnt explain is cuz she want us to be pro active between classmates. I honestly have to say that I probably not pass her class but was my fault for missing so many homeworks to turned in. If I have to take this class again I will do it with her. Shes very patient, helpful and fair. ��",1
"By far the worst and most boring teacher you can ever come across. His tests are impossible and he basically wants you to fail. Some multiple choice, then a bunch of fill in the blank vocal with words he never goes over, then open ended which he give you a 0/5 0r 0/10 no matter what you write. No homework other than reading for his terrible lecture",0
"So many things to be said in such little space. Don't take his class. Drop it while you still can. He knows physics, but he cannot teach physics. Everyday, he gave us a problem we never saw before, then he would leave the room for 15-30 minutes. He would come back, do the problem, give us a completely different problem and the leave again. avoidhim",0
"I got A's on every assignment and test but ended with a grade that did not represent that because I missed four classes out of the entire semester. Goodwin just likes to hear himself talk and his classes lectures get off topic every class. The material is extremely easy, but he is so unclear about assignments, I dreaded this class.",0
she hardly helped with any questions I asked over email. Her powerpoint lectures don't really help with the tests because she asks tough detailed questions from it. Her assignments are pretty straight forward but her interaction with students is poor so you have to be good with teaching yourself the material given,0
This class was made infinitely more difficult because theis professor has the bad habit of mumbling under his breathe and using ums and ahs all the time. He marks extremely harshly and makes questions worth more than they should be just so he can drop your grades. Which will happen!,0
"Overall, the experience was fine. Dr Ramp is very very helpful and will do everything he can so you do well. He seemed a little unorganized, but once he sorts everything out there is lots of detail. No tests, just a bunch of papers. There are multiple reading (around 100 pgs) per week.",1
he is very passionate about poetry and wants everyone to share in his excitement. class is mainly open discussion and it gets a little repetitive but it's really easy to pass,1
"I had Teresa for JRN 102 and JRN 220 in the Spring 2019 semester, she is a terrible teacher. There is no room for creativity or constructive criticism. It is very hard to please Mrs. Hernandez for she likes things done her way and her way only, she is very condecsending. I'm sure she's great outside of the classroom but it was a rough semester.",0
Lectures were fun and she definitely made the material interesting. Great teaching style and was obviously very knowledgable about the subject. She was very understanding when it came to grading work. Would definitely recommend taking.,1
"what an experience...i think the majority of the class could teach better than her.  She contradicted herself, the text, and most of the time her notes were so messed up you couldn't understand them.....NOT recommended",0
I have had Kubota sensei for several classes now and she definitely stands out as the best Japanese teacher at EMU. However she is very strict and sometimes brutally honest. If you can't handle that sort of thing don't take her class.,1
"If you wanna turn your life into a living HELL, please take this professor. Very rude and unfair. He thinks that his class is the only thing you got in life and you have all the time in the world to log in 100 times and do tons of homework, and yes teaching yourself. Will never ever take him again.",0
"Would not recommend taking this class unless you're a genuine masochist and like the ""grind"" of a more ""challenging"" class. It takes her paragraphs to describe simple physics concepts and the classwork isn't the same as the homework (20% of grade). Exams are partial credit though so if you have an idea of what you're doing you can pull a B.",0
"I just want to give Professor Halaka a big hug! She is the sweetest woman albeit maybe not the *best* teacher. Tended to rush through problems while talking at the board. Went over homework questions and quick, easy tests. She doesn't deduct points if you get a problem wrong she tries to give points wherever she can which saved my grade! Love her",1
"My favorite teacher at NCMC.  Funny, interesting, quirky.  Always with a smile and an off the wall outfit, Haight is a professor that knows his stuff and teaches it extremely well.  Some of the best NCMC has to offer.  It's been years since I had him as a teacher, but I still to this day remember his teachings and examples.  You HAVE to take him.",1
"Showed up late to almost every class, likes to hear himself talk and tends to ramble. Exams were easy as long as you studied and did the guide he gives you, show up for attendance points.",0
"great prof 
 quizes are easy 
 just watch the final exam
 :)",1
"While I feel I am learning a lot in this class, the workload is absolutely overwhelming. It's my lowest level class and it takes up so much of my time. The work is relevant, but repetitive and much of it is unnecessary. I took this class to work with students, but if I were to do it again I would have taken the on-campus option instead.",1
BEST MATH TEACHER OUT THERE! He cares so much about his students and what they need help with.,1
"Dr. Rose is really nice but he rushes through every lecture and going to class is pretty much pointless except for clicker points. He is really smart but is not good at teaching info. He will talk for 5 minutes on one slide about stuff you don't even need to know, and then end up rushing through the rest. There are also tests every week.",0
She is extremely ego driven...do your work and agree with everything she says and she'll pass you...not a very good teacher at all!!!!,0
"hello everyone don't take her class it's big mistake laguardia is doing big mistake to keeping her here and letting her teach psychology classes , she have attitude problem .",0
"Missad is by far the best professor I've ever had. Show up to class, participate, listen to instructions, hand in homework in time, and you have an A for this class in the bag. She is very quick at responding to emails, and appreciates a student who is not afraid to ask questions. Warmly recommend this professor. She's very intelligent & caring!",1
"I don't even know why they employ professors like Shin who have no job other than to enter grades. His lectures are useless. Imagine making students wake up for 8:30 classes to tell them how a mouse works. He makes you do very long assignments 4 times a week that sometimes takes hours. Class is easy to do well in, but he makes it terrible.",0
"He is a great teacher, gives you great feedbacks and can be accessed easily. Never saw him absent from his labs.",1
With having this pandemic going on I feel like this semester she did not care for her students. This class was extremely complicated with a lot of technical issues. I recommend taking this class with another professor.,0
"Grading rubric are non existent, marks are removed for arbitrary reasons (lost 20% for no make clear in makefile not specified in assignment or class) test feedback is non existent just a whole bunch of chicken scraps on crowdmark. Labs are a hot VM mess, assignments are unnecessarily time consuming. (He makes you hunt for information you need)",0
"A solid prof for sure. Lectures could be a bit boring but other than that they were fine. Topics were widespread and I had to study a lot to get a B+, so if you don't need to take this class and you're looking for an easy A this probably isn't the course.",1
I took Dr. Tulsian for Physics 1 and 2 with Calculus. He pretty much gives you the test questions and changes the numbers around. If you do the work it's a pretty easy class. If you don't do the work he'll still give you a C. You have to physically try to fail this class.,1
Don't take this class with this professor,0
"He's an excellent professor! He remembers everyone's name in the class and the course material isn't too hard for people without prereq. However, his lectures can be a little bit more on the tougher side along with the way he words various questions/assignments throughout the course.",1
He doesn't explain anything well and the entire grade was just based of the midterm and the final. Homework wasn't collected and quizzes don't affect grades. The tests ask for a lot of definitions and proofs and had way too many parts to finish in 1 hr. He doesn't communicate with his TAs properly so they don't know what is going on either.,0
"He's so full of himself.  His classes are boring, he gives evil glares if anyone so much as blows their nose in class, he's a bad and boring person to listen to.  Makes me want to skip every class just so I don't have to look at his face.",0
"Professor Lorelei seemed more like a friend than a professor, she makes class interesting even when she's lecturing. You have to buy one small book and write short papers on it- you are given question guidelines for the papers. This was my favorite class this semester, if you cant make it to class all you have to do is tell her before hand& its ok",1
"Donna is really a great teacher. She's traditional but can be really funny! She's very accommodating. She lets you pick between study guide or open book tests, gives test re-dos and great feedback. She hates people that don't try.",1
"Probably one of the best profs Ive had here. Yes, he is a very difficult prof, I've done pretty well in his courses, but not as much as I would like. Despite this however, I've never learned so much, or had so much motivation to learn with any other prof. Ramp truly cares about his students and does what he can to help them,",1
"Dude, whatever you do- DON'T cry in his office. I saw a few people who did, and it's so sad. I don't think this man pities anyone in particular, nothing but a FAIR and SQUARE guy.",1
He is a very patient professor. He always help students a lot. The lecture is very detailed. Recommend to take his class.,1
Will's a nice guy if you go to office hours but honestly the lectures were pretty pointless. The whole LFS250 course was super messy and so much work... but I felt like we didn't get much out of it. Definitely more TA dependent than prof. Cool beet tattoo though.,1
"Melanie is a great professor who really knows her stuff. Be prepared to read multiple poems, short stories, and a novel. Be prepared to participate in many group discussions that are in the shape of forums. She allows you to form articulate opinions and interpretations.  Course includes 4 essays and a good feedback/grading system. Overall, well ran",1
"If it is your goal to learn the science of nutrition, do not take this class - with this professor. Expect to find all of her test questions searchable on Quizlet (even the online midterm), and to be blindsided for the final. Personally, I know a lot about nutrition - A LOT, and I hoped to learn something here. Nope. She is a robot, sadly.",0
"She is amazing! Finds a way to make very complex ideas look simple. Going to class is a must! Though they were long (3 hours, 1 break) they are essential for understanding what's going on. She was unclear at first and forgot to send us the instructions for the assignments. Still, she is always available for students and gives great feedback",1
"Dr. Law is a very nice professor that I ever had, he treats students very kindly and even let them take quizzes at home which is very nice of him. Thats so sad that people dont show up until quiz session or they leave early or dont pay attention during the lecture! Hes so respectful to me and I think students should respect him a lot.",1
"This guy should have justed stay with research & developing patents. He is a very terrible professor & rude! Just because you have a PhD, doesn't mean you should be allowed to teach. He constantly goes off topic & rambles on about random stuff--not chemistry related. If you are a serious science student, don't go to SRU--its a waste of your money.",0
"Awesome Professor! Makes the lectures fun and interesting, tests are very fair and pretty straightforward, labs are very lenient and he cancels them pretty often, and is very lenient when it comes to grading. I didn't take any notes but went to every class and got an A. I just looked over the power points few days before test and I was set",1
Really good teacher can help you if you ask and always makes sure you understand what is happening in class,1
"Good prof, He is old fashion and doesn't use lecture slides. Exams are more then fair, he supplies you with a short list of possible short essay questions for review and chooses a select few of those exact questions to be on the exams. Create a google docs with everyone in the class and this course is a easy 80!",1
"She lectures RIGHT off of her slides, but includes photos/maps that she refuses to put on D2L so they're inaccessible. Her lectures are the driest I've been to, even though the material is interesting. I had to be 3+ cups of coffee in to not fall asleep during this class.. Save your money and time; avoid this prof like the plague.",0
"Just awful. Literally like a robot with no interaction with the students at all. She knew none of our names, didn't take any attendance, and our entire grade was based on one final paper. Easy to skip class because she took no notice. Depressing for people who love to discuss books. ",0
This class was extremely easy and he's a great teacher.,1
"He has a thick accent and is hard to understand, especially when he is rushing through the chapters to get it over and done with. I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND HIM. Dr. Ba is a knowledgable man and knows his stuff BUT he is deff not the one to teach.I might as well have taken a hybrid class.Also don't be surprise if he gets fustrated if u ask questions",0
Class is literally only 4 tests. He is hard to understand and very old! I would not recommend this class to anyone.,0
"Not great... Her online course is all busy work and she is SO picky when it comes to grading. Every assignment is just re-wording info from the textbook and it takes forever. Also - I don't think she knows proper grammar. The ""corrections"" she makes on assignments aren't actually correct, and she makes plenty of typos herself.",0
Do not take this class. He gives unclear direction and he really needs to retire. He doesn't teach at all he just passes out assignments with directions on them . He grades very harsh but he lets you re do the assignment as many times as you want. Assignments are easy but kind of lengthy. I got a B(barely) . Stressful class,0
Awesome!!!  Highly recommend the course.  2 observations a little out of the comfort zone but attainable.  Great discussion board topics and easy final!  Easy A if you do the work.  Professor is professional and easy to contact.,1
"Don't take him if you have little knowledge of programming before this class. He expects you to come into it knowing everything. He does not answer questions or actually teach anything, his lectures are extremely confusing and fast-paced. He disrespects students. He is VERY intimidating. Don't take him if you want to keep your self-esteem intact.",0
"Class was very hard for me. the pace was insane learn close to over 600 words in a semester. I also had no language background. But she is a wonderful professor. the material hard, but she does everything she can to make it manageable",1
"Yikes. This guy has no clue whats happening. Dont know how hes still teaching, but we dont have to wear goggles in chem lab which is a plus. Show up and get anA",0
Prof Nelson is a very sweet person. She does give lots of homework but its super easy to do and its to prepare you for the tests and lectures. Her class is very easy and towards the end of the semester she gives out lots of in class extra credit.,1
"Dr. Shing could barely explain any of the concepts in this class. He rambles often and is difficult to understand. If by some miracle you can understand him, he is still very difficult to follow for an extended period. The course material itself is not very difficult - it is just difficult to understand with him teaching it. I learned nothing.",0
"WORSE PROFESSOR EVER!!!!! Do not take him unless you have a strong background in math. Took him for algebra II and it was the worse experience. His class lectures are confusing, he gets an attitude when students ask questions, and he has a strong accent which makes it difficult to understand him.",0
She teaches  like she thinks that history is your only class you are taking.  The readings for each class are at least 30 pages long and you have to know all about it. She gives you what is gonna be on the midterm but there are about 53 terms and 4 essays to define. She narrows it down but it is too difficult. Dont take her or you will regret it.,0
"of the 4 required crim classes, this was by far my favourite! (i took it dis-ed). it wasn't as hard as i had expected, and i thought the readings were interesting. i really liked this class... probably because i got to write an academic paper about graffiti!",1
"Grading is based almost completely on in-class group work, so even one absence can really affect your grade. She teaches this class like it is a review - so if you need things to be explained, take a different professor. She also seems to favor teaching older adults, and had made rude remarks based on her own stereotype of young college students.",1
"Essay exams and one 10-page paper due at end of class. Only 100 points total and a 96 to get an A. A few extra credit opportunities, TAKE THESE. For exams, give background of the topic AND what was talked about in class to get an A. Pretty much just pray that she picks the prompt you prepared best for. This was my most difficult A yet so beware.",1
He is a clear communicator with a well prepared structure to his lectures. Asks for class ideas a lot and gets discussions going. Definitely need to take good notes and study to do well on the tests. Full class session reviews before tests. Your expected to study and know all the material. Two papers. Good extra credit opportunities. Great teacher.,1
"Its a Math class, so theres lots of homework. thats just part of the deal. But she teaches in a very clear, easy to understand way, and gets things graded fairly quickly. I really enjoyed the class and i would love to take more of her courses.",1
"Plank is a great professor, she really delivers the small school Pepperdine experience that everyone talks about. Her tests are no joke and believe her when she says you need to study as you go and not cram. The best thing I ever did was record class and listen to it while filling out my study guides. All of the information is NOT in the book.",1
Overall he is one of the better profs that I have had. Local Gov. in Ontario is an interesting class. He has a mandatory 20-25 min presentation that he doesn't make exceptions for and grades in a professional manner. The written assignments look easy from the outside (don't fall for it). I also believe he secretly grades based off attendance.,1
Simply: He is a great professor.,1
"Doc is by far the most caring, thoughtful professor I have ever encountered. He truly understands his students and helps out when he can. He relates all his lectures to real world experiences and has a multitude of knowledge to share. Don't hesitate to call him as he will always answer!",1
"She is a mean, cruel individual who does not care about students at all. She makes the class much harder than it should be. Overall, the worst and meanest professor I have ever experienced.",0
alright,0
A blessing.,1
He goes through 2 white board markers in a lecture. Sometimes confusing if you do not follow with the pdf that he provides. He covers exactly what is on the pdf book and the exams are pretty much like what he goes over in class.  I would say this class isn't hard. He is very helpful in office hours. Tough grader. Not a bad professor. ,1
"Prof Winnik is nice although he goes pretty fast in lectures and sometimes goes off-topic or mumbles. Because of this, it was very difficult for me to understand his part of the material.",0
worst class I ever had. so rude to students. very unclear about homework and lectures. just all together awful. can't wait to never have him again,0
"Very wonderful teacher and person. Firm, but fair! I adore her!!!",1
"Attendance is completely optional, which is really nice. In the beginning I would go to class, but I realized that just watching the videos online was more time efficient. The homework's are definitely time consuming, but I like how he ran his class overall.",0
"Be smart and avoid her. I dislike Rousinnova, but she is better in design. I regret having to take Pusca next year.",0
"would for sure recommend this professor to anyone who needs this credit. writing of course, discussion boards, peer reviewing and some reading. VERY helpful and VERY fast at responding to your emails even when on a school break/holidays. Gives good feedback, if you put in effort you'll get the grade. difficulty is not very high but you do learn",1
"Lectures are based in theory not in what will be on test. Homework isn't graded, first time you are graded on your work is on quizzes and tests. Heavy grader in this area. Four years at this school and I've never felt so cheated by a course. Hard material, unnecessarily hard class. Unstable office hours. If you get in, usually critical of semantics",0
"Joel is honestly such a sweetheart. The guy literally gives you the syllabus and tells you everything you need to do to get an A in the course. He wants his students to succeed. Although it may be a lot of work and overwhelming at first, it isn't that bad and you put the work in for the grade you want. The speeches were honestly cake.",1
Read everything you are assigned to and write your quotes. write a couple of papers and a group project and a group project is all that you have to do.It might sound easy but it is very time consuming.  You have to work for you grade.  It was a great class as long as you take part in the class. Wish i could take the class again!,1
"Very good teacher and explains things clearly. If you get the chance to be in his class, take him. I wish he was teaching programming next semester.",1
"horrible teacher.  no room for creativity. wants perfection every time, her way or no way.  she will shoot down your ideas in a second.  i would stab myself in the eye before having her for a teacher.",0
"Professor Hardgrove comes across as a teacher who could care less to answer questions or clarify course content, in fact, she portrays it as a burden. If you are having trouble understanding a particular section she will not give positive feedback to help you understand. Assignments are long and tedious.",0
"His class is a nightmare, everything he teaches you dont need to know. But everything he says 1 time write that down! Its gunna be on the test! His review covers 10% of whats on the test even though he says at the end of his review thats everything on the test. His hand writing is awful and labs good luck figuring it out yourself.",0
"Interesting SW perspectives, likes to lecture and hold center stage. Ignored some students. Neutral about ideas presented, which makes people feel safe about their ideas. Likes feedback re course and puts it into practise. Very enthusiastic about SW.",1
"Worst professor I've ever had! She is unorganized, very prejudice, boring, and thinks her beliefs are the ultimate answertruth. It's ironic how she is supposed to be teaching an ethics course, but does not practice personal moral behavior. Also, DO NOT BUY THE BOOK. All of the readings can be found online in some capacity.",0
Horibble that is all I can see. Bring a pillow,0
"I looked forward to going to lectures, she's hilarious and knows what she's talking about. Weekly readings and journals, sometimes the readings are long but if you have a basic understanding of the topic your journals will be fine. I struggled a little with the midterm, but she tells you what to expect from it!",1
"Dr. Fischer is misunderstood by lazy students who don't want to put any effort into learning. He is a wealth of information on many different subjects in psychology, and he genuinely cares about his students. Yes, he talks fast, and yes, sometimes he goes off on tangents. However, he really wants you to learn the material and offers lots of EC.",1
worst class i took at uci,0
"Dr. Honts is an expert in the use of the polygraph. His lectures show his expertise. However, class materials are 10-15 years old and out of date. You're graded on 3 quizzes and two exams with no extra credit available. If you need to reach him, don't expect quick responses to emails. Exam and quiz questions are ambiguous and worded to confuse you.",0
Quizzes are impossible to get perfect scores which brings your grade down dramatically since they are weighted so much. The exams have a super low average because they are impossible. SAP homework is the easiest thing and it is still annoying. Avoid this class in general.,0
awesome class,1
Dr. Teaford was the BEST teacher I ever had in my entire educational career and I am a teacher now because of HIM!  He made history come to life and is one that I will always remember.  Class was at 7:30 AM and I usually met him at 6 to have breakfast with him.  He was incredibly inspiring and brought out my best.  GOD BLESS JON TEAFORD!,1
"Thompson is easily one of the worst professors I’ve had during my time at LCC. Her lectures are pointless. I ended up having to teach myself. The class itself isn’t hard, but it is not worth it having to put up with her for an entire semester. If you need a social science credit, I recommend you take anything else but this.",0
Avoid him total jerk,0
He wants his students to stay within his knowledge. does not want you to explore new possibilities. always discourages new ideas.,0
This class was way too difficult. I have taken many psych courses here and this is one of the hardest. I'm a straight A student and I will be lucky to pass this class with a c+,0
"A last resort prof. His theory class/ lectures are not sufficient, and the only way to pass is to avoid relying on the lecture.",0
DO NOT TAKE HIM!! He over complicates math and makes it so hard to understand. Homework given is not what we cover in class and by the time you get to the test you are so confused. He wants you to do math his way and if you don't he will mark it wrong and take off a lot of points. If you are not good at math do not take Professor Bahri,0
"Funniest guy ever. I was not sure if I wanted to take the class but I could not stop laughing because he's so funny! He is always there if you need help, and is really easy to talk to. I am really big on asking questions and he was always good with clarifying.",1
"Horrible prof. I hated it. Only contact were reminders of week #. Lectures are barely helpful & all reading on your own. Decent study guides. Map exams easy, just practice. Exam 3/4 were hard, exam 5 easy. Quizlets already made - have answers on them. Exams are proctored. Final is essay Q's, do a couple a week so you'll be done early!!! No EC :(((",0
"J'ai adoré ce cours! Pour chacun des trois modules, il y a environ 3 films à regarder (tous très bons) et quelques courtes lectures à faire. Je recommande de regarder tous les films et de prendre des notes car elles seront utiles pour écrire les 3 dissertations. Ce cours est parfait pour en apprendre plus sur l'héritage des canadiens-français.",1
Eve is the type of professor that teaches out of her own book. You will have a paper due about every few days. Very few feedback and mostly graded by TA. Class is out of 100 points so every point counts. Offers extra credit for speaking in front of class so use that to your advantage. Otherwise the class is so boring and long. Would not recommend.,0
"If I had the choice to drop I would.  rude. He is always discussing his own views and will pounce on anyone who thinks he is wrong. He is always talking off topic, in fact I don't even know what he talks about because his lecture is everywhere. Does not expalin his projects and just makes it hard for you to focus. You will learn more from the text",0
shows interest in students who know how to draw already. Do not take with a full time schedule (i.e. 12 cr or more) She demands alot for an intro drawing would not recommend her to others (unless you love strict professors by all means.....),0
"There's nothing wrong with him as a person. He is clearly educated, smart, and knows his information. But his lectures are long, slow, and a bit monotone. He is very strict, which I'm normally fine with, but he's not great at communication, giving or receiving, which isn't a good combo. Gives little explanation to assignments, inflexible.",0
Religion and Politics with him was a mistake. Don't take that as your THEP requirement. Makes you buy 7 books (none are ever necessary to use) and has two in class essays and one paper which he grades with difficulty(very hard to get an A). If you are looking to get a good grade (since its a non-required elective) I would not reccomend this class.,0
"Tests are harder than any homework or anything seen before. Likes to test on theory. Have Matlab assignments that are nearly impossible and she is not much help because she wants you to figure it out on your own, with very little instruction. Avoid if possible.",0
"I am rating him while listening to his lecture right now.
 
 The course is absolutely NOT recommended for those who are considering to take it for thier electives. Go take some other courses. He is brutal",0
Zoran was funny and engaging but quiet and hard to hear at times. Overall great guy but try to sit near the front to hear him.,1
"This was my first history course and it inspired me to pursue a history minor. Professor Bob Senkewicz is always there for his students to clarify readings, give detailed feedback on papers, and share advice for students interested in pursuing a career with history. You must always read to be prepared for lectures and quizzes. Would take him again!",1
"Dr. Crawford is a tough professor, but is very helpful and approachable. Never be afraid to go to his office hours or to email him or just drop by his office and see if he's available. He expects a lot from his students, but he gives very extensive study guides and encourages people to ask questions. Be prepared to ask questions, and you'll do fine",1
"Doesn't post lecture slides, nor does he use any in class. Lectures consist of hour long rants with little to no guidance on what the lecture is covering. Beyond these short comings, he is very passionate about his area of study, and has great insight into the topic at hand, but could use a kick-in-the-rear to use more modern teaching methods. ",0
She's not the worst but she's not great. She is the hardest person to get a hold of and she never gets back with you. If you don't have to don't take her.,1
"A very good professor, it's a shame he's wasted on the lazy idiots at Villanova. Amusing Russian accent, but his English is fine.",1
"This professor is a very arrogant man. I will admit that he does have a lot of knowledge about this stuff and is passionate about it, he expects that we know everything perfectly like he does. He appears to be annoyed by questions. He is extremely hard. This is only a 3 credit class with the work load of a grad school class. IMPOSSIBLE!",0
Lectures are always interesting and well organized. Likes class participation but it doesn't guarantee you a good grade. Tough marker but her suggestions will make you a better writer. Be prepared to put a lot of work into assignments if you want to do well. Essay/exam topics come directly from class discussion so read the books and go to class.,1
"Zero notes are posted online so you better go to the lectures. Which barely helps because his handwriting sucks and skips half the process of a question by saying ""and then after doing math, you get this"". Midterm was alright, final exam was tough. A lot of students failed but just attempt to answer everything and you'll get enough part marks.",0
"take someone else, avoid him!",0
"He is very unhelpful when you ask him questions. He only leaves negative feedback on papers. I agree. He scolds creativity, which is interesting since he is constantly asking you for your ""opinion."" He is not that smart, he just knows how to regurgitate other people's ideas.",0
"Okay, now THIS is Epic.",1
"Dr Bohanan is a brilliant professor that knows her material inside and out. To get an A just go to class and take good notes, study the highlighted words from the book for each test, and read the sections of the book that she mentions. Her class is based off of four tests, so just pay attention and you'll learn a lot from her.",1
"You have to go to class, as each class has assignments you get and do in class. Extremely hard class as you have a homework assignment every class and the labs in class she won't really help you with. She really cares about her students and wants to inform them, but this class will be a big test of your consistency and IQ. 2 A's were earned.",0
Professor Kelly did an excellent job making all the material flow together. This is essential when taking an online course because of the limited interaction with the professor. She made everything clear and she he give constructive feed back to help you with your assignements. It was a challenging online class but DOABLE. I enjoyed this class!,1
"Professor Heap is extremely intelligent; he has great analogies in his lectures. But it will be the hardest class of your semester. I only received a B after reading the textbook every night, going to office hours weekly, and attending the review sessions. If youre willing to do the work youll be ok.",1
"Very good!!! Love her! she does everything right! She is so good she knows what she talking about, honestly learned so much, all you need to do is just pay attention!!",1
"Alan is extremely helpful, although his lectures are very dry and he does mumble. He is the most caring prof I have ever had as a 4th year student, he will do almost anything to see you succeed in the class. His tests are tricky but the amount of free credit you get from pass/fail assignments and bonus questions is worth it",1
Has a huge ego for mediocre teaching at best. He rushed through the curriculum. He makes stale jokes. Would shut kids down during class if they asked a question he didn't like. He had a few helpful tricks but overall not a good teacher. You have to teach yourself if you want to pass the class.,0
i loved his class! i would recommend him for intro phil! you will love it! i promise!,1
"As long as you agree with everything she says IN REGARDS TO US POLITICS, you'll pass. Say one thing she doesn't agree with and you're out. She is very sarcastic towards students who question her political opinions which she pushes on students. This isn't a speech class. It's a let-me-shove-my-political-opinions-in-your-face class.",0
"Professor Baez class consisted him of going over powerpoints in class then assigning homework through saplinglearning. Here the homework consisted of mostly multi choice questions you can find online. There was one midterm, one final, one research project and overall it was a great class and I learned a lot about economics!",1
"He is not the worst teacher. He gives a lot of busy work and grades it very specifically. He'll do a minus .1 here, minus .3 there, it does not make sense. If you skip class you have to make up the work, even if its group work, you'll have to do it on your own. He does not care about due dates, turn things in whenever. But warning, he's so boring.",1
Even though you have to do a lot of public speaking I absolutly LOVED this class. She is so easy and very understanding however she will bust ur balls here and there. but i loved this class and would recomend her to anyone because she is awesome.,1
"Very concise lectures, they make great study notes. However I did not enjoy him, he can be very arrogant.  Favours some over others, I would never want to take a class with him again.",0
"Tests and quizzes are ok tells you what you need to know. On the final gave a list to study for and went over it, but then had stuff we never covered on it. class is pointless but participation does matter.",0
"Great professor! Clear and straightforward with assignments. Actually has thought-provoking, in-depth discussion questions compared to many other online family studies classes. I'd definitely recommend taking a course from her!",1
"thinks over half the class failing is good, rude, condescending, do not take.",0
Avoid!,0
"I really like this professor. He genuinly cares about you, I would highly recommend you take him. Also study for this class through the textbook. I really enjoyed this class.",1
Explanations are not clear. Powerpoints suck. really hard to pay attention through boring lectures. Cheat sheets are not helpful. Test questions are worded tricky,1
"We only had class twice a week (instead of the scheduled three) because the project is 49% of the grade, but the result was that barely any class time was spent on the material, even though the majority of the textbook was assigned. He changed the project guidelines every time he was asked about them and there was no syllabus for the course. Avoid.",0
"A lot of people give him crap, but his lectures were some of the most interesting ones I have attended while in college. He cares so much about the subject and the student's success. He wants you to understand the material, not just memorize some multiple-choice questions. If you can talk well about a concept, then you should do fine on the tests.",1
Very helpful prof. Fair. Course is not as easy as it was in previous years. Everyone did fairly well at the end due to easy marking by prof/TA.,1
"I have had Dr. Brown for TEC 110, TEC 211, TEC 217, and TEC 317. He is by far my favorite teacher. He is very easy to understand, funny, and knows how to get you prepared for the real world.",1
"overall nice professor, and he really likes to ask if you have any questions...about anything.",1
I had Patty back in 2001-2002 and I agree with all the comments that she is a tough marker. I had to take her classes since they were compulsory courses. She's a great lady but get ready to work really hard for a max grade of 72 or 73. I wonder if anyone could honestly comment that they received an A in her class?,1
"Its not impossible to get an A but you have to work extremely hard. Lots of hw, quizzes, and exams. Prof rambles so I had to watch countless YouTube videos, read other sources outside of textbook to teach myself the material. Final avg was 55% and no curve. I ended up learning a lot bc of the work I put in, not bc of him.",0
Knows his subject so well. Teaches his class so clear.,1
"I loved this class!  Everything was clear, just make sure you keep up with the homework on the syllabus.  You can hand it in whenever you want. but she won't announce it.  Tests were very fair, and overall I really enjoyed this class.  Would recommend Madame Poindexter to anyone!! Such a nice lady and great at teaching!",1
Knows his stuff but does not do a very good job teaching it. He is willing to repeatedly go over same things until most students understand. Tough papers and exams. Hard grader.,0
"Dr. Pearl is a great professor who really knows what he is talking about. I never had a problem understanding music theory in his class. However, for the course in general, it is advantageous to have some background before diving in.",1
"I have taken his class before, and he used to be laid back and pleasant. Now, not so much.",1
"give low really grade on lab report although u have 20 pages, barely can hear him, never ever c/p someone's work on ur report even though u only use  5% out of ur entire work, he considers it's cheating, and report to university. over all he is easy but mean.",0
"By far the worst Prof. I have ever had.  She's rude, and ignorant.  I dislike this person on a personal level after taking her class.  If you need this class for anything put it off until you dont have to take her!  You've been warned!",0
Best prof in Chem Eng Department,1
This class was the completely opposite of what I was expecting when I enrolled in the Alpha program. I wish I took another class instead of this one because at the end of the semester nothing she taught was relevant. The plus of this class is that every thursday she buys pizza for the class which is a nice treat.,0
sometimes she shows up.,0
"She is really nice, but she is not a good teacher. If you can self- teach yourself this might be the class for you. Attendance is mandatory! She gives actual written test which are extremely hard.  Class was fun at first but the class had too many students so it was hard for her to help people. Most people dropped the class. ",0
Beware! Avoid her. Critical and harsh comments. Fails to provide guidance but holds learnes accountable for info. does not go over. Grades harshly. I got an A and a 4.0 GPA still. Never take her again. Beware!,0
"Most unorganized teacher i have ever had. She gets her due dates mixed up in between the different sections, then often pushes the due date back anyways. Often tells one student one thing, and another student something completely different on the same assignment. Just a very frustrating course overall. She will only like you if you suck up.",0
Very knowledgeable; kept discussions interesting;gave feedback on our work,1
"He's definitely a fair guy, but a very strict grader. If he catches you plagiarizing or anywhere close to it, it's over. He gives in class essays, which are fine, but grades quite strictly on them. Would I take him again? Nope. Also, I didn't learn anything from his class. We did use a text book for maybe half of the semester. Overall, avoid.  ",0
"If you're someone without a life, a job, and a family and you have nothing better to do than study this is the class for you!!! You can spend hours upon hours studying, thinking you know every thing there is to know about it and you'll still do horribly on her impossible exams. Don't miss a lab! 6% auto deducted. ONLY positive: great curver!",0
very laid back teacher!!highly recomend him for a summer class! i really enjoyed talking with him and im super glad i took this class with him.... no one would have been better!!!!,1
he grades so hard and his lectures make calc 2 so much more complicated than it should be,1
Participation is CRUCIAL to your grade. Prof. Guttmann is really passionate about his work. There's a midterm and a final. Weekly aplia and DB is mandatory. As long as you do your work and take good notes you will be fine. I barley studied and never read the txt book. Type your class notes for DB and do extra credit when he offers it!,1
Starkman is terrible. He spends all of lecture discussing things that you dont have for homework or on tests or quizzes. His tests cover material he never teaches and then he gets mad at his students for doing poorly. Maybe he needs to get upset with himself for teaching poorly.,0
"Easy lectures to follow & posts the pptx on Canvas before tests. She has reading quizzes on the readings every once in a while, nothing to worry about, 3 pts and are easy if you did the reading. The tests aren't an easy A, but aren't hard either and there's extra credit at the end. I haven't tried much and I have a B+/A-, you don't know your grade",1
"Worst communicator I've ever encountered in my lifetime. Monotonous, repetitive, stuttery and generally unclear. Absolutely no ability to connect with an audience. Awful, awful, awful. Worst final ever written.",0
"Very laid-back prof who really cares about helping students. Always available for a demo or any other kind of help, the only problem is that he's usually helping like 10 people at once! Knows his subject very well. There are two major critiques and an easy paper.",1
"Intelligent, kind & passionate about his work. But unfortunately pretty unprofessional. Online school has its learning curves but he forgot to include half the class on his email list for the first 3 weeks of school. (it was a cross listed course - forgot to email math students). Left us missing nearly a month of Q&As. Slides always full of errors.",0
"He's a nice guy, but he doesn't care about students at all.  If you go to see him for help he pretty much asks you to leave.  You are a nuisance to his research.",0
"Horrible teacher. Biggest B*$%#. Not helpful.  Looses work.  Does not want her students to succeed. Truly needs to be fired.  WVC should have no place for teachers like her, she brings the whole school down.",0
"By far the most unorganized teacher I have ever had. Out of the whole, part of the test is pretty legit and things we talked about and another part is just a bunch of stuff we didn't even talk about or not important in contrast to the material. I must admit, worst class I have taken at MSU.",0
Found lectures very hard to stay alert/pay attention. Lectures basically restated the reading material and covered the same few points over and over. If you zoned out for more than a few seconds you would be lost for several minutes. Tutorials/TAs were the best part (attendance mandatory for those),1
"Best teacher ever period. No mandatory attandance. HW collection at the end of semester. Easy tests. Helpful, not extremely but cares about students. very organized. TAKE IT! Textbooks and her own labbook required.",1
Amazing professor...people who rate him poorly are either lazy or foolish or perhaps just easily intimidated.  His desire to help is students is genuine and his commitment to their success is way beyond the typical Saint Vincent College Professor.,1
Extremely passionate about the subject matter. Turned what could be a very boring class into an interesting narrative each class. Thoughtfully executed discussions led to a comprehensible understanding of the subject matter. The discussion response are easy. The main paper is not hard if you do not procrastinate. The midterm and final are easy too.,1
This professor was awful. Tests are hard and he does not give good feedback.,0
"This man definitely deserves 5 stars. He makes statistics really easy and he spends a lot of time reviewing for the exams. He has somewhat of a heavy accent but if you give him a chance you'll be alright. His only rule to pass, is to show up to class. That's important because he goes over everything u need to know",1
He creates a very unwelcoming environment. There's two professors who teach this class and both do a terrible job explaining the material. Hough doesn't even teach the class yet he's considered a professor. During office hours he comes off as very rude and makes you feel dumb for asking certain questions. He does not care about his students,0
you should  see that clear in  the class,0
To start honestly one of the worst professors I've ever had. He is one of the world's toughest graders ever. If you ask for help he will give a very sarcastic response. Very rude for absolutely no reason. I ask him for an example of how he wanted a paper to look like and he gave the most sarcastic response ever. Not worth taking for the credit.,0
"Very knowledgeable on the subject matter, but a VERY slow grader. She works on her own grading system so for most of the semester you will only have 2/10 grades in. The study guides she prepares are very lengthy and so not like up with her lectures. All around not a bad class. Attendance not mandatory, but you will miss a lot of content.",1
Very difficult class. Took Contemporary Literature with him and struggled a lot. Tried to get help outside of class and still couldnt understand what he was trying to teach me.,0
"Sex & Evolution sounded interesting, but was SO boring. Weekly quizzes on TONS of reading were impossible and worth 50% of your grade. You'll only do well on them if you share the same opinions as him-- but you don't know his opinions until after you take the quiz. No makeups on missed quizzes, even if you have an emergency. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!",0
Do homework. All classes are interesting.,1
"She's terrible at teaching and she yells at people for no reason at all. Spends lots of time complaining and insulting the class. NEVER take her class, given an alternative.",0
"She is extremely nice and more than willing to answer any questions or concerns pertaining to the subject at hand.  Her lectures can be sometimes tedious, but certain chapters can be quite interesting if not helpful. The videos are great. Word of advice, write notes during class, complete the learning objectives and I guarantee you will get an A.",1
"Very kind professor that makes the subject of geography accessible to everyone. I came in with no prior knowledge of physical geography and he was super helpful. Make sure to go to class as much as possible even though it isn't mandatory, because a lot of test information is in his lectures.",1
A terrible instructor. You have to do it 'his way' or he marks it wrong. I got the correct answer and another instructor said my method was fine.,0
3 tests count for 50% of total grade. Was worried but the practice tests are exactly the same as the actual tests. Fine workload with multiple attempts allowed on homework and quizzes. Uses Thinkwell instead of a textbook. Material is taught concisely and well. Prof was understanding through emails. Probably the best math class I've ever taken.,1
"Very hard to understand, and very fast paced talker. Hard to follow what she is saying and I cant stand this teacher. I took her on accident and I hated her class. Regret doing it . Do not take her class.",0
So cool and so hot. He is very helpful to students and vivid examples to explain principles. A very good professor!,1
Her feedback and super helpful and does a nice job of stating the pro and cons of your piece. Gives a decent amount of studio time in class but still a good amount of lecturing too. Tends to pick favorites and gives a lot of homework. Also you have to check your emails and blackboard to be clear of the assignments and homework,1
"Dr. Mike is easily my favorite professor from my freshman year.  I had him for both BIOL 1105-1106 and he never failed me, even when I almost failed him. The material is tough, but thats not his fault because he give you more than enough material to work with and practice from to get a good grade. Participate, do pre-class quizzes, & activities!!",1
Higurashi Sensei only cares about the students who are already good at Japanese and not the ones who are actually learning it from the start. Native Japanese speakers who learned from their parents or students who are good at it without studying a lot are loved and respected. Anyone else she doesn't care. That's not what being a teacher is about.,0
exams tough. Don't be late in exams. ,1
Terrible. Here is someone who (which he openly admits) couldn't make it in corporate america and decided to become a professor. Another profession he is terrible at. Peffer belongs at the university of phoenix teaching a subject other than accounting.,0
HA!! Try research methods. she is strict and demanding (but still fun),1
"Nice guy. However, if you take no other warning take this one. When he says that ""if you are able to do the homework, you will do fine on the test."" -- Just know that is a complete and utter lie. The tests are 50x harder than anything he gives for homework or does in class. If you have not had calc before I would recomend another prof.",0
This professor is very boring and does not stay on topic during lectures.  Tests are somewhat difficult you will need to study.  I do not recommend him at all.,0
"The online homework was easier to understand than the lectures. As caring as he seems to be, there was no belief in me to pass the class after failing the first exam. Great person, awful instructor. Doing the tutoring, extra help during office hours, and testing accommodations did nothing to help understand.",0
"One of my favorite math professors at Trinity, I was never bored in his class. His tests are not terrible, as long as you work the practice problems he gives out and pay attention in class. He is a kind, funny guy and is very understanding and helpful if you are struggling.",1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE WITH HIM. I am an above average student with a 3.5 GPA in the COEDU. I have never dropped a course or recieved lower than a B in any course. I struggled with his class from the beginning of the semester, emailed him several times looking for help, he was very rude and did nothing to help me. I had to drop his class midsmster",0
Derek is an extremely personable professor. He also graduated from UE so he consistently maintains a difficulty level on par with other courses. He is also very helpful and will do his best to answer any questions you have.,1
"Professor Lewis is great. His exams are long, but he pulls all his questions from previous exams, which you go over, and other worksheets from class. He explains everything thoroughly, which can get a bit boring if you have good knowledge of calculus. If you do the work an A is definitely possible. Take him if you can.",1
"Minimal textbook use. Had 5 writing assignments the whole year. TOUGH GRADER!!! She was very boring, but provided some good insight with a few lessons she explained. Easy class to pass. She allows you to miss class and encourages you to take an""emotional day"" to yourself. Overall, average teacher. Pretty boring & would take her again. She's chill.",1
His multiple choice doesn't relate to what he is teaching!,1
"GOOD prof, try to attend class because what she says sometimes helps in the exams. I felt that she really wanted everyone to do well and she tried to help in anyway she could. There is a lot of reading to be done so be ready for that",1
I severely dislike this teacher for his lack of effort and bad attitude. Also doesn't respond to any emails even though I emailed him over and over,0
"If you want an easy A take him!! Also, it helps if you're an attractive female. I went to about three or four classes the whole semester, failed just about every test, and somehow received an A. It's almost impossible to get a bad grade in this class. And he gives a lot of extra credit just in case you feel you may need it.",1
"She has the most horrible slides, not informative at all and in ugly format. Her lectures is so boring and she makes mistake in almost every lectures. also she doesn't seems to care for the students and doesn't really answer your questions.",0
Material is difficult.  Very limited opportunities to help grade.  Failure in one exam meant failure in the class.  He graded on a straight percentage.  He promised that he would curve on a test because at least 15 students scored below the class average.  He never did.  Some of the questions did not reflect what was discussed in class.,0
He's a nice caring professor but his class is very boring. He takes attendance at the end so if you leave halfway through the class he doesn't give you credit. He can make a 30 min powerpoint last 1.5 hours.,1
Excellent proffessor. Very clear. Very interesting. Lots of energy. Id recommend for anybody.,1
"Like many of the professors this year, Dr. Apelblat did not make the course suitable for online learning. All I saw were a few emails from him. The bare minimum a student should expect for Chem labs is a video on what's happening and there was only one video for the entire semester!",0
"If you get him for this class and can't switch, unless you need to take this class, just drop it. The class is unnecessarily difficult and its not worth taking as a GE. I was panicked because I started this class at a D+ but then he started grading easier. The only grades are 7 tests but he drops the lowest one. TAKE GOOD NOTES!",0
"Want to learn about communication theories? Don't take this class. I learned about other classes who talked about ACTUAL theories. Not here. He makes you read philosophical articles and then the talks about them the whole class period. Can be interesting, but should be in philosophy, not communication. ",0
Out to prove that alternative lifestyles our cool at Christian Universities. Not a very scholarly prof.,0
"Dr. Shahrava has a very good understanding of what he does and has the potential to be a great professor, but his lack of organization or communication makes understanding his lectures impossible. Reading the textbook will usually save you with profs like this, too bad the exam questions are pulled from concepts in his lectures and not the book.",0
She's incredibly mean and selfish.,0
"Had Tiggy for Span 308, which is basically an interdisciplinary study of Hispanic culture (too broad of a topic for one semester, if you ask me).  My biggest complaint was that her fake Castilian lisp, layered over her thick W. MI accent was extremely difficult to understand.   I think she's too smart to be teaching at Calvin.",0
Interesting lectures. Makes you interested in mental health.,1
"A profoundly talented educator who has that rare quality of balancing intellectual passion with a true sense of investment in the development of her students. Anytime a student encounters a professor like Katy, he/she should be prepared to actually work hard and learn well; that is, after all, the required point of pursuing an education, kids.",1
"Awful professor +communicator! I hope everyone drags her in our course eval cuz she really did not teach this class well. She didn't go over our final project in class at all, so now our group is left scrambling with extra things that she never mentioned. Readings are like 50 pages every time and she sometimes changes them last minute.",0
SUPER boring lectures. Probably the worst lectures I've ever attended.,0
"Horrible class. Doesn't have textbook and provides extremely terrible lectures. So you are basically on your own when it comes to the enormous midterm and final. Constantly goes on tangents, giant waste of time. Don't take a class with this guy",0
"It was an easy class, he's a little out there but just quizzes for grades doesn't care if you come to class as long as you get notes from someone. Tells everyone up front not to get the book to save money plus it's lecture mainly. Be sure to speak up. Makes lame jokes but it's bearable easy A as long as you don't do bad on the tests very few grades",1
"very enthusiastic, but tests were very hard. she criticizes all questions",0
Refused to give assignments ahead of time which resulted in the constant need to refactor code from the last assignment that the new ones build on. Lecture were him constantly rushing people through questions so he could leave faster. Gave a deal to the people where they could skip the last assessment breaking guelphs syllabus policy in theprocess.,0
"Worst class Ive ever taken, he doesnt teach. He plays music the whole class and then tests you on nothing. He makes the class super uncomfortable and is super strict about technology. I normally never feel this way about the class but the professor was terrible.",0
"i got a B+ in this class and did so much work , only missed 3 classes and made up 2, and did extra bonus out of clsas work.  she gave someone a C+... she's moody and weird. avoid her if possible",0
The professors lectures were interesting as he had a lot of past experience in this field and provided many interesting stories. His tests were very clear and he provided a study guide with clear outlines for each test.,1
"Everyone loves Betsy! She is a super lenient grader who really cares about her students and their success. Sure, she asks that her students do a lot of reading, but that's part of going to college, and all of the reading is super relevant to learning in the courses. She makes her students feel loved and inspired to do better.",1
"Professor Maresh does her best to make her class a good learning experience. She will help you if you ask. However there is lots of homework for each chapter and 2 tests that make up 50% of your grade. Dont fall behind, show up for her lectures, and study and youll pass",1
He's the best prof for ULI101.,1
Exceptional professor who has compassion for students with chronic medical conditions and disabilities. He was the most understanding re granting necessary accommodations.,1
"Mike is a good guy. His class is pretty easy too. He puts all the slides up online, which helps out a lot.  There are only like 10 labs a semester, due on Fridays and as long as you start them by Wednesday, you should be good. They aren't that hard at all.  Those are the only grades, along with 2 exams, and they are honestly JOKES. Good class.",1
His online Exam due to the pandemic was absolutely brutal. The exam was 22 questions in 30 minutes with very hard questions. He did not do us any favours and made no compromises. Will most likely fail the class due to the lack of time on the exam.,0
The worst teacher I have ever had. The subject material for this class is insanely boring; the readings she assigns are impossible to finish & actually understand/comprehend. She gives pop quizzes for no reason and DOESN'T DISPLAY FINAL GRADES; every single test is a paper on the lectures/readings that make no sense. DONT TAKE THIS!!! I dropped.,0
"Mr. Morris has forgotten more about Creo than you'll ever learn. He's the perfect instructor for a class like ME359 which isn't really based on theory. The homeworks are graded harshly, so be sure that everything in your drawing is *exactly* how it looks in the example.",1
"Pretty fun class. If you have any issues, she's super understanding. Just participate in discussions and do the assignments, and you'll be fine. They shouldn't take too much time. Extra Credit is plenty. If you do even one or two, you'll be golden for the entire semester.",1
"Always positive and smiling, often very funny too. The class is essentially review, but I felt it was necessary after the fast pace of 211/212. It will give you what you're willing to take out of it, and Claudia will help. She definitely made everyone feel comfortable because she was so personable. Has a cute baby too!",1
"Very strict about phones, being late, and assignment due dates.",0
"Has recently changed teaching style, he is now unclear in expectations, and can not clearly explain course. He skips around material and likes to surprise students with homework assignments. Homework has little to nothing to do with the test, and may even demonstrate what you'll never be tested over.",0
"Caldwell is a super interesting professor if you yourself really care about literature. He uses the readings to talk about almost anything that comes to his mind: science, politics, gender relationships, etc. His grading of papers can be confusing sometimes, but if youre a good writer, you can easily get anywhere from a B to an A in his class.",1
"I have to say that it was the worst experience in my life. I do not think she is fit to be a teacher, she does the complete opposite of encourage or nurture her students. Like mentioned previously, AVOID FOR SANITY.",0
"He is amazing, interesting lectures, has very good knowledge of what he teaches and is very good at teaching it",1
"Super Hard grader. The pop quizzes are worth most of your final grade. At least telling students about the quizzes even one day beforehand will help. There was a pandemic going on, and I felt like the guidelines were so harsh considering the state of mind so many people were in. He doesn't think about the students and doesnt grade fairly. UGHHHH",0
"She explains with longs powerpoints, a totally confusion. She only says the date of the exams in class no emails. She in kind but doesn't help too much. Drops the lowest grade.",0
His teaching style is not very useful as he just writes out his notes again (which we have already received in an email from him.) He canceled a midterm less than 2 days before the midterm himself. His first midterm was not an accurate depiction of the practice problems assigned. Disappointed by this class.,0
Extremely boring but also extremely easy. You decide if it's worth it.,1
The entire class is one long lecture. I found them easy to follow and entertaining (though i am a history buff). He encourages class participation and is quick to answer questions.  ,1
worst professor I have ever had. he doesn't care about anyone in his classes and expects you to teach the material yourself out of the textbook even though his material doesn't match the textbook exactly. do not recommend if you need this professor for this class.,0
"Really knowledgeable in his field, caring professor. Easy, and not much work to do, only 1 case study, 2 papers and the exams. The case study is done in a group. I got a 90 in his class. Extremely easy grader on the 2 papers that are take home finals. Do not listen to the bad comments, take him if you want a good grade. Easy to get extra credit",1
"A great teacher.  She clearly explains things well, and how things are suppose to be done.",1
Good professor. He really knows a lot about math and he is comical. Don't know why so many people switch out of his class but I do like this prof.,1
"If this is your only class for the year, then yea sure take it.",0
"She was fantastic.  I've never had a teacher that genuinely cared about me learning until I took her.  It is a LOT of work, and a pretty tough course, but you will be a better student because of her.",1
"Horrible teacher, doesn't explain anything properly. Often would put code on powerpoint and not bother to turn the lights off, so you couldn't see what he was talking about to begin with. This 'teacher' is also rude when answering questions. The course jumps up in difficulty the day after the last drop date for the class, so much for 'introduction'",0
"Incredible professor! Very eager to help students debug, even though it is a third year course. Very knowledgeable about many CS related topics. Very interesting prof and perhaps the best on Waterloo campus.",1
Talented lecturer ! nothing more to say !,1
"She is a wonderful person, but an awful teacher. She was not specific about what she wanted from the class. You do a 10 page research paper worth 25% of grade, which isn't bad (I mean come one it's college), but she did not clarify what she wanted from it and a majority of my class did very poorly because of it. ALWAYS read and go to office hours!!",0
"Don't take his class. Pollack thinks he is the best teacher in the world when in reality he makes disgusting jokes and fails to teach. Get ready to be glued to your textbook because he spends 4 seconds on OChem and expects you to know everything. That is kind of his style... 80% useless info, 20% him rushing through everything else.",0
"Dr. Sullivan is a nice person, but just not a good prof. His expectations are too vague, he never responds to emails, and his lectures are incredibly boring. He only grades you by two exams and a four-page paper (and on a HUGE curve). The only reason I took this class is because it was required. I wouldn't take him again.",0
"Don't waste your time. Maybe 25% of lecture is actual learning. Tells too many meaningless stories and is extremely condescending or flat out rude most of the time, esp when students have questions. No reminders and few resources to help; it makes it very hard for students w/disabilities like me. Take it w/a different prof or just teach yourself",0
"You will have to buy 9 books for this class, and she might add more if she feels like it. Very unclear about most things she says. Syllabus has been rewritten 3 times and NONE of them have any grading criteria on it. Some papers are 7-8pgs for an INTRO class. SHE DOES NOT USE CANVAS. You won't know ur grade and she probably doesn't know it either",0
"I was a design student in a computer science class. I didn't know any of his terminology, couldn't follow anything he said, and studied hard for this class and barely passed. His quizzes were not related to material discussed in class and barely to what we read. I went to him multiple times to him for help and he didn't know how to help me.",0
"Enjoyed the class, fun instructor.",1
"Boring prof, harsh marking T.A.s, has little interest in speaking with students. Somehow takes one of the most interesting events in human history and turns it into a bland-as-cardboard praise of Lincoln every two seconds.",0
Awesome prof. To bad he's leaving the University of Winnipeg.,1
"Let me clarify to the people who are thinking about taking this Professor class. Dont do it . His grading criteria is insanely impossible to pass, he openly encourages students to drop his course. That should speak to the character of this Professor, there are Professor at this institution that are horrible Professor Fallon is one of them.",0
"Erika's class is ridiculously easy, but beyond boring. I love anthropology, but this class made me want to sleep. I sat on my phone during every class and ended up with an A. Erika also is strict on her grading in weird ways, like turning in assignments. I was NOT a fan of her as a professor. She just talks and talks and talks until you sleep.",0
Poor response to questions. Not very helpful and a very self taught class.,0
"Sullivan is very disorganized, things are often not graded on time and he takes a very long time to respond to e-mails, or just does not respond at all. Notes given in class are often very different from the things we are expected to read online and in the book and there is no correct way to prepare for the test, all of them have been different.",0
"Super boring but if you show up to lecture and pay attention, its an easy A",0
Don't take her. End of story.,0
"Ken is a great teacher with a wealth of real-world experience to draw on.  His MBA strategy class is much harder than the equivalent Global one, but well worth the extra effort.",1
I do not know where to begun because this teachers thinks shes a math god but she really is not good at teaching math at all. She gives you more than 100 math problems per week for homework where like other math teachers I had taken pass gives less than 60 math homework problems. Really a rude teacher that sleeps in class and can't teach.,0
"An amazing teacher for an amazing class. But it's not a walk in the park, you have to be commited.",1
"I had him for Principles of Microeconomics and he was horrible. His lectures made no sense and he got angry when people asked him to clarify what he meant. The homework assigned had nothing to do with his lectures or the tests, and he was incredibly condescending all the time. He stresses not thinking as a tool to succeed which makes no sense.",0
Textbook is a joke - the whole course is about Bibby's book and his perspective. Don't feel like I actually got an education in this class.,0
"A teacher who is very passionate about her job, which makes the classes enjoyable for those who are serious about learning Japanese. There are a lot of stuff to study and daily quizzes, but if you put in the time, they won't be difficult at all. However, I would not recommend the course for those who are looking for easy credit.",1
"I have never worked this hard for a C in my life I am in the tutoring center often, I do all the homework I actively participate in class. She goes to fast in her lectures, Gets frustrated when you don't get it. Simply tells you she is moving on leaving you confused. She just doesn't care and makes no attempt to hide it.",0
"I also have him currently for 3P14 - same problem: boring material, but he loves it and sticks to the text material, i find his lectures much easier to follow than the readings and it's all the same information. Great sense of humour, great sense of style! Love him.",1
"awesome (and im not a history person!) easy class. she is interesting and thorough. I personally did not use the book at all.  I would definitely recommend her,.",1
"Dr. Mack is crazy!! She is a really hard grader when it comes to quizzes and exams. If you have the option to take this class with any other professor, I recommend it!",1
She is a way boring. Boring boring boring. Just looking at her paper and write to the blackboard.,0
"Cooper is a decent guy and even though his perspective is a bit out of touch with the average uni kid, you can't deny that he does know what he's talking about (most of the time). I thought lectures were a bit boring, but Cooper is genuinely hilarious at times so I think it makes up for it. Overall, would only recommend if you like poli sci.",1
"David was a very fun Professor, made the class enjoyable. This is not a easy class, he will make you work for it. 5 Books to read, 2 Papers, 2 Quizzes and 2 Exams with multiple group discussions via smaller readings. He is a harsh grader, but will give amazing feedback on how to improve. Make the effort, easy to communicate with. Cares for students",1
"She relies heavily on you reading the textbook claiming that we do not get enough class time to actually teach us, even though we get the same amount of time as normal. She gives very vague lectures and rarely actually taught. I would not advice taking her, but in my case it was not an option. Be prepared to teach yourself.",0
If you're not attending class and taking this class during co-vid online I recommend you don't take this class. His videos are so boring you WILL lose attention and start falling asleep. In the last 2 modules he even makes you re-watch them he claims his videos wont be more than 16 minutes but they're up to 19 minutes long.,0
"He will quickly scribble a list of ""how-to"" instructions and while your trying to catch up on writing he just explained 3 other things you have no chance of understanding anymore. He doesn't allow the student time to absorb. You may only see one example per topic. If you heard it one time and took your notes thats good enough for him. Sink or swim.",0
"He is a great professor, he explains everything in a very easy way to understand. Uses different colors during lecture for better understanding, he answers any questions. His test are pretty straight forward, everything he covered during class. If you like structure, this class is for you. Easy to get an A If you follow lectures and do the work.",1
"Highly do not recommend this class. She makes a syllabus but by the third week, we were way off schedule, and no revised syllabus was provided. She is so incredibly rude and hateful. Makes you feel like an idiot for asking questions. This is a freshman level class, but will NOT boost your GPA. Don't take unless you're already familiar with theatre.",0
"Easy A! there is no final or midterm. All she asks is that you write jounal entries! If you are honest in your writings, & you actually spend time working on them, she'll give you an A! I hardly spoke in her clas & still got an 80!",1
"Lecture-wise, Xue can get somewhat boring, but the lectures are not something to skip.  Assignments don't become difficult until the last two, and be prepared to suffer on those.  MIdterms and finals are easy if you actually pay attention to the notes and learn from your mistakes in the assignments.",1
"While I believe Professor Logan is a nice man, the online formatting of this course combined with the lack of responses to emails is what made this course frustrating. Email enquiries go weeks unanswered which rends understanding math concepts difficult without further collaboration. If you aren't strong in math you need to teach yourself a lot.",0
"Dr. Macleod was an amazing professor for FYS 112, but it was important to make sure that you contributed to class discussions. There were three papers and one presentation that you have to complete, and you have a partner for the presentation! His final isn't worth a huge percent, but it was hard. Overall, I did not find his class too difficult.",1
Lots of readings. One of the worst professors I've had at AU. While the readings are interesting there is no deep discussion and you don't get helpful feedback. ,0
"Professor Huffman is such a sweet man! He really cares about his students' success. He has so many inspiring lectures especially for students who are education majors. There aren't many assignments, but attendance is mandatory. I loved this class and would take him again if he taught more class.",1
He's grades super harshly without any clear criteria. Not super caring either.,0
Material seems unorganized for a class that is about organizing. Lots of reading and reading reactions as homework. Sometimes the assignments would not be posted until a day before they are due. The lecture slides make sense unlike the reading. Gives many chances to do extra credit.,0
Dr. Harris was an amazing professor! He makes the lectures more interesting and the iClicker questions were a lot of helpful in the class. All of the work in the class was online that way it will make things much easier and more time to work on your other classes and still pass the class.,1
"Wouldn't recommend to anyone. Extremely boring. The tests are completely hard and the questions don't have anything to do with what we learned in class. If you have to take this class, just bring a book or other homework to work on in the back.",0
"ENG 101 is a tedious and oftentimes annoying class, to begin with, but don't make it even more so by taking it with Lloyd. Grading is extremely rough and it seems that doing what is required will get you a C or C+ at best. Feedback she gives seems very subjective and oftentimes students will be left wondering if any of the criteria are real.",0
"AWESOME professor. Deserves an award. Orgo is supposed to be a very difficult class but he makes it easy to learn, I highly recommend him.",1
"She knows her stuff, but she is not great at getting her points across. Very rude and disrespectful. Not helpful when you ask a question. The material is easy, but her notes are not easy to follow. Gives poor marks unless the answers are done EXACTLY her way. Not the worst, but certainly not the best prof.",0
"Worst professor I have ever taken in both my undergrad and graduate career. Lectures are unorganized and incoherent. Showed up 30 minutes late to the final. Changed the midterm rules 5 hours before the midterm. Sloppy handwriting. Never returned homeworks, or midterm. Doesn't explain concepts or equations in lecture; learned nothing from him.",0
"-He didn't say ANYWHERE the time of the first midterm and I had to email him to figure that out -Gotta pay $100 to submit your assignments -His website gives you a cryptocurrency phishing warning (really playing the long game here, huh?) -Says he'll do something by a date, doesn't do it -Contradictory statements GALORE Avoid this man if you can.",0
"If you're not a music major, forget it.",0
"Plan on attending class everyday. Says 1 thing one minute and changes her mind the next. Not clear about what she expects from you; even another Prof I talked to about her agreed. If you get put with a bad group for the semester, don't expect a good grade. No matter how hard you work she'll punish the whole group for it. Avoid taking her.",0
The lectures are very long and it's easy for your mind to drift off. I also disliked the power points.,0
"Overall, had a good semester. Dr. Parker was approachable and helpful. He consistently listened to feedback from students to make our workloads better.",1
"Dr. Panar is an absolute beauty. His lectures are quick and concise. He could use some updated notes but regardless they are good enough for the course. He is also a funny guy. ""Teach this to your family cat"" and ""It ain't rocket science folks"" are his catchphrases. If u study 3 hours a week max u will get an easy A+",1
"The most boring, unclear professor I've had during my college career. She's so smart yet has no idea how to teach. If the course had been structured better, students could get more out of it. However, we had 10 papers and 3 tests along with hours of reading. The entire class feels kind of like a fever dream.",0
"terrible class, do not recommend taking it,very boring, instructor talks about stuff that is not even related to the class!!! Gives way too much work and does not explain clearly, take it with another instructor",0
"Loves what he does and is happy to answer all of your questions. Has a workbook, which you work each day by answering question and answers, just like in English.",1
"this guy is absolutely insane, but an amazing professor. totally inspiring when i was convinced i'd hate literature. proved me wrong. papers can be hard but if you meet with him he'll tell you exactly what you need to do to get an A. overall pretty easy if you put forward the effort. i sparknotesed everything and got an A with the papers.",1
"Absolutely aweful. the comments I've read so far are SPOT ON. I was kicked out of his class this semester because I'd finally had enough of him being so disrespectful to not only me, but my classmates. Always bringing up the subject of abortions and how ""if you don't want the baby, you can give it up for adoption.""teaching strategies were confusing",0
"I truly enjoyed Dr. Ortegas class. Not only did I learn a lot, but I was also inspired by his passion for what he teaches. If you want to learn and enjoy a biology course, then take Dr. Ortega! Make sure you go to class as well!! Tests come straight from lectures and powerpoints.",1
"Make sure you participate in the discussions and you HAVE to reply to someone by Sunday, otherwise you lose points. That bugged me because online classes are supposed to be flexible. Quizzes and discussions are pretty easy. Log in daily because you might miss something, as this teacher isn't too organized. He has things all over Etudes.",1
Intro to american government is required for my major but I would recommend Smith to anyone. There is only 3 tests and a few outside of class assignments. His tests consist of short answer questions and an essay question. The big essay counts for half the test but he tells you what it is before the test. GO TO THE SI!,1
"This guy literally has put me in jeopardy in my career, due to his lack of responsibility for his awful marking, and most importantly his lack of concern for his students. I took this course from my willingness to learn, which I certainly did but failed the course. Never ever take an important course in the summer, ever.",0
The first time I took her I slacked off and ended up with a D. The second time I worked my butt off and barely made it with a C. I just don't like the way she teaches. She flies through the PowerPoints and gives problems during class that you get 5 minutes to work through and gets clearly annoyed when people aren't finished. Teach yourself.,0
I would definitely not recommend this professor. I took his class during the semester we were all online and showed little to no flexibility for the difficult times. His lectures were uninformative and showed little interaction with the class. I would certainly try and get the other professor that teaches this course.,0
"Dr. Malpass is almost impossible to work with. I was a junior taking a freshman level class, and I don't know how I passed. She does not give clear instructions or lectures. Her stories are probably the best part of the class.",0
Studied for this class and did well on the quizzes and homework which put me at a B in the class. Then graded analytical essay before finals week( which was graded harshly and said to not follow assignment) and this dropped me 7%. Hard class and a hard grader and is very strict with almost everything. 100% do not recommend.,0
"Online course was pretty easy -- made a B by reading the book and relying on lectures he provided.  He was very helpful with me when I had my baby.  But then again, I did not call him out on the message list for stupid stuff like some students.  One got mad because he did not email her back within an hour of her post.",1
"He is a very easy professor, you won't have a problem passing this class unless you don't do the quizzes; which is pretty much his whole class. You have 5 quizzes all online and on your own time as well as one 6 page paper that if you follow the guidelines you get an A. All in all only boring part is lectures which are all power point.",1
"She is very detailed with all her lectures! She knows how to make sense of math, and will do her best to make sure your understand. She moves very fast but will slow down if you ask her.",1
"The professor is rigid, and the worst part is that he holds a stale education concept in mind. He does not use the learn system and refused many good recommendations from students including using the forum like learn or piazza to discuss questions.  He trained his TAs to be killers who gave you lowest grades, and not respond to your request.",0
"Being from Sweden, he can be a little tough to understand at times  but is still a great lecturer and tells many great jokes.  Writes quickly and somewhat messily but still legible. It's evident he really cares about calculus. You can skip a few lectures here and there and be okay. Just make sure you attend the last class, it's great.",1
"Some students will find this professor easy and get an A without even trying or even showing up to class, while others will get Cs with countless hours spent on studying and trying to understand what the hell he is trying to teach you. If youre the latter, you need to attend class, take goodnotes & LISTEN to what he says if you want to do well",0
"horrible. she tells you what she looks for in an essay, but when you do what she says, it's wrong. i tried hard on all of the essays and got c's on all of them. the one essay i didnt try on i also got a c. she has favorites and if youre from L.I. or the city, you have no hope",0
"She copies and pastes pieces of different problems and still expects you to know what on earth she's talking about. She rambles so. freakin. much. We started off with 30+ people, ended with barely 20 by the following week.",0
"She teaches well, but her lectures can be boring and read right off her slide shows. She does not like to help students on her own time or even email them. Can be really rude, gives dirty eyes to students. Makes students feel incapable of things. Hard tests and hard marker (need the textbook to explain things she skips).",0
"worst lectures EVER. slideshow fest. you dont have to go to class, she gives answers to essay questions on review day b4 test. she grades exams easy, but hard on the paper. make your flashcards and memorize that crap",1
She is indeed rude on email. Everything is online. You study by yourself and take the exams online. The Examity she used doesnt work sometimes. And I missed the midterm for some tech issues. Not recommended!,0
I love her ,1
"Very nice. He will definitely bring up your grade if you don't agree with how your test was graded. The class is boring, the labs are boring and so long. 4 hour labs every week: would not recommend. 20% of your final grade in the class is based on your accuracy in the lab and it definitely brought my grade down. Final was quite hard as well...",1
"Eardley's one of my favorite profs at Guelph. Good, clear lectures and great sense of humor. Fair grader, as well.",1
"A great class, he knew his stuff all the time.  He sometimes had difficulty imparting his knowledge, but in the end we knew what was going on.  As long as you do the homeworks and show up for labs, you'll do fine.",1
"Definitely not the greatest professor the department has had. Thinks highly of himself and the opposite for his students. Not helpful, unless of course you already know the answer. As for his lectures: your pillow will need a pillow.",0
"Stone cares waaay more about showing off his knowledge than presenting material, ie using Italian and Latin excessively just to brag. We talked about one sculpture for 3 straight classes. I am an art major and an art history minor, I thought I'd love this class, I was wrong. He rambles so much we're WEEKS behind on the syllabus. Avoid at all costs.",0
worst class ever how hard could business ethics be. do not try and argue you point because you are always wrong his test are hard I read the book twice over and because it wasn't word for word on the test I got the question wrong do not take this class with him .,0
Martha is the best. Gotta get on her good side though.,1
"Was wary after the first few classes as she seemed very opinionated, but quickly changed my mind! Extremely passionate about Shakespeare but is willing to accept any view or opinion as long as you have a solid argument for it. Despite critical feedback on assignments, she marks fairly well depending on the strength of your argument. Great prof!",1
-knowledgable about what she teaches -free online textbook -gave good opportunities for getting marks. -she used a group quizzing system that did not allow me access to my accommodations provided by SAS -sometimes I felt her email correspondings were less than friendly -was not always helpful when I had questions or administrative issues,0
"Lectures and HW dont help on the exams at all, and she doesnt care if youre struggling. Wont offer help or answer emails for days, youll have to teach yourself everything. This is NOT a class for non majors. Seriously made me contemplate dropping out of college altogether.",0
Explained material extremely clearly and thoroughly.,1
"Great teacher, super interesting. If you like economics or if you are majoring in it definitely take him, you will learn a lot. If you are looking for an easy professor, there are easier professors than him. He only gives you 4 tests which you have two classes to finish in, basically if you dont finish the test you can just go study and come back ",1
First class with him and I'm already regretting my decision to take him. Should have read these reviews. 3 hour class and I barely understood what he said in those 3 hours. He just reads off the slides and his accent is unbearable. I would avoid. Sucks that he is the only professor teaching INFO 2315 this semester. Listen to these reviews y'all!,0
"This class was a very broad overview of Greek Mythology that mainly focused on plot and characters, so don't expect any deep analysis of the works. His quizzes, which are given randomly, can be kinda tricky because of his wording, and there's a lot of reading, but the class was pretty good. ",1
"If you do the extra credit and go to class, this class should be an easy A. Her grading system is weird, but she gives you sooooo many opportunities for extra credit. Being in class was a waste of time, but she did have some assignments in class. She doesn't really lecture, but instead just goes over practice problems which rarely helped.",1
"The material is alright, Dr. Simerka is very helpful. Expect pop quizzes (12 but she drops 2), 3 ""freebies"" for absences, 2 papers, midterm and final. You can rewrite your paper to get a higher grade and she will help you to write it during her office hours.",1
Textbook is needed for this class and its around $70 if you get the hard copy we get 3 exams He makes us do readings he gives no slides all he does is talk and go on extra credit is participation Hes probably the worst professor I have so far,0
"When we were studying at the roundtable in MC, Mark approached us,  gave us sweets and threw us a dirty look. Disgusting!",0
"Dr. Toma is one of the sweetest human beings on Earth.  She stays after class for several hours and helps students with their problems.  How many profs will do that?  She makes class interesting and is very energetic.  Exams are tough, but if you read the chapters and go to class, you will be fine.",1
"Although Dr. Meyer has high expectations for his students and is rather strict, he is also a great professor and is very fair. He was willing to toss out exam questions if you had a good argument against them. He was also willing to edit your papers before you turned them in. He's not as hard and set in his ways as he originally comes off.",1
"1st year classes are easy, upper year classes require a lot more investment in time.  A great guy and prof.  I went through some tough times and he helped me out more than most.  He knows his stuff cold.",1
"Worst Professor at this school. I had her for Test Engineering. A good grade is easy, listen to the slides for when she finally says somthing realating to the class. Of all the professors at this school I learned the least from her. Never answered one question about LabView. I am not even sure if she is compotent in LabView. Trust my number rating.",0
I took women's self-defense. I enjoyed the class and learning the moves. I did not like how much we would talk though sometimes. It is 60% physical and 40% learning. The learning in class is not entertaining.,1
"One of the easiest math classes I've ever taken and I'm terrible at math. Her online math course is through ALEKS. The more you complete of it, the better grade you get. So easy and is at your own pace. Gives you credit where earned on tests if you show your work. Would take her class again in a heartbeat!",1
"*sigh - boring teacher, slow. She wasn't clear most of the times and I dreaded attending class. Textbooks were interesting though and papers were ugh. >_> 2 five page papers and a few readings - MOVIES included! Got out early most of the time.",0
"Seriously, don't take him. He tries to be friendly and encourages to come to his office hours, but his office hours aren't that helpful. He doesn't get that we are learning the whole idea of phonology for the first time in our lives. He treats us as if we are grad students who are familiar with all the materials. He might be lenient in grading tho.",0
"Attendance is a must, but not mandatory. If you attend class, it's an easy A. If you need extra credit, he gave it out twice to those who attended class (before a holiday/break or when class was sparse). 2 papers, 3 exams and some section work. Overall good prof, just need to pay attention and ask questions if you get lost.",1
"Dr. Yarotsky is an adequate professor. He knows the subject matter well, but he's so busy it seems hard to care about individuals. His lectures are decently engaging. Has a bit of an ego you'll have to work past to effectively communicate with him.",1
"I thought this class was going to be like a Calculus class I took in high school, but no. Professor Gupta truly is the worst teacher I have ever had as he never provided any reasoning for grades and even though I went to all the classes and his office hours, still did not do great on midterm or final. RIP to whoever has to take him next year.",0
"DON'T TAKE HER!! SHE'S AN ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE... SHE THINKS THAT HER CLASS IS THE ONLY CLASS... HONESTLY, I WISH I HAD LISTENED TO OTHERS... SHE'S REALLY A NIGHTMARE. FAVORITES ARE AN ABSOLUTE IN HER CASE... UGH",0
"I saw a lot of negative feedback about Professor Morty but if you really pay attention to this class, he taught the core of OS. Since we all are remote because of the pandemic, his HW, Quizzes are key to the exams. He gives HW first, then he will review them after we submit, quiz will be based on HW only after the review. Exams are based on HW and",1
"Very fun and interactive class, often we would play games for the entire class and then get out early and leave. She is very fair and really cares about her students. Highly recommend her!",1
"Prof. Marchand is extremely respected in her field and knows her stuff. You will get what you put into this class-- if you want to grow and learn, this class is for you, if you want an easy A, look elsewhere. She wants her students to succeed and gives good feeback on essays. Participate in class and get to know her, you won't regret it.",1
"Dr. Sundahl was my professor for two core courses:  English 104 and English 105.  He organized the class with a large lecture, small serminars, and in office tutorials.  As a first year student, I was very appreciative of the time he gave again and again.  And the occasional hug when I was down.  He made a major impact on my life.",1
"It's probably easy if you try hard, I missed a few classes though so I missed 2 quizzes. Wish there was more extra credit, but he gives you some. Tells jokes!",1
Very easy class. He is a funny professor. Two exams and a final. Attendance is mandatory and he does not like you using your phone in class,1
"Do the safety training's and get a 100, gives a lot of extra credit, puts a ton of notes on the board that are irrelevant, and the self study chapters are irrelevant. The exams are extremely hard and she pulls questions out of hat.",1
This may be one of the hardest classes I have ever taken. You will have four exams that are Multiple choices which is very challenging and essay questions. You will also have three quizzes which are based on scholarly readings. If you want to pass this class be prepared for long nights of studying and make sure to attend all the classes.,0
My first time taking her. Absolutely terrible. Through online classes she makes you take a quiz before and throughout class. All the questions she writes and her English isn't the best so it actually made it harder for me to grasp concepts by the wording of the questions. I am also 90% sure that she hacks zoom and can hear you even if you're muted.,0
"Mutes the entire class and disables the chat so he can talk to himself for the entire lecture. When he solves questions he just reads of the solutions. His answer to every question is check the textbook, ask your TA, google it or tells us that we should already know this content. Assignment questions are not explained during class time. Avoid.",0
"Wonderful caring professor. It is art history, so prepare to study and memorize. Make your cards ASAP! I learned a lot and had fun doing it. You will get a lot out of this class if you are willing to put in the work. Don't just come to class unprepared and expect an easy A.",1
"This guy sucks, plain and simple. its almost the end of the semester and i have handed in 4 assignments for this course and recieved one from the beginning of the semester.",0
"She was a sweet lady but seemed to favour certain students. Overall, an average class, even though the course was tough.",1
"Excellent intructor!  Very interesting course.  He helped write the book that is used, so lectures follow book very well.  Highly recommend this class.",1
very very helpful. gives every phone number possible out to students and u can reach her at anytime. gives you notes and goes over them in class. lots of hw but its so worth it. i learned so much from that class. she expects a-lot from her students but shes great,1
"Funny, but lazy and class was an insane waste of time after the first test. If he didn't feel like teaching he'd just pop in a movie. Sounds easy but his tests were intentionally tricky to make it seem like his class was harder than it really was. Wouldn't take again.",0
"If you taking this class just to pass he is considerate professor and he will gave a take home final.  But if you want to learn abut accounting, he is not the one to learn from.  All his acc. explainations are about him and how he date his wife, waste of time. He thinks that he is funny but he is not. 
 I would not recommend him!",0
"He should have become a chef, comparing potatoes or as he says ""pataitoes"" :) to a circuit board. I don't recall understanding lectures, getting the labs done with my friends without the help of the TAs, and reviewing the notes and slides and getting an A-. This guy has been teaching this course for over 15 years, so he too must be bored by now :).",1
"Prof. Saucier is a super great prof. There is a discussion and a quiz every week, midterm is written essay questions but not super difficult. Participation is a HUGE factor in your grade, must participate or will not pass. Definitely recommend.",1
"Not the best of professors. She has two essay exams that are graded incredibly hard, and then she also does short essays on readings that need to be a min of 250 words, but they need to be much longer. She can be helpful if you go to her during the office hours  but doesn't do much to help your grade.",1
Shes very interesting. She seems lost but knows how to explain very well through her lectures. Does a lot of group activities though. Not that much homework. Very helpful with your writing if you ask for it. It helps to attend every class and to be organized.,1
"Easy B class. Getting an A is extremely difficult in general. Compared to other Engl 1 A, it's outrageous. Papers and projects will bring your grade down.  The class average for both is around a B which is why this class is an easy B. Way too much work and all for nothing. Avoid taking this class if there are better options...",0
One of the best teachers one can encounter.,1
"Horrible professor, so rude and reads straight from power points, doesn't actually teach. Tests are confusing. Read the anatomy textbook because it's your only chance of passing.",0
"Okay, let's be honest.  I wasn't crazy about this flipped class initially but it really forced me to actually do the work.  I went to all the lecturers (almost everyone did) and I really now feel I can tackle real world probs using Matlab.  It isn't for everyone as you have to watch a video ahead of time and attendance is a must.",1
"Doesn't talk about the lesson contents at all. Never take his class. You will waste money and time, ending up with learning nothing.",0
I like her very much,1
"I had over 100 credit hours when I took her class and it was enough to make me consider dropping out. It was the worst college experience I've ever had. You'll pour days of your life into the project and be proud of the result. But regardless, she'll be offended by your efforts and tear every piece you turn in to shreds with no guidance provided.",0
"Professor Doubleday has an enthusiasm that is contagious when it comes to the Russian language, making class enjoyable. You definitely will need to do the homework and put in the work, but it's worth it. She is very accessible outside of class and wants her students to succeed.",1
"not enough time spent public speaking, too much time spent listening to oother people public speaking. The only reason to show up is to get marked as present. His heart is in the right place even if he's never ever funny.",0
Best internet class page on campus. Great lectures.,1
"I have to say, Ahmad, albeit being known as a good professor, has not shown himself to be as superb this semester. He made his grading criteria very vague in this semester. Refused to curve the course. And refused to let us reference sheets and calculator during exams even though you need those for Statics like exams.",0
Attendance is not mandatory at all and all power points are online. The subject is hard so going to class does help because McPherson will sometimes differ from the power points. His lectures are usually just notes with some practice problems. There are two homework assignments for each chapter and only 3 tests ad 2 quizzes the whole semester.,1
"Although the class is relatively easy, the professor seems quite disinterested in the class/teaching. I took only online classes because of covid-19, so I relied a lot on email as source of communication, Sandweiss will reply to emails, but if you have a specific question, his answers are pretty vague and not that helpful.",0
Tests are tough but he curves generously.,1
"Seneca should be embarrassed to have professors like Russel on their payroll. Knows his stuff, but is truly incapable of conveying any of the information in his head. Throws up code on the projector and tells students to copy it down line by line to complete the assignments. Genuinely one of the worst ""teachers"" I've had the displeasure of seeing.",0
"Don't take her class if you can't teach yourself. She usually has you watch voice-over PowerPoints at home and then holds class for about 30 min. She doesn't give detailed feedback on tests or assignments. If you need help you will be diverted to the HAC. If you don't already know chemistry and are taking this class to actually learn it, good luck.",0
"Absolutely loved her. She is so caring and the class lectures are interesting. She makes an effort to have the class be friends with each other, so the environment is super friendly and unique. Highly highly recommend personally introducing yourself after class and making an effort to talk to her--she will like you and help you out!! She's so sweet",1
Avoid taking him . Makes class very difficult,0
"Boring lectures at times. Tough grading on tests, you have to be very specific, pay attention in class and take notes, read the textbook and you'll be fine.  The group project was annoying. She's very easy to get along with even if you don't agree with her on things. She won't judge you or belittle your opinions which was good.",1
"Great prof, funny, and interesting. The course would be nothing without him.",1
This class was the worst biology course I've taken yet. Vargas was a terrible teacher. She could not explain things well in class or in office hours though she is very nice and wants to help. She's funny and entertaining. Her tests are harder than you'd think and never what you'd expect. Extra credit is always available. Just CANNOT teach at all.,0
"One of the best professors at CRC. He only teaches at night and his lectures get a bit boring but show up & you'll get an A! Quizzes are online for Geo300 and geo301 labs and hw are due the next class but he is lenient on late work. Tests don't have anything you've never seen. Rent his E-books on chegg, way cheaper",1
"A lot of people will tell you that Costa's 384 is the hardest class you'll take in ECE, and they may be right. Homeworks are long and harshly graded. Exams are very intimidating, but doable.  Decent professor when it comes to explaining but the material can be annoying to learn. Projects aren't too difficult, but overall this class is a lot of work",1
"a good professor I am sure, but GOVT 203 is not it. This class will require the most effort out of any of your other classes and for little reward. Weekly reading quizzes are impossible, and professor combs through any written work hardcore. He is an interesting fellow though, and very approachable/willing to help, so I'd recommend another class.",0
"Good teacher, you will learn Japanese.  Be prepared to be asked questions in Japanese, and then having to answer them in front of the class (this will happen every day).  Also, make sure you aren't learning Japanese for all the wrong reasons.",1
"She interrupts students and is very harsh when she doesn't hear the answer she wants right  away. Her quizzes are filled with answers that are extremely similar, or mean almost the same thing which makes it hard to get a good grade on them. She is very picky when it comes to papers and gives a rubric which seems completely arbitrary.",0
He rambles on and on in class and will stay on one slide for the entire 50 minutes you are in there. He is also not very specific on reading assignments and quizzes so you have to keep track of that on your own. Theres also usually a quiz every Friday so you have to go to class. I would not take this again!,0
"His ""teaching"" involved handing out video lectures that were 1:30 long, then made us watch the SAME video the following class. He was supposed to encourage discussion of the videos, but instead he watched them with us during ""lecture"" with his back against us, so he couldn't even see if we had questions or not. Easily the worst professor at Western",0
Simply the best! tests are based on both lectures and textbook so make sure you understand the concepts she talks about.   Gives great advice and feedack.,1
"He's a very nice person and seems very knowledgeable and passionate in teaching this course, but I can't seem to concentrate or focus in his lectures because of his way of speaking. The course requires lots of reading, lectures are recommended, 20% of the course mark is easy to attain, rest is up to how you study and do on the midterms or exams.",0
"Class felt somewhat disconnected. She's not really receptive to feedback. If she asks a question in class and nobody knows the answer, she will act as if we are all mentally incapable. Grading is average, she gives partial credit. You must do your homework, she randomly checks it for credit. Quizzes nearly every class. Exams are relatively easy.",0
"Palfai is really passionate about this course, He knows and can explain everything well. The tests are the most important part of this course and they can be tricky.",1
"a nice guy, gave rly kind feedback on one of my papers that was V validating. i didn't Love his lectures tho and tho he's ofc rly intelligent and good at what he does, his personal style wasn't Captivating for me.",0
"Examen de mi-session injuste, choix multiples confusant pour être ''tricky''. La prof a rendu cet examen très difficile. De plus, la correction est injuste. Il y avait même des fautes d'ortographes dans les questions choix multiples. La professeur nous avait pourtant dit que cet examen serait juste, et de ne pas stresser.",0
"Prof Alvarez is a nice person. As a professor, he is not very good. He calls people out and expects too much from a 200 level course. I came into the semester as an English major and now have changed to Group Social Studies because of his teaching style. He is available and encourages office hours but he is very harsh if your writing is not his.",0
"This is the worst class I have ever taken. Dr Field is the typical terrible professor you see in movies. Lectures with words that dont make sense to anyone unless you are a professional ethithsist. Papers are impossible, I needed help on one and went into his office, he did not do one thing to help me understand the material better.",0
the papers you have to write arent terribly long but she is reallly boring.make sure you read everything because you will get a quiz. you have to go to every class! if you write a paper and do not do well on it she is pretty nice about helping you fix it and letting you redo it. she likes when you participate. read everything. not that bad at all,1
"Okraku is one of the best econ teachers out there. This guy knows his stuff - and is really, really funny most of the times. His favorite examples of products to compare are ""guns, and butter"". Great class. Study for the tests, and the final is basically a bunch of questions off all the tests you took.",1
"Very nice professor. Unless you miss the lectures more than several times it's an easy-A class. I averaged 96-97 on three tests, and didn't study for final at all but got A. Make sure if you have a solid understanding on calc before you take physics classes. then you will be doing great.",1
"Take a class with Friedrichs if you get a chance, even if you're not a history major. He is interesting and funny, and his expectations are straight-forward and fair.",1
haha could not get any worse. You're better off taking this class online because you're going to be teaching yourself the material anyway.,0
Worst class... a hour and 45 minutes of her monotone voice talking about greek mythology...... I thought this class was ethics? I guess Emerson wrote the course description wrong.,0
Good teacher. Puts only as much effort into teaching the course as his students put into learning the material. Probably one of the most brilliant professors I have ever had at Marist.,1
"I took this course thinking it was an easy A. I was definitely wrong, his exams were  harder then expected them to be given the course. You definitely have to study (not last minute) for this course, read his book and readings. No curve as well and most people i talked to in the class said they were not doing so well.",0
"Very stressful class. Requires a LOT of studying. He only grades the tests, but I recommend you do the homework. Ask a lot of questions. I studied over 12 hours for the second exam, and only got an 86 on it. This class requires a lot of time put into it. Make sure you go to class.",0
Avoid him for sure!,0
"If you're looking for an easy A, Bogdan's not your guy.  To do well in his class you need to read and re-read and re-read and even then you might not get an A, but he is a genius and very passionate about his material.  If you're interested in philosophy of mind and willing to work hard it's definitely worth taking a class with him.",1
"Prof Montano is nice, passionate guy but his class... Attendance is mandatory and his lectures go in a million different directions and dont make sense if you dont understand the language of montanese. 10 weekly quizzes which are hard and 1 midterm essay and 1 take home essay. If you dont wanna read the textbook to learn, dont take this class",0
great teacher...,1
"Professor McConkey is a great guy! I definitely recommend this class for the Religion Ged Ed requirement. It's not difficult, but the material is interesting and he is so flexible and understanding. Read the powerpoints and come to class at least once a week and you will ace this class!",1
Very biased toward younger male students.,0
Mr. Finelli was a very mediocre professor who let peers instead of him determine the grade a student gets. Aside from this he carried a very rude and non-caring tone when he responded to emails sent with relevant questions. The class was okay but this professor definitely does not need to be teaching.,0
GREATEST PROFESSOR EVER. Has great lectures and is very passionate about History. Will definitely take again!,1
Follow all the assignments and ace the class.,1
"She is the most confusing teacher I have ever had. I have never rated a professor before, but I thought I should warn everyone! DONT take a class with her. Shes a walking contradiction and doesnt even know what shes looking for when grading your assignments. Shes too lazy to give you an actual percentage and like kindergarten gives an M or C",0
"Bad at explaining, disorganized, very boring, doesn't care about his students' success. Would not recommend this prof.",0
"Makes students do all the work, presentations, etc. Rarely lectures. Seems to lack confidence and mumbles. Quirky, she corrects papers on grammar. Doesn't have a lot of direction when studying topic, so it can be boring at times. Wish there were more lat. Am. Lit profs at UD.",0
"He is a very tough grader, and it is impossible to get an A on the homework and in the class. Would not recommend taking him",0
he is easily the best teacher i have ever had in college. the guy is super helpful and really cares about teaching u the material. the essays are kinda hard but if you ask for help and put effort u will get an A for sure. i took him twice and got an A both times. i high recommend his class. just make sure not to skip class.,1
Took her for BIO 355. She puts little to no information on the lecture slides and then grades on every small thing she said in class. Her exams are incredibly hard and very vague. She is a tough grader and often makes you feel dumb when you email her with a question. Would recommend taking a different prof for genetics if possible.,0
"super helpful, made history interesting. Responds to emails super quick, such a wonderful man. Really wants students to do well.",1
"Nice prof, the tests were harder than other economics classes. But he do gives out bonus marks. Study the textbook and you will be fine.",1
"GET ON GOOD SIDE EARLY! He picks favorites and he can be mean. If you don't plan on talking in class every class, do not take him. You need to be very nice to him and participate ALOT! 30% of your grade is participation and the only other grades are a midterm and final. Had to spend a good 3 hours to be prepared. VERY HARD class do NOT recommend!!",0
"never on time, sometime strays off into a rant.  easy to get along with, helpful, lets you express your thoughts, caring, knows his stuff.  not like any other professor i've had, cool dude.",1
His lecture presentation is terrible and it made you feel like you had a astriction,0
"Not a fan. I think he really failed to make the subject interesting by overloading us with personal and irrelevant stories. He's rigid in his teaching style and discourages  class discussion and participation. Even though the lectures seem simple, the tests are extremely difficult. Do yourself a favor and find a different history prof..",0
"This course was one of my biggest regrets in college. The major of this ""professional ethics"" course was spent dragging on about ethical theory that wasn't relevant to any workday of my career path. Even Dr. Field seemed to be bored and tired of his teachings. He was monotone, unengaging, and seemed to enjoy telling students that they were wrong.",0
Unorganized and scattered during lectures. Uninteresting but the class is easy. A few short papers and easy online quizzes,0
"World class professor, explained concepts I had no Idea how to do prior to entering the course perfectly. DO NOT skip his lectures, as he is very good at explaining difficult concepts and answering questions. Go to his office hours if you need extra help! Great prof overall.",1
Easy class. He gives three homeworks and mostly he gives you the answers. The exams is the homework. I f you do well in  your homework you will get A in the exam. Very easy class. I would recommend to students who needs to take music class you will love it. I wish he was teaching another GNED course in the fine Arts so i can take him.,1
Best teacher in the dept. Projects are long and tests can be hard. Nice guy....,1
"Spanish 4 was a very easy class. He is genuine, kind and has a lot of energy in the mornings. Participation was a huge factor for Spanish 4. Everyday he would ask you entrevista questions, there were also nine situations that we had to memorize for the final interview. Otherwise, it was like all previous Spanish classes.",1
"Olson is great! People complain about him for all the odd things he says, but he still effectively covers all the material. I had a great time in this class!",1
"The worst prof I have ever had at Mal. He treats students as imbeciles; Duane is both rude and arrogant. He is very opinionated and I felt his lectures to be exceedingly bias.  He added labs and lectures not outlined on the schedule and made them mandatory, so beware, your class schedule will be much more than anticipated!",0
"By far the worse professor I've ever had in my college career. Her lectures are slow & consist of her literally her babbling things that make little to no sense. You don't really learn anything via class. She takes long to start class ( 30 mins). Basically, you have to learn everything on your own +  tutoring from T.A to get by.",0
this guy made me hate communications!!!! he thinks he knows everything and if you try and prove him wrong he will punk you and make you feel stupid.  the tests are a joke.  he asks the most random questions and its nothing that you studied. DONT TAKE!!!!!,0
He's really a great guy. Loves getting the students to talk about the subjects at hand. Do the assignments and you'll pass with flying colors. One of my favorite classes I've taken here.,1
"Corcoran is a fair, gracious, and engaging instructor. He doesn't talk down to or belittle his students but works VERY hard to make ideas clear and understood no matter how long it takes. I appreciated his balanced and careful presentation of many of the challenging topics in philosophy. Felt like he cared about me even in an online course.",1
"Dr. Poler is a great teacher, however he wants to teach you stuff you do not need to know, so then you are required to read the book material on your own. If he teaches something one day, the next class he expects you to master it. Be prepared to work.",1
Dreaded his class. Just teaches the textbook during lectures with minimal effort to make it the least bit interesting. Exams are a joke and unnecessarily hard. I was looking forward to learning about marketing but he made it hard to appreciate. Good luck if you have him for 300!,0
Ivor is an old school professor. Don't expect to come to this class for an easy grade. Pay attention in lectures and you will do fine. He makes it pretty obvious what to revise for during his lectures. I don't know why people complain so much about the map quiz. You have FOUR attempts to get over 15. Very doable if you put the time in.,1
Incredibly strict grader. Will take off points for even the most trivial of details. Didn't include a screenshot for literally every single process of your database creation? Points off. Perhaps a textbox accidentally obscures a minor part of your query? Points off. Very slow on grading too so getting timely feedback for the final was impossible.,0
"Stadnik is legitimately the worst prof I've ever had in my life. You need to read sections of the textbooks before every class because there is a quiz during every class. All his assessments are multiple-choice, so if you make one mistake, you're done. I recommend finding and printing all his past tests and bringing them into the open-book exams.",0
"If chemistry is part of your major, or you enjoy it, have Groh as a professor! The class cycles every three weeks with the first being no assignments, the second having a problem set due, and the third having an exam. Problem sets are difficult and time consuming but you're allowed to work together. Extremely helpful for problem solving skills.",1
"Wow, is this guy still teaching? I had him back in 1974, and he turned me into a history junkie. I have earned two undergraduate degrees, and his history class was the single most memorable class I ever took. He presented the point of view of every person or group or religion or ?? from that person's viewpoint - very convincingly. My best prof...",1
"Cannot teach seems knowledgeable but cannot teach. You will have to learn every thing on your own if you want to pass. WHen you ask him a question which he tells you  you must to pass he doesnt answer it and never says what he is doing Analogy: He teaches you what a baseball is, a bat is, and a glove is, and then tells you go  play baseball!",0
"Childers is alright. I'm being generous even then. Her lectures are tangental, most of class is student-directed, and she is EXTREMELY ambiguous as to what she wants on tests/assignment. Then during the test she wants the most miniscule details of everything covered in class despite ""only having to cover main ideas."" Ambiguity thy name is Childers.",0
Her test are hard and you really do not know what is going to be on them and the amount of poems and other things you have to memorize for the test are way to much. Also the test are short so if you miss a few then you grade drops fast.,0
TAKE HER CLASS! Most influential professor I've had my entire college career! She is so passionate about teaching & will help you understand a very difficult subject! Study her slides like the bible & dedicate 10+hrs/week to studying. Highly recommend!,1
BEST TEACHER I'VE TAKEN THUS FAR! she can turn idiots into A students..her teaching method is  perfect! take her!!,1
He is not helpful and the exams are very hard and often do not apply to things that we do in class.,0
Great professor -- funny and very bright but doesn't take to slackers.,1
"Caring, knows her stuff, but def doesn't wanna be teaching 101. Higher up maybe she wont be so monotone.",1
I am terrible at math - took calc 3 with Prof. Luther and received a 100% in the class. I have never before understood math so clearly or have been able to perform it so well. Would definitely recommend! ,1
"Lisa was one of my all time favorite instructors. She provided excellent direction and support throughout the term. Since the beginning of our class, I have noted a distinct improvement in my reading and writing capabilities. I am confident that this class will enable me to perform at a higher lever in my future endeavors.",1
"As a person who usually despises chem, Prof McBane makes the class somewhat bearable. You can tell he's passionate about the content and knows a lot more than what he has to teach us, but he's more than happy to slow it down to explain something again. You need to buy the book for the online HW but most of the content is taught in class. Don't skip",1
The professor talks really fast when she give lectures. She grades hard! She except you to know the entire book and vocabulary. Her quiz online are difficult. The time for each quiz is 20 min.,0
He is a wonderful professor. He genuinly wants students to learn and be engaged in the material. I was worried about history being hard but he is very reasonable with assignments.,1
One of the best teachers I've had so far at Western. By far the coolest. He made philosophy of religion far more interesting than I ever thought it could be. If you have the chance take a lecture with Hud!,1
"This has to be the hardest course I've taken at GRCC to date. Dr. Hesse is a nice man, but the workload for the class is ridiculous. Lots of busy work and incredibly hard tests. For being an intro class for NON SCIENCE MAJORS Dr. Hesse does not teach it that way and gets deep into chemistry. Don't take this class if you're looking for a simple lab.",0
"Dr. Preiss can't teach. He really can't. I have never spent more time confused and lost in a class than I've his. He has no organization in his lectures, goes all over the place with his explanations and makes references that don't help AT ALL. This is easily the worst class I've ever taken. Sorry, but like he says, a good math student is blunt.",0
Awful awful professor.  The meanest person I have ever met in my whole life. AVOID!,0
"Yeah she's a great, easy teacher  and all. But she's the worst if you want to try and make up a test or anything like that.",0
Lectures are full of theoretical proofs. Homework is impossible. Tests are fair. The text book is very unhelpful and attending class doesn't really help because he never explains anything in plain english--only talks in math variables (not even real numbers).,0
"I really wanted to take Advertising, but he didn't make it a very good class. He just talks at you w/his terrible slides. Pretty tough grader and doesn't give helpful feedback. Also I took his final the 1st day of exam week and didn't get my grade until that wknd. Had no idea what I had all sem.",0
"His class is a lot of discussion and some nonsense. He is extremely easy. U can rewrite your paper, but it will never be as good as an A. If u don't pass his class u need extra help.",0
"I took Women and Religious Traditions with her last term and the class was seriously boring. I should have seen the warning signs: the class only had 9 students on a good day. One time she invited a guest speaker who did not seem to have prepared for the class at all. Also, honestly, I felt like a lot of the material taught was slightly made up.",0
If you want an easy lab science do not take her. Her tests are impossible. she is such a hard grader. For how bad I did on the tests I actually ended up with an okay grade but she is so hard and can be so sassy. this is class should be for bio majors not non bio majors.,0
"This man is brilliant, just brilliant. You'd be missing out if you didn't take his class. Yeah, he holds people to a high standard--get used to it.",1
"professor lay is really kind and knowledgable! grades are determined by only 3 essays though, so start on them early. approachable enough to art with the lectures so you can take this class without any prior knowledge!",1
"I have tried to think about the strengths, but, unfortunately, they are non-existent. Banerjee is by far the worst professor in the entire institution This is primarily because her assignments seem written in such a way as to purposely fail you She will do this and then write feedback, stating OH, YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS, THAT, AND THIS",0
"If you value your mental health, and personal life... wait until someone else teaches the course.",0
"One of the best professors I have ever had at GVSU. I was bad at chemistry in high school, and I got an A- in his class. Tests are hard, but not as hard as some other professors' tests for this class. He is REALLY helpful during his office hours, so take advantage of them as much as possible. If taught EGR courses, I would take them with him.",1
"This professor talks the entire class. She flys by every step so its very easy to get lost in her class. She also treats students like kids, by giving assigned seats on test day and she's always screaming shhhing us like were children its awkward.",0
"Go to class, take good notes, do all the weekly assignments(do all of the questions eventhough its not required) then MAYBE, just maybe you will do decent!",1
"She's very nice, and the homework is incredibly easy. But she's incredibly unclear about what she wantsexpects, which can lead to missing a deadline because she wasn't clear about the deadline, and she refuses to take late work (except of course when she doesn't). Nice, but not a college-level teacher. Lots of youtube music videos and an easy book",0
"Utterly useless. Had to drop engineering due to being unable to pass this class. Had the same prof twice and couldn't change classes. He blasts through everything and gets upset with students that don't just get it right away. Don't bother asking questions. In fact, don't bother going to class. Just find a friend and study the book.",0
"Bruce is at times unclear and sometimes can seem unprepared for class, but overall he is an extremely nice man which made me really like him as a professor by the end of the course. I would recommend him to my peers",1
"I took his social psychology class during the pandemic. It was a waste of $2500. We read about 90% of the textbook, had notes every week that he wrote, had a few PowerPoints, had one 15-minute lecture by the TA, and had a zoom discussion. It was a waste of money. You can go to a community college and get a better class. Do not take him.",0
"Dr. Lim was easily one of the best professors I ever had when I went to John Carroll University. I had him for EC 302 in the Spring of 2019 and he taught me so much which I have used since then. He is always available after hours for questions. He sets clear expectations in his grading. If you learn how the topics relate to each other, you will pas",1
"I took his online class, If you want to teach yourself an entire math course this is the class for you. Very little homework, Very little instruction, tests are huge! So if that's how you work great! Also I found he took points off of problems for very small things even when I would get the answer right.",0
"Nice guy, really has a passion for what he teaches. Writes down notes for you to study, so just make sure you go to class and you'll be fine. The exams are simple enough, 40 questions and he reviews the class before the exam. Will stop if you have questions and sincerely wants you to learn.",1
"Masterson is do-able.. but I recommend that you have some background of calc before taking him. He can be unclear and confusing. I took calc before and I got a B+ after taking him. Don't freak out, just do the practice problems from the book he gives you, they are similar to  the ones on the test",0
Probably the easiest speech class you can take. I loved the course and found it extremely interesting and not difficult at all! Gentry is fabulous and a really forgiving grader. Totally recommend!,1
"Very knowledgeable in the subject he teaches. Lectures and shows you pictures, is not very clear about what you need to know. During labs, I felt like I was bothering him if I asked him a question. Tests are hard.",0
"Professor Lamy is a well respected genius. However, do not take this class if you are not willing to work hard. Every assignment is challenging, especially because there is never any clear right answer for this class. I often felt like I was guessing when I wrote papers for this class! I did well though because I worked hard and Lamy noticed.",1
"The class is not hard. It does require hours of studying, which he does state in the syllabus. The worse part about this class is listening to the lectures. They are very long and drawn out and waste a lot of unnecessary time. You MUST listen to the lecttures to pass. 5 test and 1 ""research"" assignment. Graded out of best 4 test.",0
No opinion about this teacher took cse115 for him and dont have much interaction just this class is horrible they arent able to help you for anything as you have to everything yourself,1
"His lab manual doesn't make sense, and the lab has absolutely no relation to what we learn in lectures so how do i get interested",0
Self-important schemdrick. Why screw up your GPA listening to this self-absorbed movie critic.,0
"Keeling is a great professor. There is a lot of reading, but it is a literature course, so that is to be expected. You can't really get away with not doing the readings because there is a class discussion of each text as a whole. All in all, the content was interesting and I learned a lot from this course.",1
"Amazing lecturer, gives example code and explains how the code works. Writes blogs regarding how to complete the assignment for students. Midterm and Final are easy, and make up for the difficulty of the assignments. Assignments are heavy but well defined, if you start early, you shouldn't have any problems. Funny and is quick to answers emails.",1
"De Vos is a very smart person, and likes to make jokes in class. However, this actual class was completely useless. Called ""Sex & Gender"", he mostly talked about his personal life and told stories. PowerPoints were taken right out of the book. Open note exams, so it wasn't very difficult. Get points by being in class, although they were useless. ",0
"First of all, Mel is one of the nicest professors I've ever had. He really cares about his students and wants them to do well in his class and in life! However, his lectures are incredibly boring. He basically reads from the textbook and tends to spend a TON of time on easy concepts. The exams are surprisingly hard but if you study you'll be fine!",1
Professor Bommer is an average professor at best. I barely learned anything in this class. All what we were graded on were his exams and they were quite hard. Many of the exam questions were very random and had nothing to do with his lectures. He was annoying and had a big ego. He would often talk down to students. Very boring and useless class,0
"Fam straight lit like bic , manz only talk to like half the class but he still cool. 10/10 would attend class ",1
he pushed me in class,0
"Class was alright, but Brandt repeats his weird anecdotes such as buying butter at the grocery store too much. Gets old fast.  Claims attendance is mandatory but only took attendance once. 14 quizzes, lowest 2 get dropped. NOT ALL QUIZ ANSWERS ARE ONLINE. 3 tests - provides 1 makeup during finals, but only if you missed an exam. No extra credit.",0
Very genuine and caring professor,1
"I was actually fine with this course until the professor began to inject his false personal views into the material. He had an example of misleading data visualization and a few slides down he provides a graph that has the EXACT SAME FLAW as the ""bad"" example to promote how iphones causes teen depression.",0
"Based on my personal interactions with her and ratings from other students I would say she's a good Professor, however SCREW CJ 303! (Research Methods). Hopefully in the future she takes steps to make this class less of a headache, because man it is a nightmare. So much to do with little time and a lot of confusion as to what needs to be done.",1
"I don't know how Professor Hower has such high ratings on here... Just to highlight a few things, she's very unorganized, class gets cancelled a lot, lectures are just her reading off of the screen and not really explaining how to work through the problems, and she gets very off topic for majority of the time during lectures. Would not recommend.",0
"Political Philosophy is possibly the hardest class i've taken here, Blair is an awesome teacher hands down, but the material along with class lectures can be very confusing for a laymen. I recommend doing all the readings, participating as much as possible in class and preparing well for the essay bc he will call you out on your BS!",1
"He says you need the textbook, but he grades mostly based on his lectures. He gave a pop quiz the first week and almost everyone failed, but it wasn't graded. Grades are based on tests and a short paper about a political meeting you attend (of your choice). You can write another paper for extra credit. His lectures may be the best I've ever heard.",1
"Dr. McNulty is an awesome professor. His teaching style and his grading method are both quite strange, but he cares that you learn the material and his love for mathematics is very apparent. I am very glad to be taking Math 544 Linear Algebra with him next semester and I hope to be able to conduct research under him in the future.",1
He just doesn't teach. He gives you his prewritten notes tells us we need ANY finance book no one is on the same topic. For HW its watching youtube videos of him going over his notes and in class he says the same exact thing in his video word for word. there was no clear structure of what to study.,0
This teacher is a real character which makes her lectures all the more interesting. If you fall behind you have plenty of opportunities for extra credit&she pretty much grades her exams on a curve&even has a 4th optional exam to bump ur lowest grade. My only advice is to read the modules each week and write down what she says during lectures,1
Dr. G's class was great. He lays out a clear path to follow and you just do the work. Writing English at a basic adult level is needed to pass. If you write like a ten year old child then you get a D. Like you literally have to be totally ignorant about writing to fail his class.,1
"Best Prof ever, I had him for Ethics and loved going to class! He's so down to earth and has a phenomenal teaching style!",1
"Class is so pointless, all you do is talk about the book he wrote. Did well in the class but would never take him again. He is creepy....just look at his picture.",0
"There always are some knowledge points that he talks about it in class but doesn't put them on the slides. So really don't skip class, you will miss a lot.",1
this teacher is okay. After the first test i realized showing up for her lectures was the dumbest thing i was doing. The test are 100 % based on you knowing the terms and identifying them in scenarios. What she talks about in class is so off topic and her slides are generic with no definitions or key notes. They will not help.,0
"Awful, didn't explain things, hard. I'm a dean's list student and I got a C. He was the worst professor ever.",0
He lectures the entire hour and asks the class many questions. Most of the time I had no idea what he was asking for. He assigns a lot of papers and is very vague in the prompts. He required us to do one speaking presentation and the rest was just writing. His handwriting is extremely hard to read and isn't very good at giving advice.,1
"For a guy who attempts to dress well (blazer + bowtie), he somehow manages to wear pants too long for his height, looking like a grimy and homeless leprechaun.",0
"Professor Brown is a very genuine teacher.  He provides power points which makes note taking significantly easier.  His tests are a combination of multiple choice, definitions and short answer and he's very lenient with partial credit for the definitions and short answer.  The textbook for this course was a bit hefty (some chapters were 50+ pages)",1
"Worst teacher Ive ever had. His study guides for the tests are 17 pages of stuff listed that you need to know. Jokes around about failing and says there is always next semester, good luck passing his class with a C. You can study and work your ass off just to barley pass. Hes a dr so expect to have as much knowledge as him and retain everything.",0
"He really is a good guy, but if you don't have a good base-knowledge of math, DON'T TAKE HIM. The webwork was pretty easy, but he gives problem sets that are usually super hard. I'm an A/B student and will be lucky if I make a C in the course. And don't bother going to his office, he gets mad/frustrated if you don't understand something. Very harsh",0
"Dr. Kass is determined to provide UMaine students with a top notch Anatomy & Physiology experience. The tests are hard (class average in the C-D range) but there's plenty of opportunities for gimme points and extra credit. Lectures are boring because Kass speaks in high level science lingo. Lab's are tough. Dr. Kass is a tough, but good, professor.",1
I got a C because I lacked on homework but I always Aced tests. It isn't that hard if you take notes and pay attention. The tests are open notes and that helps a lot. I feel like if you have to take a math class this isn't a bad choice! It also applies to real-life situations a little as well.,1
"Not only is she very clear about everything (assignments, lectures, etc.), she is a really funny, entertaining teacher.",1
"Solid prof - but let's be honest, for CHEM 181 you can basically just skip the lectures and buy NTCs and get an A.",1
"Take him! If you're a CJ major, or if you're interested in taking a criminal justice course take this man. If you take good notes, pay attention, study for the test, write good essays...you know being a good student! You'll do very well in his class. And you'll also enjoy his insight to the criminal justice system since he is a Parole officer.",1
"Worst professor at ASU. Might have been good in a post-graduate class but for a 300 level, it goes way too in-depth. I work in the industry and none of the things he teaches actually apply.",0
"Nice enough guy but a joke as a professor. Pretty much useless lectures, just study the slides and tutorials and you do well. Worst part is he took over a month to mark and return the midterms, kept saying next class and would show up empty handed. Also, its past Christmas and still no marks for the final. Very inefficient.",1
"The material in this class is very interesting; however, she is not a good teacher. She does not add any info to the slides in class, and gives you no time to take notes. There are ""pop"" quizzes every day in class in addition to bb quizzes on every chapter. The tests that are about 90 questions each are deceptive. This is a very demanding class!",0
"Cathy is an amazing prof! She is energetic and enthusiastic about the material she teaches. She always wants to help the students do a good job. She makes hard concepts seem so easy. It's too bad she only taught half of BTP200 and then Manzer had to take over the class, after that I didn't understand anything. Cathy is an excellent prof!",1
So boring. Do not think she knows what she is doing. cancels class very often. classes were a bore. she is also very lazy. she has you grade yourself on multiple things and gives five homeworks and two papers. class was easy but just a nuisance. class was mandatory but she doesn't take attendance and you grade yourself on attendance. ,0
"Dr. DeFonso is a great instructor! He is the best history instructor at Northern. His tests are almost like trivia on what he talked about in class, so pay attention to details (people, places especially). What might seem like a minor detail is frequently on tests (which are curved). Go to class & take good notes and you'll be fine. Read the books!",1
Awful. Doesn't know how to help at all. Grades out of 3 but judges subjectively so no one can ever get an A.,0
"I thought I would regret taking this class as a free elective after how time consuming CISY105 was for me, but professor Brower doesn't believe in busy work. He highlights only important parts to read from the textbook. He's also great at explaining the material. Lastly, he could probably write computer programs that would end a zombie apocalypse.",1
"Overall, Dr. Jacobs was a very entertaining lecturer and I found the class really enjoyable. However, if you're taking this class b/c you've heard it's a bird course, think again. There aren't any readings and the first assignment is easy but the paper requires A LOT of work. The multiple choice final is really tough and You MUST attend lecture. ",1
"I'm normally not the type to be negative. I'm a hard working student and do my best. This wasn't an English class, more like Political. All our papers were on politics. She would spend endless time ""sharing"" her opinion. She gave me and another a C when he didn't even finish the paper and I only had 2 errors in five pages. I do not suggest. Awful.",0
Really interested in material and shows it; expects you to do the reading but if you do the class is really interesting; willing to help once you make the first effort,1
"My favorite teacher by far.    Note taking is imperative, as a lot of things on Mymathlab you'll never see in class or on tests. Anything you take down as notes, expect to see on the exams. Show up, as he does give quizzes that count.  Explains in a very clear manner. You'll work for your grade, but he's the best math teacher I've ever taken.",1
"I have taken three courses with Fiona, and plan to take more. She is by far my favourite professor at Trent. She genuinely cares about her students and their success. She is a fair marker, a good lecturer, and goes the extra mile to give you feedback. Her office door is always open for you, even if you just want to chat. She lets you be creative. ",1
"He's an amazing professor, but the class stinks. The material is pretty dry and time-consuming with no real effort required. Despite this, Jones's determination to make class fun made it worth it. He makes up games and activities to keep the class engaged, and it makes the content much more bearable.",1
"he doesn't care he put resp. on his TAs.  TAs are not helpful. He is unorganized.  His lec. notes don't have title and are bad hand writing.  The TAs were not helpful to answer the questions and hehimself does,t care to listen.  At last some TAs curved and some didn't.  If you don't have to don't take this class. It lowers your grades and takes tim",0
"He's a great teacher, his class is well structured and he knows his stuff. A fair grader but his quizes can be a bit unpredictable at times.  You will learn German.",1
Hard stuff. Wish he would actually listen to opinions.,0
"He is a fairly straight forward professor, he will make time to discuss outside class hours any problems you have. The term work that he puts forward is fairly straight forward and easier than the exam that you will write. I found the exam to be challenging but organized, it was a fair exam just a lot of material to cover.",1
easily the worst professor at UT. would not recommend you take under any circumstances.,0
Such a gem. Always makes lectures funny and engaging. Super easy to do well on exams ( questions straight from lecture slides). Lectures are very long (2-5 hours/week). But he really does make it super easy for you to do well if you watch the lectures and take notes! Very nice and really funny.,1
"Absolutely terrible!  One of the worst communicators I've ever encountered and she's teaching a communications course.  Spelling, grammar and the entire English language are not among her strong suits.  Looks for things to justify deducting marks and when she can't find them, she makes something up.  Lots of useless assignments You learn nothing.",0
Ms. Lee motivates students to achieve the highest results. She really cares about each student progress. If you are interested in course there are no doubts that she will do her best to help you. This proffessor is the most student orient on the course. I am really happy to be a part of her class.,1
"Very confusing. Her grasp on the English language isn't up to the standards I'd expect for someone who's supposed to be a teacher. Grammar can get bad enough that I've had assignments where I genuinely couldn't understand what was being asked of me. She has even at times asked ""what is this called in English?"" and pointed at something on the board.",0
"Terrible testing method, needs to be improved.",1
Beyond the best. He is an amazing human being as well as an amazing teacher. I honestly feel blessed to have been lucky enough to accidentally been enrolled in his class. And I am not religious at all.,1
"The only fun part of the class was when he would get off topic and talk about his dogs. The lectures were dull, the course wasn't particularly well structured, and he's overly dismissive of others' ideas. Overall, nothing to get excited about. Don't bother with his philosophy of language class unless you really, really love linguistics.",0
He is simply the god of concurrency.,1
"Amazing teacher!! Because he makes you laugh, offers the opportunity to take halloween candy as many times as long as you declare you failed halloween, so yeah best time to take his class: fall semester. Oh and tonnes of extra credit, you work so hard and still don't manage to get that A don't worry extra credit got your back!",1
"Going to class is necessary, as she explains everything needed for the problem sets and exams. You learn a decent amount, and the exams and problem sets are pretty easy. The only point I would make is that in certain cases she grades rather difficultly, especially on the problem sets, marking off large quantities of points for small errors.",1
"Wow, what a boring guy.  The first day of classes, i couldn't even keep my eyes open.",0
"Ortiz is great in class, but he is also a great advisor. If you need advice for choosing classes, he points you in the right direction depending on your interests. He is in charge of ""administrative studeis"" and his students get great advisement. He even helps over the phone.",1
I have to agree with the egotist. Intimidating too.,0
Terrible. should not be teaching an introductory programming course. Taught recursion before loops. ,0
"Nothing stressed me out more than taking a class with Sun, I often left lectures feeling very confused. There are also daily quizzes that you only have two minutes to complete. Throughout the semester he also gives 9 exams. On some exams he'll mark you down for mistakes and some he won't. Literally the only reason I passed this class was tutoring.",0
"The worst lab in uottawa. biological drawing useless, lab exam not fair, I dont know what is the point that make the lab this tough, lab at least take 10 hours each week to study for it,",0
"The tests were single handedly the hardest tests I have taken at this university, and they were for a NON MAJOR CLASS. Quizzes and homework were a breeze, but the second you open the test you might as well write your name and take the L. Gallucci was funny though, although she did 100% thought we were all stupid.",0
"Hes a nice guy but his teaching style made this class unnecessarily complicated. He doesnt post notes and talks super fast, he doesnt give a study guide for exams, and the exams are worded badly which makes answering the questions frustrating. Attendance is random and so are quizzes. i dont recommend this class.",0
"He responds to emails within a few hours. VERY organized. he goes over everything that is due the next week, never leaves you guessing. He plans everything out on a calendar for you. There are no surprises. He is willing to take the time with students to go over anything they may not understand. Very helpful and easy to work with.",1
This man is one hell of a model american and a true icon to the fitness world!,1
Doesn't provide any feedback at all and is very hard to get ahold of,0
crazy... too strict on attendance.. too much work...,0
it is best teacher I ever had and he is very helpful by fix any technical problem that you might help. he also give good feedback.,1
One of the best math teachers for math 330. The lab work is a little tough but quizes and exams are easy.,1
"Mrs. N is a native speaker and definitely knows Span very well, but she is a PAIN. She has many unnecessary rules that she will not negotiate whatsoever. The Span dep. is using a new book this year that is truly AWFUL. The online homework is full of errors but she will still not give you any extra points to make up for these program issues.",0
Very lecture heavy and unorganized. The material is scattered and the amount of information crammed into one class period is incredibly confusing to say the least.,0
"Where do I begin with poor miss Thompson... Boring lectures, shes always complaining about how hot the classroom is, too serious, and she doesn't like when you ask questions during her lectures. TAKE ONLY IN MAYMESTER OR SUMMER!!!",0
"Mackay is hilarious and his textbook rocks.  If you are a Classics major then you should love his course.  If you don't then you probably either hate classics or have no sense of humour and I hope I never meet you.  Loves talking about his wife and ex-wife, (both fellow classicists)",1
"I had Dr. Thomas her very first semester at Tech. When I tell you this was my favorite class so far in my college career, please believe me. You can tell that she loves teaching. She is also a vet herself, so it's very helpful to get this kind of knowledge from her. There are easy quizzes every week, so take advantage of them! The tests are easytoo",1
"Very nice professor. He really likes this subject. ME on the other hand find it pretty long, and boring. It is an easy class, and he really puts an effort into it. Lots of writing to do. one group project",1
He mumbles alot and he sometimes goes off on tangents,0
"This guy does not know how to teach a class. His lectures are terrible, long-winded, lack even a semblance of structure, and are sometimes nonsensical. Students often have to correct his examples and marks on homework. Stay away if you want to keep your sanity.",0
Really easy course if u work just a little bit. Profs awesome. Learnt alot from it.,1
He tries to keep the class intresting by telling jokes every once in a while when he knows people are drifting off. Forgot to do the homework once cause he has it for every chapter I think. Easier then my 256 profesor tho.,1
Avoid him like the plague!,0
She is awesome!,1
"Lectures are pointless and you do not need to pay attention at all to get an A in this class. Memorize the practice exams for the tests and briefly go through the book= easy A/B. Plus, she gives extra credit. They are tedious and hard but they boost your grade. She's also super nice if you go to office hours. Her voice is boring but you can do well",1
"Belzile is one of the worst at LU he was useless, demanding, and does not respect his students",0
"Dr. Zbeida is very active in making sure you are ready for essays by providing in-class worksheets you do in groups and giving great, detailed feedback on Blackboard for essay sketches. She is extremely nice and likes for participation in class. Discussion boards are not overwhelming and textbooks for this class are cheap overall. Highly recommend.",1
"Ive taken a lot of college and english courses in my career as a student and its VERY safe to say that Professor Wardens Comp 1010 course was the highlight of suffering, anger, and rage. Her grading is nothing short of rage inducing. You can do the exact work she wants and shell still make up something about how you didnt do as you were told",0
Professor Davis is enjoyable but is unclear about almost everything relating to his class. Most of the class is used to discuss things that aren't course material and he gets off track often. When he says the exam is a matching word bank format what he means is the word bank will have little relevance and most answers will have to be recalled.,0
"Would not take with him he is always off topic, we were 4 chapters behind where we should have been give easy questions for assignments and super hard ones for test. Doesn't explain things well. Would not take again with him",0
"bad, bad and ..... oh yeah bad",0
"Easy A. Didn't even buy his textbook and got an A-. Go to class and study his power-points. Funny guy,talks about himself a lot, keeps lectures interesting. Gives bonus points for Psych studies.",1
"I went to her office hours, asked a valid question, and then laughed at me in front of my classmates. The class itself isn't hard, the issue is her. I can't tell you how many times I've woken up on a Sunday morning to an email saying we have a pre-lab quiz due that night. I would call myself a very capable person, but Vanderhoning makes 0 sense.",0
"Without a doubt, the worst professor at Wright State. And that's a serious accomplishment, because Wright State has some doozies. But he definitely takes the cake... and not only does he take the cake, he bashes his face in it, and throws it at you. WORST. PROFESSOR. EVER.",0
She is cool. The class is early but she makes it fun. The assignments are really chill. Just do them and be open. Easy A.,1
GREAT PROFESSOR AND KNOWS WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT WHEN IT COMES TO LAW,1
"Professor Madrid is an excellent lecturer, he makes his lectures interesting, he is also very knowledgeable about the subject and has high interest.  His test are straight-forward, you do have to study A LOT but  most test consist of 10 multiple choice and 2 essays. The essays are questions that if you study your notes you will answer very easily.",1
"This is one of the more nerdy professors you'll meet.  In some countries, it's a criminal to be this interested in the finer points of C syntax.  Very good at explaining himself to a class.",1
Prof. Drumond is an amazing teacher. He makes everything so easy. This is my first taking spanish and I did very good surprisingly. If you ever have a problem just talk to him he'll always find a way to help you out. He's the type of teacher that'll cut you some slack with no problem.,1
"Here are the facts about Langstraat:50 points of your grade is determined by class participation, which is easy if you attempt to answer the homework question when he calls on you.Doing the homework prepares you for the exam.48 points from attendance, he takes roll everyday.Exams are open book/notes.He does use his exams from previous semesters",1
"She is probably the nicest lady ever. CISC 101 is an easy intro class to computing, as it should be, and Mary does an excellent job teaching it. Make sure you have her if you can.",1
"Crazy Austrian Economist from the University of Vienna.  Although he knows his stuff, he is extremely dry.",1
Prof. Hunt was PHENOMENAL for BIO 215. I would highly recommend. Jodee is very funny and made lecture enjoyable. Reading the textbook is very important. Reading guides and study guides provided. Cheat sheet allowed on all exams. Little to no homework.,1
"-Rambles about the most random topics for MOST of the class -Doesn't reply to emails -VERY Late at lecture uploading (uploaded slides 1.5 weeks before the exam) -Says its not an online course, yet i went to every lecture and it made no difference -Quizzes are brutal/stupid (class avg was 40% and NO bell curve) -Exam was 435 MARKS! SAVE URSELVES",0
"I took this class by mistake. The school signed me up for this coarse that i don't even need. He doesn't speak clearly, he is to fast, a lot of people dropped this Friday and Saturday class. He is not understanding at all, and he does not comprehend very well. He says mean things to students like oh well you don;t pass not my problem. Fire him!",0
"Sperling is extremely helpful, intellectual person who cares about you as person. She's funny and a great academic adviser. Her seminar, though, could use some work. We spend the first half of class going over what we already discussed online, and then the second half repeating one another. I like her, but her class isn't my favorite.",1
"My friend and I alternate going to lectures but NEVER miss tutorial with Arie because he can explain everything we learn in lecture over a week in about 15 minutes and much more clearly. he is also a very nice, genuinely helpful person and always has a smile on his face.  good sense of humour (even when he makes minor errors in mental arithmetic)",1
mg she's horrid,0
Avoid at all cost! ,0
This was the his first time teaching the class and hopefully the last. Well to start off this is a hard class so I would avoid it. Second attendance doesn't help you at all because he just goes over silly slides that don't have anything to do with the book. AVOID!!,0
"Requires a lot of work on the student's part. Going to lectures, studying your notes, reading the handouts, doing the work, reworking the work. Can be an excellent class if you know how to do work. Do not take if you don't know what a log is. :)",1
Unbelievable amount of reading and work he makes you do. Tests are complete ****. I highly recommend staying away from this class.,1
"Best professor Ive had, really makes the subject interesting even if history isnt your thing. A lot of notes but the notes are very clear and useful. He actually cares what grade his students get and will help you out with anything.",1
"The homework is consistent every week, so you know exactly what is expected. The textbook assigned was bearable. I actually feel liked I've learned something which is fairly rare with online classes. Would recommend for those who are independent and self starters.",1
"Sr. Manker is THE funniest professor that I've ever had.  If you have a sense of humor then you would love him!  Apart from making the class fun the assignments were very clear and straighforward.  He gives extra credit opportunities and if you show up and do the assignments then you should be fine, even if you struggle with the language.",1
"No help for students outside of his packed 1 hour office hour, says he will look at Piazza, the online forum used, but checks once a month. Insanely long times to mark (Still waiting over 2 months for our first problem set, along with problem set 2,3 and test 2 mark ). I do not recommend taking a class with him.",0
I took calculus 1 this summer with him. He is a very fair professor. If you do your homework you will do well. There is nothing on the exam that is not covered in the homework. He also gives back 10-15 points for correcting the wrong answers on the exams. He will go over any questions that you have on the homework in class. Take him if you can.,1
"She might be knowledgeable regarding standards, but provides little to no guidance regarding how the students can read and understand the standards. She expects students to remember material learned in 2A, and she will NOT provide any detailed explanation related to the standard. Her marking guidance to the TAs is terrible- many inconsistencies.",0
"Dr. Goddyn explains concepts very clearly, however,many typos in his lectures, in his exams no calculator is permitted and in questions you have to apply what you learned rather than solve problems. Also, not enough time for his exams.",0
Dr. Marrone is so nice. She helps us a lot and smiles to everyone. The class is relaxing. Anybody who is afraid of using English should go to her class.,1
"Engelhardt knows his stuff. If you participate in class, it'll help your odds. However, you NEED to study a lot to do well on exams. (6-8 hours for a typical exam is fair for his class). His practice exams will take you by surprise compared to the actual exams. So ask questions, and you might just be successful. Exams have HUGE curves (10-20%).",0
"An intelligent lady, absolutely no idea how to teach the material. Whatever you do, do not take her.",0
I took her seminar class. Shes very sweet and is a pretty easy grader. Its kind of an unnecessary class but shes the perfect professor to have for it. Shes also always eager to help students.,1
"she seems a little spaced out sometimes, or shes very forgetful about things.  shes a nice person but that wont help you learn anything!",0
"Easily the worst professor at SUNY Potsdam. Avoid taking any classes with him if possible. Very rude, his projects are pop quizzes, and VERY boring. I dont think he deserves the job. Cant even do an evaluation on him at school because he doesnt hand them out. Probably because he knows they will all be bad.",0
"Very knowledgable and understands the class material really well.  Boring topic, but she does a good job relating it to the real world.  Has very high expectations, especially for honors students, so grades harshly.  Really makes you earn your grade, but she's nice and knows her stuff.",1
Professor Diduch went on vacation during the middle of the****ster and when he got back he did a poor job of explaining the theory in relation to questions on assignments. He doesn't give us any notes he just draws pictures. Overall he gets two thumbs way down.,0
He is a nice man and friendly but this class is so hard the only thing I learned was how to go nights without sleeping trying to finish the 12+ hours of work he assigns a week. this class is an absolute NIGHTMARE. Prof. seems oblivious to how much the majority of the class is struggling. The worst class i've taken at Pace,0
"Later I worked as a grader First and pretty much only thing she said ""mark hard, be picky""",0
"While Dr. Turkovic gives interesting lectures, the only thing his class is made up of are 4 tests, all in essay form and participating in class discussion. If you don't do well on those tests, you're pretty much screwed. I would not recommend taking this class if you are not a good test taker.",0
"I thought this class was really interesting.He has alot of energy for this subject, and he is a nice guy in and out of class. i took it pass/ no pass (that was a mistake) i would have gotten a B+ and i did not do much work and skipped the project.Nice guy, approachable, and attendance not mandatory.Lectures online",1
"He takes off 2 points from your FINAL GRADE: for every time you're late, absent, leave early, use your phone, or talk. He grades hard, lectures are long, monotone and boring. only take if you have to - if you wanna pass read the assigned stuff/skim do 3 out 5 quizzes all onlin, midterm/final STUDY!! go hard on analysis. speak in class 3 ec points",0
"She is very rude, and does not know how to talk to a normal human being. She rarely helps, and when she does, she is very demeaning to students.",0
"Watched most of the course online, which turned out to be alright.  Found this professor slightly rude towards students.  I personally wouldn't recommend him as a professor for first year students.",0
He was the first professor I ever took at SUNY Westbury . I was horrific to choose such a hard class but I really learned a lot. He is such a good professor! Love his feedback . Take him if you can !,1
"Fun and interesting, but he is blunt. I have given many hours to this course and I still think I may fail.  I am trying everything to succeed and he tells me if you don't understand physics, I can't make you.  He is harsh, for a 100 level course he teaches it like it is a 400 level.  Hoping I can succeed in the end.",0
"Submissions for his class are done in a completely incomprehensible manner - there is no real indication of where to hand which assignment in. He seems to have a serious confidence issue that results in him belittling students, choosing clear favourites, and deliberately obfuscating answers to simple questions. ""You're a technician. Figure it out.""",0
"Prof does lots of examples during class without explaining what we are doing. You have to teach yourself most of the course content. He posts review questions before midterms and the final exam, which reflect test questions.",0
"Pace of the course was a bit off: we moved really slowly before the term test and suddenly started sprinting through the rest of the material afterwards. Doesn't really give you any intuition about the topics, but he does walk through the textbook proofs in an understandable way. Follows almost every definition with hundreds of examples.",1
"All we were graded on was 2 quizzes and the exams, which were mostly truefalse and multiple choice (straight from book vocab), I wasn't always so sure what to study for the short answerdiagram section though, he wasn't very clear on what he expected from that. I always skipped class because it was at 8:30 but that didn't usually hurt me on tests.",1
Really nice guy. Very knowledgable and want's to see you succeed. Would recommend him to anyone.,1
"I really like her. She gives you all the information you need for a test up front. No surprises. Her lectures are really boring, but she makes sure you have all the info. She's really understanding, and nice to talk to.",1
"Very good instructor. Challenges us, but is helpful. Highly recommend taking a class with Prof. Judge.",1
"A lot of discussion board writing and 3 exams. He is a tough grader but as long as you try, I don't think you will fail this class. He wants you to improve on every discussion board and offers tips on how to write your discussions better. Highly recommend!",1
She seems overly eager to force students to adopt her points of view,1
Amazing prof with a passion for computer science. Her enthusiasm makes the class fun. Quizzes are based on things done in class so make sure to attend to pass them. Took this class for science credit but am now looking at it as a major.,1
"Awesome OrgoII professor! I really enjoyed the enthusiasm that he brings to lectures. OrgoII is not a cake walk, but his lectures are easy to keep up with. Attendance is not mandatory but he will give random pop quizzes that don't count as a grade, but will be factored in at the end of the semester to see if you attended. Would highly recommend!",1
"Ok, she is so confusing with her grading scales. She is very slack on the class too, I would not recommend taking her. Only 3 tests, all essays. When you do group work you will do fine, but when it comes to the essays look out....you will be lucky to pass with a C.",0
Spanish sucks and there is no reason to make us take high levels of foreign language. this prof made it bearable.,0
"Dr. Gardner is very funny and respected. His teaching style does not alter throughout the semester and you are graded based on three exams, two major papers, and class participation. Expect to write a lot for the papers and exams. He is also a tough grader, but going to office hours does help. Also be aware that the class can be boring sometimes.",1
"Dr Meglich was a terrible grader. She laughs with you in class and acts all friendly seeing you outside class but when it comes to grading she is just too terrible. Nobody got an A in her class and she didn't even give opportunity for B+ grades or A- grades she just stuck to the traditional A,B,C. I narrowly escaped a C. NEVER TAKE HER CLASS!",0
This class was easy he put his old exams on blackboard. They were basically the same test as what he put online. Quizzes were not hard. You would have to try to fail.,1
"Professor Griffin is an incredible professor who is clearly passionate about education. She isn't very clear on how she grades and she can be confusing at times but she does care about her students doing well. Professor G makes you want to be the best educator you can be. Loved her ""story times"" throughout the semester!",1
Do not take this professor!! He put the hardest questions on the test.,0
"This class is like a semester of therapy in the best way. I feel like I learned a bunch about myself and how I communicate and have new tools in my toolbox to better myself! Definitely one of the most influential classes and professors I've had, my only regret is that I couldn't take it in person! I think that only would've made it better",1
"This class was absolutely the most tedious class I have ever taken.  Everything had to be perfect, and he was not very helpful. He answers questions with a question. (student)""Dr. Walsh, is this the right chemical formula to use?""...(Dr. Walsh)""I don't know, is it?""  If would highly advise a different professor if you possibly could.",0
Best prof i have had,1
Yes you dont have actual test in the class. but the encyclopedia is a pain in the but! he gets annoying with the grading. Overall he is a good professor but wouldn't recommend this specific class to another.,0
"oh my dear...horrible horrible horrible. i have no idea how he got into education. he speaks in a diffferent language and he might be brillant, but he has a bunch of useless knowledge that cannot teach the class..seriously.. if you're smart..avoid. he's rude too.",0
"Attendance is taken and necessary for a good grade, as tests are based on class lectures.  Book is not necessary, but found a teacher edition at Half Priced Books for $30, good to keep as reference material.  Kim is a great person, caring teacher, and interesting lecturer.  You will learn a lot about art, history, culture, and life in general.",1
"Her class isn't an 'easy A'.  She gets off topic/ out of order occasionally and goes too fast for notes. At first the class was interesting but as the semester went on, I regretted not dropping this class (so much reading!). She grades insanely hard but she has good feedback that is helpful in rewriting papers or finding sources.",1
"Got to be the worst professor at PCC. His lectures are so boring, I would actually find it more entertaining to watch paint dry on the wall. And his tests are ridiculous. I feel bad whoever is taking him next semester, they don't know what their signing up for - AVOID this guy.",0
I suggest taking this class with a different professor. His lectures are almost impossible to stay awake during and rarely cover the correct material. He also cannot go 5 seconds without saying uh or um and has a horrible sense of humor.,0
"When I took his online class, I would have to email him 3 or 4 times before he would respond to me.  The class material is easy, but he is not helpful at all.",0
"Her style of teaching is kind of scattered, so she's hard to follow at times. and she's very lecture heavy. But she's very knowledgeable and very sweet and the class itself is very interesting. Make sure to read the syllabus and keep track of assignment due dates!!",0
Prof. Mohun is a very nice person.  However her class can be pretty boring.  She never takes attendance during lecture so i never went however there is weekly sections that are attendance based.  Overall a pretty easy class.,1
"Long and dense lecture followed by a quiz that has little to do with anything he just taught, D- to C- average on almost all of them. Does not know how to effectively communicate and teach material. Changed grade weight distribution last week of school dropping scores anywhere from 4-8 points.",0
This teacher has a tendency to have favorites! She needs to give credit where credit is due and to whom!,0
"I really liked the content of the class. It was online but she was really nice to us because of coronavirus. I had to move and there was a lot of stress, plus I had other work and class demands that piled up. She cared about us and went out of her way to adjust the class to minimize stress on us. I appreciated it!",1
"Attendance not mandatory, but in math if you want to pass you must go! Mrs. Warne was really nice & helpful towards me & anyone else who asked for help. She's fair with her grading. Online homework & you have unlimited attempts so you can get a 100%. 5 quizzes (curves and can replace lowest), 2 tests, and a final. Tests aren't hard if you study lol",1
"I'm glad that I got a passing grade... but I know my writing is worth more than a B+. He never gave us any grades while class was in session... so we never actually knew how we were doing and whether we needed to improve or not. He focuses far too much on Indesign, which isn't right because it is a WRITING class not a design course.",0
"This instructor is terrible at getting back to students, grading, and completely unorganized. This was the worst course I have ever had. I would not EVER take a course from this instructor.",0
She was amazing and super passionate about her class. She wants you to to succeed and makes class fun even through online class. Lots of fun video clips to watch and be able to relate to. The test are a tad hard but not too bad if you study and she holds a class chat before to test to help with uknown answers to her study guides. She is fantastic!,1
"Five 50 point tests and one 150 point paper. The only time you use the textbook is for the paper. All of the exams are based off of his powerpoint presentations. Such a truly nice guy. I had an 89.75% and he rounded me up to an A. Really cares about his students. He lectures every day from his powerpoints. Low maintenance class, super easy.",1
"He teaches an online Leadership and Vocation class. Miss a single comma in a paper and you lose 8% of your grade yet his posts are poorly written, grammatically incorrect and often have spelling errors. He also likes to play devil's advocate with posts which is ok, if they make sense but usually they are outlandish or foolish suggestions.",0
Amazing Lectures Caring,1
"Kremer is that cool guy that started teaching a language 26 years ago and never got updated. His classes have nothing to do with his assignments, these assignments are HUGE and so bad written that makes me bleed and because of those being that bad even the TAs can't mark them. Half semester and no grade was given to us. Avoid Kremer at all cost!",0
"Ok, I've had Scordi for several classes. If you're smart and work hard, you'll get an A, simple. However, in class, he's impatient, rude, and will not hesitate to implicitly call you stupid. If you're reading this Professor, consider the fact that some students don't know everything, and that's why they ask questions...",1
"She is an amazing professor, she doesnt judge anyone at all. she is extremely helpful and understanding. only wants the best for you. Workload in class is decent and at a steady pace. i guarantee you;ll love her by the end of the semester.",1
Definitely the least helpful professor I had at SU. Doesn't really care if you pass or fail. Not accessible outside of class. Take anyone else if possible.,0
I love my Doc T!,1
"My best buddy and I took this class together. He's a conservative thinker and put a lot of effort into very thought out papers. Grade was in the Bs. Me, couldn't care less about this class there were more important things on my mind. Wrote lacking papers, but was what she wanted to read: how Democrats are basically better than Reps, got an A.",0
"Thank you Sir! Great class structure, especially for single working mothers. Amazing information to learn!",1
This class was by far the toughest class Ive taken thus far. Tests were extremely difficult as there were no study guides given and when asked what would need to be studied we were told our 18 pages of outlines. Tests were very heavy as there were only 4 in the semester 2 of which were the final and midterm.,0
"Honestly, listen to the negative reviews. She definitely loves her job, but she's beyond disorganized. I dropped the class after day 3. It feels like your ""honors"" speech class is actually remedial. She also had the idea to combine with a totally different class to restrict our speeches. Nice person, bad teacher. Don't waste time with her.",0
"I took this class because my aunt (who is younger than me and much smarter) took it and recommended this professor. When I took the class the teacher never had time to talk outside of class and would always tell me to go to the mathlab. He gives tons of tests, 1-2 per week and goes EXTREMELY fast! Math isn't my thing and he did not help!",0
take her and love every minute of it,1
I dropped out of my program because this man is that bad of a teacher.,0
Took him for Statistics for Science Majors in the summer session. Class moves really fast so make sure to see him after class or in office hours if you got really lost. There was lots of web assign hw which took time to do but ended up being good practice for his exams. The class is tough but fair. If you work hard you'll do well.,1
This teacher is very difficult and she isn't clear with her viewpoints on the material. She grades as if she was an english teacher and she grades poorly! STRAY AWAY FROM THIS CLASS AND DON'T TAKE THIS TEACHER! ,0
"A great all around person/professor. She's amazing, easy to work with, understanding, attentive, passionate about her subject, etc. The material was great (3 essays throughout the semester). She never ever made the class boring. I seriously love her and worked my schedule around so I could take her again, she's just that great. Please take her!!",1
Not a bad prof. Is a bit disorganized and takes forever to input final grades. Attendance is mandatory but she doesn't pick on people in class. Assignments and final exam are fair.,0
Dr. Coil is awesome!  Great professor! I would recommend him to anyone in IT.,1
"Worst online professor I've ever had. You're just going to read the textbook, that's it. There is absolutely no instruction from him whatsoever. He posts power point slides for each of the chapters, but there is no review of the course material. He simply relies on Revel. He won't even post grades in Canvas, you have to go to Revel for that.",0
"I took him for INBS 347. He's really not a bad professor at all, he has real life experience and often shares his experiences with the class so he gives everyone an idea of what it's like in the business world. 8 case studies that are in sets of 2 (4 case studies in February and April) and one term paper which is an export plan. would take again!",1
The actual class was not too difficult but professor Kaelin is unclear in lectures and discussions. He is also rude and has no respect for the students. Tests are ridiculously hard but he ends up grading mostly based on attendance and the big group project.,0
"He is a great professor and his lectures are very clear and complete. This was an interesting class and it confirmed my interest in my major, but his tests are HARD.",1
"Maan Omran is one of the finest professors I have ever encountered. Twenty-four years after taking his Finite Mathematics class, I still remember his name, his teaching style, and, more importantly, how much I really enjoyed learning math while in his class. His teaching style is very much ""Festina Lente"" (make haste, slowly).",1
He didn't respect students and only help his favorite students. He made me lose my interest in graphic design.,0
"Awesome prof. You will love taking Literature with her, she knows so much!",1
"I had Mrs. McCormick for pharm and she was very unclear. She's a sweet person with a sense of humor, but this is not her subject. You definitely have to study the powerpoints and use the book for reference - she does take questions from the book that she didn't stress in class. Even if pharm isn't your subject, if you study well you can get a B.",0
"Avoid him if this is not your major. Intensive readingwriting. I studied for hours for his exams and still did horrible. Multiple choice exams with an essay; timed. One big paper along with museum visit. Confusing, unclear, and deep down I definitely dreaded attending his class.",0
"This woman is great! She is all over the place. She loves theatre so she loves to talk about it. You have to write a lot of papers, but they are pretty easy to write and she grades them easy. The tests are just like the study guides, so if you study them you should be able to make A's.",1
This is the best history class I have ever taken since I took APUSH in high school. Knupfer is so GREAT! The class isnt based on right or wrong but the opinion and interpretations you form from the text and documents. There's a lot of reading and papers but its so worth it. He obviously cares about his students and will work with you so you succeed,1
If test taking is not your strong suit definitely take her. There are a lot of assignment in this class that are worth a lot of points and if you do well on them you will get a good grade in the class. She offers a lot of extra credit as well! The tests are hard but if you do EC and HW Assignments then your grade will be fine!,1
"Chali is awful. Questions you ask are often met with mean and or degrading responses. His marking feels like he is rolling dice to decide it. One assignment I get a 93 the next a 26 and I honestly have no idea why even after asking for help. He also gives no rubric so you are stuck guessing what he wants, get it wrong you fail the exam and class.",0
"I had Goudge for Intro to Geography and as a freshman I was blindsided. He lectures on and on, barely covering the material. All of the tests are over textbook material, to keep up with it you have to read 1 chapter every week starting as soon as you get the book. AVOID TAKING HIS CLASS AT ALL COSTS!!!",0
One of the Toughest professor at ccny.,0
"She is a nice person, but so scatterbrained it's very difficult to follow most of her lectures. Don't bother reading the text book the tests are all memorization of specific words from the notes. really hit or miss, requires more effort than other introductory classes.",0
"Orgo is never easy but this man will do everything to make sure you understand. He is interesting, fun, and definitely cares so much about his students. I would 100% take again.",1
"Shes a very nice lady, but this class was a waste of time. It was like she wanted to teach a race and gender studies class, but got stuck with writing and rhetoric so she had to shoehorn it into Computers and Writing. This course did not improve my writing, lecture mostly consisted of discussing pop culture, and the final was a group project.",0
"Dr. Littlfield is very smart, but he can't be bothered by grad students.  I got an A but have no idea why.  I asked for my paper back several times and he returned it.  It's a shame because he could do so much more.  I learned more about Early American history and US slavery during my undergrad classes.  Take Holton, Maskiell, or Childs",0
"Professor Wilson is a weak excuse of a professor/teacher. He takes forever to grade any assignment, has very little interest in his students, and provides little assistance when asked. He requires high standards for his students when his emails/announcements are full of grammatical errors. Lastly, he did not grade our final paper with any comments.",0
took this online and it is an easy easy easy A. If you cannot write a paper then don't take this class. Only 3 papers and a midterm and final. The midterm and final you print off and then submit later. You have to be an idot not to get an A in this class.,1
"I had Will for my Holocaust Theology course in Salzburg during the summer of 2011. I can see why people don't like him for THE 101, but I thought he was very knowledgeable and his class was actually one of my favorites at UP. There was one presentation and an essay final. Both were easy and I pulled off a B+.",1
"Professor Pell speaks very quickly, it can be hard to catch her pace most of the time but if you do your revision after every class, you should be fine. Also, do your homework and attend classes, score the free marks it will help tremendously.",0
"Definitely an easy class. Kind of annoying and tedious at time, but interesting nonetheless. Weekly two page papers are almost always opinion based and super easy, and the tests aren't terrible as long as you do the study guide.",1
"good teacher, but could improve by having clearer objectives, is set in her ways",0
Very nice professor. Always ready to help. I took an online class and never felt like that I am in an online class. Always ready to meet you and very fast in replying emails. I would love to take class with him again and again.,1
"Conspirationniste, mais nous enseigne à pousser nos recherches plus loin et diversifier ses sources. On apprend par exemple que notre système judiciaire est corrompu, parceque son ami incarcéré lui a raconté quil nétait pas coupable, que lextrême droite recrute à lUQAM et si on a le temps, on apprend comment analyser des textes. Cours facile.",0
"Yes he does have an accent. However this is not the only thing about him! He is very passionate and respected when it comes to this class. Essay heavy. Personally not my style of learning, however it works for some.",1
"Super nice, but note that TAs are worthless",0
"If you can take this class with a different professor, do it. He is probably good at teaching upper levels but really lacks in these gen ed courses.",0
"Adored this Professor! Communication, feedback and suggestions there when you need them. AAA+++ Professor!",1
"Dr. Belus is very knowledgable and sweet. She gives great positive feedback. I have taken two of her courses now and have learned so much from both. Be ready to read and write a lot in her courses, but she keeps the writing prompts and readings interesting. There are quite a few quizzes, but they are simple if you read the texts.",1
"This was a colonial latin america class and I will admit he isn't always the most thrilling professor, but he really knows his stuff and is widely respected in the academic community.  His passion is evident and the work isn't hard as long as you read the books and pay attention in class.  I really appreciate the faith he shows in his students.",1
Knows what he is talking about. Very good lecturer. Tests are difficult. Final exam is one of the most difficult exams you could take.,1
"2 exams, 8 cases, participation, group project. Test are very hard and study guides aren't a guide at all. Pay attention to his slides. He is very unorganized on what is expected until all students are confused. Make sure you ask questions if you do not understand and participate in group case discussion as it is a big part of your grade.",1
One of the easier upper liberals and this prob is a pure joker.  Entertaining course.,1
"Himelfarb was unfortunately a huge disappointment. I was very excited to take a politics course in an academic environment looking at issues with a neutral tone. THIS IS NOT THE CASE, Himelfarb teaches his own ideas as truth, and looks for any reason to belittle, embarrass, and debate any student in class. No wonder nobody participates....",0
"I like him as a person but he is a terrible professor. There is homework everyday and this stuff is complex stuff too. I mostly chegg everything but Im looking at a D to pass in this class. He teaches it like youre in graduate Electrical Engineering college, not an undergraduate Mechanical Engineering. Im glad I can take him only this once.",0
Dr. Ireland is an amazing teacher he made my first semester at NU fly by and gave so much assistance as a teacher and advisor. I stronngly reccomend his class he is a funny guy who also gets his work done,1
"Tom was hands down the BEST teacher I've had in my two years at WCCC. His lectures are extremely interesting, especially once you get to feral children, and it is clear that he is passionate about sociology. Grades are based on writing assignments that are a breeze if you pay attention in class. Would absolutely take Dr. Soltis again.",1
"I took him for Ultimate Questions and he made a religious class more open and discussion based, which was good for people who weren't religious. He depended on the books for his lectures and his tests, but he gave funny and romantic stories with his lectures. It is hard to know when it take notes due to the stories, but just write down the concepts",1
"Luigi's teaching skills are perfect. Glad to have him for my MATH. In class, he solved all of my questions even if I couldn't express it properly or the problems were not really related to the lecture (that's the best of him, very approachable). Outside of class, you will see who is the BUSIEST MAN on earth.",1
"Worst class I've taken at JMU. Henigman is all over the place and difficult to follow. Canvas is extremly difficult to navigate. Lectures are boring, she doesnt make material intersting. Mandatory attendence but you cant gain points. Four shortpapers throughout the semester and 12 page final paper that she is very unclear about. Avoid if you can.",0
"The more questions you ask, the more she will be interested in your success. Monique is one of the more caring teachers at the university. Some people won't like her, but if you get to know her a bit you will enjoy her a lot.",1
"We had to switch to online due to Covid-19 and he was nonexistent for 2 weeks, then did measly 2 hour zoom sessions once a week and never answered emails. In person he was constantly late to class(one day almost 2 hours late)and would leave early and take long lunch breaks. He's good when you can get him to focus and actually lecture, but if not...",0
The best instructor I have ever had !,1
"Sweet lady! Very smart, but teaches as if we already know the material. I somehow passed her class, with lots of praying and extra credit. Wouldn't take her again, her teaching style isn't the best, especially with such a difficult subject.",0
"An old school lecture based teacher, if given 75 minutes or 145 minutes he will use every single minute. A bit biased because im a history buff, but absolutely knows his stuff and doesnt just know it all, but tells it passionately. Assignment wise, he doesnt have a lot but when there is theyre grinders with a lot of reading and fact checking.",1
The teacher hates criticism. Everything during the class is verbal. If you don't read the chapter before the class you are screwed.,0
"If he gets off topic good luck, and be prepared to be like 8 classes behind every other psci101 all year. Nice guy though, knows a lot about what he's talking about just seems to forget we don't have PhDs too.",0
I would not recommend taking his class. He can be rude. The test are exactly like the homework so you actually have to do it even though he doesn't grade it. I should have listened to the other reviews for his class.,0
One of the easiest class I have ever taken. Basically all the assignments are online and as long as you do them and submit on time you are sure to pass. I barely showed up to class and still ended up with an A. Assignments are easy and it is clear what he expects from each assignment. TAKE HIM! ,1
"If you're looking for an easy A, don't take this class. It's way hard. Hardest tests I've ever taken. That being said, he has a big curve at the end, as well as big extra credit opportunities. Didn't touch the textbook - tests are lecture heavy. If you're chill with getting an A- or B+ then this is an pretty easy way to get AHTG out of the way",1
Great teacher online and in class.,1
All the bad reviews (especially for his online class) are 100% true. He's a little hard to understand with his accent and I usually ask a ton of questions in math but he's very unapproachable and will yell at you and make kids feel dumb. The homework is okay but the only way I'm surviving is going to tutoring and teaching myself. Don't take him!,0
"Great professor!!! 10 essays, two in class written exams- watch is you-tube videos so you can study.. you must study.",1
"This guy doesn't really teach, just reads the power point slides and then uses oracle (intended for high school).  This would be fine, except oracle assumes you're using the book that goes along with it, but he has you buy different book.  So basically, you have no idea what's going on, and he definitely does nothing to help out.",0
"Everyone says Lash is terrible, and it's for a reason. If you search for meaning in this class you can find it, and people are overly cruel. But that's because no one likes being talked down to while their time is being wasted. Lash is a bad teacher. The content is whatever, but he presents it horribly. Replace him.",0
"Meadows is by far the worst professor I had at CMU. Her class is near impossible to pass, I study hard and do my PsychLogs and I still receive bad grades. She is rude to students and not helpful what so ever. I have not had a professor as bad as her ever at CMU. I do not recommend her  or her class!",0
"Miranda is the worst teacher I have ever had. She is rude when asked questions, likely because she doesn't know the answer herself. Her slides are useless and incorrect (noticed an error in her slides and she told us to assume they were wrong). The only thing you will learn from this class is how to resent her and how neat she thinks diatoms are.",0
Very patient and is willing to take any questions and answers them clearly.,1
"Literally the best class ever. 5 essays that are 400 words minimum each, she gives us 2 topics to choose from and you just have to read the book and write about it. Finished majority of mine in 1-2 hrs because its so easy. Shes also a very easy grader and the quizzes you get 2 tries and you find almost everything in the PowerPoint.",1
"Easy going, flexible, and very helpful",1
"Dr. Yeager is probably the least helpful prof I've ever taken. Bring him a problem your program has and he'll tell you, ""you should probably fix that"". I'm not sure if this is a calculated effort to force you to learn (he is a nice guy), or if he's actually clueless. Lectures will actually lessen your understanding of the material.",0
Great teacher. Best lecures,1
He is a Great Professor! I learned more from him than anyone else in the department. He also inspired me to be a teacher of Communication.,1
"She's a nice enough lady and the class is pretty easy, but it was quite boring.  I feel like she tried to impose her beliefs as what is right.  Lots of information she gave didn't seem to be based on facts whatsoever.  Basically, if you write what she believes, you'll get an A.",1
Such an easy A!!! take this class if you can. Its 3 hours long and if you create your syllabus like I did you never have to go and you can still get an unconditional A based off of what you want to learn. He really loves what he does and is super kind. Never did work outside of class.,1
This was a hard class and not even for my major. I also took it through covid-19 so it made the labs harder. Also used proctorU for exams and they're hard to work with.,0
DO NOT PLAGIARIZE. Careful how you reply to the discussions. I would not take any of his classes.,0
Professor Snyder is an awesome professor. She moves a little fast so you have to keep up with her but she uploads all of her lectures to oaks and she is super caring about the students you just have to reach out to her. She gives connect homework and smartbook homework but it is just to make sure you learn the content. Would definitely recommend!,1
"Great teacher, this guy is like a father to me. Ok, I am just joking about that. But he is a teacher that teaches, not just preaches.  Easy A, what is wrong with that. You do learn, it is really up to you to learn, the teacher is there to calrify the subject not to study for you.",1
"she's horrible, annoying to listen to, and picks favorites, it's VERY hard to get a good mark in her tests, even if u have asked her for help and she does, you'll still do bad...NOT recommended",0
Dominic has a very good memory. Don't even think of skipping a class because he can remember all the names in the first two lectures. He doesn't upload the slides until 1 hour before the class. Such a measure is to encourage you to read all the required materials before the lecture. It was fun studying accounting under his guidance.,1
"Worst professor ever. Encourages discussion on questions and nods yes to basically half of the classes' answers. Come exam, write the same answer - given 0, because it doesn't match marking key. ",0
"As long as you show up to class, pay attention and read the textbook you'll be fine!",1
Professor Vanderpot is hilarious he will keep you laughing all class! There is a lot of short papers due but he is very clear of what its expected. Easy grader! Participation is a must! He will put you on the spot and make you share your opinion even if you don't have one! He makes you get out of your comfort zone! He uses no technology at all!,1
"Calling it a tough class is an understatement,  Prof. Alberi is decent about putting stuff on blackboard but when it comes to class, if you don't understand it the first time she's not taking questions, if you wanna pass you pretty much have to learn it all on your own.",0
Not very intresting. Reads off powerpoint. Often gets things wrong. Exams are difficult.,0
Graded mainly on 3 essays. You learn nothing useful in lectures because he is too busy talking about his own life or other people's lives. You will need to read a few articles but they're all pretty pointless. He is caring and wants to be close to his students but not a great professor. You won't learn anything. Most people get Cs on essays.,0
"I took PHIL101 for a GenEd and it was the hardest class EVER. I attended every lecture (which were boring and repetitive) and study hours. If you didn't agree with Debrot, you were wrong. We only had 3 tests and then a final that was very vague. He didn't put any of our grades into Canvas so we had no idea if we were passing or not. I did not pass.",0
Worst professor I've ever met. She basically knows nothing but is always condescending. Try to ask her questions and you will know. Don't take unless you have to.,0
very nice and down to earth...tendency to ramble,1
If you show up and pay attention you'll do just fine.,1
"This guy is a robot, will get very boring when he repeats himself everyclass. Also If youre an environmental activist dont choose him, he wastes paper like I mad man. I blame global warming on him",0
"Professor Chung is a very responsible professors in Pace University. Without him, I won't have any idea of accounting research. He is also very kind person who promised to be my recommender for the Phd program applications. Forget about those drowning kids who just want free ""A"". If you really want learn something, choose Professor Chung.",1
"She plays favoritism alot. If she doesnt like the way you do things, forget your grade. Take another teacher if possible",0
"Tests are insanely disproportionate in difficulty compared to what is taught; much of my final was things I hadn't learned yet. TAs lead sections but its a hit or miss, some explain concepts and others skim past them. Online schooling meant my peers and I were left struggling to stay afloat in this 2 credit course.",0
The class is alright just to fill your GLER. Don't expect too much from it though. A quick glance at the coursepacks Bruce & Kevin design make it pretty clear that the class is more about advancing a social agenda than a truly liberal education.,0
Professor Jones made psychology interesting and fun to learn! I highly recommend this professor due to his engaging and hilarious lectures!,1
"Dr. Gross is a great teacher.  Everyone taking English classes ought to have him at some point or another.  He is a fairly difficult grader, but you get so much more out of him than simply literature.",1
"great prof, fair marker, go to class and you should do good",1
"Hey John Carroll, don't make a sociology professor teach a psychology class unless you want all the students to fail. Horrible teacher. Would not recommend. Tests are hard and so are the worksheets. Attendance not mandatory. Grade based on 4 tests. ",0
"Dr. Loewen is really nice, and genuinely wants to help students learn. However, he tends to over complicate things and a simple subject can be explained in such a way that confuses even Einstein.",1
"Good teacher but gives a ridiculous amount of homework. Try 5-10 assignments a week; oh & there are 5 papers. Additionally, many of the assignments seem like busy work that she doesn't even grade based on effort/quality. If you do poorly on an essay or miss an assignment, it wont matter bc there are so many assignments to balance out low scores.",0
"You will have to: A: Learn all material on your own, her lectures are not helpful, also a strong accent. B: Memorize the entire Calender: Her online scheduling is bad C: Not have any issues, Her email response rate is poor. D: Have the patience to do this for an entire semester, while worrying about your grade. Just find a new teacher.",0
"Took this over the summer, the class material is not hard at all but it is a ridiculous amount of work. For a 6-week summer session, we had 3 quizzes due EVERDAY + 3 exams in total. He doesn't admit his mistakes easily and goes against his own sources sometimes. It is an easy A if you are willing to put in the time and deal with inconsistencies.",1
"Easy professor. You do 3 presentations and they are, introduction of yourself, to inform, & to persuade. All your work is online and is all due at the end of the semester. There are NO TESTS AND NO FINAL EXAM. Take him if you want to get an A.",1
"hasn't worked in journalism in decades, he is so outdated and doesn't know WHAT he's doing, as he has no experience. STAY. AWAY.",0
I took this class two semesters ago but when I did we got a textbook and he said getting a Pearson access code wasn't necessary. GET THE ONLINE ACCESS CODE WITH THE STUDY MATERIALS IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT. That would've saved my life if I knew his class was going to be like that. Powerpoint lectures in a boring voice. Grade only based on 2 tests!,0
"I don't understand how everyone likes him. This is by far the worst class I have taken as a biology major. He writes on the board very quickly with his back to the class most of the time. I went to every class, wrote down everything he said, and memorized my notes and never did better than a 75 on an exam. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS",0
"He is passionate for what he is teaching and it shows, but he is very monotonous and rambles on. It feels like he talks forever and he can take a while to get the point. You need to watch the lectures and shows up to class because everything he says is important. Take notes on what he is saying and you will be fine. No too many assignments. Easy.",0
Mr. Simpson is an amazing professor. You have a midterm (worth 50 points) and a final (worth 50 points). The lectures are informative and he has no trick questions on tests. He will have to miss days on occasion but when he goes he has the optional opportunity for extra credit. Although attendance isn't graded it is really important to prepare.,1
Tom D'Angelo is a great person and professor. You can tell he really loves what he teaches and cares for his students. I wish more professors were like him! Always open to a discussion and never judgmental about your opinions. Homework is one weekly journal done from the textbook readings. Just show up and read and you will do great!,1
"I personally found her unclear during her lectures. She would often present with her back to the class blocking material, and go off on unnecessary tangents. She is a very smart woman who is also very caring about her class however she is not good at efficiently conveying the content to the class. Another prof could have delivered it better.",0
"Great professor. Many people seem to not like him, but I feel as though they are just very frustrated with the difficulty of the class. He is good at explaining and constantly asks if anyone has questions. Would definitely take him again.",1
"Good professor. Sometimes lectures are too fast-paced, but nothing that you can't catch up on with the textbook. He's got many ""fancy colours"" of markers and ""animals"" as graphs. :)",1
Pas capable d'expliquer la matière en classe  et donne des explication qui ne sont pas clair pour les projets. Mais si tu va la voir elle va t'aider!,0
There are many other good CS professors. why will you bother her?,0
"Not a bad professor, grade comes from 4 tests. Attendance is not mandatory but it will help you pass the class to listen to his lectures. There was a textbook to read, and the tests had a few questions from the textbook",1
"I really liked Dr.G! He made 321, which was online this semester, still a very interesting class. You can tell he really cares for his students and wants them to succeed. He gives a fair amount of homework and is always willing to give extra help. If you have the chance to have him as a prof definitely take him!",1
"Dr. Vohs is great. He's a brilliant professor in my opinion. He's the best lecturer I've taken to date, he's clear and concise, he has good analogies to help students understand what he's teaching. He really dislikes swearing, so avoid swearing in front of him (I accidentally dropped a swear word and now he isn't particularly fond of me)",1
"He wasn't the worst math teacher, but I've definitely had better. Make sure you keep up with the homework and quizzes, and don't bother buying the textbook. He does give you extra credit for showing up, but if you can take another teacher I would.",0
Interesting guy. Manages to make subject slightly interesting and prepares you well for tests,1
"He is the worst professor in all of SHU and i regret taking him. He barely knows any of the stuff he teaches on the board and gets all the answers for his questions wrong. If u ask him a question, he hesitates and just says some random crap. But, theres no homework and all his tests are easy, but you basically have to teach yourself",0
great teacher. shows he loves to teach algebra. uses the book to pick out problems to work thru and gives review credit before ea test. works with you since courses are evening and aware everyone works - but don't take advantage as sees thru that.,1
"Easy class if you are good at memorization (makes you memorize ridiculous things like scientific names of species). Never paid attention in class and just studied off the slides/notes he posted and got an A. Test is extremely detailed and requires you to know a lot of diagrams. Also very tricky with options like ""two/all/none of the above"" etc.",1
"DON'T TAKE THE ONLINE BIOCHEM CLASS, IT'S HARD TO LEARN IT ON YOUR OWN! SERIOUSLY! DON'T DO IT!",0
"Really terrible prof. never really said anything important, all material was pulled from the textbook, and most was common sense. I stopped attending lectures because they were a waste of time since the notes were posted online, and he really had nothing to add that was useful.",0
"hated her teaching style, reminds me of high school. she talks bad about students who are not there to the whole class. never had a professor that takes points away for using the bathroom. very strict with attendance, but yet showed up 15 minutes to our final exam. very ignorant about other cultures. wouldnt take her class ever again.",0
stupid course...,0
Rombo is a very nice person but a poor teacher. She is very knowledgable but is not very good at explaining the concepts. She gives study guides but be prepared to study 2-3 weeks before an exam because they're not specific or accurate to what she says in class. Her lectures talk in circles sometimes and we spend half of class talking about nothing,0
"To put it simply, do not take him. He is a kinda cool/cringey dude. He never makes sense on lectures and never is clear on what he wants on assignments. He gives you a copy of (some) powerpoints but doesn't really help. He refuses to work with you on your grade, even if you try to argue that you are correct on your projects. Would never recommend.",0
"Dont know why this lady is teaching. Grades very harshly. Ruins your grade even when nothing was wrong with your assignments (paper worth a B  a D- to her). Nitpicks at tiny tiny things to make you fail. Extra credit only if you buy it on ATI and its only 1 point. Stay away. She is bitter, cold, & entitled. Rude & will not help you at all.",0
"His classes are very informative and interactive. Unless you have the time to really stick to the text book and lectures, you'll have a really hard time in his class. He is a really hard marker and has very specific expectations for his assignments. Be prepared to receive lower marks than you expected. I would not take a class with him again.",0
"Her grading system will not always make sense. I took her her class online and got a zero on one of the Essay. Had the Essay checked by online classmates and they were mostly positive about my Essay and I met most rubric requirements. Unfortunately, her way of accepting ""credits"" is from a different perspective.",0
He doesnt explain what is on the exams and it is very frustrating because I studied for hours over stuff that wasnt even on the exam...,0
"Schreibfeder is the easiest teacher ever. No final or midterm. All quizzes are take home. He calls out answers as you guys grade, so just get an extra sheet and copy all the right answers and turn that one in. Only thing is the 9 page paper he gives nearly the whole semester to do. Majority of class did it last minute and still did well. Cant fail",1
Awesome teacher-this group stuff is terrible though,1
"Goes on and on in lectures, he tests over terms that are mentioned in the reading so you actually have to read his book. About 40+ pages to read per test. A lot of the questions he ask are over the ideas he shared in class so it's like you're learning his ideals and what he believes in. Prob the only class I haven't figured out how to study...",0
Ms. Kingsley is such a wonderful person! I really enjoyed having her as a teacher! I have gained confidence and learned to not be so hard on myself. Even my peers agreed that this class has done a lot for me. If it is suggested that you take CPD150 then she is definitely the teacher you want! My life has changed since taking  this class!,1
Such a boring lecturer no expression in his voice. Professors should be able to capture your attention. Hes a nice guy but is extremely boring to listen to.,0
"Heavy workload, most of which is busywork. Acts like he's trying to get feedback from students but really will end up doing what he wants anyway. Journals are horrible and he marks you down for not having enough personal reflection. Keep checking due dates because he sometimes gets them wrong in class, and if it's late he won't accept it.",0
"Ehrhardt is small and petty, a truly miserable human being with absolutely no concept of academic decorum. She will allow her personal views of you to completely eclipse any semblance of objectivity. If she personally dislikes you, then you will not pass, and she won't even tell you what's *wrong* with your work. Gossips about students, colleagues.",0
"This prof is archaic in that content and presentation need work--a lot of work--. Time to retire unless she could update her teaching style big time, really big time, Don't take.",0
"If you don't pass this class with an ""A"" or at least a ""B"", something is wrong with you. Exams came straight from lectures/examples in class. Exam 1 might be a little tough but 2 & 3 are super easy. He's also funny :)",1
Lectures are extremely long and has nothing to do with what is on tests. I would avoid at all cost because you are on your own! Don't say someone did not warn you ahead of time.,0
"I had her for both intro classes. She's nice on the surface, but you don't practice any problem solving skills that you'll need to get an actual programming job. Also, she's super busy. I've visited her during her office hours and she makes really passive aggressive comments about how busy she is and that I'm interrupting her",1
"The professor bases your group assignments on the peer review your other team members grades you on. If they say you were not helpful then he will adjust your grade even if you did do your portion. PICK YOU TEAM MEMBERS CAREFULLY!  YOUR GRADE DEPENDS ON THE REVIEW FROM OTHER TEAM MEMBERS! His lectures are boring, and his exams are not easy. ",0
Dr. Spiegel is not the most amazing teacher when it comes to textbook biology rather what biology is really like in academia. The content lectured in class is very confusing. The tests are hard and based off of confusing scenarios and if you get assigned a bad lab group you are SOL. Good luck future bio majors !,1
"She is a very nice lady that is always willing to help. Essays and readings are quite hard, and I don't recommend procrastinating on the research. There are four total essays, but she explains everything pretty well. The last essay was around 8-10 pages. If you don't get at least a C or higher on these, then you will fail.",1
He will talk all hour about stories and it's so hard not to use your phone because no one cares what he is talking about. His quizzes and exams are hard but we won't ever re make them and is okay with a failing average of 60% and lower :) His notes aren't even helpful basically have to teach yourself!! rip if you have him.,0
"He is sooo organized. We would receive a daily email explaining exactly what was expected of us in place of a zoom call for this asynchronous class. Dont wait to do your hw because there is a lot, but it is fairly easy. Dont be afraid to email him with questions! Would love to take him again for spanish II if he was teaching it!",1
"This class is effectively useless. He didnt even have any material for the class, it was just reading the book. What little material was provided all came from another teacher, so some of the exam questions referenced another teachers projects. Textbook was outdated for a class called competing technologies. He was not good at answering questions",0
Reading assignment every night and pop quizzes almost every class. There are three papers during the semester and she does a horrible job at explaining her expectations for these. Her midterm is impossible even after extensively reviewing the class material. I asked for assistance multiple times and she was rude and not willing to help. DO NOT TAKE,0
"Gaston is great and I have learned a lot from him, but I've noticed that most people either hate him or love him...",1
"Stott is a super sweet, understanding man who knows a great deal about what he teaches. Lectures can be dry at times and I'll admit I zoned out, but you will still learn a lot. The papers and the two exams were very straightforward, and they are graded by your TA. Do the readings for discussion, it will help.",1
"Online class, just do the easy work and you'll get a good grade!!!",1
"Im rating this professor with all honesty. She IS AWESOME! Reading all the previous reviews, I was hecka nervous for myself because you guys scared me. What the heck, first day in class and shes awesome! Maybe the reviewers dont care to learn about the environment/policy. The class Im in hasnt been taught in a couple years.",1
"Dunstan is by far the sweetest professor I have ever met! She is amazing. She is very helpful and makes great real life connections to the lessons.  Though the class she teaches is mostly for nursing majors, I would recommend her to anyone who needs a lab science. I wish I she had more classes that I could take!!!",1
I thought she was a really good teacher. Homework's were kinda tough but she went over everything the next day and they were very help with the tests (which was easy). Went over problems on the test also. Overall helpful teacher and easy to understand.,1
"I have mixed feelings. Hes super funny, captivating, and outgoing. However, he is unorganized, a tough grader, and the assignment are not explained well at all. & he he seems to get aggravated when you email him about any questions,comments or concerns you may have. So my review is wishy-washy.",1
"Stated he would not tests would be ""applied"" and have no silly memorization of lists.  Tested pretty much the exact opposite.",0
loved him. you should go to class and take notes since a lot isn't included in the lectures.,1
She is very a harsh grader and rarely gives A's. However she is very nice.,0
"Plesha's lectures weren't the absolute worst but they didn't exactly make the material enjoyable. The discussion section was a joke because nothing in there helps you with the class, yet it has mandatory quizzes. Last 3 quizzes were very difficult and there is no curve (even if the class average is a 60%). I highly recommend a different professor.",0
"Lucia Moura is by far one of the worse profs at uOttawa. Very unorganized, she will bombard you with emails about last minute changes and clarifications. If you can avoid then I highly recommend that you avoid her.",0
"I loved this class. Very interesting lectures, images, web links, and other materials. Professor is very conscientious and caring towards the students, cares that you learn.",1
"Genuinely a good person, and does very much care about how well his students do on his tests. His ability as a teacher however is lacking. Lectures are fast and sometimes nonsensical and his teaching style does not correlate with the book. Often he will state that reading the book is worthless and his way is better. (Often a false statement)",1
"she is ver helpful, very nice and made the course easier than what I thought. I took the class on saturday morning..... It was not that bad..... I recommend her if you are afraid of speech classes.",1
"Take him in the summer and he's SUPER easy...he doesn't require essays in the summer. But his tests are straight from his notes. I never got the book and still did well in his class and trust me, i'm not the best history student..if i can do it, yall can too. take him, he's better than the other professors.",1
"worst ENG teacher I have ever seen, he always tries his best to disrespect you in feedback",0
"Extremely unorganized. She expects you to be in class but was late for class a lot herself or cancelled. She didn't seem to know what she was doing. Required three textbooks for the class, more reading involved than English classes. She required you to also write 5 papers. Her PowerPoints were extremely long, and her lectures were boring and dry.",0
"The power points Dr. Gehring gives out in class are helpful to take notes and follow along with the lecture. However, I found her to be very condescending, especially when she calls people out in class. Some concepts she explained in class were unclear at times. Not to mention many of her test, quiz, and homework questions are worded weirdly. ",0
One of the most comprehensible professors I've had!,1
"The professor is also the local city Judge, if you don't agree or do what he says he will utilize his power as a Judge to attack you and ruin your life. Avoid his classes at all costs if you want to have a life devoid of criminal records. He abuses students an employees at CCU and allow his children to go around the county committing crimes.",0
She  rambles about things that are not even remotely relevant to the class. she also gives A LOT of pop quizzes about material we have not discussed yet. her power points are vague and doesnt put them up online and what she talks about is not what the power point says. i get As in all criminal justice classes that ive taken but her class i got a C,0
A phony and fraud -does not put time or effort into grading student work,0
"He's awful. My advice for macro: 1. Don't waste your time going to class. Read the book for the hour and 15 minutes you have his class instead. It explains things much more clearly than he ever can. If you hate textbooks and need a good lecturer to learn, do not take him. You will fail 2. Memorize his packet practice questions for exams.",0
"This is probably an amazing class in person. Online it is pretty bad. First off, she used someone else's video lectures and worksheets. She didn't teach a single thing. We had mandatory group meeting in place of class. The actual work is very easy except on Sunday's expect to have 6 or 7 worksheets due. This makes getting the work in difficult.",0
"Hardest Professor I've had, do a lot of reading, practice hw and old tests, thats really the only way pass. Very tough grader, I was averaging an A but the final killed me, super tough.",1
Take any class with him! Prof. Pohlad is super cool and very helpful. He is so passionate about art and it makes the class fun.,1
Dr. Pilger seems more concerned about his hatred for his job and the fact that he's not retired than the class that he teaches. This professor was not very clear on his teaching. His method of teaching was not useful at all. We had several group projects and he did not explain them well at all,0
"great guy, great class.",1
"I acknowledge he need to work on his English, but at least he needs to prepare some lectures notes or something to make lectures more coherent. He marks hard to the presentation, term paper, and short responses. And presentation and paper take up 45% of total grade! unwilling to help you with paper and presentation ahead. workload is not much",0
He is funny yeah he runs his class like a show called sympathy for the devil. You are only graded on 4 tests so if you're good at tests then you'll do fine. If not wouldn't recommend his lectures tend to never make sense he as a person never makes sense. Hes the most confusing person I've ever met and doesn't put grades in EVER,0
"Nice guy, very willing to help.  Class isn't super exciting, but it's math - what can ya do?  Funny at times, in a geeky kind of way.  Explained concepts clearly and went slowly enough to understand.",1
"Olsson had the potential to be a great teacher but unfortunately, she was not super accessible. She would not respond to emails nor the discussion board she put up for questions. Her grading is very arbitrary and often would not give feedback. I would have learned more if she cared more about her student's learning experience.",0
"Test #1 CLASS AVERAGE 61% Test #2 CLASS AVERAGE 55% This means, in test 1 the great majority of the class (about 40 individuals) got an F or a D in the test. In test #2, the class majority (about 30 individuals) got BELLOW AN F ! Calc III is difficult, yes, there is no debating that. But, for a WHOLE CLASS to be failing?",0
Had Lori Case a few years ago for this course and she is also a CS advisor. She is so approachable and a great professor. You can tell she wants her students to understand the content.,1
Writes exam to decieve students instead of test knowledge.,0
"Mark certainly knows his math and is a very smart individual. However, his personality makes the course a drag. During the 2020 election, he talked about nothing but the election for weeks on end. Rude responses to student questions. Awkward teaching style (you will NEED the on-campus tutors).",0
I had her for UE this summer and learned a lot. The class was fun and she's great to have a conversation with!,1
"He made the lecture portion of this course hell. First 2 midterm avg was 51 and 54. His midterms are A LOT harder than examples he gives, and he only gives 7 example PER CHAPTER. Last time this course is being offered in Waterloo, I guess he just wants to make a label for himself of being a ""tough prof""",0
"The course pack was abysmal, it had incomplete texts and pages that were incomplete as a sticky-note was left on the page. The majority of the semester was spent listening to presentations of a high school level on artists and art movement or a philosophy. Where was the teaching?! Oh that's right, we watched movies on the Greek & Romans & a church.",0
"the professor doesn't do anything. he only gave us syllabus, no lecture, no communication as in NADA. If you want to learn something, you better register to a different professor",0
She is very well-educated.  She knows what she's teaching. She makes you work for the grades but it is worth it!,1
"Professor Meade has some good reads, and I did get a few things out of his class but overall completely not worth it. We just now got the final exam study guide two days before the final exam. He also has only graded our first exam so far so I have no idea what my grade is in the class and it's exams week. My recommendation is to not take him.",0
"Tough but really good teacher. The tests are very thorough and detailed, so ask questions and go to office hours. You're gonna wanna double up on lab hours during qual. Read the text and take some notes on it before class. If you're a STEM major she's a good choice.",1
"One of the worst profs I've had so far. Publically shames students for asking questions, gives vague explanations and rushed lectures. My class with him received 20% lower averages than Wendy (take her class!). Must attend class or you'll be lost. Also made students pay an extra $35 for ""Top Hat"" on top of the $180 textbook. My Lab Tec saved me.",0
I thought that Prof. Marlin's class on Truth & Propaganda was one of the most interesting courses that I ever took.  It literally changed the way that I look at the world.   He was one of the best professors I ever had.,1
Terrible professor for a graduate level class. Most of time she doesnot seem to have any clue about the material she is trying to teach. This class is required for MS in Econ. so BAD LUCK for you poor souls if she is teaching it!!!,0
"At first when she explain the grading curve I thought she seemed like a fair professor. Then my semester of hell started. She was terrible at explaining physics and she was constantly unprepared. She would blame the students for ""not reading"" the textbook when her examples were wrong. She would lose everyone during her in-class examples. Terrible!",0
The tests are very hard. Each test has essay questions. He does not give good study guides to help you prepare for the test. When he lectures he gets off topic a lot! I worked very hard in this class and still got a B.,0
"Math is not by best subject at all. However he is THE best teacher that i have taken in years. He allows you to understand and explains so that you can move forward. Such an amazing professor, especially during a pandemic. Lots of extra credit. If you fail its because you didn't try.",1
"not the best teacher in the world. its a good class but the teacher has her own expectations. my previous teachers have made english pretty interesting which motivated me to actually read, she made the class very bland. if you don't like english much, this is not the class for you",0
"MSCM 430? You HAVE 2 take him. Good luck. Don't ""think"" on your own, think only the way he thinks. Hmwk assign. aren't what's tested on, he includes diff. variables which he doesn't cover in class. Pay attention, laugh at his ""jokes"".... acceptance his arrogance (the fact that he knows more than anyone in SCM). Study and pray, & hope you pass.",0
"Dr. Maher is a very nice man who cares about his students. His lectures are very unorganized and his test can pull things from left field. He does not use powerpoints, he just talks. He also does not give study guides for his exams. It's not a hard class, just very frustrating when it comes to exams because you don't know what to study.",1
"He had an entire section on attraction and did not include any LGBQ relationships whatsoever. He said that there wasn't enough research on it, which is false. He just likes using old, outdated research, and is inflexible. I also didn't like how he wasn't clear that not participating in his studies wouldn't affect your grades (if even true).",0
"Great Teacher, easy notes, but you have to do the reading and attend lectures to better understand the material. Funny and nice teacher to have. EASY essay questions!!!",1
"I'm not even done with the semester, but this is the hardest class I have ever taken. I have found that she teaches things in class, but the online homework rarely coorispondes well with the taught material. She does offer to go over any problems at the beginning of class but it's very difficult to do on your own. I failed the 1st test.",0
"I've actually logically proved his lectures to be a waste of my time, along with another student. TA's pretty helpful, tests follow homework and the book.",0
I don't know what everyone else is talking about. Kerry is great.,1
"Her concern for all of us truly makes me feel like she actually cares about the human beings we are. The way she teaches this class, audio lectures coupled with her personality toward me, made all the difference in completing this course.",1
Nrgative feedback.,0
If you are in search of an easy A to maintain that GPA..this is the class for you,1
"Very knowledgable, very helpful -A+",1
"First of all, taking this class was the worst decision I have made when it comes to registering for classes. This class was a ton of work. I took it online and this professor was pretty much unreachable. When I had questions about and assignment or had and issue with something he wouldn't respond until I emailed him again about the same thing.",0
I was not in his section for lectures but I was in his section for tutorials. He's very clear and helpful. Better than my own professor. ,1
"He clearly knows a lot about the subject but when it comes to teaching it he's lacking. His lecture videos are long and monotone so it's difficult to stay focused and not get bored. He's very rude when it comes to addressing questions, he gets frustrated quickly when you don't understand something and says it's easy when it really isn't.",0
"All you do is listen to the lectures, and if you pay attention, you don't need to read the textbook to pass the exams. The only grade you have is based off three exams including the final.",1
"My feedback will be towards non music majors, I believe that his class is super cool and interesting. As long as you put effort into studying, you'll be fine. He's a kind professor so don't be afraid to ask questions. Tough in the beginning but you will transition through.",1
He is the best math teacher I could ever get. He knows we have life outside and always helps with assignments. He is quick at replying emails. Very funny and helpful professor. I will highly recommend this class.,1
"The first thing this professor asks you to do is call him Greg. Hes awesome and keeps the class alive. Attend class because he explains everything on his tests during class. His homework is not mandatory but is essential to passing the course. If you attend class and take good notes and practice the problems, theres no reason to get blow a B.",1
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS if you want to pass.,0
Prof Ferguson is definitely a person I look up to. I had the best connection with him out of all of my professors I've had in the engineering course so far. He makes somewhat uninteresting topics lively and fun and is great at explaining tough concepts. Definitely attend office hours and introduce yourself. Good luck on your next adventure!,1
DO NOT TAKE I PROMISE YOU WILL REGRET IT,0
"Go to class, sudy notes, attend lab, the class is not challenging. But you need to be active. Great teacher and very obvious she wants her students to pass.",1
"His notes suck on the board, you cannot read them. He is kind of rude but if you just sit back and go to class its not bad. I liked how the homework was all organized out for the semester and how it was online but his test suck and are hard and LONG!!!",0
"Askay is the man! always a fun guy to have a conversation with and talk about the transcendence of philosophy with. If you put in the effort for the finals and listen to his lectures, you will do just fine in his class.  he will give you the answers of the finals and midterm questions if you finesse them out of him.",1
"Disorganized, un-transparent, poor communication and horrid marker. Prepare yourself for the lowest mark of your 3rd year. While she may be knowledgeable herself, she is a poor lecturer and often times has to go close to the full 3 hours to get across all content, and that still isn't enough. Didn't give a single mark till course was over..",0
He based our grade on only 3 tests instead of 4 because of the wildfires. He goes over what will be on the tests. He also offers help to students outside of class or after class. Likes to ramble a lot on random things. Kinda hard class,0
"Dr. Santoro is a one of a kind professor. Is he tough? Absolutely. There are no power points in his class and reading the textbook/ taking detailed notes is crucial to passing. However, He really cares about forming his students into competent adults who know how to think for themselves. As long as you are willing to put in the work, you'll pass.",1
"He takes FOREVER to grade even assignments. Up to recursion, his materials are easy to follow, but after that, he doesn't teach well. The textbook isn't so clear either. He's talkative but he speaks almost in riddles. Would not recommend. You'll know what I'm talking about when you get there. His test and assignment questions are... Weird",0
"knowledgable on the subject of econ, but is a terrible teacher. She is extremely disconnected from the class. She is open about using trick questions in her tests. Online assignments are hardly ever assigned, but worth 20% of your grade. I missed 2 on the first day of class and my grade has suffered 18% (86%-68%). Mid semester and still recovering.",0
"Elisa is best at lecturing in a friendly way, and encouraging participation. Everything else is average. She does seem to favour the white students though - gives them a little more attention, remembers their names.",1
"Very rude, do not take his course if you don't have to.",0
"Ok, yes, he does go off on any possible tangent and VERY easily gets distracted during lecture. But he is the most caring, helpful, and sweet person out there. He's so friendly and easy-going, and wants to help you. Very encouraging. Had him for 342 (lab) too, and loved getting to know him. Just needs to learn to stay on track lol.",1
"Professor Johnson is easily the worst professor I've had so far at CMU. His essay prompts give absolutely no guidelines or specific instructions. His lectures tend to be rambles about things unrelated to what we're actually supposed to be learning. He's a smart guy, and clearly very passionate about politics. But his class is an unstructured mess.",0
I took this as an easy lab requirement but it ended up being way harder than I was expecting. Exams and lab are all memorization of useless information. Madsen wasn't bad though. Take GEOL105 instead,1
"If you will listen to what she tells you, it is an easy class. She often straight up tells you the important parts of tests. Her tests are not easy but if you study they are managablr. Her lab is even better, but for lab you will be in her room the entire time. Do not expect to leave early.",1
"Boring lecturer, boring content, but what do you expect? Easy Group A if you have a good TA. Never opened the book went 2/3 classes every week(discussion attendance mandatory). Got a B, pay attention and know the vocabulary and its too bad. Hard to get an A, easy to pass.",1
"An excellent teacher, I would highly recommend her.   She is well versed on computers, website design, and computer security. A quality teacher that provides a great education experience, and she's always happy-",1
"AVOID THIS MAN AT ALL COSTS. He is the meanest, most arrogant professor I've ever had. He is not approachable. When you do talk to him, you will walk away feeling like the dumbest person alive. He is incredibly condescending and rude. His criticism is often unnecessarily CRUEL and unhelpful. He should be teaching grad students, NOT undergraduates.",0
"Prof. Jalpal, knows his Marketing stuff, but he can't teach an introductory class.  Now if your at advanced marketing level than he's your man.  I can't support prof. that says, i don't get paid to provide solution to cases he uses in the class, and so won't handout his solutions.  Also, he has the class do 3 group presentations on same case/day",0
"Dr. Kahan is an extremely intelligent, very caring professor. The class is difficult, but she is very clear about what she expects from you so if you do the work it isn't difficult to do well. Cognitive is probably the most interesting topic for this requirement, I would definitely recommend taking the class!",1
"Halstead knows what he talks about, and you will learn a lot from this class. However, he grades too hard for a 100 course, and his grading is weird. One more thing, it takes him forever to grade things!!! My suggestion is: take him only if you don't have other options!!",0
He likes to make lots of jokes and make fun of his students which is cool because we take him as a joke as well. His class is stupid easy. If you do the bare minimum you'll pass with 100% He canceled class often and would end class after 30 minutes. Little to no hw throughout the semester. You can tell he's not passionate about teaching anymore.,0
She isn't super engaging. . She skips a lot of steps and doesn't really seem to understand where people are in the class. Doesn't go over basic concepts. Requires a lot of homework but doesn't count to grade. I wish I could have taken another teacher. But i was stuck because I was a transfer student so not a lot of classes were open.,0
"Bad prof, very unorganized! Lot of work without any explanation, would not recommend him to anyone!",0
"Honestly, I would say exactly what the person below me said.  Prof Baldiga is amazing, easily my best accounting professor and most dedicated to teaching.  Class will be tough but you will learn.",1
"One of my favourite classes I took at Ryerson so far! He made the midterm and quiz SO easy, the group project was marked fairly and the final was easy too! Theres no textbook for this class, so it's all based on his lectures and slides. His lectures were AMAZING, told a lot of cool stories! Professor Carl wants the best for his students!",1
"easy prof., lots of stories, hardly any lectures, discussions-fun",1
This class is not geared well for teaching students who are new to coding. The homeworks are unnecessarily convoluted for new-ish students and getting reasonable time with TAs can almost be impossible. The material you are provided to learn how to program is underwhelming.,0
i highly recommend this professor. she is such a generous teacher in grading. she always motivate to join you the debate team. i love her!,1
Have not had much experience with this prof yet but she DOES NOT REPLY TO EMAILS AT ALL. I have emailed 3 times in the past week after missing the first class with no response to my questions. Office hours are only by appointment so there is no easy way to get in contact with her AT ALL.,0
"He is, by far, the worst teacher I've had. He is a relatively nice guy, but beyond that he is a bad teacher in every sense. Can't understand him or his handwriting, doesn't cover material needed, doesn't assign appropriate homework or even have due dates that make sense. AVOID AT ALL COSTS",0
"She really thinks she is an intellectual, and will hold it over anyone who doesn't meet her standards. Snobby and unpleasant to learn from. Demeaning. She needs to work on her personal issues and know when to leave them at the door. There are better teachers at BCC.",0
The quizzes are ridiculous-- he asks us to recall stats from 100 pages of reading. We also had a group paper and tests. Would not recommend.,0
"I hate theater so I did not enjoy this class. If you like theater and drama, I would assume you would like him. Lectures seem so long and are boring. We don't get to act, just sit and listen. Personally I dreaded that class everyday. Tests are open ended, so hard. Read the freaking book and put stuff from it in the test or you won't do well",0
"nice teacher. i didn't learn nothin' though. she was strict on attendance. but if you wanna get good grade, i recommend her. but you will learn a lot of material when you get to sharma's 236. worth taking it though.",1
"I agree with what the other reviewers are saying about Bell-he's pretentious and arrogant. I showed interest in his class, and gave him respect, but even that, coupled with my skill in art, didn't save me. He favored a girl who drew herself nude, and everyone else was obsolete in his eyes. I don't recommend him. Spare yourself the time and money.",1
This professor is the worst. DO NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE. He is does not help when you go to his office hours nor help in class. All based on SPSS software.,0
"If she picks you as a favourite, you will do well. She seems to do this on the first day. Look decent in her classes, but dont challenge her ideas because ""she is educated and we are not"", although by the end of class ""we are smart because she taught us""",0
"Dr Souaiaia is really knowledgable and friendly. He is accessible at office hours. I look up to him. Make sure to go to lecture! You can't find answers online. Discussions aren't really helpful, which I hope will be improved in the future. I also wish we could get a schedule of lecture topics and dates in the syllabus.",1
"Easy A for sure, but be prepared to be annoyed out of your mind by her incessant yelling about people talking... when doing assigned group work.",0
"Literally the easiest class i have ever taken in my life. Attendance is mandatory, but he grades attendance like quizzes. i have 5 zeros for attendance and still have a 97 avg. HW can be long, but it is so so easy. he doesnt speak clearly in class but offers powerpoints. If you are just looking to take this as a GenEd, do it. Easy A for sure.",0
"Movies were interesting, but lectures before were sometimes boring and hard to follow. 2 exams and a comparative essay. Wish there were smaller assignments/homework to help grade. Has slideshows of movies. You can skip class and watch the movies later on and still do well on the exams. He is very knowledgable about the time periods/movies.",1
"HE'S THE BEST AND ONE OF MY FAVORITE TEACHERS. he was so nice to me and the entire class, and was super lenient and chill. he's awesome, and if you're lucky to have him, be grateful",1
"Boring. Boring. Boring. I'm sure he's a nice guy, but he never stops talking. I always felt like I was trapped with no way out. And, he doesn't grade most of the exams and hw turned in till the very end of the semester so you have no idea how you're doing. Can't say I learned much either... too boring to pay any attention.",0
Professor Yuhas was a great professor.  He is very passionate about tax subjects and he genuinely tries to pass this along to his students.  His class is a lot of work but he does everything he can to help you.,1
This class is very difficult. If you are not interested in science please do not take this class. I wouldnt recommend even it even if its your last option. He makes the class harder than it should be and the study guides do not help. Hes a nice guy .,0
"Very easy A as long as you go to class and pay attention. She offers a lot of extra credit opportunities to boost your grade. Do not waste money on the textbook for this class I never used mine, and it had no effect on my grade. Very nice lady.",1
not a bad guy if you know your stuff,1
"This is probably the worst professor that I have ever had across the board. He thinks he is a perfect teacher and expects you to already know so much about stats. The amount of homework he gives is ridiculous and his HW quizzes are very hard to do well on. Overall terrible professor, wished I had dropped the class long ago.",0
Orgo is hard enough as it is. Do yourself a favor and just take Flemming if you want to understand anything at all.,0
"Levine-Keating is the epitome of incompetence. She's full of herself to say the least, and obsessed to say the most. She is the perfect example of ""Having a Doctorate does not make you a Teacher."" She fails to understand styles that differ from hers, and doesn't comprehend the simplest of writing concepts. It would be wise to avoid Dr. Divine Ego.",0
"Dr. Korros does not really teach anything relevant to what you need to know for her assignments, which will not be based on Russian history even though it's discussed daily. Class is extremely boring and might put you to sleep. Your assignments will get ripped apart so good luck. Definitely would not recommend taking any course taught by her.",0
"Great teacher, mostly talks about her dogs a lot but she gets the job done. I would likely take her class again. She skims over the homework just to see if you did majority of the problems and gives you a full grade. Her tests and quizzes are simple and straightforward. Final was a little more difficult though.",1
"It seemed like there was always an assignment due practically every day of the week. Did not understand the grading criteria. Also, I feel as though she took important matters not seriously, such as cheating. Also I basically only wrote about one continuous topic throughout the entire semester.",1
"Mr. Dayoub is by far, the worst instructor I've ever had at DMACC. He can demonstrate programming, but he can't teach it. He won't answer questions, can't tell students the ""why"" of programming, and thinks students learn by copying him. The homework is so frustrating b/c it's not practice - it's teach yourself if you can. Avoid this teacher!",0
"Worst professor ever, avoid at all costs.",0
"If I could give a score of 0 I would. By far the worst semester of my life. Dr. Khazeh implored me to switch to Finance, and I initially liked it. After taking his class, I hated finance. I went to his office hours numerous times and he always criticized me for not knowing the material. Do not take Dr. Khazeh.",0
"His interest in teaching is nowhere near your interest in learning.  Good thing I already knew most of what he tested on, or else I'd be doomed.",0
Most stressful course ever.,0
"Honest review: Prof. Horn is nice but is a cranky depressed guy whose mood fluctuates wildly. Many Econ professors, especially at JMU, are ridiculously weird and weirdly ridiculous--sometimes outright... unstable. As for the class itself, you WILL need CALCULUS, namely optimization and minimization. JMU Econ dept in general  stupid amt. of work",0
First experience with Dr. F as a teacher. Really enjoyed his class and his method of teaching - takes it down to real-life examples so you understand. Heavier workload but it is an important class so rather have more work to grasp the concepts than to just get the surface level. Final project is a big part of the grade but you learn a lot from it.,1
Took his class during the summer and it was great! There was a total of 3 exams + a final which was optional depending on how you did on the previous exams. Make sure to take notes during his lectures because the majority of the answers were basically given to you. The exams were also open notes and book so its honestly impossible to fail.,1
"This Professor is AMAZING! Any class she's teaching, I'll be there! Gives you everything you need to pass with an A. Her goal is for her students to learn the material, not set them up for failure. She's good at lecturing, not boring at all. All in all, my favorite professor so far, hands down. Love, love, LOVE HER!",1
One of the best teachers at Master's. He does everything in great detail!!!,1
"Before i had this professor i didnt think it was possible to get a ""bad"" teacher.nope. this guy is really bad.If you must take him read the textbook his ""lectures"" seem to be based off of them. he goes through no examples just theory but his tests are about 50% quantitative so try problems in book for practice as well as obscure definitions.",0
"This professor is all over the place. This is the most disorganized class I have ever taken in university. Lectures consist of one page of hand written, scribbled vocab and you are expected to follow along as he jumps from topic to topic with no consistency. He is EXTREMELY unhelpful and you have to fight to even get a chance to do an assignment.",0
"Dr. Amenta is a very kind lady. Her lectures though are awful, she messes up often and it is hard to understand. She is very accessible outside of class and will go over material with you one on one if you ask. I'm sure she is better in person but online is confusing. Overall, do your work, its alot, but do it and push through. Hope she curves.",0
She is a great and amazing teacher. She is is hilarious. Dr. Massey will work with you if you missed class. All you have to do is be willing to talk to her and put in the right amount of time and work.  Trust me she will be a great teacher for any one to take. ,1
Doug's great ! He's so funny and really enjoys teaching and loves anthropology. He is a walking encyclopedia of information but you have to do your reading if you want to do well. I would for sure take another class with him. ,1
Awesome prof but can get off topic or boring. When he is on topic he is incredible... when he is talking about war memorials well not so much.,1
Don puts too much material into his class and doesn't even cover all of the material that ends up on the tests.  way more work than it's worth.,0
"Expects a lot, but a truly knowledgable and inspiring teacher. Wants all of her students to do well, but you have to work hard. ",1
"Mr. Saldivar was by far one of the GREATEST professors I have ever had. I struggle with math, so I was very afraid to take this class b/c of what other people said about him. DON'T BELIEVE IT. Hes a GREAT professor. Homework is optional, never graded. DO IT! Practice makes perfect and really helps for quizzes and test! LOVED HOW HELPFUL HE WAS!",1
"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible. This was one of the worst classes and worst Professors I have ever had. She was boring and not involved. She never even took the time to lean anyone's names. Terrible Professor and an absolute snooze fest",0
she curves everyone grade and gives 70 points of extra credit or else everyone would fail. I'm receiving an A in this class but it's be cause my self & the TA's taught me everything. ( even the TA's will tell you they have no clue what she's doing or talking about) I have a final next week and still haven't received grades from the other 2 exams,0
"literally ive never had a professor talk as much as she does about the most pointless stuff in the world. every single class period she just rambles about the same thing until class is over. shes super sweet and stuff but she doesnt even follow her own attendance policy described in the syllabus, her reasoning being to weed out kids. drop her.",0
Not helpful during office hours at all. ,0
"I hate the way he talks, he always stop for 3-5 seconds between each setence, and his voice is kinda low too. Sometimes make ya wanna fall asleep. Other than that hes fine. ",0
Loved him.,1
worst professor i have ever had focuses on insignificant details and contorts information to strengthen her beliefs extremely unhelpful and is not open to hearing anything you have to say. only 3 tests which makes the class difficult and she knows it even if you study good luck. pulls questions from lecture or textbook and some answers are wrong.,0
Dr. Lin is one of the best professors at Emmanuel! Take every class that you can with her- she is awesome!,1
Wouldn't recommend this professor.. Dry boring lectures and exams did not correlate to anything we did. Quizzes were nearly impossible. Do not take this professor unless you are very skilled in acct,0
"By far one of my favorite professors! His class was a little difficult, but he is very passionate about religions. His lectures were sometimes not very clear, but his PowerPoints helped to stay on track. He is such a sweet man, and I definitely recommend him. He doesn't give reading quizzes. As long as you study, you'll do well on the exams!",1
"This guy is very sweet and he means well, but his tests are ridiculous.  Nothing in the book or in his lecture notes show up on the tests.  I have no idea where he got his questions from.  He had to scale the grades majorly for my class.",0
I enjoy the class and the discussions. Exam had no surprises.,1
"He doesn't have his own lectures for online classes. He just give you a textbook to use, the assignments and you have to figure out everything else. He doesn't provide lectures that explain well the material and the assignments. The textbook is not enough and it doesn't have too many examples.",0
"Great Professor I'd recommend her to anybody, she's very funny and you dont even really need to go to class to get an A. Studying the book is a definite must but at least that way you know exactly what you should lear. All her lectures are available on-line which is nice, study the book hard you should do well, all those who dont like her dont work",1
"I can barely stay awake in this ""class""....He talks and it's like he talks to himself - NO ONE LISTENS....PEOPLE ARE READING MAGAZINES EXCEPT WHEN HE CALLS ON YOU TO READ ALOUD! I DON'T THINK HE'LL BE TEACHING MUCH LONGER - I HOPE!",0
"You can tell that she is an upper level athletic training professor. When she is presenting, she does a lot of referring to other body parts/location that she doesn't test on. She is terrible at e-mailing and getting your assignments graded. Her feedback is unhelpful and grades ridiculously hard on abstracts. If not going into AT, don't take her",0
"I took one of his courses about 27 years ago. Great to see he's still inspiring students. His course was very challenging. I still consider him one of the very best professors I've ever had, three degrees later, and a lifetime of experience under my belt. He's generous with his time, humour. He expects a lot of his students, and you'll want to work",1
"Never have I ever had a 101 class that starts of with so much reading and a 100 pt exam ONE WEEK in. Also, most of the links for the readings have been broken and not repaired. Avoid taking this class at all costs.",0
"HIGHLY recommend her! She is an amazing professor who does a great job teaching. She is very passionate and very helpful. Her lectures and guides are easy to follow and are very detailed. If you pay attention, you will definitely do well in this class!! She is an amazing professor!! :)",1
"Great professor, probably my fav professor ever.",1
"awesome profesor, and made the class really fun, and i learned a lot",1
Unreasonably timed quizzes randomly.,0
"Professor Knott is a great teacher who cared about her students. She is energetic and loves to talk about the subjects she teaches. She assigns a lot of reading and requires a lot of interaction, so make sure you stay on top of everything. Professor Knott was very helpful to point out parts of my papers that I needed to work on. 9/10 recommend!",1
"Trudi is among the best educators I've come across. She is very organized and prepared. Her classes are always intriguing and she shows up through thick and thin. She offers her students the best tools she is aware of and leads very engaging, inspiring, and well-guided discussions. Meaningful projects demand meaningful effort. Trudi 4eva",1
"I was told psych would be easy. it was not. Her lectures were difficult to understand and she did not help when asked. Ive had a 4.0 my entire life and I got a 69.6% in this class, barely scraping by with a C-. please, for the sake of your GPA, do not take this class.",0
"Horrible, his lectures are unorganized and almost nothing he says in lecture appears on the tests. Even the slides he posts on canvas if he ever does post them are so weirdly disorganized. Never any clarification on what exactly will be on tests. The good thing is you can skip class every day and if you study before tests you'll get a good grade.",0
I found this class interesting. The class was extremely easy. There are 8 quizzes that are basic and can be aced with 30 minutes of study beforehand. The midterms are easy also. He gives you the multiple choice questions and gives you a great idea of what the short answer will be. After that you just need to study. I would take from him again.,1
Best. Teacher. Ever.,1
"Lecture notes are posted online and easy to understand. Not hard to get an A, if you do the work. He is generous in giving partial credit on hw, quizzes, and exams. He is very knowledgeable and is willing to help you understand the topics in depth (if needed) during his office hours.",1
"Professor Thull was really helpful at explaining if you didn't understand something. Lecture notes were taken via a blank packet he handed out and went through on the board. Before an exam he would post exams used previous years to BB and these were incredibly useful, make sure to study those closely. I would highly recommend taking Thull for 302",1
"I really wish I had experienced the joy of being a student of Prof. Bailey before my final semester at Guelph. So willing to help, makes boring subject matter interesting, and is funny in lecture. Definitely one of, if not the best, professor in the philosophy department. Do yourself a favour and take a class of his!",1
he likes the beatles...what else is there to say,1
Worst teacher ever.  He is very hard and people drop out like flies every class.  You will want to burn this man alive after you've had him.  DO NOT TAKE THIS MAN'S CLASS!!!,0
"Wasn't sure if I'd like him from the first few weeks of chem lots of yelling but after sticking it out, I have grown to love him. He genuinely cares about his students and is willing to do whatever for them to succeed. Dr. Lee has a very specific way he wants his students to do things but if you put in the effort to learn, it's worth it.",1
Jean is an absolute doll. She cares about all of her students and will fight for you. She is really an inspiration and I am so happy that I had the opportunity to take a class with her.,1
This prof is great. Clear explanations and good assignment designs,1
So boring. I couldn't even try and pay attention because he just tells us random stories about random ethicists who I obviously don't know. Half the words he says sound made up...also he wears sweaters that are WAY too large!,0
Rodrigues is by far my favourite professor. You can tell he's very interested in the topic and wants you to enjoy it as well. Very interesting lectures and posts the notes so you have great material to study from. I received A's on his tests with not much studying. An easy GLER that is actually interesting.,1
Had this teacher for 2 online classes. Introduction to economics and principles of microeconomics. Watch videos on the connect site and you should get an A.,1
"He is a good teacher.  Gives good notes, and know them well.  He may pull test questions from the reading that he didn't talk about.  Fends questions well, so he knows his stuff.",1
"Great prof.  Was clear in lecture, tested fairly, helpful in labs, graded & handed back assignments very quickly.  Professional, on time to class.  Not an entirely easy class/subject but Dr Miller really simplifies things for his students.  Highly recommend.",1
"Great teacher, makes ethics interesting and fun. Daily quizzes are easy!",1
Took during summer term...very disorganized and uninspiring class. He didn't live up to his reputation of being a great teacher. Assignments were confusing because they lacked guidelines. Would compliment my A quality work but then give me a B-. He's not the best at actually teaching things. Nice guy though.,0
"He is great but I sure dont know in what,
 definitley not in teaching",0
"Professor Wolff is awesome! She's really nice and helpful. She gives 5 exams, 2 reflection papers, and learn smart quizzes for each chp. She gives and bases her attendance off of random in class assignments that are 20 points of your grade so attend class regularly. Test are not hard as long as you study. Overall an easy and enjoyable class.   ",1
He's a good teacher. I took him for Calc 1 & 2. Do the homework and pay attention and you'll do well.,1
"Easy class! A lot of homework assignments every week: mini short essays, social media, quizzes, chapter homework, and class participation assignments. There's a mid-term and final, and one major essay that requires to do presentation on it. Teacher is really nice and grades easily. Boring lectures!!",1
A+++ Would take again. Show up prepared and ready to learn. Rugemer not only helps you succeed in class but there's life lessons to be learned here as well. Great professor!,1
"Late to class, graded based on relative standing because everyone would get 40's on the exam, so you wouldn't even have a clue as to what your grade could be until after the finals are submitted. He would rant about things and lose track of time. We had a midterm a week before the final since he forgot to give one. Stay away from this professor",0
"Pooja knows her stuff, but I'm really lucky that I've taken physic before. She can't convey ideas, and even when you ask her questions, you won't learn from her. You either have to learn from friends or the textbook. The homework is rare but hard and the tests are easy, but if you don't already know physics well, everything will be hell on earth.",0
"I'm taking his online class and it is a JOKE! He does not respond to emails EVER! Plus, the game literally kills my computer. I have to go to campus and use a specific computer in order to play it! His essays are completely made up out of no where. Worst professor ever! I highly recommend not taking anything this man teaches...",0
Dr. Blanchard is a very smart man but not good at explaining anything at all. He is not specific and it's very irritating. His tests are super hard and he grades very hard,0
"Benevento is a good choice. There really aren't lectures, but there are classroom discussions of the books that you've read. His grading system is simple: contribute to the discussion each day, and 40% of your grade is an A. The rest of your grade comes from three papers (6-10 pages), and if you read the books, then you'll do fine.",1
"Dr. Morgan does a great job delivering content, but there is A LOT of it. Attending lecture was important and, even with great attendance, I used my textbook more in this class than any other. He does assign readings and WILL expect you to know information from the text. Mellow guy though, has a good sense of humor, and is helpful.",1
very easy. No exams. A couple of presentations that are graded mainly on completion. Prof is very friendly and helpful,1
Hes a sweet old man but the class is horribly boring! I remember liking biology in high school but this kinda ruined it. there are only 4 tests and a little bit of extra credit so you have to do extremely well on the tests to have a good grade (A) since there arent any other assignments. he does curve it a little though and gives a practice test,1
Prof. Regan is not clear. hard to understand. Poor at teaching. Got nothing from this class. Oh well.,0
This was one of my best professors. I would go to his office for extra help and he was always accommodating to help me. He is a great teacher and an awesome dude. I highly recommend taking his class if you are willing to work.,1
"Greg is a solid professor who clearly knows alot about calculus. After taking calculus AB in highschool and doing Greg's webassign homework, I didn't study for his tests and still made low A's. He's decently funny, which helps because calculus is so boring. Class isnt madatory except that he has the occasional in class quiz. Dont buy textbook.",1
"This prof does the minimal, hes lecture slides were from another prof or the text book and he never explained topics well, hes tests were all straight out of the text book, for examples he would just read the slides and he would say he doesnt do the question like the slides do and would just try to explain w/o showing how.",0
"Doesn't use canvas, so you will never know your exact grade. Only hand writes, and his hand writing is hard to read. Went to every class, but the way he teaches makes no sense. If you screw up one little thing, you get a F-. HARD GRADER do not take him. GPA killer.",0
Professor Ashline is great. This class was Math for Teachers and was incredibly easy. He is a very tough grader but he clearly cares very much about his work and his students' success.,1
Prof Lieberman is not the best she is always rude to students even TAs and was not COVID careful at all. She would tell students to come to class even if they had just gotten tested/exposed. She also has the tendency to have her mask below her nose. Even though she isn't great the lab itself isn't too bad. TAs are very helpful (honestly livesavers),0
"Roe is awesome, but you shouldn't take his class.  The lectures were interesting, but had a hard time staying awake.  You will never know when his notes are something you should know.  only grades: 2 tough exams that you don't review and a huge vague research essay that the class won't prepare you for.  Won't read email, can't use internet research",0
Perfect Creative Writing professor. Subjective yet has expectations. Assignments consisted of doing one activity a week and reviewing it in a group. Very funny and gives great feedback. Accessible and easy to work with. Definitely recommended. I'm taking him again.,1
"CivArts over intersession. EASIEST CLASS EVER. She's very pleasant and straightforward. Exactly what you need to know. If you take good notes in class, you don't have to study much outside of class. Makes a dull subject more interesting. EASY tests.",1
"Great guy, and super laid back class. There is a writing assignment due every week and a 30 page compilation due at the end of the semester. He gives great feedback and is always available to talk to. I recommend him!",1
"He knows his stuff but he clearly has no idea on how to teach electrical engineering to non-electrical majors. Spends too much time on the easy things and barely skims through the harder concepts. If you're not in ELEC, YOU WILL HAVE TO TAKE THIS COURSE WITH HIM. Find a copy of the textbook to make sense of what he's tryna say.",0
"Dr. Walsh is a very sweet woman, but her lectures are mostly boring with the exception of a few. She plays lots of psychology tricks on you throughout the semester which was actually pretty cool. Tests come straight from the ppt and the book. She also writes her own comments on here, so take them with a grain of salt.",1
She needs to be given a raise,1
"Kemp is an extremely intelligent, insightful person who has deep knowledge about the class material. However, his class consists purely of him lecturing and he doesn't write on the board or use powerpoints, which can make it difficult to pay attention and take good notes. This class is not difficult and is enjoyable if you like the material.",1
"This man is incredibly stubborn and unorganized. He talks extremely fast during his lectures and his notes are impossible to understand. Anyone who tries to ask for clarification won't get a straight answer. He refuses to post answer keys for practice problems done outside of class, so it's impossible to know whether or not they're right.",0
"Do not get on her bad side. Attend class everyday. If you are sick you better have a note if not she will think that you are lying. Explains things well. However, she is horrible was sick for 2 weeks and had doctor's notes. Would not let me make up test bc it was the day after excuses.",1
Genuinely great guy.  Really cares about his students doing well.  If you have any questions he will clear them up during office hours and you will do very very well.  I would highly recommend taking Dr. Auer.,1
"Really enjoyed her class. Reasonable grader for papers. If you show up, take good notes and do as many of the readings as possible, you will do fine. Exams are short but to the point so as long as you put in a reasonable amount of effort, you will do fine. She recognizes that a lot of the people taking the class are only there because of honors",1
"Boring class and subject. She lectures what is in the book, so if you don't go and just read the book you'd be fine; but she gives points for participation so you're kinda forced to sit through class. Rips papers apart but grades tests fair (although tests are hard). Loves talking about judaism and russian history which are irrelevant to the class.",1
"Honestly, the midterms were so easy that the practice questions on myeconlab were infinitely more difficult.",1
I agree with the student before me - everyone gets an easy A - just show up. Sometimes hard to understand.,0
"Really funny and interesting lady, but boy, does she ramble. Too many anecdotes, not enough objective facts. Can't really tell you too about archaeology after this class besides DIVA lab, Underwater Maya, and Canada. Good if you just need an elective, awkward if you're an anth major like me. 3 tests, multiple choice, pretty easy w/5 bonus questions",1
"This mans is retiring so I doubt anyone will be looking at this, but hoping him the best. Hated the class because I'm not a good film director at ALL, but he was very good at explaining stuff. Knows his cameras. Wishing him the best",1
"She was the worst teacher I have ever had, she is cruel and vindictive. Also now she is in charge of the entire theater department. So now I have no choice but to leave Laguardia, because she is unbearable.",0
Don't fall asleep! He doesn't like that. Very good teacher though. Please forgive me for dozing!,1
"Mairi is a great professor, she is brilliant. I would stress that for anyone taking her commBio 2/3 class to prepare yourself for a lot of paper writing. I have taken a few of her classes and she enjoys papers. She is a tough marker, but gives good feedback. She is approachable and the grade you get is determined by the amount of effort you put in.",1
"She knows a lot about this topic. I advise everyone to take this class due to the algorithms taught are real life stuff. Start coding early and ask her for explanations. She cannot write code well. It reminds me of a CS102 student. Besides that, cool class.",1
"No exams, only a 10 page midterm paper and final paper that aren't terrible if you do the weekly discussion posts throughout the semester. Also two oral presentations that are graded easily and you can read right off your paper. Attendance wasn't mandatory until the last two weeks when no one showed up. Lectures are dry but overall, class isn't bad",1
She is way hard and not nice at all. She is not understanding. DON'T TAKE HER!!!!,0
"He drew a large crowd, but I think a big part of it was his fun anecdotal style. His actual teaching though..I didn't find that great and wasn't getting much out of class.I stopped attending early but did well by reading a friend's notes and ass't sol'ns. His quizzes/exam are relatively ez if u just go through notes/sol'ns well.",0
"Pharo is tough. I would not recommend taking her class. She is unclear about what she wants, and comes off quite rude at times. Whether you pass her class or not, she doesn't care.  ",0
"Prof. Karras is very knowledgeable, but his lectures can be a bit dry. He's a bit intimidating and arrogant; be sure to come prepared to office hours because they're individual meetings. Don't bother doing the readings- just go off of lectures. I got an A and did about 4% of the readings. It helps to make a comparison chart of all the thinkers.",1
The best professor I have had while at the University of South Carolina. I learned more from him than any class or other professor. He is real life and doesn't tolerate incompetence. He calls out the slackers every class. Take him and learn more than just the subject material. He is funny and doesn't look like a typical professor :+),1
"Waaaaaaay too much work for the field she presents. You dont learn anything from her readings, truly unacceptable for history students - she almost made me wanna switch my major!",0
"She is very nice at appearance, but is not very understanding with students. If you ask a question her response is always very passive aggressive. Homework you grade yourself, quizzes are online, so you really get nailed on exams and the plant tour project. Shes very critical of your plant tour charter, benchmark questions, and written report.",1
thinks everyone who walks into his class is a math genius. the ONLY good thing about his class is that you do not need a book...his hand writing is completely unreadable so good luck,0
Dr. Waite is an amazing professor! Great lectures pretty easy to follow (it is Physics after all). Very quick grader (lots of feedback). He also really easy to get in touch with even on weekends. He is also really funny! Four exams and you drop your lowest one. All in all definitely recommend Dr. Waite! My favorite Professor so far!,1
"Communications teacher who can't seem to communicate. Tries, unsuccessfully to relate personal stories to lessons instead of ya know teaching. Refuses to submit online grades. BUT if you are attempting to learn how to read minds, deal with terrible teachers, or hate yourself and want a cruel punishment then Ted Lloyd is your man.  ",0
"Dr. Looney is more concerned about you grasping the ideas and your grades, rather than her just giving you a grade. She is always willing to help outside the classroom and make you a better writer.",1
NOT AN EASY DEC! Don't be fooled. Hard tests that are all short answer/short essay. Extremely long study guides with no answer key. A lot of useless information. Teachers hate when students leave early or take out cellphones. Don't take this class it's too much work for a 100 level.,0
"I would not recommend Prof. Ehring to anyone. The material he uses in class is not his own - you can find the PPTs on Google. He reads directly off the slide and gets bored teaching (he announces it in class). Syllabus is not downloadable, was not helpful when I asked for it, grades are not clearly communicated with you. Stay away!",0
"He is hilarious. He lectures as if it is a story which is kind've interesting to listen to. The tests are definitions and essays, all written. He does give you all of the possible questions before hand as a study guide. If you raise your hand and ask for a review session, he'll make one. On the last day he dressed up as a colonist. Real Gem.",1
he is tough but by far the best math professor i have ever had. he will make you know the material but it requires lots of practice problems. if you make a mistake in basic precalc you will not get any part marks. but he is amazing.,1
"Don't expect to look at the board and understand whats going on, you'll just see a ton of equations, most of them being the derivation of one key equation.  Her handwriting is also very sloppy, making any feedback near impossible to read.  If a large portion of the class does poorly on the assignment, she scolds the class instead of trying to help.",0
She was a miserable teacher to learn under and almost drove away my drive to learn Japanese.  I refuse to be taught by her ever again.,0
"Lectures wonderful or bad depending on the day, connects well with the reading sometimes of which you need to do to write the papers in which there is typically 3-5 that determine your grade. Need to learn what he wants to do well. If you don't get along with him, you won't with the department, he hired practically everyone, similar personalities.",1
"Chemistry w/Peploski was as good as it could be. Chemistry was a difficult class for me but Jim was a good teacher. His lectures are interesting because he does experiments in class and they are very fun. He goes fast through each topic which can be difficult but his homework, labs, and recitation help a lot.",1
"Lord is cool, I guess. His lectures are really good, but the grading criteria isn't really specified and he tends to grade pretty hard. I think he kinda warmed up as the semester went on though. Once classes switched online he became very caring and understanding. He really does want you to learn, he's just pretty average overall.",1
"worst lectures ever, doesn't care about whether the students will pass. your grade is only determined by 3 exams. doesn't teach anything you have to teach yourself all of the material, would never take again",0
"DIFFICULT. DOESNT USE POWER POINTS VERY MUCH. KINDA JUST RAMBLES MAKING IT HARD TO REALLY KNOW WHAT TO STUDY, OVERALL HE ISNT TOO BAD,",0
"Take this class if you are actually interested in human geography. The course material can get dry. He explains concepts well, however, the tests are mainly on extra readings and info from the textbook. There are five quizzes with 130 multiple choice each. I was not prepared for the amount of work involved.",1
"Powell is one of my favorite professors at the university. Very caring and knowledgeable. His workload is manageable and he is accessible outside of class, a very helpful person all around. I have now taken three classes with him and received an A in each. Would definitely recommend!",1
He thinks he knows it all. Looks down on people. Treats some students like they are his friends and others like who the hell are you? Very rude.,0
"Most useless lectures. Doesn't know the material he teaches and constantly gets stumped with student questions and stares at the board, until someone else answers the question for him.",0
"This man was the most uninspiring person I have ever had the displeasure of listening to in my entire life. The fact that he can't seem to separate his own political beliefs out of his lectures was rather ignorant. Also, have fun being 4 units behind every other Poli Sci class in the school. Nice guy though!",0
Win's class is very interesting and he does his best to accommodate you as a person. He is very understanding and tries his best to make sure everybody gets as much out of his class as possible. There is no homework but there are a decent amount of quizzes and tests. He posts plenty of study material and is always available to help. Best prof. yet!,1
papa smurf is the smartest man you will ever meet...and one of the kindest.,1
"Wow, this class was really hard.  I wish I would have taken it with Ball or one of the other professors.  You have a group project throughout the entire semester, so if you're stuck in a bad group, that's just bad luck.  Also, her tests are extremely difficult.  She gives you past copies, but don't expect them to be anything like the real one.",0
"Attendance is mandatory, taken every day. There are only 3 big grades: midterm, a paper and the final, so don't mess up. No other homework. Make sure to take notes and pay attention to his lectures. Reading of primary and secondary sources required. Very passionate about history, interesting lectures.",1
Gross didn't teach anything in class. We had to attend class 4 time per week so she could just talk about nothing and we would have to learn it on our own. She wouldn't even review in class. She also was never in her office so I could never ask her a ques,0
"Jan is an amazing professor. She has inspired me to become a college professor. Although her courses are difficult, she presents material clearly and is very fair in her grading. Study hard, take lots of notes and you will do well.",1
For the love of God Almighty do not take this teacher.  You have useless presentations and two papers that are worth 60% of your grade! 40-50 journals are pointless and topics discussed are bizzare.,1
He makes CIS300 much more harder than it should for a base programming class. Expects you to know C# like the back of your hand and to remember every single detail that comes out of his lectures. The class starts to become increasingly more vague and you'll exponentially have to dedicate more time outside of class learning material.,0
"2200 is a bit difficult and Bill is a little tough with marking but is ALWAYS willing to help you and make sure you get a good grade. But even if you get an A he still has a lot of comments on your paper because he's seriously a genius, don't let it scare you. Bill is awesome, definitely take soci classes from him. Another chili pepper for Bill!",1
"She is the best teacher in the world! She has her doctrine, SUPER SMART IN ALL SCIENCES. She will do anything to help you understand the material, very patient, and funny. She loves her subject! And I love her.",1
Very very hard class. Professor Alse seems like a really smart guy but is not a very good teacher at all. His in class lectures are just all over the place and are really hard to follow I had an easier time understanding the material by reading the book.  His tests are extremely difficult be prepared to study all day and all night before the test.,0
Professor Alchon is so passionate about what he teaches and makes it interesting to learn. This class was by far my favorite class I've taken at UD. He made me really want to learn about history and made me really think. Readings are helpful & class is necessary to pass. ,1
"Frustrating prof. Everything he writes is full of typos and unclear expectations. Lectures were long and strayed away from the material. Quizzes were difficult, questions felt random. Nice guy but not great at teaching. Luckily he graded our final project and paper easily so I received a decent grade. Most of exam questions are exactly from quizzes",0
She is the worst teacher ever. She literally stands there with a microphone and talks. No one paid attention and literally the whole class failed every test. Whatever you do DO NOT TAKE HER. SHE IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.,0
This professor was amazing! he would respond to emails quick and do whatever he can to help you succeed. The final was easy if you look over other quizzes and study.,1
"Lots of reading, there are weekly assignments but after a while you get used to them and they're very easy to do. The exams are brutal, even though they're open book. Assignment guidelines were vague but she's willing to clarify. Attendance is not mandatory as long as you show her you completed your assignments, but I don't recommend skipping class",1
"worst teacher I've ever had! Doesn't explain, review or help! Expects you to know the material already. I was worried about my grade and asked her what she suggested I do to succeed and her response was ""if you don't know this material you need to retake math 11"". She doesn't care about her students success. Terrible teacher don't take her",0
"great teacher! very helpful, very understanding. Learned a lot!",1
"Her class is easy, with 3 major essays and some small assignments. Very tough grader, the main focus on punctuation. She does not explain why she took points from the essays. Very boring class, she does not explain properly and is very confusing.",0
She is an amazing professor. She is very helpful and her class was based on 4 quizzes and a written paper. She is also very sweet and in our final exam she bought us fiber bar :),1
Easiest teacher I have ever taken. Assignments are sparse and very interesting. He is and easy grader. I have completed my entire Sociology minor by taking only his classes and no other professor in sociology.,1
I took his Intro to Music class and it was the worst teacher I've ever had. Without fail each one of his quizzes would have one or more mistakes. He also refused to put grades in Moodle which made it difficult to know my grade. He is also hard to reach out to. He still has not forwarded the email he sent to everyone but me in my class.,0
"Hanks is a wonderful teacher! He is interesting and he really tries to make sure everyone gets the material. If you are interested in Linguistic Anthropology, you HAVE to take him! PLEASE do yourself a favor and keep up on the reading! The readings are not that interesting but you NEED it to write the papers and you'll take FOREVER catching up.",1
"Even tough he is homework and paper heavy, if you do your work its a guaranteed pass. He is a great professor.",1
"Had us read 20 pages of a statistic book every week, and asked us 3 random questions regarding chapter. On top of that was having us research, write draft, and final within 3 weeks and didn't offer much help regarding the papers. Also wouldn't grade my finished work over the spring break because one of my sources couldn't be printed.",0
Very tough and plays favorites. Doesn't teach regular students the same way that she teaches honor students. If you aren't an honor student then watch out if you get her as your professor.,0
"Mr. Bunn was a pretty good teacher. He definitely knows a lot about accounting and has a lot of experience in the field. The homework was pretty consistent (2-3 times a week). Overall, the class was easy since you're able to use your book for almost everything. At times the material could be tricky though.",1
"Professor Christensen is a PHENOMENAL professor! He is extremely funny when he teaches, and he is very easygoing. His essays are a piece of cake, and his lectures are interesting. I am so grateful to have him as my English professor during a semester that he says is his last semester of teaching before he retires. Im so happy that I had him.",1
Life changing.,1
"SOC 422 is much more difficult than SOC 421 because there's more schools of theories. I thought this class was a little difficult for that reason but it's easy to study for as long as you're looking at your notes every week. There's 1 midterm & final and it's easy to get an A or a B, it's going to take a little more work with this class",1
"Dr. Sternberg was very interesting and was a very helpful professor. The only thing that made me struggle in the class was how he gave the five quizzes that are assigned. Although this strategy can be tough, you have to understand that college professors can be tricky at times. But other than that, you will have an nice experience with sternberg.",1
lol just messed up prof and super not helpful in any manner. stunned by how full of herself its not even worth writing things about her on this site ,0
"The only thing she talked about was the trump impeachment and if you arent a democrat, she will treat you like you arent even a human. Also, get ready to do 2 speeches in 2 weeks. And she never responds back to emails.",0
She was very condescending when explaining things. Also didn't explain things clearly at all. She gives a lot of information at once and not all of it is relevant and you have to try and decide what she is saying. I would not recommend her at all nor will I take her again.,0
"I loved Pat McKean! His connections in the journalism world are incredible and we had some amazing people come in to talk to the class. There is a lot of writing outside of class as well as in-class assignments. But none of it is crazy long, and it's all straight forward. He gives great writing feedback. I recommend him!",1
"I like Coop as a person, but his lectures leave a lot to be desired. As an engineering student, I don't really care about the theory behind the math, I want to know how to do the problem and he wasn't very effective for that. Overall, wouldn't take him again.",0
"Hardest class I've ever taken here so far. Granted I'm a sophomore, I took this with 303 and was my first elective. I like software programming but this was extreme coding. Don't slack off the projects at all. You learn a lot though. He knows his subject almost as if he invented it. Take with pass/fail otherwise, say goodbye to your GPA.",1
funny!,1
Best professor I have had in college!! She really connects with students and makes the class and subjects relatable,1
"He is really knowledgeable, but he lectures terribly; the lectures are not structured and hard to follow.  I started to not even go to the lectures and only to the problem sessions and still passed.  He started taking attendance in the middle of the semester and gave 5 EC points to whoever did not miss more than two lectures.",0
"Great prof. His lectures are informative and well done. He does take attendance and picks students at random to answer questions though, so if that's not your jam it might be rough. We ended up making a little game throughout our six assignments which sounds like fun, but it was a TON of work. Unless you've got a lot of spare time, you'll struggle.",1
This class is interesting if you're an erudite because It's basically self-taught. Doesn't respond to emails or doesn't read them correctly. It's sad because it's a great topic but there was no passion for even showing people how awesome it is.,0
He is genuinely a very nice guy who seems to love what he does he just rambles a bit. He gives lot's of extra-credit opportunities and is willing to help. The main grading components are the papers and he doesn't seem to grade them that harshly. If you just do your work it shouldn't be that bad. One negative is that he does not update grades.,1
"The man, the myth, the legend: Ed Evenson is a god amongst men. If you disagree you're wrong. If you go to class and pay attention / take notes you can get an A. His tests are based entirely off of what he says in lectures. Definitely get the textbook because it has all the diagrams he goes over in class that you need to know for the exams.",1
"You can rewrite your essay as many as you want until you are satisfied with your grade. For ENG 105 course, you have to write 4 formal essays and some short papers, but as long as long you follow her directions, you will get a very good grade. I will recommend you to take her class.",1
"John Tarjan gave very interesting and important lectures.  As opposed to other teachers who typically have only one of these elements incorporated into class, Tarjan always managed to have both.  He is very interested in the well-being of his students, and will go the extra mile for them.  I would definitely recommend taking a course with him.",1
"is pretty unclear on what you need to know, and then grades ridiculously hard. just getting the general concept DOES NOT get you ANYWHERE in his class. but, he's pretty fun and is a great person, he just expects everyone to be insanely intelligent and completely devoted to biology. which i, for one, was not and therefore failed the class.",0
"This class is super easy to pass. All you have to do it go to class and have a basic understanding of physics. However, he has a super soft voice and can make you go to sleep. There is a presentation at the end , but gives you full credit if you try enough. Super easy class.",0
"He makes no sense at all. He changes his mind so quickly and does not even remember what he decided on. He clearly said he will not do essays as exams once the class transfers to online due to covid-19, but made us listen to 40-50 minute podcasts and watch videos (which he said he would only do 15 minute podcast maximum) and write essays on it.",0
Just don't take him.  Im trying to warn you!!!,0
she is nuts.the lecture notes wont be posted till midnight or morning of a quiz.No partial points on anything even if you did the entire thing right till the end N theres this single little mistake all are points are knocked off.I understood the material well but her  grading just sucks.N be ready to have more exams n quizzes then more what u learn,0
"Supper nise and grate. Best rof ever. Restles but fare, never a dul momment witfh him. As i like too say. the best profs are the one's who alsso have a sence of humor, an grate nowledge! Wonder why he rettired.",1
"Dr. Garrison is such a sweet man, however, when it comes to teaching his lectures can be difficult to understand. Attendance isn't mandatory, but he has 5 random in class assignments that count towards your grade. Tests cover 7 chapters at a time, so take lots of time to study for his exams. Overall a good teacher, just be prepared to work!",1
"Prof. Barakat has got to be the best math instructor I've ever had! People who say otherwise are the ones who need their hands held at all times and don't actually try to learn the material on their own. He showed us all the tips, tricks, and shortcuts there is to math in detail. If you actually try, you'll pass. Definitely would recommend.",1
"Honest review here, Professor Fels is such a Fels. She has no idea how to teach this course because she's a researcher. She brings in guest lecturers that think we're high school students. Our exam was to write 15 pages of complete BS with questions that makes no sense. It Fels good to finish this term cause I can't stand another term with her.",0
"I'll start with the positive, he lets you use a sheet of notes for every test, which helps a lot.  Now the negative, he yells A LOT. If you have your phone out he won't only yell at you, he'll come to your desk and continue to make a scene. I also truly don't believe he cares about the success of his students. I would not recommend you take him. ",0
Her lectures are confusing. Had a better understanding when i read the textbook. Very rude often taking shots at the students for absolutely no reason and also for asking genuine questions. Course project groups formation is a nightmare as there are no deadlines so students don't respond early and send emails in the final month to join a group.,0
Assigns a RIDICULOUS amount of reading.,0
"Rodgers was off topic almost 100% of the time. When it came to tests/quizzes you were never fully prepared. He never explained anything well, and when you asked him a question he would answer it with another question. I would not suggest you take his class.",0
"Vederas is an amazing and hilarious guy, but not an amazing prof. The final was worth nearly 40% of our grade and only had 25 questions (all mc or t/f). I'm not sure if being online made the course that much harder for him to teach, but I don't think he adjusted well enough to teaching online properly. I definitely feel like my education suffered.",0
"Eh...not a horrible prof, but not the best. Grades easier than most on papers, you can BS and up with with decent marks. Midterm and final are random multiple choice questions. Won't ever give you a straight answer and will ramble on and on Lectures are pointless, but he takes attendence. eh.",0
"Taking her now, & she's a nice professor. Lots of reading, but the readings are interesting. Quizzes are mostly opinion based so it's hard to get them wrong. Documentaries every week, so if you hate watching movies, this isn't the class for you. Discussion based class, so if you hate participating, then I wouldn't suggest Sullivan.",1
he cut his thumb off in the woodshop at lakeville and it made him retire hahaha papen,0
"The grading policy is very lenient. I ended up with an A, but to be honest came away not really understanding physics. It seems like it's mostly equations being put on a board, with not enough attempt at helping students to really understand the material. Retakes on every quiz though, and participation counts for 20% of your grade.",1
"He is there for you, both academically and spiritually.",1
This guy knows what he is talking about.  He's not going to hand feed you the answers.  He wants you to understand the material inside and out.  If you think about things and are willing to work you'll do fine.  If you quit trying you are not going to do well.,1
"I was dissappointed. Concepts were scattered. 'Practice' quizzes are given but are much easier than the real ones, so it does give one a feeling of false readiness. I liked Dr.Koehler on a personal level, he was very nice, and he did post lecture notes. It was a brutal course for most of us.",0
"Apathetic of students who seem inferior of smarts. Has put down some students, neglected to answer some questions, inserted political opinions that started debates, and even sent an email about offended feelings about confusing and draining lectures and book reading difficult to understand. Besides TA's, save yourself and don't take econ from him.",0
He's not good at teaching on how to write a paper.,0
"AMAZING lecturer. He really knows his stuff and presents it in an understandable way. The class hinges on the midterm and final. Reading is on your own, and most people don't do the readings, but are still fine. He is fair in his grading if you put in effort and show that you're trying to learn the material. Tests are primarily lecture based.",1
"His English is not that good and he can't really explain well, he mostly reads from the slides and the lectures are sooooo boring!!",0
"CMST210 is a pretty chill class. Each week there is a live discussion (takes 20 minutes of your time), one discussion board (5 responses, kind of heavy), and one short paper due. All of this takes around two hours per week, which makes it a very light class. If you just do what you're supposed to, there's no reason you won't get an A. Kinda boring.",1
"Ya this prof is horrendous. He picks on students all class and is rude and unprofessional but says its just ""because it's a role he has to play"" to prepare you for real world. Too bad he's the chair of GMS so you can't do anything about him. Wish I could give him a 0/5, since even 1/5 is too high.",0
"I am surprised on his ratings by other students. His teaching is not excellent, just average. The course was not hard with no exam and was graded based on homework/report. My problem is his grading. I am not a native speaker but he graded my reports harshly, taking point for English writing errors. I am an Engineering student, not an English major.",0
"Best professor I've had here at St. Thomas! Really cares about all her students, super nice, easy, and makes class a lot of fun. I was hesitant to take it as an 8am but she made it go by fast and let us out 10 mins early each time (sometimes more if the weather is nice). Understands this is likely the last Spanish class needed for credit. Take her!",1
"Shes a very nice person overall, but I didnt learn anything and didnt improve as a writer. Her lectures are incredibly boring and she stares at the clock the entire time. I honestly didnt try at all and got a B, so the class isnt hard... its just boring. The nice thing was we only had 4 essays to write.",0
"this class is pretty difficult especially because it is two math classes combined.  He is really easy though, but your better off reading and understanding from the textbook.",0
"Literally every single lecture was a prerecorded video from another semester. I could have learned the same stuff from youtube, why did I pay Oakland thousands of dollars to watch videos. I have never witness a professor care less then Jonathan Maisonneuve. I'm struggling to find words to describe this sorry excuse of a professor. Just don't.",0
"He literally has been talking about airships all day today. No one cares about the Graf Zeppelin. He's a nice guy and he'll always answer your questions and stay after class, but he gets off topic way too easy. It's a 2 hour class that could be condensed into 15 minutes.",1
"No way I can understand this guy...very HEAVY RUSSIAN accent + no good presentation slides. If you take his class, you're on your own to teach yourself.",0
Worst professor i've ever had. Tests are impossible! I spent hours and hours studying and it still did not matter.... you will not get better than a C. I've always been a straight A student until this gem. She will fail you with a smile on her face. AVOID HER! ,0
"A real caring professor. Offers students to come to him for help, will read your work and offer advice on changes to be made before he grades your work. Wants everyone to do well. Solid in his teaching, experienced teacher. A",1
"Prof. Smith is wicked, he's hiliarious and tells it like it is. Sitting in on his lectures is not boring, he likes to bring some aspects of his personal life into the picture, & if you're listening in on a lecture online (live!) he actually responds to your lively commentary. He's very open and available to all his students for help & smiles a lot",1
"Let me get to the point. I'm not a Computer Science student and I had choice between CPS109 and CPS118 - I made the wrong decision and chose CPS109. Midterms were very easy. But, I just wrote the exam today and I'm speechless. The exam was possibly the hardest exam I've ever taken, not because of the content, but the questions. +1 if you agree.",0
"Such a great professor! Start on hw 2 and study for test 2 ahead of time, they were the most challenging. Get to know him, he's super knowledgeable and friendly! Study the ppts and practice questions (not too long) to study for the exams! It's a more memory based class than anything but I didn't feel overwhelemed often!",1
4500 words report + 1.5 hr quiz for final. NEVER answer your question properly. Whatever you say is a complaint.,0
"Professor Sperling is great; she's definitely one of the most organized human beings I've ever encountered. Her classes are well-structured, assignments are straightforward, and best of all, she invariably returns papers the first class after they are handed in. She also has a great sense of humor.",1
"Trefftz is a good prof and incredibly nice. Sometimes his lectures are a little bit confusing, but he is very accessible outside of class if you need. He also is a lenient grader, if you make an effort you should get a good grade.",1
Class is very fast paced! But do your work and you'll get through it! PROOFREAD!,0
"This professor is super duper easy. However, the most useless and the most boring class, I have ever ever taken! Gives out study guide, every class period was spent on going over the study guide (NO ACTUAL LECTURE OVER THE MATERIAL). All the questions are going to come from the study guide. You are just lazy, if you don't make an A in this class.",0
"Has obvious knowledge of subject matter, but very boring. Doesn't seem to like teaching much. If she would have been my first English teacher, I would not be majoring in it now. If you don't have her exact opinion, you're absolutely wrong- she does not value students' opinions AT ALL.",0
"The best professor i've had by far, and im not a history major. His lectures will amaze you, but you need to take notes. He will give you all the time you require for the exams. Take his course once and you will remember him forever.",1
Absolutly the best chemistry teacher i have ever had. He is a generally nice guy and is willing to help you out as long as you put in effort. If you go to class and take notes you will be fine. Old exams help with Doer and do the homework its a huge part of you grade but super easy!,1
not a good instructor all he talks about is his old stories. and i you want to be an officer thats not what you need to be learning.,0
"Very easy class. He lays out exactly what you need to do for each assignment and as long as you do that, he'll give you 100 for it. Very helpful and understanding but the lectures can be a bit boring - he over-explains. Really nice guy though and an easy A. Definitely recommend him to get this class out of the way.",0
"I have never had a better science professor at Auburn and no it's not an easy A.  You do have quizzes every Friday, but it makes you stay on top of the material.  I had a B going into the final (88%) and I made a B on the final but she gave me an A in the course because I went to every class and every review session. TAKE DR. ELLIS IF YOU CAN!!!",1
"If you show up, you'll be fine. However, just warning you that the tests are a bit difficult. If you are on top of your assignments, you will be fine. Just know that the tests are EXTREMELY DIFFICULT.",0
"Lectures are really boring, but I would still recommend going. Weekly quizzes force you to stay up-to-date. The quizzes are straight from the HW. The concepts are difficult and I found my small section instructor (Ferrante) helping the most. You will need to study a lot for tests, they are not easy. A lot of partial credit is given on problems.",1
Get her if you can! She is super nice if you work hard and show up for class. I have always hated giving speeches and she made it fun.,1
"fabio may have been a good prof. in-person, but i would not recommend taking him fully online. Even though we were adapting to online class, he was still not very lenient on deadlines. He made 2 hours of daily homework due at 5pm, which is extremely inconvenient. He's very vague on instructions and not flexible, but my spanish did improve immensely",0
Her class was amazing and she teaches you from the minimal basics. It really did teach me a lot and gave me something to look forward to twice a week. She was very nice. An easy A.,1
For the online teaching world I would hardly call him a prof since all he does is Pearson stuff. I'm not complaining since it's easy (even though I hate pearson). Feels like a waste of money since I payed to be taught by a human not Pearson.,0
Best teacher @ UB!!,1
"Laughs constantly when making mistakes. Very thick accent and cannot understand. Skips steps in problems. He doesn't have a set key to grade exams. He just takes off as many points as he feels. Also he tries to make his course's average look sufficient by doing this and some people who deserved higher or lower grades are averaged out to a B-, B.",0
"She is clearly an intelligent person, but she'd be more fit to teach an upper level Econ course. She has a strong tendency to go off on tangents, and though she goes over the material in class I always left never really learning anything. If possible, take another teacher. She's not terrible, but it wasn't a very enlightening class.",1
makes a lot of mistakes. Funny teacher. Likes teaching. Never take it in the morning class.,0
She grades papers way too harshly and they are on the most boring topics ever. She is a good teacher and you'll learn a lot but it's over the top for basic college writing.,0
She is very helpful with questions and research. Very friendly and helps with the papers. Her material is very interesting. Grades ok.,1
"he is the best organic teacher there is at clemson, & he really know his stuff.  he is so hard to follow and understand though, so you have to learn it yourself, but i would recommend him anyways because he is genuinely nice and knows so much about it.",1
Stallar was opposed to anyone who challenged or questioned him. He is very biased and discriminatory.,0
"decent teacher, but he is really strange with grades.  It seems like he just pulls a grade point average out of a hat to determine your grade.  Makes you believe you are doing better than you actually are as well.",0
"Dr. Willett is amazing! She is one of my favorite history teachers by far! Her lectures are interesting, and she doesn't use a textbook. Tests are essay based, but her and her TA's aren't tough graders. I would take her again and again!",1
"Prof Chang is cool and interesting, but his class can be extremely disorganized. Your grade depends completely on attendance and answering iClicker questions during lecture. He brings in guests, which is always fun. You have to go see two outside shows, but one is free. Interesting subject, but very disjointed class structure.",1
Dr. Melnichuk is the sweetest and funniest professor I've ever had! He is always there for help. You will truly be blown away by how much help and support he provides to his students. Amazing.,1
"This lady is a TOUGH GRADER! When I took the class I always received an A back for what I did for my projects but when the end of the semester came, my grade was low. She expects too much for a 4 hour class when it comes to grading, & she doesnt put in grades! Other than that her class, is fun if your an artistic person.",0
every single midterm and final is boderline useless and is made to fail students,0
"Honestly, I am SUPER understanding of professors due to them also having personal lives. This, however, is so different. This class was supposed to be fun and interesting, especially during this election year but turned out to be the worst class I ever had. I had all As this semester besides this class due to disorganization and procrastination",0
"The driest topic psychology has ever seen is classical conditioning, yet Russ is able to make it the most interesting thing right after Stranger Things. Every week ends in a quiz so prepare yourself for reading. The quiz questions come from the end of chapter quizzes so make flashcards and be sure to learn all of them. A short paper and 2 exams.",1
"Awful. While he seems like a genuinely nice guy, he's impossible to understand, provides no extra examples, and is unable to clarify when asked for further explanation. Going through exam review at the end of the semester reinforces how little he manages to teach over the semester.",0
"Hard to follow. Complicates topics that aren't really that complicated. Describes things very vaguely, and examples don't really give a clear indication as to what he means.  Probably the better of the two options, considering Adomait, but try to avoid at all costs.",0
"Great teacher, she will break it down and make something you dont get at all by yourself really easy as she explains it in class. Dont miss lecture not because you will have to spend four times as much time trying to figure it out on your own than you would have if you just showed up. Very challenging but very fair and more than do-able. ",1
"If you are in the psychology field, it is a must to learn about your professors as you expect them to learn about you. You must read and learn the flow of this class and if you are involved and listen to her lectures, she pretty much tells you what will be on every graded quiz or test. Reach out and you will be met at the other end. Effort is key",1
"Joe Kirtland has a vast understanding of calculus. He is very good at helping out on problems during office hours. However, he does give a lot of homework that take a while to do. Overall, very nice respectable professor that is enthusiastic in class.",1
Great online instructions.,1
Take him!!! 2 written speeches and in-class debate. One research paper. Easy grader. Very friendly and helpful!!,1
Terrible Prof. He simple does not know how to teach this course. The text book he provides is a joke! Totally not worth 60$. In my personal opinion he should be sacked as he is just as good as someone of the street teaching students that are paying lots and lots of money for!,0
Very friendly lady and very helpful when needed. She'll offer time on her schedule to help with Sam assignments any with questions for her tests. Attendance is not mandatory but not going to class will definitely affect your grade.,1
"Cares a lot and tries very hard, but not a great prof.",1
I have had him for two semester. The second was because it was the only class that I could get into. I can not tell you how awful he is. He just lectures for the 50 minuet class and then makes you read 60+ pages per night with a quiz a week and tests that are 75 questions in 50 minutes. The all around worst teacher Iv had at GU.,0
"Do not take him!! He's so soft spoken can't hear him even if you sit in the front. He's very unclear I didn't learn anything. He's very knowledgable, wrote many books but shouldn't be a teacher esp at an undergrad level.",0
"Hrinca is the worst. Literally have to teach the entire course to yourself. He only reviews homework in class, you literally have to read the textbook and teach yourself the math, he does almost zero lecture in class, just pop quizzes and answers questions.",0
This teacher isn't the best teacher to take a class with. He has a very thick accent that you can't understand what he's saying at all. He does however doesn't give you a lot of homework but you won't understand how he grades. You have to purchase his book that he made because there's a code in the book to access your homework and it's hard to read,0
Don't let yourself be fooled by his average it is misleading. Some people really like him because he is entertaining but when you actually analyse his teaching and grading skills you can see that an economics Ph.D in 1980 is not worth much in 2018. Big waste of time and money.,0
He expects you to know the material. It is hard to understand him.,0
"This professor makes easy material to be very difficult. You always get confused while reading a very long assignment. And most questions asked on Piazza were answered by some enthusiastic students but not the professor. I would highly recommend, instead of taking this professors lecture, wait for somebody else teach this course.",0
"David Pace shows serious interest in his students work and research. If you are willing to go out of your way to talk to him, he'll offer a lot of helpful advice.",1
"hardest cs course had so far, not recommended to the ESL students couse he is russian",0
"don't take this class if you don't know everything about polisci on the top of your head. connect quizzes don't relate to the tests. before online classes, the tests were unable to read because of all the typos, now w/ online classes the tests are extremely hard. not to mention, if you email him he will respond very rudely & it wont help.",0
"Quiz every class, all work only based off of the book. If you do not teach yourself you will not pass. His lectures have nothing to do with exams or quizzes, they are pointless. Wish I could give him a zero stars.",0
"Straightforward, easy to learn from.",1
I feel as though dr. blandino is a very nice teacher. she shows interest in class and makes it fun at times.  she is really easy to learn off of if you just pay attention,1
This is the first time I actually rate a professor on this website. Because I find the negative comments untrue. She is a great professor and probably one of my favorite. Took her for linguistic and I really enjoyed it. The midterm test was easy but the final was pretty tough. Gives out only few assignments (easy). Overall an excellent professor. ,1
"He is one of the smartest, most genuine professorsteachers I've had, though his lectures and assignments can be baffling they do push you to learn about yourself and your environment in new ways. ",1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. If you take Stein's class be prepared for no homework (not even optional work for practice), 1-2 quizzes every week, and for him to only lecture about problems he already wrote out. He comes to class with a paper full of work and just talks about it the entire class period. He is a VERY harsh grader on exams and quizzes.",0
"The lectures are easy to sit through and content isnt hard. youre graded off of only 4 tests, 40 questions a piece. 12 of the questions are about a clip of music. He doesnt talk enough about content thats actually going to be on the exams and its up to you to study",1
"I took Joseph a few semesters ago, dropped his class and am now retaking CS113. Just came back and wanted to say I still have a strong hatred for this man. DO NO TAKE HIM!",0
"Quizzes, 2 exams (1 midterm and 1 final), large portfolio project, and weekly lectures. This class was AMAZING. The book, Mountains Beyond Mountains, is used in place of a text; I enjoyed it. His quizzes/tests are very easy if you're prepared. He is kind and engaging. I was always happy to do work for this class. Stay on top of the portfolio",1
"Dr. Gebrewold is a great professor and a kind person.  You do have to write quite a few papers, and he likes the title of each section centered and listed in the paper.  He reviews for tests and exams are fair.  He also allowed open book final.  Theories is not the most interesting subject, and he made it enjoyable.",1
"Don't need to go to class because he doesn't actually teach anything in it, just asks about people's feelings. Had a lot of guest speakers. Read the book because that's where all his exam questions come from. 3 tests, 3 essays (easy grader).",0
This is the WORST professor I have ever had in my life. He is a poor representation of LaSalle and I am appalled that he is allowed to teach here. He is rude and utterly unhelpful. Stay away at all cost.,0
worst teacher EVER,0
"She's so nice and I thoroughly enjoyed her class.  Do take notes on key points that she makes, and read the book as the test is based on both her notes and the material in the book.  Participation will help with your grade.",1
She is a very very sweet lady and will help to clear anything up for you. She also is always helpful outside of class. The lectures are somewhat boring though. She does try and make things interesting sometimes. If you miss class and don't know someone in the class you won't know anything for the exam. Notes are fill-in and she does not post PP.,1
"I dont think I hated a professor more then I hate him. He was the worst math professor I have ever taken in my life. Dont take him, take cutler instead. Or you can take him if you enjoy hell",0
I love his class on poetry analysis and think he's an extremely intelligent professor. All poems can be found online as well so don't buy the book.,1
"Going to lecture was a very big waste of time. He basically would put the prelabs on the projector and talk about them. There was never any structure to how he taught and it felt like he didn't care. Don't base whether or not you take the class on Ammerlaan because he's never around and I really liked my GSI, she was super helpful and really cared.",0
"super easy class, kinda boring but hey i dont like theatre.  guy babbles off on tangents quite often, but if you read the book and study you're all set, papers are easy (goto a play, write about it, your good)...",1
"Scovell can get a bad rep. But I genuinely love having him as a professor. He is funny, and willing to help. Yes, sometimes assignments come out of no where, but if you pay attention and are actually nice to him, youll be fine. Hes easy to get along with and hes very kind. Ive had him for a few classes and would take him again. Hes great.",1
"You're back in high school with Rankin. Does not help you at all, just says it's test material and she can't comment on it, even though it's in class and not an exam day. The Lab skill training taught me way more than she did, it's pretty easy if you just do the lab assignments a couple of times. Would NEVER recommend Rankin to anyone.",0
"I like watching movies and I chose this course. I like her analysis about the movies, and she is really fair on marking papers and the deadlines. Though sometimes she repeated her words several times, it's not a big problem.",1
Expects far too much for the coursework of b50,0
"He pauses in between sentences which adds up to half the class time Spends a month lecturing half a chapter. During reviews, he goes over questions that won't be on the exam . Takes off points if you don't solve it the way he wants it. I should have listened to the previous reviews on this man. Please read the other reviews and avoid this man.",0
"He's a typical overworked PhD student who doesn't want to teach. He often rushes through slides and responds rudely to questions. He won't take late hw though he doesn't grade it for weeks, and he will make your life hard if your project doesn't interest him personally. His pop quizzes are easy & open note.",0
"103 pol. Sci winter semester and am thankful I did. It's a gen ed so you have to take it, but I wouldn't recommend this class. Prof. Ross rarely writes notes on the board, he tends to get off topic, and doesn't exactly work his way back to his original point. Heavy grader but leaves specific guidelines But some sources he gives for wrk are outdated",0
you ruined my life... I hate you....,0
You have to teach yourself in order to pass this class. He communicates terribly and even his TAs have no idea what is going on. He only does two examples of questions during lectures that dont even make sense with whats going on. You need the book in order to teach yourself if you want to pass.,0
"SUBMIT WITH CONFIDENCE! Good prof, uses web assign. Comes to class prepared. Intermediate amount of HW but reasonable due dates. I would, however suggest not using him as your only resource and looking up professor Leonard on YouTube or something. He saves trig and logs for the end which is a huge plus, gives you time to digest the material first",1
Good lecture notes. Audio notes are available too.  There're sample tests online and quite similar to the midterm. He gives you solutions for assignments which is great. Overall he's a good decent prof in CS. The course is hard though but all CMPT courses are hard you know what I mean.,1
"Greg is a good guy! He gives you a chance to rewrite everything. His grading style is different - He doesn't give number grades, but rather leaves comments to improve your writing. He emphasizes learning rather than the student going after a certain grade. I would recommend him. I ended up with a 3.7 and the workload wasn't overwhelming at all.",1
"I had professor Enright for the Spring 2020 during the COVID-19 crisis. He probably adapted best out of all my professors. In terms of mathematical understanding, he knows what he's talking about, something rare in other professors I had. His class isn't easy, I'll admit, but that's not because of him, it's because its freaking 3d calculus.",1
"She makes this class really hard, but if you ask for help outside of class it will help. She moves too quickly through material, her accent makes her hard to understand, and she doesn't answer questions in class well. There are graded clicker questions each class. There is a semester long group project. Definitely suggest going to office hours.",0
"Professor Martinez does not care about you as a student nor your grade. He only cares about his prestigious as a professor and his own image. Comes off as condescending when his lectures were unorganized. During COVID, the professor was unreachable and did not rely on technology as other professors. Kept blaming internet problems on us.",0
If yoy take her class. You better lean on my math lab and be good at teaching yourself because she does not lecture and not good lectures when she does.,0
"you will not pass her class , do not take, please,",0
"Professor's reading assignments mostly consist of his own writings that summarize thinkers like Hegel, Locke, etc. in a few short paragraphs -- so this course doesn't really teach you about sociology or how to critically analyze texts, just parrot back his own ideas of who these people are. Seems very self-indulgent.",0
"I can't believe all of the bad ratings. By far the best professor that I had at OSU. In fact, the only one I really remember 14 years after graduating. His lessons impacted my writing style and skills and have had a lasting impact. Great guy with dry/sarcastic sense of humor. Follow directions, get to the point in your writing, and go to class.",1
"To get an A in her class you would have to work very very hard. She gives out a lot of work. Expect homework on the first day of class till the very last day. It might start out slow, but wait till the end, she throws all these work at you. If you are not willing to put 100% effort in her class, don't take her!",0
"One of the worst professors Ive had. If you understand math and can teach yourself, its okay, but, if you are a person who is a slower learner and needs extra help, DONT take her class. You dont need the book but there are always group projects and she does not answer your questions well. Lectures are very boring and long. Makes mistakes.",0
"Ms. Hutton is knowledgeable about SpEd, but seems to have another agenda...not sure what. She is impersonal, unapproachable, and has a chip on her shoulder. Her appearance is questionable, with unprofessional and unkempt clothing.Also, reading from ppts is not a teaching method.  HCC should take a closer look at this...she is a real turn-off.",0
"If you're taking him for chem 116 GET A DIFFERENT PROF His lectures have nothing to do with his tests and he is too smart to teach this class. Hard to relate to and obviously a genius. I could not pass the tests and when I talked to him about my grade he talked down to me as if it was as easy as pie. I'm sure he's a good guy, but it's not worth it",0
Dr. Artis is an amazing professor. Her assignments and expectations are clear and she explains the concepts really well. Easily accessible outside of class. She gives a practice midterm and practice final to help you prepare. Weekly homework assignments but they aren't hard. Definitely recommend her for SOC 279.,1
"She is a good and incredible teacher, she is very weird but cool and good person at the same time. You would love her.",1
"Hard class, but she makes it easy. Make sure to watch the lectures before you come to class - sometimes gives quizzes to see if you did.",1
"The king of ambiguity when it comes to big project requirements- you'll fly without radar until the last couple days before something is due, when he tends to finally drop a big hint about what he wants. If you can live with that, he's a great guy and his lectures are very interesting and informative. Talking to him in his office will always help.",0
Mueller is a real cool guy. GEO100 was my first core class and he is a fantastic professor as well as adviser. Would highly recommend him.,1
"I loved Professor Lee and his class. You can tell that he's super passionate about his subject, and he spoke in such an energetic, funny, and engaging way that I was always entertained while learning a lot of good stuff. I typed everything he said, and so the tests were a breeze. He's accommodates for you and edits the tests with your feedback.",1
If you don't come to class exactly on time you will SHIRLEY loss points lol a little Britt Shirley pun for ya,1
"nelson is the man, he is soo easy and is a good teacher too, go to class all the time and study practice tests because they are exactly like the real thing with different numbers, one of the best and easiest profs at tech, take him if you want to learn a lot and get that easy a. best of both worlds.",1
"This is such a bird course. M/c midterm and final. Final is cumulative. 1 group project and labs. Labs are very easy. All you need is to read his slides. No book needed. Overall, recommend!",1
"Worst professor I've ever seen. Never listens to you, she has a habit of talking too much but trust me you will never get what she is talking. If you want to fail then take this professor. She is an old lady, her English is too bad. She does not teach anything also she is a tough grader. Seneca should fire this type of lady.",0
Quizzes every week so be sure to study for them. There is a written portion and a multiple choice portion for tests. I recommend writing your notes out in order to help with the written portion. Pay attention in class and write down what he says. He does give partial credit on exams/quizzes. If you get something wrong hell write out the answer,1
Can't get down our level - take math over the summer.,0
"Very intelligent person that certainly cares about what he teaches, but not a very good prof. He avoids e-class like the plague, from my experience isn't very reliable with emails outside of sending sources like articles, requires a virtually useless textbook, and regularly goes on tangents though you pretty much need to go to class to pass.",0
"Mr. Don very passionate about the subject, everything plainly stated especially about the expectations for the course. I missed a few assignments which is why I never sustained my dream grade but the course is very straightforward, the number one thing I think the professor wants you to take from the class besides information is sense of identity",1
"Assigns online homework on this program mymathlab. It is horrible. I did really well on the my math lab assignments, however once he decided to give us assignments that were 4 sections of the textbook and 90 some problems a piece. absolutely ridiculous! also gives you weekly quizzes with like 8 mins to do them. Completely outrageous!",0
"She is very tough, her grading method will hunt down your grade. She says that she is tough, and the test will be tough. You study very well, and you know the material, but the questions in tests are so specific that you don't know what she is talking about. Be ready for a lot of tricky questions. DON'T FOLLOW HER STUDY GUIDE, just study everything",0
He is a very nice guy cares about his students. you must must must understand his way to pass his class. His tests from the practice problems just changing the numbers. He never replay to your email before 2 weeks of writing. Ignore his lecture and focus on the practice problems and labs,1
"After 3.5 years at jmu, Hyser was my favorite professor. Never was too big on history, but i think this was my favorite class out of all classes taken because he made it so interesting. Also was always the quiet kid in class but he made it easy to talk in discussion. Pretty cool guy.",1
"Copied his curriculum from the web. He READS it but doesn't teach it. If you ask him a question, he says: ""Pay attention unless you want to repeat the course"". Not supportive and tries to bend University rules to him. Doesn't post grades. Gives HW subjects before they're ""taught"". Assigned 2 chapters and a project both before AND after the midterm.",0
In the process of dropping this class right now. I am a senior at UNCP and I have a 4.0. I am a finance major and I took this class for one of my science gen ed classes. It doesn't matter how hard you study and your book will not have your answers. I am struggling to get a C in this class. I have never received a C on anything in my entire life!,0
CSC373 is a hard course in its nature. He uses the traditional way of teaching by writing on the board which really forces you to follow in class and take notes. He is also very patient and understanding.,1
Very cool and laid back teacher.,1
"Seriosly, i dont think this man has ever admitted to being wrong in his life. Dont challenge him because he just gets super pissed and eggy. Quizzes were farely easy, tests were hard - he hates it when you spell things wrong. Final was a joke.",0
"I took this class 4 years ago, and I remember it being one of the worst classes of my life. All Clark does is barrel through the material, and it doesn't seem to matter to him if you are actually learning. Plus, he is extremely inaccessible.",0
SHE IS OK,1
the worst in cuny.,0
"Clear/strict but fair expectations. Attendance mandatory. Tests are tough. If you go every class and take diligent/decent notes you'll get a B. Grade is mostly from 3 tests/cumulative final - have to study hard for them/visually recognize art and/or when in history it's from. Loves his subject, girls think hes hot. Ask about graverobbers story.",1
"Super nice and funny prof, but tests way too hard for a first-year course. Lots of easy participation marks though. You will have to do A LOT of reading and memorizing for this course.",1
One of the worst profs I have ever had She should be teaching high school instead of a class in an MBA program. Rotman should be ashamed that she is still there inspite of the horrible reviews over the years.,0
"Absolute joy to have him as a teacher. He knows his stuff and is brilliant at what he does, a true inspiration :)",1
"His course is decent and not too difficult but his entire blackboard is super unorganized, making it difficult to follow when certain assignments are due. Hes very particular on grading papers and gives feedback, however what he expects on the papers isnt clear, its confusing and exhausting. I wouldnt take him again.",0
Why G.W. didn't tap JohnnyK for the Supreme Court I will never know.,1
"I agree, She has her favorite students.  She is unwilling to listen to theories that dissagree with her own, and 'acts' dumb sometimes.  She is obviously a little to feministic, and is very uncreative.  It takes her 15 minutes to say one thing - Worst class ever - but she is nice",0
Math is not my strong point.,0
Everything must be done her way or you will fail,0
"Dr. Angell is a very intelligent man who loves the content, but he is the worst professor I have ever had. He is condescending when asked questions. He is a very tough grader. He REFUSES to curve a test even when the average is a failing grade. He has the hardest exams I had ever taken. Take this class at washtenaw for your mental health.",0
"Prof. Billett is very nice and helpful! He has a lot of experience and knowledge in his field and seemed always willing to help the students. Downside is you are only allowed 2 absences before points are deducted. Other than that, 3 exams online are all you really need to worry about! Easy class, learned a lot too.",1
Best POK class at SU period for any major.  I think it should be requred!  And he's just so freggin cool!,1
"As a geog major, this was hands down the worst geog class I took at sdsu. Videos are long and unclear. Instructor is mostly into himself and talks a lot about his travels and his book, but not enough about course content. ALL papers are graded by TAs, online quizzes have weird questions about his favorite movies. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.",0
Makes it easy to pay attention and explains things very well.,1
He doesnt answer questions when things are unclear. Gives unrealistic time frames for homework when you also have 14 other credit hours to take. He also points out when students get failing grades on homework,0
"One of the hardest classes I took at San Diego State University. I am not sure if I just did not understand the material or if it was because of Professor Haddad but the tests seemed way different from the homework. Lectures were hard to follow and sometimes irrelevant to the applied concepts. Lots of homework, fully online. I barely passed.",0
"He's honestly a great professor who really cares about his students learning outcome. He does write his lectures in class off his notes, but it's so you can follow along and learn and program with it as he does the process. He does repeat things, because programming is something you need to practice over and over again to learn and remember.",1
Zedel is a funny guy but he has no idea what's on the go 90% of the time. He encourages questions but is rarely about to coherently answer them. He fools around a lot. He always admits he's unprepared for the lecture and slaps something together last minute. He wastes a lot if time in class and his notes are useless. Study the textbook. ,0
She explained everything assuming you already know it. Lectures where almost purely top hats without answer explanation,0
I did not have a good experience with this professor. Her teaching methods are weak & she is not an understanding professor. If you can avoid taking her class please do.,0
"Very good professor, does not play afvroites as he is amde out to.  Always helpful.",1
"Never took her on campus, but her online class was very disorganized and I was stressed out the whole semester because she graded everything right before the grades were due. Something was always wrong with the assignments or exams on blackboard and she was not clear about what was due when. Most disorganized class I've ever had.",0
"great teacher!  A lot of hard work, but if you attend class (like your supposed to) and do your homework, it's no problem!    And he's funny and knows how to relate math to commonplace things/situations, too bad he's retiring!",1
"He is one of the best math instructors. He is very patient and is willing to go above and beyond to help his students. Homework is optional, but it helps if you do it. He takes attendance every day. The biggest bulk of your grade are the exams, and there's maybe about 5 of them total. Attend his class, and you'll do great.",1
j.j. is one cracked up woman.  she has such a vast knowledge of everything in psychology that she DOES NOT STOP TALKING for the entire duration of class.  she chooses fav's and her tests include the tiniest details about the material.,0
Hilarious! The final would have been hard but he doesn't grade too hard.,1
ha... nice guy... but hes from the island... brits are funny. good teacher though,1
"Great professor who cares about students. This is my second time taking Micro because I didn't well the first time, but my fault. Pay attention in class and study.",1
Digglinggggggg! Dominatorrr! Vebber!!!,0
"If you don't have to take Physics THEN DON'T!!! He is the ONLY professor who teaches this class, and if you have to take this class because of your major, minor, or concentration then good luck. Get ready to teach yourself Physics if you have this professor.",0
Terrible professor tell you you have a test the day before and the test is completely different from the home work he assigns,0
"Most of the class time is spent listening to him talk about himself, which seems to be the only reason he came out of retirement to teach. He includes a page long resume/biography about himself on his syllabus. You have to keep track of your classmates, and report on their whereabouts to the entire class, which takes about half the class.",0
"Not a terribly good teacher. Gives horrid notes and nearly incomprehensible lectures that drone on and on. Reviews for exams are often unclear too. Grafstein tries to come off as humble and says there are no ""easy"" solutions but you can tell he thinks his opinions should be the be-all-end-all of policymaking. Overall, a mediocre teacher.",0
"Hands down the best professor I have ever had. Not only did he answer every question I had, he has a great sense of humor and really gets to know his students. As long as you show up and do the homework, the class is a breeze.",1
"Dr. Roberts is by far one of my favorite professors I have had at JMU and is the reason I have gone into the field I am. I HIGHLY recommend taking for PPA 265, PPA 415 and POSC 302. His lectures can sometimes be hard to follow, but if you're confused on anything he will always answer your questions! TAKE HIM!!!",1
"He has very good slides presentation...but they are of no use!Dont waste paper printing them !Exams are tough....you will find nothing similar to what you have learnt throughout the course.He has his own methods of proving problems....and expects students will write on the exam paper exactly what he has in his""MIND"".In the beginig of the sem he tel",0
"This prof. is awsome! Lets you write about whatever you want. No tests and the research paper is not conventional therefor STRESS FREE!Loved the class, his humor is one of a kind. TAKE HIM IF HE IS OPEN",1
WORST CLASS AND PROFESSOR I'VE EVER HAD - HE DOESN'T TEACH AT ALL. AVOID THIS CLASS.,0
"Elizabeth is very old school, she is completely disconnected from her students. Her lectures are super long and super boring, she uses no visual aids and does not post her lecture notes. In order to pass, you will have to show up to class. I will never take another one of her classes again, did not help my average at all.",0
This professor was interesting and assigned some really unique writing homework. I like how he encourages people to be creative and not just analytical. He can be very opinionated at times though and he can be really loud. Overall he was good though.,1
"I am a B+/A student but nearly failed his class. Asked for help and clarification, but all I got were vague apathetic answers. Got a paper back and his only note was on his dislike of my writing style and writing PROCESS what?(the claim he made was untrue) There is a major difference in criticizing and critiquing and only one makes a good teacher.",0
"Dr Mike is such a gem. His lectures are so engaging and he's obviously very passionate about his job. His exams are not bad at all, and he definitely adds information and value that you can't get just from the textbook! He's super accessible before and after class as well :)",1
"The course is tough only of you don't practice. He always says that a mechanism will almost always write itself provided you follow the rules. Very enthusiastic, fun, and helpful. He knows his stuff. The chemistry department has very good to excellent professors...",1
"I took HUM5 online during fall 2020. Prof. Terry changed his requirements for discussion board posts listed in his syllabus halfway through the semester, marking down grades. He does not offer lots of help. Directions on assignments need clarification. Super reading heavy, but if you do the reading and watch the films, you will pass the class.",0
"I have had Professor Carr for numerous business classes at Long Beach City College. He is amazing and continues to be a resource for me, even though I have completed all of my business classes. He grades fairly and pushes you to do your best. Making sure you do your assignments and tests on time, if you don't do well in groups, not the prof. 4 you",1
Utterly incoherent. His lectures are a colossal waste of time - just review the slides on your own.,0
She's a great teacher! Very very nice. Very helpful and she knows her stuff! As long as you pay attention during class and study for the tests you'll do fine. You can tell she wants everyone to do well in her class. She's one of my favorite art history teachers. Definately will take her again!,1
This was the worst professor experience I have ever had. I  never made above a low B on my speeches with no explanation. She gives insanely hard quizzes without really teaching the material. She takes forever to reply to emails so you can't even contact her outside of class. Would not recommend taking her.,0
"Dr. Zeeh is awesome. She is sweet, kind, helpful, funny, insightful, and an all around nice lady. She cares for her students like a mother cares for her children, and the students look up to her. Great person, easy to talk to, willing to help with any issue-class related or not.",1
He is a professor that doesn't care for his student's grades. He gives the same assignment multiple times and is not specific with what he wants so he will take off unnecessary points just because he feels like it. Wouldn't recommend taking him. Also makes you buy textbook and we NEVER used it.,0
he will destroy any one come in contact with him,0
"This is one class I actually don't mind going to. Most of the books you have to read are decent and the class is actually interesting. The papers are a pain but doable. You pretty much have to go to class bc there are 6 in class pop quizzes, but they're really easy if you do the reading.",1
Professor Mooningham is a very kind professor. You can tell she really cares for her students. I was not a fan of her teaching style and found her class to feel longer than it really was. I would recommend taking this course with Professor Mooningham if you like to learn things on your own.,1
"She is no where near helpful! She takes too long to explain things, extremely boring, and makes useless references to drinking, relating it to rocks somehow. This woman is useless. Don't take her!",0
"David is a ""gotcha"" kind of teacher. He often times places items on his tests that he has not gone over in class. He is demeaning and rude when students ask questions during class. Unfortunately, he is the only option for many students who have no choice but to take evening classes. Made easy material difficult. Worst math teacher I have had.",0
"Great teacher, gives youtube videos as lectures so you can watch them multiple times, gives good easy to understand overviews of the weeks and is a great teacher, really helps you learn the material rather than memorizing it.",1
"Professor Valluri seems to be nice, but I didn't find his teaching to be all that thought out. The course was online and if other professors hadn't posted their material to the common OWL page I wouldn't have passed, that's for sure. My advice if you register for his class is to look into whether there are other prof's sections you can attend.",0
"I have never left a review but this teacher just isnt fair at all. She responds to emails with sarcasm. Shes rude, blunt, and seriously RUDE.   I asked for her and she basically showed me how my classmates response was better than mine. No help just criticism. I will be filing a complaint, its that serious.",0
The absolute bomb of deadpan humor,1
"The worse class I have taken in a while. 100% group work online, seriously? Have to depend on entire class for quiz grades. You never see what you got wrong on quizzes.  She is short in her responses. Waste of time!",0
"Super understanding about everything, especially when my car wouldn't work and I got pulled over FIVE minutes before class, a real gem, and looks like the High Sparrow from Game of Thrones",1
I dont recommend this professor at all. He expected you to know how to do everything. He would show a problem and then give you a different one to figure out on your own in 3 min. So stressful. He also made you feel very stupid if you asked for help and just ran through all the material so fast. He even rounded my final grade down..,0
Do anything but don't take his class or Math 184 in general bc he is the head. He is way too difficult to work with and does not accommodate his students at all. Gave a midterm online with NO part marks when all the other departments are giving part marks and instead claim it's the student's fault. Is super unorganized. Changed midterm times thrice,0
"Hardest ""Intro"" class you will ever take. She knows her field cery and excpects everyone to know it as well as her. Lectures are absolutely awful, as she does not shut up about her dog and how smart she is. Tests do not include anything taught in class. Just don't take her class unless you have a strong psych background already you will not pass.",0
"Highly recommend him. Took Cal 2 and 3 with him. Gave extra points in exams and still at the end. Always answers emails. Met with me at his office for extra help. Clear explanations. I would take him again, no question. Learned a lot from him. Best math teacher from all I had at HCC.",1
Dr. Thistle tends to tell stories rather than teach. It's a really good class but I ended up teaching most of the concepts to myself. ,0
I took Prof Addi for Eng 101 and 102 online. Very fair and clear grader with a manageable amount of homework. Feedback was short and too the point but willing to expand if you email him. He chose really enjoyable topics to write on. Would take again.,1
"Dr. Brichford is the WORST professor I have ever had in all four years I have been in college. His grading is unfair and he picks out ""favorites"" in the class. He is very rude and arrogant and I would not reccomend this instructor to anyone. Anyone planning on taking English should think carefully on choosing professors!",0
"Very intensive class but definitely worth taking it. You will learn A LOT about politics in the Middle East and Brynen makes it very interesting to learn. He talks very fast but lectures are recorded. Readings are heavy, but you dont need to read all of them in order to get a good grade.",1
Expects perfection,0
"Steve, yes he wants to be called Steve, is awesome. I really struggled in the beginning but he was very considerate, understanding and helpful. Loves the class, would definitely take it again. You can tell he really cares about his students.",1
"If you're not prepared to go to all of his office hours, you're not going to pass. The man grades depending on his mood and not on accuracy. In fact, when he lectures he'll tell you one thing and then when you give him that answer on the test he will tell you its wrong. During the lecture, he yells, a lot. He's really just a mean old man.",0
"Shes just sooo boring. She trys to sit there and tell you, you need to use lots of teaching styles while she only uses one, LECTURE! Also she expects us to stay awake during class and watch movies and she is sitting there falling alseep herself. Terrible",1
"Three weeks in and already it is the worst course I've taken. The professor makes it so convoluted and full of garbage assignments that not only require you to log in every single day, but also have nothing to do with the course. I miss the old days of reading the material and taking exams. AVOID AT ALL COSTS if you can (I couldn't).",0
Took professor Hurd's intro to psych course online. He provided no course outcomes or any info about what the class covers or what is important. His lecture videos are boring and hard to follow. Weekly synchronous meetings are basically a waste of time. Most of the learning is done through long textbook readings.,0
"He's not organized, and when he teaches you don't know what chapter he's on which makes it confusing",0
"He is not the type of teacher to just let people all get A's without trying. He makes you work for your grade. However, I have learned a lot in his class, and I feel like he communicates the information well. He gives great lectures. I think that Dr. L is a great prof!",1
"Doesn't put much effort into his lectures. No slideshows, just a Word document that he scrolls through with minimal information. No textbook so you can only rely on the Word document and what he says in class. That is what makes the class difficult, you have no resources. Tests are all short answer. Only offers help when asked.",0
One of the best professors in EE,1
"Very dry. Fair, I suppose, not the worst professor ever. Just very very dull. Don't take him if you have problems with strict and boring professors; there are plenty other challenging and interesting profs out there.",0
"Goes too fast, doesn't accurately give you proper information. Messes up problems on the board. Repeats himself. Uses old algebraic ways of teaching. Got more help from my high school math teacher then I did him!",0
"Lady expects us to write a 15 page law school policy brief in 2 days. We would have had more time to think about it and write it, if not for her disorganized teaching style and procrastination! She procrastinates so much and never keeps to her promise. Its really hard to keep up with the class because of her.",0
"He is very clear, and goes over many examples in class, which is helpful at test time.  The concepts are new to most people, but he explains them very well.  Overall, I think he is a superb prof.",1
"At the start of the course, she claimed we wouldn't have a final exam. Second to last class, she announced that she had ""made a mistake"" and we actually would be having an exam. She was utterly useless as far as grading in a timely manner, giving helpful comments on why she graded us the way she did, and telling us that BEFORE our next assignment.",0
This professor was nothing but a nightmare. Professor Gilbert not only seemingly never graded a thing but didn't abide by her own syllabus. I would advise against ever taking one of her classes- especially her online classes.,0
"I have never written one of these, I have never written a review on anything actually but for this professor I had to go out of my way to. This guy is hands down the smartest professor I've ever had, he literally knows everything, everything. He is a funny guy and his lectures are never boring. I would take him again at any given chance.",1
He was late almost all semester by 10-15 min. His teaching technique is pretty avrg. Only gives a few tests a semester he takes points off for the smallest things such as whether or not you placed arrows on your graph. He didn't update the canvas grade book the entire semester. He has no problem with trying toembarrassing you in front of the class.,0
"I loved michael's hon 111 precep, he's amazing and really encourages free thought. He's also super supportive of us bringing our own passions to the discussion. Talks more about what the text means than the literal straight text, so if you only skim the book, u should be fine. he doesnt currently teach 112 and i miss him sm",1
"She's nice to you if you don't slack off.  Also, Japanese is at 8:30, 4 days a week for the first the quarters; if you can resign yourself to getting up that early that often you'll survive.",1
"Professor Trower is a very kind professor who really cares about his student's success. He can be a little difficult to understand sometimes, but he tries to make things clear. He is not tech savy, don't expect tech help from him, its not his job anyway!",1
Best professor ever! She is so sweet and cares so much about her students. I would definitely take her class again. ,1
She is not willing to discuss any matter and doesn't go as in depth as she expects on her exams,0
Rudest professor I have ever had. Offensively mean when you try to communicate for assistance. Refuses to help in a meaningful/positive way. Has a stupid grading scheme that can curve you down if you are below the average.,0
"He is OK professor. Subject is not difficult, but his explanation is often confusing, and often boring. He does not care a lot about his students. Make sure to do your homework, and make sure you understand it. Exams are not hard if you did your homework.",0
"Class is online during the pandemic. Most people are not on campus, and cannot get to the library to get the sources she wants us to get. Says she understands but then grades us poorly when we don't have the sources for the paper. Stated that anyone with the wrong type of citation (wants Turabian) will be documented as plagiarizing.",0
He just talks on and one and on an on. Show up and stay awake and you will pass . It is an easy class just boring.,0
"A really nice guy and really clear in lecture, but an ineffective professor. The experience overall left a bad taste - exams were much more difficult in comparison to what was actually taught and the requirements on the syllabus.",0
AMAZING; if you truly want to learn from a linguist you should take his class. He will teach you to create sounds you never thought you could do without an accent... worth all the work. A GREAT experience; he's an awesome professor who truly cares to make his students understand the concepts of the course material,1
"Spent literally 10 hours in total on this course online and got an A, course material is pretty difficult to understand, almost to the point where it's pointless to read it. His tests are really easy and he just uses the material he posted online. The study guide is apparently where all the questions come from but I didn't bother using it. Sigh.",0
"Textbook reference is essential. There are about 20 assignments, which are usually due 2 days apart from each other. Just do a bunch of them at once and you'll be ok :-)",1
This WS class is on Men's health. It was such an interesting topic & the professors brought in guest lectures almost every week. They both work together well and provide really great information and you learn a lot. They don't try and trick you so the midterm and final are easy if you study your notes. There are 2 papers and they're easy! Take it!,1
she's awesome she helped me with a different class yesterday when i was stuck for a lab.,1
"What a waste of time in the morning.  He talks about nothing but mercury amalgum!!! Also his course notes suck, a new born baby could put together his course notes. AHAHAHAH such a waste of $14.00.  One last thing don't expect to get good marks on his midterms because he expects you to know uncertainties of all your equipment in your lab!!",0
his lectures are long and boring. important info but hard to follow sometimes. pol213 spec only has 4 tests and 1 paper. so far i failed the first 2 and he didnt tell me what i did wrong only wrote things like read question or marked out things on first question w/out explanation.,0
DONT TAKE HER!!! She requires lots of work that is useless. She needs us to high light our sources and answer 30 questions for peer review of the paper. I mean seriously? She acts like we only have her class for a semester. Be smart to avoid her!!!!!,0
Worst teacher I've ever had. Very hard grader considering the class was easy. Doesn't explain grading and is very rude in response to questions. 10/10 do NOT recommend.,0
"I had this professor for several classes and would take more with him in a minute.  He is excellent - requires much of his students, but students will remember the material when engaging in a career in psychology.  He is concerned that students learn and be able to apply material learned.",1
Im 4 weeks in to his Database class. Really good and goes into detail when you ask questions,1
Professor Stoller is a great guy and I enjoy his class and the lectures he gives. The class is difficult although if you go to class and take notes you will pass. He also gives extra credit opportunities to all students to help boost your grade. He does make you buy his own book though which is annoying .,1
"1-3 hours of captioned lecture vids/week, v organized. Heavily eurocentric, I repeatedly had qualms about representation of African & Asian cultures esp; was marked down for correcting her on an ancient religious custom of my culture. Be aware that all announcements are in video form with no captions, if you're like me and at auditory disadvantage.",0
She is nearly impossible to understand. Her class is horribly organized and teaches absolutely nothing aside from a feeble attempt to expand your world view to fit her own opinions,0
"Prof. Frank is a joke. Everything that comes out of his mouth is with the intention to open a discussion or begin a story that relates to his personal experiences with the Asian culture. He does not teach, he talks about irrelevant things. He cracks himself up all class long and leaves the students feeling lost and helpless. DO NOT take his class.",0
"Attendance is mandatory but is an EASY 10% of your grade. Reading will help, because he goes over the information in class with examples, and that's all that your exams are on. Exams + 1 assignment + attendance  your grade, so don't drop the ball. Caring professor, wants you to understand it and give EXAMPLES. Wish he taught more courses!",1
"Royer is hands-down the worst professor I've ever had. He mocked students in class, he was really unprofessional when asked questions, disregarded his own syllabus (there were no rubrics for anything), he plagiarized another professor in the department, he made students workshop his own writing for him, and he doesn't actually TEACH anything.",0
"I think Keith is a really good guy but he obviously has favourites. Speak up, but don't over do it. He's actually quite funny and I appreciated his live lectures, but not the prof for me.",0
"He is an amazing professor.  He clearly presents all of the material that will be on the exams and he makes class fun.  The exams are difficult, but his study guides cover everything that is on them.  One of my favorite professors at SCU",1
Worst teacher in the world Do not take the class Doesn't know how to teach confusing Not helpful  Bad gradin,0
"Nice Lady, but hands down the Worst professor I have ever had. Extremely unclear with directions and explanations. hours of work outside of class with a no nonsense late work policy. If you get this professor, the only way to pass is to study and learn by outside help and study groups.",0
Professor Reynolds grading is very tough!,0
"Excellent professor for Kinesiology - good examples that helps you understand the material. But for AT, she sucked.",0
very hard to get along with,0
"She assigns a ton of work. She is a nice person, but the comments that she leaves on your papers are pretty rude. She can come off as condensing.  There are so many papers and they must be incredibly detailed. She is a ridiculously hard grader. Like she grades you on participation (only professor I know that does that)  I suggest avoiding her.",0
By far the best professor I have ever had!,1
"Best thing about Professor Lorcan is that you know exactly what he is looking for in essays as he outlines what you will be doing for midterms very clearly. As long as you pay attention in class, you should receive a good grade.",1
Take another Professor.,0
He is the only good teacher in the business department at CSUB. This is not an exaggeration. The whole school and MBA program is a joke. You only learn when you take his classes.,1
"No clear directions on to what the actual assignment is. Wants a new essay draft printed each time you make even just a word change, and we all know we don't have the money as college students to be printing off 8 or more pages every class. Definitely would not recommend taking her class, honestly taking the online class would be easier for sure.",0
"probably the worst teacher i have ever had.  throughout the whole semester, he only actually taught one day.  the rest of the time he just read off the powerpoint.",0
"Ward's class is straightforward and interesting. ""THEO and ECON"" is the best theology course that you could take at Marquette because it's so interesting and applicable to your life/other studies. If you read bare minimum and participate, it's not hard. She gives out potential questions for tests, has extra credit, and easy points. Take this class.",1
"Good professor. She's very understanding if you communicate and are putting clear effort into class. Not an easy A, but it's possible. You have to try in this class, as you should any college course. She's a tough grader but if you know your material you will do just fine. She doesn't use blackboard but she does give progress reports throughout.",1
"I took professor Renner through the pandemic and I can easily say she was the worst professor I've met at IU. At the beginning of the semester, she clearly told us she wasn't a ""teacher"", just a ""score keeper"". She hardly knows how to use Canvas, and was not understanding of her students at all. If math is not your best subject, like me, good luck.",0
She is a great teacher! Explains everything to the fullest and doesn't give a final! She does it by progress. I was terrible in math and she got me a 90 average by the middle of the semester! I highly recommend this teacher!,1
"A very nice person outside of the classroom and during office hours, She was always willing to help. However, lack of clarity in expectations/instructions for assignments left me, along with half the class confused on what she wanted us to do. She is definitely a really difficult prof. If you can avoid taking her, do it. I would not take her again.",0
"This class was, at its very best, slightly below mediocre.  I would not recommend this class to majors or non-majors.",0
"great creative writing teacher. if you think glaser's better, it's probably because you can't write and need someone to stroke your fragile ego and not tell you self-centered emotional drivel is good writing. sorry. Silex is awesome.",1
"Patricia can be nice and funny, but she is a very tough grader and her online lectures do not exactly cover what is on the exams. When quizzes are do you take them between 4-9pm and if you can't during them times you can either take it late at night or take a 0. Emailed the entire class saying we are cheating while most have a C.",0
"VERY TOUGH GRADER!!! Took PA history and she requires a 10 page paper with 10 sources and it better be perfect or your probably gunna fail. Lots of reading, presentations, and book reviews. Her lectures will put yu to sleep when she finally stops yelling. Never thought I would fail an open book take home test that I had every answer  for.",0
"Bruce is so sweet. I loved this class because it really opened my mind to writing, Bruce doesn't want the cookie-cutter papers you are taught to write in high school, instead, he wants you to actually think about the topic and write about how you think and feel about it. Easy A if you just try, have an open mind, and attend the lectures!",1
"Dynamics is a tough subject, and Dr. Quinn knows that. He really wants you to do well, and the curve is very generous. The main thing to do it practice as many problems as you can, and try to score above average on the tests.",1
"Teacher uses 3 different websites to organize syllabus, schedule, and class materials.  Very unorganized.  Does not make projects very clear and sometimes the teacher doesn't even know how to do the projects he is assigning.",0
"Very set it his ways, does not use the online resources effectively. Places one copy of solutions for assignments/tests at the library and expects all students to be all to view them. Only thing posted on his website is the assignments(which he hands out anyway) and the course outline.",0
"Expect to be assigned multiple quizzes, tests, assignments due the same day w/ hours worth of unclear lecture videos that will more than likely be assigned only a couple days ahead of the due date. High stress class especially in the middle of a pandemic/political crisis, would not recommend if you want to maintain any sanity you might have left.",0
The lectures are the essay questions on the test. The quizzes that are before the lecture are difficult but  you can get a zero on a few of them and still be fine. She curves her tests so much you can geta70  and that be a 100%. She answers questions and is very helpful. I think she is a great teacher that makes you think. ,1
Lots of reading followed by class discussion over material. You know ahead of time exactly what is expected for assignments. So if you want to actually learn and participate in class do the reading. If not do the readings when the assigned papers are due. With the least bit of effort you can get a great grade. She is lecture heavy.,1
"WORST ENGLISH PROF. She grades harshly and without explanation. She does not use a rubric for assignments, making it difficult to understand why she grades as she does. When I went to her office hours for help on a paper, she was not helpful. Her midterm exam included quote identifications (you must know author, text, speaker, etc). STAY AWAY",0
"TERRRRRIBBLLEEEEE, he never grades assignments!!! how are you supposed to do better on the next test if he never grades anything!!!!",0
Everything seems to go good all semester till you get your grade back. Has no Grading rubric whatsoever. IS NOT LENIENT. Avoid if you don't want your gpa to DROP.,0
"This prof has mandatory group work, which is worth half of your final mark and she has no empathy for group members with useless groups. This class is mandatory for all Tech students, and the workload is ridiculous with this prof, which is far more than any other prof teaching the course.",0
Theres a lot of homework and she grades she me what hard when it comes to papers. But she is also very understanding of her students.,1
"Good prof and willing to help if you ask for it.  The course is not math based, mostly subjective long/short answer exams.",1
"His class was okay. I wasnot impressed with his class. I loved some of the reading but he just read to us. I felt ""What was the point of reading if he was going to read to us?""",0
He is a smart guy but not cut out for teaching. Just reads off the slides unless he's talking about his own research. Covers way too much material. Would avoid taking the class or wait till a different professor is teaching it.,0
"Terrible teacher for the lab, doesn't explain much but also doesn't require a huge lab report... As far as her lectures I think she may actually be bored with the material. Tough grader that doesn't give partial credit from what I could tell. Multiple choice will be hardest part of tests. The online homework will teach you more than her",0
"Professor Schlortt isn't a normal history teacher, he is not date heavy, and unlike other professors' he understands that life happens, so he is flexible with due dates but don't take advantage of it.",1
"Professor Hegbloom has no respect or sympathy towards her students. She is rude and if you email her, don't expect a response until midnight. She does not provide you with any necessary requirements for assignments she requires and expects you to know the information without teaching a single thing. I do not recommend her to anyone. She's horrible.",0
I really feel like the entire course was very unfair. I would not recommend it to anyone under any circumstance.,0
"I think he is a nice man, but this class was awful. We watched movies everyday. He would write random terms on the board during the movie. Then expect you to know them all when he turned the lights on. Also, you're graded on three exams are take home essays. 4-5 essays varying in 300-500 to 1,500-1,750 words each and exam only totals to 100 points.",0
"Very dry humor, though I really enjoyed it. Funny guy. He gave about 12 or 13 pop quizzes. A couple of them he would give you the answers too, these were mornings when nobody went to class. I found the tests to be very tough, but in the end the quizzes helped my grade.",1
"An ok professor...tests are hard, never figured out how to study. Lots of extra credit, little hard to understand but overall a decent professor.",0
"Took pages of notes everyday , and yet couldn't understand what the hell he was teaching. Basically, i had to teach myself and read whole bunch of pages from books. In class term papers, is fairly straightforward, he does give the specific requirements he wants. ",0
"Very, very boring lectures. Grades on a curve though. Overall, if you show up and somewhat listen. You'll do just fine. Very easy class overall, tests once a week, along with written assignments that are only 250 words. Do your homework and show up.",1
Denise is awesome. If you like art or sculpting check this class out. You'll have a really good time. She'll help you with anything you need. Go for the gold.,1
"Okay guys...I got an A+ and it was all because I read his provided lecture notes over, and over, and over again. I read the textbook too, but only as supplement. But it really helped that he wrote lecture notes! Seriously! Listening to the recorded lectures over and over again help too...",1
"I had her for Intro to Costuming (B+) and Fundamental of Costume Crafts (A-). As long as you show up and participate, you should be able to get a good grade. Classes like Intro to Costuming has exams but they're easy if you read the plays and take notes on the costuming information. Totally helpful if you ask for it; very approachable.",1
Worst Professor I have had at GVSU. His tests always had errors and was not interested in hearing how you interpreted a question. His tests are very vague and extremely unclear so misinterpretation can cause a wrong answers. I am a strong student and struggled to receive an C in this course. I would warn all pre-nursing majors not to take him!,0
one of the greatest professors i've ever had.  he really makes you think.,1
"""Isn't it?"" lol. He was hilarious for the maybe 20 minutes I was awake in class. Read the chapters assigned in the books, study the powerpoints, and just memorize terms. He tries to trick you on the tests with similar answers. His final exam had the answers B,A,C,D repeated the whole way down and I got a 100+EX. You probably won't get that lucky.",0
This teacher is super hard. Hard to follow. You do get out of night class early but a very difficult class,0
"She is a very knowledgeable instructor. She often gets off task and talks about something else. If you do your work, she will help you. If you sit there and do nothing and ask for help, she will do the same back to you and will not help you.",1
LOVE this man! want him to be my grandfather!,1
"Will never take this professor again! His quizzes were very tricky, all quizzes had questions that had nothing to do with the assigned chapters. The weekly reports are heavily graded on grammar. Take at your own risk!",0
Dr. Sauser is one of the best biology teachers I have every had! She is extremely sweet and wants the best for all of her students! Her notes are heavy but well worth it and she includes study slides at the end of each powerpoint so there should be no reason to fail!,1
she is a good teacher but she is kind of crazy. It is hard to understand her because of accent. but she Is pretty good,0
"extremely nice and understanding. he is willing to help you as long as you ask. wrote me an EXCELLENT recommendation, take his course.",1
He can helps us.,1
"This class was really easy and I didn't mind having Professor Cornish. The main thing that I didn't like is that she wasn't active with her online students. I never really heard from her throughout the entire semester, just announcements when something would go wrong. It feels like she just forgets about her online students.",1
"He is extremely old fashioned but also very thorough with presentations and papers. You'll learn a lot. However, if I were to take this class again I'd 100% take it from someone else. Some of his grading is a complete joke. I feel like if he decides your a B student, you'll be a B student for every paper/assignment. Very nice guy though.",0
"The bad grade in this class was my own fault, and I'll admit to that. Dr. Pretzat really is a great professor. She cares about her students and wants them to do well. Just...go to class. Her attendance and homework policies kind of force you to. Would recommend her. But really. Go to class. Even if it's Elementary-level stuff. Go. To. Class.",1
"Lot's of harsh reviews for this teacher; however, I had a great experience.  The many papers was a lot of work, but I was made into a better Writer because of it.  She gives great feedback outside of class and wants her students to succeed.  If you put in the effort and time you'll do fine.",1
This professor helped me to obtain scholarships as well!,1
The epitome of a red chili pepper!,1
"Not one to call profs ""tough"" but Howell will be one of the few. I consider myself pretty hard working but Howell hits the point of destructively challenging 4 an intro. Class is 90% based on tests with 3-4 questions 30+ points each. Asking for help or collaboration with peers will give you a zero on assignments. Office hours? Don't bother going.",0
"I have Bemko for many classes to come and multiple before, if I had the option to take anyone else, I absolutely would.",0
This is the worst professor I've had at San Diego State University. His grading scale is the work of a complete lunatic. Perfect attendance copious notes the entire semester still did not give me a grasp of the subject. He lets you have all of the class materials at your disposal during tests an everyone still fails. Don't take this professor...,0
"Great guy! Super understanding and a fair marker. He's really nice, gave me an extension on an assignment and the final essay simply because I asked. You can tell he's passionate about what he's teaching.",1
"I took Shah for MTH 261 in the fall and I was miserable. He assigned hours of homework each night (you meet everyday since it is 5 credit hours). I'm a math major and I almost changed my major because his course was so overwhelming. He is a highly intelligent, kind man. He really knows his stuff, but expects you to learn HUGE concepts in one day.",1
"Interesting topics, awesome professor. Draper is definitely among the best of the sociology department faculty. Consistently fair grading and clear guidelines made this course one of my favorites. Exactly what a great college class should be.",1
"He was awful, the class is so boring, he has minimal notes on the screen during lectures, I studied for 11 hours for his exams to get C's. Office hours are so inconvenient and he has no interest in helping, do not take this class with him.",0
"Meakin is by far the best & nicest professor I've ever had. His lectures are very engaging and although the material in the book is a lot, he makes it enjoyable with his sense of humor. On the day of the final I woke up extremely late and arrived 15 minutes before the exam was supposed to be over but he still let me take the exam! 10/10 recommend!",1
"The WODs in this class are pretty easy and are not interview-level questions so you can just cruise em. The material learned was pretty relevant and was some good stepping stones into REAL software development. NodeJS, MongoDB, and Github are IMPORTANT to learn for a high paying Software job, however, top companies stopped using Meteor yrs ago.",1
"Hands out As like they are candy. He is the only smart person at the university or in the world, remember that and you will do fine. Just laugh at his stupid jokes. He is terrible.",0
Worst professor for finance. Quizzes and homework are not multiple choice and There is no instruction or practice problems similar to them. So disappointing to see a professor that can care less about his students.,0
Really not helpful. Material biased and boring. I do not reccommend the class or the teacher.,0
"Moved too quickly through the slides, but is a funny guy. He knows a lot of information, but it is unclear what will be on the tests.",0
"Tough class, got a B+.  Take the prof that guarentees 20% get A's.  I'm fairly confident Gross doesn't do that.  She is the course cordinator and I have heard from upperclassmen gross gives the lowest grades...  If you want to learn alot take her though, she is actually very good teaching wise.",1
"He was alright, class isn't too difficult if you put in the effort but he does drag it on and makes it feel boring at times. Overall, a decent GE",1
"I'm still amazed at how he pushes you onto lab coaches, teacher assistants, past students, and then...finally...he'll help you during office hours if you have a question.",0
"Dr. Klein was always energetic and ready to teach. His enthusiasm was easily transferred to us, making us eager to pay attention. Online assessments every once and awhile and map quizzes in the beginning of the semester. Review your notes so you don't have to cram before tests.",1
"This class was actually ridiculous. SO unorganized. Literally cancelled a midterm! And the quizzes can be tricky because they say they're based on readings, then they're actually based on an entire chapter! The only thing that saves this class is the FAQ because you can find out which assignments you don't need to do",0
"Has a very thick accent and no one can uderstand a word he says. Hard marker. By far, the worst prof I've ever had.",0
"I sometimes struggle to understand the material in this course, but I love the class, so interesting! Dr. Groves is a very nice professor. Great feedback on assignments, flexible, speedy replies to emails. I only wish I lived close to B Rap so I could take his class in person. I'd bet he has awesome lectures, because the book he co-wrote is great!",1
"I have taken multiple online classes under this professor.  As long as you listen to his lectures he provides you with the needed information for your tests.  Usually one 2-3 page paper to write in each class, but usually let's the student choose the topic.  Highly recommend this professor!!",1
She cant really explain things. Homework is really long and most of us work in groups. Literature papers are pretty abstract and I didnt understand any of it... if youre good at making BS that lasts for 20 minutes then this class is for you. No final exam just group projects which is really just luck on who you get stuck with. I should have drop,0
"Dr. Raymer is undoubtedly the best professor I will ever have for any Computer Science course. He cares so much about your success and will do whatever necessary to help you succeed. If you give effort on the projects, quizzes, and go to his office hours, there's no reason you can't get an A in his course. He's an amazing professor.",1
"This guy's a dick. He berates and insults people in class who don't agree with him, and the TA's graded the hardest out of any professor I've ever had (after nearly 5 years in college).",0
Did things to cover all you would need to know but if you aren't a woman then he doesn't seem to pay attention to you as much for answering questions or suggestions.,1
"Same as the last person's comments, plus: assigns a project completely non-related to the course worth 1/4 of the final grade. Do not take this class if you don't have to. CS majors; wait for a semester when he's not teaching this course.",0
"Pop quizzes with 5 minutes to complete and you will get an F if you turn them in even 1 minute late. Does not give good feedback, says she weights grades heavier at the end of the course which is untrue. If you need this class for credit, find another professor. She has a loud chirping parrot that is present in every lecture. 0/10.",0
"Phenomenal instructor. He's a business owner so he's very familiar with the real world and often incorporates it into lectures. He picks 5 random days to do attendance throughout semester and if you miss the majority of them, you flunk. Exams are moderately difficult (you need to study hard). Great guy. Really wants to help you with career pursuit.",1
Super hard! Homework is not relevant to exam material and he actually gets annoyed if you go to clarify things during office hours. You're better off self-studying and using Slader to solve your problems. Avoid!,0
"The class itself is easy. I still don't recommend it though because you don't really learn anything. Professor Kelland is very hands-off and the information you need for the project is all over the place. He's also pretty snippy if you actually email him for help or because you can't find something. Overall, not a fan. Feels like I wasted my money.",0
"I have taken all the classes required for my cis associate before I took this class. So, I took this class at the end with Professor, when I found cis 20 is also required. I feel that I should have taken his class earlier. I finally do have confidence in Computer Programming after taking his class this semester. He is best if you want to learn.",1
"I read the book 3 times, yet the test had no questions from the book. The second test was word for word from quizlet, but the 3rd test had none from quizlet. I have no idea where she gets her questions or what exactly she wants us to know. Difficult is not even the word for her confusing expectations.",0
(CS 107 Fall 2015) Short homework every two weeks. Lectures can get boring. Pay attention to do well on the homework or to finish them quickly. If he's unclear during the lecture try to re-learn it online. Funny lectures. Extra Credit will be provided if you show up when others don't. Tests are almost exactly the study guides. Would take again.,1
"Not a bad prof to be honest. At first, I thought his accent and handwriting would be a big issue but after two classes, I got used to it. He was a bit disorganized and the webwork/midterms were horribly difficult but somehow I managed to get a decent mark mark. Overall, he's an OK prof, just wish he was more accessible outside of class.",1
This class was great. I really enjoyed this class and the professor is amazing! Take him you wont regret it!,1
"Well im glad his class is done, but he does allow re-writes which definitely saved my butt. Class was boring do not recommend taking the Tues Thurs class.",1
WORST TEACHER IN THE WORLD...  I had to re-learn quantum mechanics in order to understand ANYTHING from the follow up courses...  FOR ANYONE TAKING THIS COURSE:  dont...  try to skip it and find a new teacher...  You will be lost forever.,0
"Really hard tests, they are not curved. Lots of printed out notes to memorize.",0
"Unless you're a cop don't bother taking his classes, he doesn't even want to know you exist.",0
"If you aspire to be a poet (do they even exist anymore?), or would like to experience what it feels like to learn English inside prison walls, then this is the adjunct warden for you. GOOD LUCK!",0
goooooooooood,1
"He is a very strict grader (counted off a point for putting an ""irrelevant equation"" in the margin of my quiz, even though I got the problem right...), and flies through the material. But with some outside studying, you should at least pass. But be warned: If you don't know you're stuff, don't ask for help. He'll make you feel worthless.",0
Very funny & easy to talk to and ask questions to. He is very educated in classics and is passionate about sharing his knowledge.,1
"Attendance isn't really mandatory, however, Redding makes everyone answer questions during class, and they count towards your grade. So if you don't attend class, you can't really answer them. There's a lot of reading to do, but besides that, there's not really much homework. In total, you write 2 esseys and take 3 exams. It's not a bad class!",1
Prof. Bray was not a particularly pleasant person to talk to. She wasn't a particularly engaging lecturer. I did not enjoy her class.,0
He is so unclear about assignment requirements that the undergraduate office had to intervene twice during the winter semester to advise students on their course options and assignment instructions for two different sections of his course. The course itself isn't even hard but he makes the entire process unnecessarily stressful.,0
"This class was very tough with DeBruine. He seems to care about students, however, this class is difficult with a lack of explanation. Most of the time I ended up teaching myself. He doesn't go off the textbook very much, so you have to watch lectures. However, the lectures really don't clarify anything as he doesn't explain or give clear answers.",0
"The only good thing about this class is that he is a pretty nice guy, HOWEVER, I highly recommend never taking this course. Nothing is clear that he explains and if you ask for him to clarify he goes on a passionate yelling spree instead of actually clarifying. He gives no assignments other than like three tests which are short and very specific.",0
"the good things about him, first he is a very nice professor, he cares about students , he focus more on tutorials than the book l, and in a way he forces you to study every week to get the bonus point for the lab. what I did not like is that its hard to get a good mark in his class only those who has previous knowledge about Java will do so.",1
Don is a really nice guy but is one of my least favourite profs. He spends a ton of time making jokes and telling stories but he doesn't do a great job of explaining concepts. I'm a psych honours student and Don's class was my worst mark ever (out of ALL of the classes I have taken). Do the readings and know all of the people's names he talks about,1
"While the professor is very knowledgeable on the topics covered, he is no help at all outside of the lecture. There is no point in emailing him as he will just tell you to email TA's that he clearly doesn't communicate to. To perform well in this course you either have to spend all your time on it or already know what you're doing.",0
Wayyyy too much work. Teacher is annoying and not cool at all.,0
"Richard was an amazing teacher, the material isn't easy, but it would be impossible if you took it with another professor. He cares so much about his students and wants everyone to succeed. He made this class one of my favorites all semester, and I loved going to class.",1
"Elliot does not care about you and gets offended my the slightest of things. Avoid him. He seems to make understanding the subject easy. While the exams seem straight forward, you wont answer correctly without thoroughly understanding the material. The exams questions are extremely tricky. AVOID AVOID AVOID HIM!",0
Bolker has potential. She seems like she could teach a lot but she get's off topic sometimes & rambles on things that don't have much to do with what we had to learn. Her tests were somewhat unfair and didn't make much sense. The course could have been interesting but she made it not. Also didn't follow a book making it hard to study w/ only notes,0
"This class is very interesting but her methods of grading are horrendous. She gives you the questions she will ask on the midterm and goes over the answers in lecture, but even when writing all that out and more from the textbook she says it's ""too vague"". She is very hard to talk to about how to improve, and lectures are VERY disorganized.",0
One of my favorite professors at UofT,1
Easily the worst professor of my first semester. Doc is a condescending man who prides himself on his knowledge over his students. His classes are filled with boring lectures about theory. Most of his tests are on particle physics and history of physicist. He loves his typical honors students and frowns on upon anybody with any social life.,0
"Dr.  Wanamaker is a wonderfully, kind man and I highly enjoyed the one on one discussions we had. However, his tests  are every Friday , worth 50% of your grade and can be rather difficult as definitions are in his words. Please read the syllabus  as it clearly explains missing one of the tests results in your final exam's grade being applied to it",1
"horrible prof, A LOT of work and u must earn your grade, he gave everyone C's  and plays favorites, so only 2 people got A's....very boring and he's not worth your time!",0
"To be honest, I would not advise taking this course. Shows is not the best a conveying information to the students, and it is difficult to learn much of anything in his class. I  completely stopped going to class and learned the material myself, luckily the curriculum wasn't too difficult.",0
"He is perhaps the most interesting teacher i have had ever.  Pretty funny, if you like his humour.  Very easy and helpful if you ask questions at all.",1
i took this class and was so afraid of not passing it .i hate math and was never good in it. this teacher is the best teacher i had ever met in my whole life she is so nice and helpful . just follow what she says and u will get A in all your math classes not only hers. if u show up to class every thing will go smooth and easy.,1
Class is lecture heavy and boring but notes are only presented in class (not put online) so attendance is mandatory and counts towards your grade because he calls on groups to answer activity sheets done in class. Exams are the same as the review and are 60-80 MC questions. In-class notes and activities are irrelevant to the exams.,1
"He literally teaches from the book. There's no point in showing up to class, your best bet if you end up with this professor is finding someone who already took Calc II and have them help you with the class. Take someone else if you can help it.",0
"Ive never enjoyed an English class in my life but Dr Hallett made it super fun, I would definitely recommend him to anyone! He was super accessible outside class and was, in my opinion, a very fair grader. He also gave list of opportunities for easy marks, and there was options of which assignments you could chose to do. Overall, great prof!",1
"Everything was straight from the textbook but she decides to randomly take call so you are always forced to go. ""Babz"" tries to seem like this hip young professor who is so cool when really she is lowkey mean and she favors the IA majors and people in the front row. Easy if you read and go to lecture but very painful to get through a whole 75 min",0
"Manley is a great guy and super caring. There is no problem taking this class with him. Very informative with what he wants for the assignments and grades them fairly. Don't listen to the reviews about this class being boring, how exciting can business writing actually get with any professor.",1
Very lecture heavy. Most of your grade comes from in class notes. Recommend taking advantage of all extra credit opportunities. Very bad jokes which make them funny. Will work with you on grade.,1
"Nehring is passionate about his work but his lectures are dense and frustrating. He goes off on tangents that have little nothing to do with the material and rather than develop on texts, reads a couple memorable quotes and calls it a day. I'm not sure what rock music has to do with Modernism and literature, but he sure talks about it a lot.",0
She is an amazing and kind person who cares about her students and does her best to help them succeed; she always makes herself available to her students. She can be VERY disorganized so it's important to read everything before class and really know the material b/c in lectures she can be confusing but will help make connections once you understand,1
"Took her twice, she is so cool, so fair, gives work but it easy not hard if you have a brain and just the best. take her, youll love it",1
Pr. Deavor is amazing. You can tell he loves chemistry and makes you wanna go to class. He wants you to succeed in his class and he's more than available outside class.,1
She is AWESOME!,1
"Amazing man, terrible professor. He is kind, caring, and hilarious, but does not know how to teach in the least. This class was the biggest waste of time. I can't believe this is what my tuition went to.",0
"He made everything online. No need to buy the book, only need to buy the wiley code. No need to go to class. Labs are a waste of time but easy points. Easy A as long as you do all the online homework, quizzes, and tests.",1
"MATH122 is hard enough of a class as it is, especially to teach, but if Argerami is teaching it AVOID LIKE THE PLAUGE. The content of our class never lined up with SI, and Argerami was hard to understand with the way he went about doing his examples.",0
Ramsey is the smartest professor on campus. She has figured out how to get paid without working. She is a poor excuse for a teacher. Find another class. You will regret hers!!!,0
"Dude, I love this guy. I didn't think I'd like biology anymore than I already did but I guess that it's possible. He explains things extremely well and is quite funny, which makes this class the one I look forward to the most every day. He really loves diagrams so bring a phone to take pictures or a lot of coloured pens. Slides are 15/10.",1
Knowledgeable professor but very strict and not very lenient.,0
"For a theater class, he really made it harder than what it had to be. He assigned too many assignments to do everyday and forced everyone to buy tickets to his boring plays for a grade. ",0
Dr. Starrett is one of the best professors I have ever had. He knows EVERYTHING and has the best stories. He is perfect to take if you are pursuing Anthropology or genuinely want to know more about the field. You will read A LOT and the papers are not easy but put in the work and you'll do fine:) Seriously take his class and have fun!,1
"Seriously the worst teacher I've ever had. Take my advice and find another teacher. You'll be glad you did. Lectures were incomprehensible, he was really weird and grading on the final SUCKED. he is not consistent with grading at all. AVOID HIM AT ALL COSTS!! :(",0
Professor Moton lives and breathes English. He even wrote a few books about it ! If you live and breathe for English this class is for you . He has us do 8-10 page essays in his class also,0
"Pretty challenging at first, but managed to get ahold of it under his watch. Still don't recommend the way he grades the midterm, however.",1
Her voice cannot be heard.Notes are very unclear.tough programming assignments.Exams will kill you .Need to take this as its a core,0
"Palmer was a really good professor. The only reason people give him bad ratings is because they dont do the readings. He only assigns 2 readings a week and pop quizzes which just means theres a quiz for every chapter. These quizzes are not hard. They actually help your grade a lot, and help you retain information!",1
Does not take into consideration any helpful comments explained by students in order to make her teaching a bit more bareable and easier to focus on,0
"I had Professor Durst for Immigration Law. She made a complicated subject clear and was respectful of students and differing viewpoints. She does cold call sometimes, but is not harsh if you do not know the answer. She released a practice test and her grading system, which made clear going into the final what we could expect. Highly recommend!",1
"Very tough grader....grades came from only 3 tests and they were extremly hard...does not curve at all...notes are taken directly from his mouth, and he talks too fast and has an accent so its hard to understand...studied a lot but still did not do well..",0
"Nice lady but extremely tough grader, especially for such an easy class. Take a different prof.",0
Not sure what to say. He is a nice person but does not know how to teach well. ,0
Prof Delaney is passionate about astronomy and always makes it interesting and entertaining.  He is very busy but will take time to listen to you.,1
"Participate, seek assistance when needed and your time in this class will be worth it; dont participate and you will rate Matt and the class awful. But who's fault is that? Everyone I spoke to learned something more than they knew about public speaking. That was my goal, I'm pleased with the results, thank you Professor Rosenberg",1
Great teacher! Very helpful. If you study the notes you'll ace the test. Don't need to even look in the book or read the chapters to ace exams. Start studying early for Lab Final. Would take a class from him again. Has funny comments during lectures,1
"Amazing teacher! Assigns readings as homework, which can be difficult to get to. Pop quizzes here and there, based on the readings. Easy quizzes, 10 points, five questions, one extra credit. Take notes on what she says!! The board is obviously implicit but she says a lot that will help you on her OPEN NOTE tests! Hilarious to listen to!",1
Her lecture was amazing!,1
Goodluck....,1
"Amazing professor, take his classes and see.",1
"He's not a fan of collective security. Keep that in mind when you right papers for him.   Class workload: Powerpoint Presentation, Final, Participation and Attendance, 20 Page paper, a few weeks were you have to post comments on the readings",1
Boring teacher...Exams were way too specific the questions are way too particular. However he gave a lot of examples and brought some speakers that were interesting,0
"She rushed through portfolio work and spent months on ""busy work."" She yelled throughout the class, kicked a number of students out cause she thought they'd fail. Her feedback is weeks late and not helpful. I went back to my English 101 teacher for help. Yes you have to work hard for a good grade, but she's so stressful and unnecessary.",0
"Lots of reading, but that is generally true of all Econ 101 classes. Overall great professor!",1
Worst professor I have ever had at Grand Valley.,0
"Love Ms. Casey, Strict, but very good!",1
"He has to be one of the worst profs I ever had. He doesn't take the time to answer questions, rather tells you that you should know. His explanations are very unclear and his expectations are not stated. The average of my class for a midterm was merely 27% and he said that it was our fault because we were stupid. A prof to avoid at all costs.",0
"He's an interesting guy, but the books he chooses are EXTREMELY BORING. I really wanted to put them in a shredder. He also doesn't give much guidance for exams.",0
"Dr. Furey is the most unorganized person I've ever seen. It takes forever to get marks back, and she doesn't really teach anything. I went into the Mid-terms with no clue as to how she would be grading them or what she expected from me as she did not give concrete solutions to anything. It's probably in your best interest to avoid if you can.",0
"Half our class dropped after the first day...I wish I had done the same - worst, most pointless class I've ever taken.",0
Probably the easiest class I've taken at eastern. You just have to take a few quizzes (with questions that are easily googled) and make two discussion posts.,1
I would like to make up for my last comment (the one below this). Per is an awesome guy and is one of the best transpo engineers in the country. The only thing about the class I did not like was how the tests were irrelevant to the class. They were over different topics than he lectured about. Besides that the class was interesting.,1
"Professor Chodorow is an excellent instructor! If you take the time & really listen to his lectures, much of what he has to say is very profound and thoughtful. He's also helpful and approachable. If you're taking HUM1 and you want to really learn about the subject, I highly recommend having him as your professor.",1
"His lectures are amazing, very helpful & inspiring. The hw isn't collected, but pretend it's being graded for accuracy or you won't do well on the biweekly quizzes. Carefully re-read every example in the book, the hw, & the discussions prior to each test. Don't take it with 10 additional units of 400 series math/science courses: you won't get an A.",1
"He is a great teacher. DO NOT LISTEN TO THE LAST COMMENT. He does a lot to try and help you pass the class. You get to rewrite your papers if you don't get a good grade. Yes the class is A LOT of work and Yes you do write A LOT, however he is a grate teacher and knows what he is doing. If you have to take English 15 take his class.",1
good prof.,1
prepare to be tested on two completely different criteriums: the text and the lectures. They are extremely different from each other that it feels like taking 2 classes in one. Her all focus is to make the material as confusing as possible. She wants you to read all the chapters and memorize lectures even if she is not going to test you on it.,0
"Not hard class, but debate in class was fun, plus the interdisciplinary aspect kept it interesting.",1
"Always busy, sick, or otherwise unable to get help from outside of class.  C-",0
"Rich is hard and you have to understand that she's not going to let you slide by. I really like her as a professor because she makes you work hard. Not an easy class, but she's worth taking for sure.",1
"He has no tact. When questioning him, he gets very defensive and is ready to attack you left and right. Very unprofessional. Very obscure grader and mediocre at best.",0
he tries to sound very clear.  every word he says is very clear.  but all together doesn't make sense,1
Had this professor for 2 different classes. For both classes he opens up all of the assignments except for the final. Be prepared to not know your grade until the semester is over. This professor is also inaccessible. Easy paycheck for him. Was forced to take him because other professors classes were full. If I could I would just wait .,0
"Doesn't grade on content, really only grades on grammar which makes no sense. Would definitely not recommend",0
Took his online course and am glad that I decided to. The workload was not heavy at all and took no more than 30 minutes per day. He was also quick to answer any emails I had to send him.,1
"I loved this guy, he's so cool and I enjoyed the class. I definately recommend!",1
Prof. Edgar is very sweet and really just wants everyone to pass so she's pretty accommodating. Sometimes she's not too helpful in lecture and just does practice problems so the key to pass is GO TO TA HOURS!! That's where they go over all the homework and explain anything you need.,1
Total jrk. DOn't tell him anything in confidence.,0
Amazing woman. Love her,1
The most sweetest English teacher ever. Gives the best lectures and she's hilarious. If you fail that class it's because you don't want to do anything. She gives snacks every class. I took her for Enc1101 Tuesdays and Thursdays but she only said to come Thursdays. We only did 5 essays which you only turn in 3 and just do Mylabplus .,1
Class time was spent discussing the main points of each chapter and he encouraged discussion during these lectures. He grades everything quickly and gives good feedback so you'll always know how to do better.,1
I ended up withdrawing from this course today because of this man. I am a marketing major I received a 62% on the last exam we had WITH a curve. This professor does not care how well his students do in fact he wants them to fail. He makes the exams so tricky that you leave thinking you did fine but then you end up failing. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS.,0
This is an easy class as long as you attended--the 7:55 time is not the easiest to wake up for. Taking good class notes is essential. As long as you study before the exams and do at least a cursory reading of the book you will be fine.,1
She doesn't try to work with you. She has extremely high expectations of her students. I almost feel like she's setting us up for failure. Teaches pretty quickly and hates when you have a question. She also hates repeating herself. I highly suggest you not take her class.,0
"With Julien it is very very simple. Be ready to learn or be ready to fail. The group project is very fun but it is extremely time-consuming. My biggest tip to students taking this class is attending the lectures as the first couple of weeks are easy but then it gets difficult all of a sudden. However, if you take this class you will learn a lot!",1
"As long as you annotate the readings, skim through them get the main concept , you'll be fine",1
I LOVED this professor. I wish I had him for 116 as well. He's very passionate about chemistry and it shows in each of his lectures. He relates content to real world examples which helps clarify topics. Homework directly related to class content and often would show up in tests. He's funny but also very straight to the point. Highly recommend!,1
"So, I actually like this prof. Everyone else hated him but I found that he gives out free marks all the time if you just show up and answer the pollEV questions. Course material is interesting and fun.",0
"Dr. Brichford is a really thorough professor.  I believe the reason that people don't like him is because they were used to having teachers who graded easily and held their hand through everything. If you think he's not grading your paper fairly, believe me, it's not just you who thinks so--everyone else in the class probably does too.",1
"Tangant inceptions- he goes off on tangents within his tangents ""a room full of estrogen."" , a quote in the beginning of the year the way that he comes across makes you feel uncomfortable. Hes very loud, I feel like Im going to go deaf. half the time he doesnt even know what hes doing.",0
"Imagine curving all of your students except the ones taking the course during a global pandemic :) Instead of making the class easier during these tough times, he made it 10xs worse! Last-minute announcements for everything! And gets frustrated whenever anyone asked about grading. I would say don't take him, but we're all left with no choice... GL!",0
"Ron is the best prof I've had at UW! He is one of the funniest and nicest people I've met and he genuinely wants everyone to succeed. The course is made up of all group work and an individual assignment. The material is also applicable to real life. His lectures are inspirational and always put you in a good mood. Thanks, Uncle Ron for everything!",1
I don't even know where to begin. She thinks she's a Messiah of math and don't even know ho to teach and gives too much homework to and its about 250 math problems per week. Please don't take her any math classes NO EVEN JOKING.,0
"Dr. Johnson's class(es) are useless. There is really no point in going to lecture because he presents stuff that is outdated and won't be on the exam. To get a good grade, buy a TI programmable calculator and crank through his previous exams (ask around, I'm sure you can find all of them) . For HW, just chegg it... it's pointless to study from. GL!",0
Do not take her. I did not like this teacher at all. Very hard grader on tests. Is awkward in class. Spaces out like every five sentences. Very boring class but you need to pay attention because she put random stuff on the quizzes that she talked about.,0
"You will pass the tests by looking for test answers is Quizlet then Coursehero. 4 lab assignments this semester were wrong (bad links, etc)-reuses old labs without checking if all things still work. When you get a ""miss"" on the lab or test, present your case and will give credit rather than explain what you got wrong originally. No other contact.",0
Class was OK. He can be kind of rude so don't take his class if you are easily upset. ie. acts like youre an idiot if you answer a question wrong,0
"One of the worst classes I have ever taken, don't waste your time taking this as a gen ed or even in general. The professor is not understanding at all when it comes to grading and attendance. Extremely disorganized.",0
The reviews below are entirely accurate. I felt confident in my Calculus skills until I took those exams. He goes out of his way to give you the most difficult material on the exam without a clear study guide. The class average drops after every exam. He was the absolute WORST choice to teach a virtual live streaming course during COVID.,0
"Wei is an excellent professor. Her lectures teach students important theorems from the book and proofs her gives are clear and easy to understand. Although attendance is not mandatory, one should not miss her lectures. Final is largely based on homework and not hard at all for students who carefully finish their homework with their own effort.",1
Not a fun class,0
"Had him for Microecon. While he has an upbeat personality, his lectures were often hard to follow as his notes contained of lot of sentence fragmentation and were grammatically incorrect. He doesn't use D2L, but gives good practice questions for exams. He often let class out early so people had time to ask him questions. Watch ACDC econ, lifesaver!",1
"I personally found the lectures to be kinda boring. But, it's easy to get marks and the content is pretty straight forward. Midterm was pretty straightforward.",0
"Hopkins was a really good FYS professor and certainly prepared me for the rest of my classes.  His class will make you think, but he's a nice guy.",1
I took his flipped Zoology class. Wasn't a huge fan. There is a quiz once a week six questions fairly easy. If you wanna do well attend SI.,0
"Eh...okay, I guess. Seems to make presumptions about people with little knowledge about them.",0
"Steve had some teaching qualities that were appreciated, and some not so much.  Every time I went to class I would ask myself why I went and that I learned nothing.  He does NOT explain things clearly at all and I never knew what he wanted in the end.  Major trouble grasping main concepts.  Always offered office hours which was nice.",1
Good Professor and great teaching skills.Would recommend him for anyone that wants to know their stuffs and also have a good grade.,1
"Extremely rude to all her students, she answered questions for the first 3 weeks then ghosted the whole class for the rest of the semester. Whenever she answers she either says ""Read the assignment again"" or mocks your question. Her quizzes were decently easy but some of the assignments were very poorly worded which resulted in a lot of struggling.",0
Warning: he does tell you at the beginning of the course to expect 12-14 hours of work per week...I didn't believe him and couldn't have dropped it anyway because I needed the credits. I felt the amount of work was completely unnecessary for it being a basic class you need to graduate. Be prepared to do a lot of work on your own.,0
he is one funny dude,1
"Cool, fun, makes you think and is one great Flux dude",1
I mean she is a nice person but as a professor vaguely goes over material and instead spends more time talking about how to study. Going to office hours is pointless because she just tells you to do your own research and she makes you feel dumb for asking questions. Not the most exciting class and I LOVE biology.,0
"One of the best professors I've had in my life. I just looked him up 35 years after being in his class. He was incredibly radical, and I'm guessing that many of his students were too shallow and apolitical to even notice how incredibly interesting his classes COULD be ... if students were not clueless.",1
"Goes over lessons way too fast, does not go over stuff that is on tests. Not very good at explaining things. Makes the lesson very difficult to understand when it shouldn't be.",0
Nice prof!,1
IF YOU DIDN'T TAKE CALC IN HIGH SCHOOL DO NOT TAKE HIM.  He uses a textbook he wrote that is very confusing. Different terminology than you've ever used. Tests aren't too hard but the class is. Homework every night that you have to do that is hard and time consuming. Don't avoid him but I wouldn't recommend him either. He's sweet and funny.,1
"I didn't like this professor & his accent is really thick. If you ask him a question sometimes he'll reply with a smart alack response. All he does is read from his power-points. He is not energetic at all. If you want to get help, i suggest you ask someone who is a econ major because he sometimes will not answer your question clearly. ",0
SO unorganized! Waits until the due date/day before to post updates & add things to assignments. She doesn't care at all about her students who actually put in effort. If you do assignments before the last day YOU WILL HAVE TO REDO THEM. You will only get grades back if they are automatic (which screws you for ELAs that build on eachother),0
"I got an A, but I hate him! His lectures are horrible. He wanders off in what he is talking about. You watch a lot of movies, but never the entire thing. The only way to get a good grade is the extra credit. He is extremely slow and getting things back. It's a theatre appreciation class- I came in liking theatre, now I hate it. TAKE SOMEONE ELSE!!",0
I wish Terry taught every class on campus.  He takes a very hard subject such as Media Economics and breaks it down so well that anybody can understand it.  Terry is by far the best teacher I've ever had and probably the best on campus.,1
"Taught A* Algorithm well. All else was highly ambiguous. The book (Norvig) wasn't easy to comprehend, to put it mildly. The assignments' solutions can be found online. She tries to be fair in grading, but with solutions available online, there are 2 ways to get good grades: hard work (might get good grades), google search (will get good grades).",0
"only 4 tests; read the chapter, study her lecture notes and use all the tools in the text book - she wrote the book! teacher decided to video tape her lecture so we never had a 'real zoom class""; no interaction with the teacher or other students- this made learning very difficult",0
"I enjoyed his lectures, course itself was easy. ",1
"He did an excellent job relating the material to the real world. Make sure you do the extra ""bonus points"" work. He wants people to talk in class but then he talks over them???",1
"Content that is tought is clear but the concepts need to be practiced in order for them to sink in. very good teacher other than the fact that ""you can do everything anyway you want""",1
"He is a nice guy and the class is super easy, but I dreaded going every day. We don't do anything in class and he did not help me to understand anything better than i already understood it. There are a ton of writing assignments but he isn't really a hard grader.",0
"I think he is a great professor, he's funny, likes to make things as simple as possible, he tells you everything you need to know for the tests as long as you show up.  An easy marker, kind of senile, but that adds charm.",1
This professor is very difficult to understand. It was hardly ever clear what the main idea of a lecture was. He treated the course almost purely as a philosophy course so it was VERY metaphorical and unclear. I went to every classlistened intently but I found I was always very confused. He should probably retire so lives can be saved. ,0
"Here's the thing: she's not terrible. Her mannerisms and the way she talks takes getting used to, but she is regular. If you get stuck with her, it's not bad. If you have the chance to change, I would do it. Also, she says ""you're exactly right"" ALL THE TIME. She's not bad, just not good.",0
"His essay questions were not very clear. His multiple choice question are some what difficult. If your looking for a easy liberal, you may want to reconsider taking this class.",0
"Brian Lewis is my favorite teacher I've ever had.  I learned so much from his Ear Training 4 class, and I wish I could take another class from him.  Some of the ET topics are difficult, but he's a great teacher and a really nice guy.  B Ry also has a great sense of humor.  I love B Ry.  1010 would B Ry again.  ",1
She is a very HARD teacher.  She expects students to be just like her and write in perfect English.  Whenever you go for confrences she makes you feel stupid because her RED ink is all over the paper.  I agree with some of the other students...NOTHING IS EVER GOOD FOR HER!!! I don't advise students to take her for EC2 or any English class for that matter.,0
"Well, l if you take this professor's class, you will figure it out why.",0
"this class is easy. I never showed up and almost got an A. there's lots of reading but you can skim through it and understand. I did not enjoy his class AT ALL, how much he talks about himself or off topic conversations in class is ridiculous and the reason why I stopped attending class. Basically taught myself everything I needed.",0
"Dr. Ross has things he wants done a certain way and is not understanding. He gives no study guide on any tests and oral com is very confusing general. He will respond to emails 3 days later and is not easy to talk to. He is a nice guy personally, I just didnt think he was a good professor.",0
"Very unclear, couldn't understand a word she said. Her exams were nothing like any review she ever gave us. I dreaded going to this class especially at 8 am. If you want to pass with better than a D then I recomend getting the heck out of her class as fast as you can.",0
"His course was interesting. BUT it was hard! I read the text, went to classes and still did so bad on the midterms. The midterm questions are tricky and ambiguous at times. The TAs ar dump - they want the exact word (d.n understand synonyms). But overall the material was interesting. Nice guy - just wished his tests wasn't soo awful - lwred my GPA!",1
"I had a lot of trouble getting him to answer my emails about my grades being incorrect more than once. He was friendly in person to talk to, but never got him to answer my emails till the very end of the semester. You should be fine on tests if you take good notes, but were only short answers. Assignments were decently easy for the most part.",1
"NEVER take this teacher. Im a senior accouting major and still afraid of her. She gives ridiculous amounts of homework, you have to hand homeowork in every friday even though you dont even have a scheduled class. She treats this class like it is a 400 level accounting class. Take anyone but her.",0
Lectures can be stale but a very caring lady.,1
The class was enjoyable. Professor Lawson cares for his students and wants them to succeed.,1
"Super sweet, funny guy. He was a licensed funeral home director who ended up pursuing a Ph.D. in Statistics. Lectures are incredibly memorable, as he prepares often humorous activities that keep you involved and learning throughout the hour. Assignments and exams were reasonable, and the labs were genuinely fun. An absolute must-take professor.",1
"She is a solid professor, with balanced work and testing, just with brutal course content. It's a hard class taught by a smart, good prof. If you have to take a hard class with her as an optional prof, take her over the alternative, she's great.",1
"Amazing class w/a wonderful Prof! She is extremely knowledgeable on herbs, essential oils & organic gardening. Every class is a treat w/organic herbal teas prepared for consumption along w/healthy snacks.  You will learn about the  healing properties of herbs & the many benefits of essential oil use! Class is interactive in the best type of  way!!!",1
"Very anal about how SHE likes things done versus how you are able to complete AND show your work . It was always ""THIS IS HOW I DO IT"" If I learn how I learn and my answers were correct, leave me be. She took points off for mediocre things, just horrible.",0
Just take notes during the lecture. Easiest gen ed for Fine Arts.,1
"This is my second time having Dr. Sauser, and she is one of my favorite teachers. Her material is clear and straightforward, and I enjoy here ""real life connections"" to the class. I would recommend her to any of my classmates. One of the best professors at CBU, no doubt.",1
"The class itself dragged on, but was tolerable. The workload wasn't too bad, one big paper and some smaller assignments.",1
Worst professor I have ever had. Thank god I never have to take this class again.,0
"Dr. Ramey is an incredible professor! Every time I left classI left in a great mood. I really enjoyed his class, and his teaching style; he makes you think. If you attend his lectures and read the assigned readings you will do well on the quizzes. If you need help, he and Ms. Funkhouser (TA) will make time for you.",1
"Lectures are related to the textbook material, however you may not make some connections during lectures if you don't read beforehand. There is a final group project that will greatly impact your grade if not prepared.",1
makes you interested in Botany! Excellent Prof.,1
"Great professor, everything is clear! 3 online open book exams with study guides! Easy-A, he also does some discussion posts but very few. All the lectures were great, and available online as well, which was like being in class. He checks if people see the lecture, it is 10% of the grade. Caring gives extra credit. Take Him!",1
"I loved Professor Delton. She is one of the smartest people I have ever met, and she is so passionate about history and teaching history. She is willing to engage with students points of view, but always gets the last word. Go to her office hours  shes great to be around.",1
"Easy class, just not my favorite professor",0
Study guides for test are nothing like the test,0
"Literally the worst teacher I've ever had in my life. Shes so mean and is not helpful at all, and you cant understand her heavy accent",0
"I honestly think he has issues. Throughout the class he acts like youre doing well since we get good grades in exams, assignments and keeps on saying how he isnt here to fail anyone we will do well. And we all put so much efforts, but in the end ..... BOOM. You see your grade and its a b :) He messed everyones final grade up for no reason.",0
"He's pretty good. Funny and engaging. Offers extra credit. Save your money and skip the book. This class is doable, but it can be difficult if you miss class or zone out for even a second because he doesn't do powerpoints and his handwriting is awful. Still really helpful.",1
"Great teacher, wouldn't move on until everyone understood the concept. Tests are easy as long as you keep up on the homework.",1
"Boring and useless classes. If u care about ur garde dont take him. If u have him, skip all the classes to get better marks. Attending his class is waste of time. Study by urself to get A.",0
"Professor Hasson was one of a kind. I was placed in Basic Mathematics and he was the professor. He is very kind, understanding, patient and a very good teacher and listener. I am pretty bad at Math but taking David's class made me feel comfortable and at ease. And I overcame my fear of Math and actually got good grades. I got a B for my grade.",1
"Ridiculously hard tests, that don't focus on the ""main concepts"" he says he's trying to teach. Lectures are hard to sit through, although he did cut a deal with me when I failed one of his tests. So I can't rate him terrible as a person, just his class sucks.",0
"""This class is designed to stress you out."" Those are the words that Anne told us at the start of the semester, and I didn't think she was serious till I was crying every other day near the middle of the semester. Simply put, there's a lot of unnecessary work and assignments are designed to trick you. I gained nothing from this class except stress.",0
"I enjoyed his class; Dr. Jean clearly knows the material. You need to show that you give an effort for him to care about you. The labs, exams, and overall structure made it feel like only the exam weeks truly mattered. It's tough, but it helps you learn. I do wish he explained individual topics more in-depth. Good professor to take for a challenge.",1
"Best. Teacher. EVER! Yes, you need to work for the grade you want, but that is the reality of any science class. Day or night he will be there for you to answer any questions that you have to ensure your understanding of any material. To put it plain and simple, he is a good man. A good man that anyone would be lucky to have as a teacher.",1
toughest prof ever seen in my whole life,0
"While this platform may have not been ideal for a class like this, taking comparative politics online must have been the hardest thing I endured in my academic career. It focuses less on understanding material and more on how it affects current events. You know those ""which are true i, ii, iii, iv?"" questions, his exams consisted of ONLY that.",0
"He is gets very excited about economics and genuinely enjoys teaching, he tends to rant about stuff not related to the course material; but keeps the class interesting. The assignments and midterm is easy, but the final is worth 50% and is super hard compared to the rest of the material. Try to switch your prof if possible, but otherwise study hard",0
his way or the highway,0
"Wasn't super prepared through the entire semester. Nice cause we got to work on papers and stuff in class and deadlines were pushed, and she explains things really well once she knows what we're doing. Cancels class more often than most. I'd take her 101 again but not 102 (she flat out said it would be hard).",0
one the best accounting professors! She goes super slow and explains everything nicely. I had a hard time with accounting and she really made it easy for me to understand. If your dreading accounting take this with her compared to the other accounting professors she's a life saver !,1
She is a terrible teacher. She says to do one thing in particular in the classroom and then says do the exact opposite the very next day.  Lesson plans/all written work will never be correct.  She frequently flips out and engages in verbal tantrums. She clearly is biased towards certain students in her classes.,0
"Tests are very difficult, he uses a lot of jargon that's hard to understand as just a first year business student. He's very knowledgeable but difficult to keep up with. There is no homework aside from a couple excel projects which makes tests kill your grade. Very difficult class if not familiar with economics.",0
"Absolutely terrible, the door is louder than his talking, offers no help, seems like he doesn't want to be there b/c it is below him, asks class for basic help with problems like he doesn't how to do basic math problems, just awful.",0
"he is a fantastic instructor! Modified the course well for online learning, including eliminating the final exam and assigning students short and fair unit quizzes. He spends class time doing examples, so for a more in depth understanding of the material, you MUST take the time to watch them. The textbook is free and open source as well!",1
Kinda didn't seem like he cared much and just wanted us out of there plus he didn't explain well.,0
"AMAZING professor, I have taken multiple online courses with Professor Laro, and she is absolutely phenomenal.",1
"Do not take this class whatever you do. This guy lies about due dates, does not fully explain assignments, and assigns reading as if his class is your only class. also, tons of films to watch as readings too. Lectures are unorganized and unhelpful. Worst class at MSU. Guaranteed.",0
"Lectures were unbearable at first. He talks very slowly and has trouble finishing his thoughts. Often spends way too much time on each slide and topic. But you warm up to him and his humour. Sometimes ends early. Put stuff he didn't teach on the midterm. Don't sit in the back, come in late, or leave early!",1
I took Detwiler over a summer ses and was pleasantly surprised.  He used power point slides from the author which became a little boring but he explained the topics well.  The exams consisted of long problems and multiple choice questions so doing as many of the homework problems helped a lot (but he never checked or collected the hw).,1
"Shes a wonderful and the kindest professor ever. Always optimist, bubbly and fun and smiles a lot. Classes can be awkward at times, but it is very relaxing and somewhat fun. No tests, just a single research paper for the semester. The bubbliest professor ever!",1
Absolutely a waste of time. You can get an A just by enrolling but be prepared to learn nothing. I think he just wants people in his classes because there is hardly any work. A nice guy and all but I always wondered why I was there. So I stopped going and still got an A by coming back for the last class.,0
I believe Mr. Walters wants his students to understand the subject however I found myself trying to understand the expectation of an assignment taxing and never enjoyed learning the material. It was frustrating to spend a considerable amount of time to follow assignment guidelines only to be docked points based on an unwritten/unspoken expectation.,0
"Do not take this class if you are a history major. The man is bright, however he thinks like an engineer and not a historian.",0
Professor Magee is very disorganized when it comes to instructions and things change up until the night before they are due. He gives an immense amount of work and assigns things with little notice. If you are going to take this class be prepared to do LOTS of reading and LOTS of essays.,0
Kristen was an absolute joy to have as a professor. She has experience in counseling so she was able to use a lot of real world applications of what we were learning in class which provided a very high impact learning environment. We did fall behind in the syllabus though because of this and so we didn't cover some course material.,1
"Spoelman is so funny and tries to keep the students engaged with jokes and endless examples to understand the material. Accounting 2 is a tough class with hard topics, but he does really well at trying to get students to succeed. We did not use connect for homework and did everything by hand, which I didn't mind.",1
"She is a hard grader, I wouldnt recommend. Lots of reading",0
"Regular class days are fine as there are not a lot of reading but come exam time, your ass is going to be whooped. This guy literally wants you to write exactly the same way he said in the class. No explaining in your own ways, no doing some research and coming up with answers saying your perspective, nothing. Short tests, brutal grading.",0
"Overall, he is a great prof. Though the lectures are a big boring (lack of visual aids), he definitely goes into detail about the topics and makes them interesting. 3 exams and that's it but make sure you read to understand concepts. Highly recommend!!",1
"Lectures were boring, as were the 3 books assigned to read. 300 pages about inventing the wheel were just too many, as were the other books page counts. Theres only 2 exams and a 10-page paper. Hard to tell whats important and whats not during his lectures, making studying difficult. The course is not worth the effort required to do well in it.",0
"Take PSY 101 with this professor and you will have nap time twice a week. He is monotone and just shows videos. When it comes to the tests, the questions are formatted poorly and just leave you confused. The material is dry, and seems outdated. Many things could be improved on.",0
Finishing up American Literature I now. The class insnt too bad. Stagg always answered my questions quickly and provided examples. I liked most of the assigned reading. The course was easy to follow with lots of resources.,1
"GET READY TO TEACH YOURSELF. Her powerpoints are just pictures and graphs, there are no explanations when she gives you the slides, you will most likely leave the class extremely confused. The only work she gives is Chem 101 (the online homework) and tests, so there are no opportunities for extra points to boost up your grade. She's nice at least",0
"Easy A, just watch the movie and get ready to write your 500 word essays. Test are easy and online not at the testing center!!!",1
he is a very nice teacher but his hand writing sucks. gives alot of extra credits that will help you pass the class.,0
be prepared.... just be prepared.,0
"This class, like most sociology courses, was a waste of time.  However, taking it with Boudreaux is easy.  Her tests are all online, but be careful of the first one because you need to do well in all of them to get an A.  She considers 95 to be an A, so make sure you do well on all of her exams.",0
The only professor who knew my name this semester.  He is extremely helpful.  Keep up with assignments and participate in class and you should do fine.  Definitely one of the best professors I've ever had!,1
"I had him at 8 am this past semester, and even though I'm usually completely out of it that early in the morning, he made history a lot more interesting to me than it had ever been before. However, if you aren't big on tests, you might not want to take him because most of your grade will be based on what you get on them.",1
Prof Bailey is great she struggled with technology at first but got the hang of it. She is super helpful and I really liked her class! I would take again!,1
"EXTREMELY difficult to deal with.  She insists on complicating EVERY aspect of the course with her anal retentiveness.  The subject matter is rather interesting, but she just takes all the fun out of it...",0
"I have never cried in public before taking his class. He printed copies of my paper out and passed them around the class as an example of what not to do. Did not even show the mercy of whiting out my name. English is not my major, but I believe I'm a decent writer. He told me I had to start an entirely new paper and write it like ""an adult."" I'm 28",0
"Extremely long, boring and repetitive lectures... multiple people fell asleep during class. Comes across as very arrogantobnoxious and sounds like a James Bond villain. Avoid this class!",0
This is the right course taught by the wrong person.,0
"I hate chemistry, but professor Mu made it fun to learn. I actually debated about changing majors just because of his class. He is a great teacher, i still struggled, but the struggle became a challenge i enjoyed. Thank you.",1
Most of the time nothing he says is going to be on the actual exam is on the exam. He spent most of his time reading us from the textbook and copying the examples from the textbook on the board. He usually only confused me. I have no idea how I ended up with the grade I got.,0
"Very easy class. As long as you do your homework and attend class everday, you will do well. Kind of annoying at times.",1
"I was very nervous about having to take biochem online this semester but Im so glad I got Professor Leonard. This class was easier to me than Organic Chemistry, and thats because he is clear of what to study for exams If you like chemistry and if you put a few hours in to study for exams the day or two before youll do just fine!",1
"Has anyone noticed that alot of these entries for Chinitz sound exactly the same?  Like maybe he writes them himself?  Only this guy would think himself hot.  One word sums him up: dull.  If you like going through poetry line by line, having everything explained in boring detail, you'll like this class.  Otherwise stay away.",0
You don't need the book. Just google the graphs and save your money. Don't rely on him answering your emails. He grades hard at the beginning of the semester than it gets easier as the semester goes on.,0
"Texts and Contexts is not the most interesting class on the surface, but Julian made it just that.  I'm not one that normally participates much in class discussion, but I found myself doing so on a daily basis in this class.  Awesome professor, take him if you can!",1
Her English and grammar very poor and she is hard to understand. She should really take some English classes.,0
"If you aren't the greatest test taker like  I am, I would not choose Schaffer. The only grades given in this class are tests. Each test has a ton of material on it and are quite difficult. Go to SI sessions and go to class even though attendance is not taken!",1
This class was very informative and offered a great understating of the course load. All I wanted to do in the class was LEARN and Dawson made sure that happened. My colleagues often wanted to take the easy way out but I told them I was going to LEARN everything in the course. Would highly recommend to people who want to LEARN.,1
Has no place teaching future teachers.,0
You have to work really hard to get an A in this class. Prof. Williams gives pop quizzes every class on material she hasn't even lectured on yet and just expects us to know. The tests are really difficult and a lot of people failed. You have to study ahead of time and not procrastinate or you will most likely fail the class.,0
"I feel like going to class is useless. Use the textbook, just remember his marking scheme during exams. The midterm was easy, but he marks tough. You expect a 70 but get a 30.  For the group project don't pick lazy people.",0
"The work load is always ridiculous, and makes far too many assumptions on what majority of the students can do, or and should know how to do. Most of which they dont. Once spent 2 weeks trying explain how to submit the assignment NOT EVEN DO.",0
"No one in my class got an A and most of us barely passed. She starts off the quarter good with promise of brain check points and MyChem extra credit. However, MyChem is confusing and hard to come by and the brain checks must be totally correct for the point. Overall, the labs are good but the exams are impossible",0
"Amazing professor, I've taken him multiple times and while his classes may be long he always remembers his returning students and appreciates their input/discussion in class - I love it!",1
Took him for business finance. He was the only professor who did not give out a departmental final. he made it himself. he is sooo bad. doesnt let you use calculators. avoid him at all costs I PROMISE YOU THAT YOU WILL REGRET IT IF YOU TAKE HIM!!!! he makes you sign in too,0
"She's really nice and very fashionable! She talks to the students in class about whatever they want to talk about really, and to me that's a great way to practice conversation because you're discussing something you're actually interested in. The tests were fair and she's very helpful",1
he is a great teacher. he might be late at times but he gets the job done and makes sure the class understands. I have had him for 3classes and he was a great teacher for every single one.,1
"Professor RIckerson is an expert in her field. She is very passionate about her subject and it shows in her lectures. Her lectures can be very long sometimes, but most of them are very intriguing. Since parts of the test are visual, it is important that you attend class. I would absolutely recommend her to anyone interested in her class.",1
"This class was terrible. He gives no instructions and just expects you to figure out what is due. He is extremely unorganized and never knows what he is suppose to be doing. For the final paper we had to write a research paper based on a group ""project"". We were not given a rubric or any instructions on what exactly he was looking for. Don't take.",0
"He is definitely one of the friendliest professors at Pace, and wants nothing more than for you to get an A and understand the material. His lectures are packed with info and he teaches using a lot of different materials, movies, stories, etc. He bumped my grade up from a B to an A at the end of the semester just because I talked to him.",1
Awful statistics professor. Never had a teacher get so mad at students for asking about a question or to explain further like him. I do not recommend at all. He doesn't explain problems well enough and is not a good writer so when he'll write on the board it was super hard to understand.,0
"He required A LOT of reading, but gave you links to print them off. Sometimes he classes got slightly boring. Because he was very kind and helpful this did not ruin the enjoyment of the class. The readings he assigned are interesting. One of the profs that stops to talk to you! I'd totally take him again, even though I am no longer a CBU student,",1
"Nicole is a good advisor. She may seem to pick favorites but I found in my class she did so with good reason. If you want to WORK, and show up for class, Nicole will help you with pretty much anything. Deffinately a good choice for pcs!",1
Great professor. You write little assignments to get early feedback for papers. This helped me a lot and my grades improved over the semester. Her online stuff is clear and I thought she made the Zoom meetings interesting. Would recommend.,1
"Not helpful if you do not struggle to find the answer yourself - she once told me that the reason she does not help is because when you are working in the field, you are the one who has to go off on your own and find the answers.  I learned more in her class than almost all others.  Very cute, too.",1
"Even if you have experience in the real world, this prof wants you to keep responses by the textbook. You think you're giving 100% only to receive a D. Assignment List: 10 Discussions, 3 quizzes, 1 Final, 1 Research Paper (based on non-profit organization), Interview Assignment with licensed Social Worker. Prof gives extra credit.",0
"Pilkington is the best. If you have to take a math class, take it from him. His teaching style is very laid-back, but thorough. He grades fairly and is great about giving partial credit on tests and homework. He also gives lots of opportunities for extra credit. And I definitely didn't mind the view, either.",1
"Lectures are confusing as hell, makes it way more complicated than it needs to be.",0
Hands down the best professor on campus. He makes class fun and he's laid back. He's very willing to help his students.,1
"She teaches absolutely nothing in her class. If you ever wanted to be better in writing, please don't choose her. ",0
Her assignments are insane. Truly makes you have a meltdown or two and you still won't figure it out. Will never make it easier on her students. Okay tests though. Avoid at all costs. Don't come within a few metres of this lecturer. You WILL regret it.,0
"Although it is just a GE course, he teaches us like we are all political sci majors. So I really had no idea what he is talking about. Extremely boring lectures. Not worth it even if you're just taking for credit. Terrible overall. Do not take his class. You will regret taking his class. Probably the worst class.",0
Dr. Noels is the best professor I've ever had!,1
"CPR101 is an easy course so I cant say how tough of a marker he is. As a professor, he cares a lot. His lectures are interesting and really keep my attention. Great personality. He offers help and advice to student on other courses and just wants his students to do well. Great human being!",1
She flies through her notes and is very hard to understand if you get lost once you're screwed for the test... ,0
I hope that she teaches better in person than she does online. I have struggled through my entire semester with her online and I would not do it again.,0
"He has a good attitude and is definitely not a ""bad"" professor, and you can tell he's passionate about climate change but he just isn't very good at explaining things clearly and dumbing it down for us who don't know anything about it. Basically all you do is take notes and hope for the best.",0
"Great  at lecturing, engaging teacher but completely dismissive, sarcastic, expect to be shot down for a wrong answer. Teacher is unavailable for any human contact, releases grades goes missing does not allow you to review your exam or discuss grades. Best advice to give is do not even study his practice exams complete curve ball.",0
"Great prof! Very clear with his grading, he tells you exactly what he wants to see in your essays. He's hilarious and obviously quite passionate about his subject. My only complaint is that he takes a while to hand essays back and check emails.",1
"Deserves zero for teaching and professionalism. 3 exams, all lecture, all graded by him. Course is set up to have him lecture his understanding of torts and contracts. Creates the exams and creates the grading scale for each exam. Sets you up for failure by offering bonus points on each exam but only 2/30 passes Don't take him if you have choice.",0
"Banerjee is a wonderful lecturer and her class material is super interesting, but these things are sullied by how much work and reading is expected for this course. She assigns readings, assignments and tests as if her class is the ONLY one youre taking. This might not be so bad if she were a lenient grader, but shes definitely not. Shes harsh!",0
"Only two options for this particular semester were to take the class at either 7:30am or 9am. She's very chipper and ready to teach, but classes aren't that interesting.",1
"Easy marker, easy everything, very friendly and easy to talk to",1
"If you are trying to knock off your pre 1800 requirement, look for a class taught by Fowler. I loved her Chaucer class. She is animated and interesting, and very interested in her students.",1
Wonderful teacher and incredibly intelligent. The films in class were very interesting and reinforced with reading short articles and books.,1
"Completely terrible. I'm an honours student, but even that didn't save me from this class. The lectures are of some use, but straight from the textbook. Honestly you might be better off with just the textbook. Don't expect to learn things from him, and expect questions that he didn't teach you on the midterms. If you have him as a teacher, drop it.",0
"He has no time for the class, too busy with his day job! Does not grade labs, you have lab exams instead and he is not good about explaining how they work. Never know your grade because he takes forever to return exam grades.",0
Tidwell is an awesome professor!! She grades in a timely manner and is an awesome lecturer. We wrote 5 essays (all either opinion or prompt based) which were fairly easy to complete and had great feedback on them. The lectures aren't super boring and she really cares about giving proper information!,1
"The class is challenging, as were the exams. I never missed a class and made a solid B in the course. Dr. Green is nice, however, not very approachable. I felt intimidated by him, and never felt comfortable asking him questions. Overall, the class is okay, and you will learn a lot. If at all possible, take Dr. Piel because I heard that he is a litt",0
"When I first met Ms. Dendy, she seemed like a great prof. However, I soon figured out that she doesn't give nearly enough time to write papers, and she does not give much feedback. She seems to be looking for a particular writing style, because most things I write seem to not be what she wants, even though I follow directions and write pretty well",0
"This prof is smart, but he has no idea how to teach.  He needs to take some lessons from John Mathews at Cal State Fullerton.  The textbook for this class has to be one of the worst I've ever had.  It has zero examples and doesn't explain things well at all. The professor's notes are lame.  Don't take this class if you value your GPA.",0
The nicest prof I've had in first year! Lectures were extremely engaging and she always made sure her students' voices were heard. Very clear about instructions for her assignments. Also very considerate. Loved June!,1
speaks very fast and is unclear. copying the notes from her lecture slides before or after class is helpful and simply doing the examples in class. would not take another class with her.,0
"The lectures are really interesting and he has a really critical yet funny teaching style. The classes are laid back and entertaining. He makes a lot of jokes and examples. However, the tests are hard and seem to be based on his view of things. He assumes that we don't know anything about politics. The questions on the test were pretty hard.",1
6 week session.  Short time lots of material.  He worked hard to get ideas across clearly and if you put in the effort he did too.  He does not like lazy and it will show in your final grade if you don't put in the effort.  He meets you half-way and that's a good professor in my book.,1
"I took her class last semester. She is so picky. She actually doesn't care if you have a lot of classes or not or if English is not your first language. She only cares about her lectures and if by any chance you missed to put a comma (,) in your writing then she won't give you the full credit for that assignment. I strongly do not recommend her.",0
"She assigns a large amount of homework and expects the students to only spend about 1-2 hours on each one. It actually takes 4-5 hours to prepare each workshop to her satisfaction. Her comments and feedback go in circles. She doesn't like something, then, thinks you should add it again, then, wants you to take it out.",0
Coolidge is rude and demeaning to students. Unless you have a 100% in his class he will treat you with disrespect. If you miss the class more than twice you automatically fail. There are homework assignments that are worth massive points. There is no final but one massive assignment in the end. He is not usually accessible outside of class.,0
"Such a sweetheart. For accounting she's one of the best you can have. The subject itself isn't super easy so it's not all her fault. Tests are somewhat difficult and she likes to make short answer portion detailed. Prepares you so well for the final, got a B on it but with a little more studying could've easily gotten an A.",1
This professor is and will always be my favourite. He is very approachable anywhere and anytime on campus (provided he isnt teaching or in a meeting). Conducts very fair tests. The labs are tough and textbook use is heavy but putting the effort in will yield a very high mark in this class. Would want him to teach every one of my classes.,1
Prof. Tucker is so sweet understanding and understands communications throughly. She keeps up to date with current forms of communications so well!!,1
Skaff is a legend. Just make sure he knows you and that you are a hard worker and he will do all he can do to help you. Do past exams!,1
Online quizzes are not as easy as the other posts make it out to be. Withdrew from class because of low quiz scores. The additional program you have to buy is also pretty pricy.,0
"Fantastic teacher, gives many examples and explains things thoroughly. Brings a little bit of humor to his explanations which is hard to do in math, and makes it more memorable. Keeping up with the homework isn't hard and he does a good job of preparing you for the tests.",1
Dr. Moe is perhaps one of the hardest professors on campus. He doesn't even stick with the subject and goes off on tangents. He doesn't follow school policy and does things his way. He doesn't even follow the class textbook. He is also very rude to the students and constantly degrades them. I wouldn't recommend Moe. Other professors are better.,0
"He's a nice, but not a strong professor. If you want to take the class because you want to be an auditor, you will not learn enough to make it. He's emotional. He graded one exam all semester. He did ALL the semester grading on the last weekend before submitting the final exam to the school. Never gave feedback on personal papers unless hunted down",0
"Super hard, first midterm was somewhat by the books but second midterm and final was terrible. Homework did not help at all",0
"Very nice, low-talker, but very knowledgeable and enjoyable.",1
"Chemistry is super hard for me personally. Prof Matchett clearly cares about chemistry and his students. He emphasized how much he wanted to help you in any way possible. I took this course during remote learning and struggled but I dont believe it to be his fault, it was my own. He tries hard to make chemistry interesting for everyone.",1
Worst class I have ever taken at Northwest. He has no explanation for the grades he gives on papers. You can study the lecture as much as you want and still get a C on every test. Don't expect to get a good grade in this class unless you are an Ethicist. ,0
"Well, I have to say for a Child Development Teacher she really does require her students to TRY. I am a slacker and, well, recieved the grade I deserved. However, I hate the online tests. Those are really confusing in my opinion. Anyway, in all I would have to agree that she is a very smart, helpful, and unorganized teacher, but, I like her.",1
"Great teacher who makes most classes interesting.  He expects you to know the course material and attend every lecture.  However, we spent the entire semester learning the grammer of old english and for the final and 2nd midterm he made us do translations without actually teaching us the language.  When I approached him about this he said too bad.",0
Interesting lectures,1
He's really funny and easy to get along with,1
"Just a terrible course with a terrible professor. Find another course to take or youll regret it. Poorly put together poorly executed, you have to teach yourself. Nothing gone over and lecture is on the tests just a waste of time.",0
"He really I think is in latin american studies so he can go soak up some rays in Mexico, not b/c he is all concerned about them...he don't care, and he knows it, it shows in his teaching, very profoundly, and I think he needs to be audited by the school. He sucks and he needs to just give it a break.",0
"Worst professor I've ever had. Exams are ridiculous. He treats this class as if it's an advanced course. Extremely full of himself and thinks he is the smartest person in the room at all times. Very rude, uncooperative and does not explain things well. Expectations are not clear for what you should know for exam. DONT TAKE A CLASS WITH HIM.",0
"He made the class interesting . He is clear about what he wants. You're graded on group discussions, an IT project which consists of a presentation and a paper that you work on the majority of the semester. If you ask him for clarification in person, he'll give you examples on how to improve. He was very fair and made the class experience smooth.",1
"I don't suggest taking his class. While Colby is sort of nice, he is very unclear on what he wants in his papers, its like he develops his own types of papers for you to write.. he can be rudeisn't too awfully helpful either. If you ask something he said in class he will call you out over it which is kind of annoying. A VERY picky grader as well. ",0
The worst professor ever. I would suggest do not ever take his class especially CS 623 Database management. you are not gonna learn anything and he will stress you out big time.,0
vert patient,1
"She will be very clear about what she wants and what she does not want. If you do not follow those instructions, she will mark you off heavily for it. Make sure to always ask what form she wants her answers, and in this class lab reports, so that you are always doing as you're told. Study normally and you will do fine. (A 91 is still a B+ though!)",1
"The best professor I have had at this school thus far. He knows his stuff! Great class, I learned a lot, and I'm really glad I'm majoring so I can take more classes from him!",1
"All my assignments got graded the day before grades were due, during a 3 month semester. Often very confusing in his lectures, but i took it pass/fail so it was easy if you just do the work.",0
The lectures were very interesting and Blaustein is hilarious. He lectures on stuff that is relevant to life and current issues.,1
She is ridiculous,0
"This guy, I can say without a doubt, is the worst professor I've ever had. He mumbles when he speaks, talks to the floor and stutters like no other. His assignments are ridiculously long, and the final exam is basically all the assignments strung together. He also hired a completely incompetent TA, so there was NOBODY to ask questions to.",0
"I rarely used the textbook, only for some assignments. Assignments are easy, and take an hour or two at the most, also lets you work with a partner. Exams are 25 MC questions. Noncumulative final. Read his Powerpoint slides and you'll be fine. Also gives lots of extra credit. Excellent and knowledgeable Prof - take him!",1
makes fun of students who aren't a brain on the computer.,1
Interesting class. The professor had interesting lectures that were easy to understand. Make sure you do ALL the reading and take notes on EVERYTHING!,1
Her focus is often skewed towards just grammar and construction not content.,0
"Hes the worst teacher Ive ever had in any subject. And I graduated years ago. Trust all the bad things people are saying. They are not just disgruntled students, I personally aced his classes. Hes just not a good person.",0
So an easy class to pass. Show up and do the weekly assignments and you will get an A. Professor Crowell is a very caring person and is a very easier grader. I would highly recommend the course and professor,1
"Professor Schnoebelen is an amazing professor. She explains everything in a way that's easy to understand. I got solid A's on both midterms and the final. Her exams are very reflective of lecture material and practice problems/ discussion worksheets, so if you just stay and memorize those, you'll be prepared.",1
"I am not a dancer in any way, but I am having the best time in her class right now. I am also  big fan of the ""candy just because"" days and I have actually gained much more of an interest in dance. Just be polite and watch the language and she will be your friend for life.",1
"Study from the get go, his test are super hard and you have to study or you won't pass. He gives test and one paper. So if you fail the test you're going to have a hard time passing. I went to his office so many times asking for extra credit or something, he doesn't give it. Will do study sessions if you ask for them. Thankful I passed with a C. ",1
"He's a decent guy, but he doesn't really follow an outline and tends to get very off-track in lectures. Kind of old-school; he doesn't use slides at all. You have to rely quite heavily on the textbook to survive exams, as he asks very textbook specific questions. Pretty fair in grading but expectations for assignments can be slightly unclear.",0
Super nice person but she doesn't teach the material very well. Having a hard time doing the homework due to her not teaching the material. Very confusing and hard to follow,0
A good teacher who knows how to explain concepts. Lectures contain many example questions to illustrate concepts. Lectures also contain some live demonstrations which are always fascinating. The lab is long and sometimes tiresome but does make sense and ties in with the rest of the material. Exams and marking are straightforward and fair.,1
"This course was online and asynchronous. Lectures were posted on Sunday night. We had weekly homework due on Wednesday, discussion board posts due on Thursday and Friday, and a quiz due on Sunday. One complaint I have is that the assignments were sometimes opened only about 12 before they were due (opened at midnight, due at noon).",1
"Decent class, He's got a ton of knowledge but mostly just likes to stand on one of his few soap box topics and preach.
 
 So if you want to hear your counter-Master's culture opinion regurgitated and spit out back to you, or an easy A, its a great class. If you want to actually learn the materials, take another.",1
"Pozzi is everything that is wrong with GVSU's Spanish department. They need to get rid of the weak professors who have no clue how to teach like Pozzi and Fidalgo and employ strong teachers like Serrata. She is very egotistical and does not support you if you are trying to succeed. In addition, she is a sexist and should not be teaching a capstone.",0
"Six years out of Wheaton and into grad school, I still am thankful for classes with Dr. Davis. His classes are purposefully challenging, but he is thoughtful and genuinely wants his students to learn. Best professor I had at Wheaton, and after having Jerry Root, that is saying a lot!",1
"Bogan's a very smart man. Open to criticism and doubts. Answers questions clearly. The presentation and research paper were on the same topic. The mid-term and final were responding to two-question prompts. If you're interested in the subject, definitely go for him. If you want to have your mind blown AND to blow your own mind, then take his class.",1
The best English professor you can take at Pace. Allows you to write about whatever topic you want. You write a piece every week with no page requirement. He's very understanding if you have anything going on especially due to the pandemic.,1
"Keep in mind: written during COVID-19, online and proctored. Kathie is the first prof through this entire COVID process to make proctoring feel gross. The way she gets giddy as she explains the impossible restrictions that are entirely invasions of privacy and unreasonable to ask of a student. Suggested using tinfoil as a mirror for env scans.",0
"I would recommend his American Govt class if you're only taking the class because it's required. I have no interest in history, but I know the basics. This class was fairly easy, and he gives you cheat sheets for all the homework. Tests are mainly over PPTs and what he lectures about in class. No quizzes.",1
Spent more time on this course then any other despite it not being in my major and not being useful in any profession. here 2 semesters. so far this is the only class I did not get an A in. Ruined my 4.0. Ive been told Im a great writer here. Wont get a good grade unless you are a sheep and conform to the way of thinking In his article choices.,0
i loved singing under him and think he is one of my favorite directors/professors I've had at calvin. he is genuine and intelligent. do whatever you can to take his class sometime!,1
Professor Fox is amazing. I took this class with him and ended up taking 3 more. He is a great lecturer and is more than willing to go over  difficult concepts with you out of class. There is a fair amount of reading but usually interesting content. The tests are difficult so study early! Easy to get a B but hard to get an A,1
"He is a very nice guy. You can tell that he cares a lot about the topics he teaches. The class is graded by reading journals, class participation, and 2 essays. It could be a pretty easy A, but you have to read around 60-100 pages for each class meeting. I just didnt have time to do that with my other courses, so I got a B. Pretty average class.",1
Personable. Small class size is good.,1
"I only took a journalism class for my major but nonetheless this class ruined my semester. He doesn't put any of the information online, and only gives you flimsy half sheets for assignments that are easily lost. I've been on the honor roll through my entire college career and this will be the class that ruins that. I didn't learn a single thing.",0
"The worst math teacher I have ever had. Luckily I had the book, so I could go back and teach myself again that he never taught in class. His lectures are solely off of a powerpoint, and doesn't explain any problems. Tries to be funny, but just uncomfortable and awkward.",0
"Stapp is something else. While I respect his passion for economics, this class has guaranteed the fact that I will not be majoring in econ. The first test will destroy your grade and you'll dig out of it for months. Smart guy but also arrogant and condescending at times. Rewrite your notes and memorize every single graph.",1
"The professor is knowledgeable.. In ECO 121 he would use way too many specifics than the straight baseline understanding of the material presented.  His forms of grading were very confusing, using odd worded questions(tricky)and only using tests until he made us buy an extra online homework for 100 questions that he couldn't design on his own. Bad.",0
He is an absolute awful professor. He will give you grades based on how well he likes you. Don't make yourself known to him. Sucking up to him is a must. Brown nose as much as possible. His grading is not fair and even if you are right and argue he will not do anything about it.,0
AVIOD THIS CLASSSSSSSS,0
I LOVE MS. DENDY. I have never met a teacher who cared so much for her students. She truly loves each of her students and wants each to succeed. She is more than willing to help you outside of class and even sit in the library with you. She is an easy grader and uses all the textbooks often. This is the one English teacher who is flat out awesome.,1
Absolutely horrible.,0
Terrible teacher. Lectures are incredibly long and boring. Nobody pays attention to him at all. Attendance is for extra credit. The tests are unbelievably hard and have nothing to do with his lectures. He just really wants you to read the book. On exam review days he just reads the book to you. He can't hear well so you can't ask questions.,0
useless class. didn't learn anything at all!!! he graded really hard for the first project and then really easy for the others. but I didn't learn anything in his class.,0
"I would never take him for an online class again. No communication with the students other than sending the same reminder before each test. Class is just reading a chapter and taking a quiz, but without a study guide or anything to focus on while reading. Worst online professor to take",0
"Andor is one of the most caring, kindest professors I have ever had. He is incredibly educated and passionate about what he teaches. It is a heavier amount of work, but if you're passionate and interested then it really isn't that bad. He is very open to working with any disabilities or issues that you may be having as long as you bring it up early",1
"New, but willing to learn.  Enthusiastic, and approachable.",1
"He is such a great teacher. Even though the whole class is taught in German, he will stop and explain things clearly if he sees that no one understands. Plus he makes jokes to keep people interested. Really easy grader too. Definitely take a class of his!",1
Great teach. supper easy. Taker her for ntdt200!!,1
Professor Prasad is really unorganized. She's really informative but I wouldn't take her for lab. The practical exams are really hard. Seeing the cadaver once won't help you remember the body parts. The open labs are short too. There's so much to remember in so little time. Super hard class & takes forever to grade. I wouldn't recommend taking her,0
"Scott has seriously made me reconsider my major. He only understands himself during lectures. It's a intermediate Macro class but it feels as an Advanced+ class. Notes are barely existent and doesn't rely on his textbook, which is about 12 years too old. Didn't learn anything about Economics for a whole class.",0
"His in-class assignments were a tad ridiculous, and the group project took a crazy amount of time to complete. He expects everyone to participate in the class, and would call upon people to talk if no one volunteered. His exams were really straightforward and fair. Textbook helped if you missed a class or were unclear on some of the concepts.",1
WOW!! The only thing that is bad about this profesor is he uses red on the board and no one can see it! He is Great and Helps every time me can get a chance! If you want to take a GREAT professor take him!,1
"Great lecturer!  A bit intimidating to talk to face to face, but great class overall!",1
"Professor used technology to show us all the artwork from the textbook, and she did not even know how to use powerpoint. We tried to help her with it and she just got annoyed at us. I highly recommend not taking this professor she barely taught and her exams were nothing that she explained in class",0
"Pointless in going to his lectures, don't understand anything he says, thank god for recitation.",0
"Awesome professor, but very difficult class. I put my all into this class and I still barely understood anything. First pop quiz completely screwed me over. I'm just glad I got this over with.",0
If you're not already good in math don't take him.,0
"Nice enough professor but very boring. Taking sexuality, you would think there would be some fun/funny element to the class, but no. If you don't go to class, you won't do well. Powerpoints do not convey information well, and what he says in class is more important for the (hard) tests. If you don't take notes as he talks, don't expect to do great",0
AWFUL. Locks doors on the first day. Refuses to respond to questions by email but when you go to his office he tells you to email him. Register early and do distance learning (fills up quick) or ask around and sniff out a teacher that's alive and breathing. However the syllabus is cut and dry if you like sensory depravation then this is your bag.,0
Heidi is easily the most hilarious and inspirational communications teacher I have ever had. She is passionate about what she teaches and her students. What I love most about her is that she is receptive to feedback and constantly looking for ways to improve herself and her teaching. She is wonderful. Wish I could take every class with her! ,1
"Spaeth's passion lies with Rome, not her students. She's far more concerned with rushing through powerpoints than engaging and educating. Yes, there's a lot of material to cover, but the class just feels like watching someone rapidly talk to themselves. Don't buy the textbooks; just review the power points online. Take only if you love the subject!",0
DO NOT TAKE. There are 2 quizzes every class on the reading which was homework and the lecture he gave to make sure you were paying attention. Both quizzes and all of the exams are online tho with is a plus. I had a C all semester but the class did so bad he had to scale everyones grades at the end so I finished with an A.,0
One of the most worthwhile courses of my college experience. Professor Nankin will push you harder than ever anticipated but it is because he knows it will turn the best result and you will thank him in the end. If you are given the opportunity for this course take it. I will be hard in the moment but the results make it worth it.,1
"By his lectures you can tell this guy knows his stuff. However, he grades very and I mean VERY harshly. He makes up his exams and some of the questions are nearly impossible to answer. Its almost impossible to get a good grade on papers. (Unless its a Pearson Prompt)So basically you'd be lucky to get by with a C.",1
"Whitaker is a very knowledgeable professor. Informative and entertaining lectures, and a light work load. Only a few assignments and quizzes, and two exams (mid-term, final). If you want to retain the material from this course, I would strongly recommend taking this class in person instead of online. If you're just looking for a grade, take either.",1
"Very unclear what this guy wants from you in practically every area of this class, especially assignments. No where is it written in words what he wants/expects from you on assignments. Tough.",0
Best teacher at Wright State,1
SHE IS SO UNSPECIFIC WITH WHAT SHE WANTS. All that lecture for very few tests and things.,0
Just don't do it. Find yourself a better teacher.,0
"Montagna is amazing! I took him online so I probably didn't learn as much but he was so nice and helpful. The class is pretty easy as long as you read and do the quizzes and papers. but if you don't know the material, good luck. You have to read 3 books and have to write 3 big papers. There's a few timed exams and quizzes but nothing too bad.",1
"disgrace to UMaine's MBS. takes forever to return graded work, never returns any writing assignments except for the idiotic business plan. blabbers during lecture with stories rarely relevant to course material. mandatory highschool-like assigned seating. its been past two weeks since the last project, FINAL GRADE HAS YET TO BE POSTED.",0
"As a teacher he will get an F. He does not motivate students to learn more, he does not how to teach, and he uses an obsolete system. Not a great teacher.",0
"There is no need to even buy the book for this class.  Attendance is not mandatory, but if you want a good grade you'll be there.  Tests are strictly from lectures.  There is a ton of material.  Only two tests and some quizzes make up your grade.",0
"Very difficult professor. I took her for COMM88 this past winter quarter, and I've never struggled so hard in a class before. My TA was also a difficult grader as well which didn't make the class enjoyable. All I have to say is expect the unexpected with this class.",0
This history class was interesting because it focused on the sides of US hist that you don't extensively learn about in high school. Grades papers harshly but going to office hours helps. Tests were short answer and also pretty difficult. There's a weekly textbook quiz on canvas but he drops the 2 lowest grades. Not an easy A but it is possible,1
"Professor Aguilar is terrible. She gives so much homework, her lectures are ramblings, she does not ever speak about the assignments. She is a rough grader but if you feel you deserve a higher grade she does listen and if you make a good argument she will bump it up. Be ready to read and to do A LOT of writing. She does not make directions clear.",0
Consists of 3 exams using Proctoru & 3 page paper. The Tests are 27 MC questions and 2 Dis. The average test covers on average 300 pages of content and are very specific questions directly from the text. READ before the lecture and have power points in hand to take notes in class. No tutoring resources offered by ODU for this class,0
"brewer is a great chem professor even though the material is pretty hard, she always has office hours and really cares about her students, she always uploads her lecture slides but leaves blanks in them so you really have to go to class and always has extra practice problems for anything you get confused on",1
"super boring , easy to pass if you know the material. attendance isn't mandatory",0
"Amazing professor. He really knows what he's talking about and uses primary sources from WWII that he can translate on the spot. He's personable and friendly, as well as clear and engaging. The only downside is he hasn't starting using Blackboard yet.",1
"I challenge you to find a teacher more passionate about his job and area of study.  I wasn't thrilled to be taking this required course, but Dan's attitude generated a new-found interest in the subject for me.  Take this class with Dan and you will not be disappointed.",1
"Great professor. I'm not good a philosophy but I loved listening to Paul. He has so much faith in his students. Lovely, lovely man. So helpful.",1
"Dr. Kaelin is a very very specific professor. His tests are extremely difficult and he looks for very specific answers. His powerpoints in my opinion are a bit repetitive and didn't really help me when preparing for the exams. You have 3 exams and 1 group projects, so the group project gives you an opportunity to boost your grade.",0
Good teacher & human,1
MA comes off crazy at first but she ended up being one of my favorite professors. She cares about her students. She's really entertaining too. I definitely recommend her for BUS1010 but I'm not sure how she is as an accounting teacher.,1
Such a kind forgiving lady.  She's enthusiastic about biology and that shows in her work. If you miss an assignment she'll most likely work with you. My only gripe with the class is that at some points in the lectures a few students made it hard to pay attention. She's trying her best though and it shows. I reccomend.,1
"DR,H is a God-sent woman, specifically for anthropology. This issue is, do NOT take her if its for gen. ed. She takes a class or so to get into he grading style and vibes. If youre an anth major and dont take all of her classes YOURE MISSING OUT!  Love her!",1
"I enjoyed the films in this class, and the slide presentation of the history of SF. He is an easy grader on the tests, but some of the questions are a bit ridiculous; you have to be in class 100% of the time to learn some of the tid bits which seem so insignificant at the time, but later he'll test you on. He's also very monotonous!",1
I expected this  course to be easy... I was mistaken. Very difficult to understand the concepts in class. She was the toughest grader I have ever had! Good luck!,0
Prof. McMeans is awesome. Her deadlines are not negotiable! Do the papers on time! Turn them in again and again to be revised! Study the book for the online tests! DO NOT CUT CLASS! you cut class it WILL hurt your grade! easy to talk to and she will help you as much as you help yourself! great class great teacher!,1
"She is really nice, but disorganized. She doesn't give you a set syllabus, but instead a general outline of what to cover. We did need to get and read all the books. Our grades were based on essays and participation. No tests.",0
"Had Prof Triplett for both MGF 1106 and 1107. Hands down one of the best professors I've had. He wants you to learn the material but also understands that formulas and processes can be awkward to memorize and will let you use notes. Be prepared for a lot of homework, especially if you take a condensed summer class. Great Prof all around.",1
He is very inspirational but expects a lot from his students. He shows great films and opens up many viewpoints. He expects participation from the class and lots of papers.,1
Stay away!! She is a really nice lady and really means well but she goes very fast and if you are not good at statistics you are out of luck.,0
Arthur is the only good thing about intro chem.,1
Awesome professor. Very interesting. Has fun projects and assignments. Loved the Enthographic Genres Charades!,1
He stands out amongst the typical boring monotone math/comp sci professor's at york. You can tell he enjoys educating people and loves socializing. I myself am extremely introverted but it was a relief to see a prof expel so much personality and uniqueness. He really has helped me understand the subjects I learned in an abstract open minded way.,1
This course has became harder due to covid. The professor is no help. She will not listen to you if you are struggling .Her answer to everything is study more or gives vague 1 word replies thru canvas inbox. No study guides for tests which accounts for 60% of your grade and WILL NEVER TELL YOU WHATS ON THE TEST. Only 2 students pass the class.,0
"Kraenzel has turned a 200 level geography class into a technical GIS course. It is so boring and his lectures go on forever with neverending useless information that will never be needed unless you plan to work in GIS. His project directions are so detailed too, taking up a lot of time. He acts like it's the only class anyone is taking.",0
"His lectures seemed more like rants and a chance for him to hear himself speak. There were no powerpoints, he's not on Blackboard, and the textbook is dry and doesn't relate to class material. 70% of the time I caught myself thinking how  what he said even related to sociology.  You just write down what you think may be important & hope for thebest",0
"I liked Dr. Wallace's teaching style and I found him easy to understand, especially if I understood the reading. However, the example questions we used in class were always much less difficult from those on the exams so it was hard to gauge how you stood. I got a private tutor for this class because I found it so difficult.",1
really cool guy knows his stuff need to do the assigned readings to do good on the test likes questions tests are hard take a lot of notes and study them,1
"We were reading short stories and answering some questions for every homework assignment. Each chapter was about something different like point of view, character, setting, tone and style, theme. If you don't understand these very well then the test is going to be impossible to do. The class is a lot reading and writing a response.",0
"Seems like a nice person, but never responds to emails. Extremely frustrating. ",0
When it comes to tests this guy does not know what he is doing. His review sheets have little to nothing to do with his tests.,0
"Boring material and prof not available for questions, many of games mentioned are obscure and not useful examples",0
"Women, or any decent human being, avoid this professor at all costs. All his humor is based around making other people feel terrible. He feels best when he's making someone below him in status feel their worst. I was his advisee and I have never hated myself or anyone else more than when I had to meet with him.",0
Worst physics professor at COD. I took Physics 2111 with carter and he overcomplicated everything. He's very bad at explaining new concepts.,0
"Hitay knows her stuff for sure and seems to like it but is now 71 and too old and crotchety for teaching. She yells at us for not retaining anything when she's supposedly mentioned it several times and even swears at us. She makes us scared to ask stupid questions. She has character which is what people like, but she needs to retire and go home.",1
He is very hard to understand and does not always lecture on relevant topics. I did not learn really anything in this class. Most of the learning is online and attendance is not mandatory .,0
"Dr. Kuss is a very bright man. HOWEVER, his lectures are so incredibly boring!! He mumbles, talks to himself, and ALWAYS shows up to class 15 minutes late. It was so hard for me to keep an interest in his class, I found myself not wanting to go. Bring your computer, you'll need some entertainment. (took western civilization I)",0
"Cons: Consistently late to class, didn't show up for the final exam, lectures were useless, testing style inconsistent, 1st test was over the entire glossary, disorganized, and she very rarely posted grades on Blackboard. Pro: She was nice.",0
"Media Advertising class with Jacquie was great.  This was my first advertising class I had taken and I know now that I want to keep Advertising as a minor after this class.  Jacquie is great, she can be extremely tough at times but she challenges you to think in new ways.  Very helpful and knowledgeable.",1
"yeah, tell her she's pretty, and you will get a good grade",0
"The class was unproductive. Lectures were unstructured, unclear and redundant; she had limited knowledge of the material. We watched films every week that we were never tested on. None of my written assignments were returned. There were only two exams, which tested minute details. Halfway through the semester she couldn't tell us our current grade.",0
"She makes us do these short answer questions on our midterms that are worth so much and she expects them to be PERFECT because she gives them beforehand, such a hard marker when it comes to these questions. It is hard under pressure to remember everything we practiced beforehand and she's so tough.",0
"Vague marking. 200 pgs of readings in under 2 wks. Completely uncompromising for disabled students. Lectures are amazing but not worth for the email I got when asking for an extension as per SASS acc, 1 wk before due. ""I don't know where you got the idea EVERYONE received a bad mark."" ... From the other students who shared their files w. marks???",0
"he only cuts his hair once a year, but he really knows what he's talking about.",1
"Best professor so far - I can't imagine what it would be like to have a better philosophy professor. He must be the best in the country, for sure.",1
Terrible at conveying information. This man should not be a professor. Those course was awful because of him when I was actually looking forward to it.,0
Amazing Prof. He gives great direction and feedback. I trust his opinion bc he has worked in the industry and knows what clients are really looking for and how to do it. He is really preparing me for my future. Thank you!,1
Hard but good,1
"Most boring professor ever. Tends to go off topic a lot during lectures. The online homework is much more difficult than the in-class exams. Not an impossibly difficult class to be completely honest, but definitely one that drags on and the professor does not make interesting.",0
"His class is structured with his own interest in mind rather than students, a series of tricks/gimmicks, seems he is interested in making life more difficult/not expanding knowledge. Changes grading criteria, hides info so that you can only get from his office hours, bizarre test structures which test memory not knowledge, plays favors. Got A tho",0
One of the worst profs Ive ever had. Condescending to his students and not very helpful. Seriously get ready to READ because youll have to take seperate notes from the textbook bc his lecture content doesnt really follow it. He also tests u on journal articles. Make sure to come to class bc he doesnt post full versions of his lectures online.,0
"This professor was an absolute disaster. Professor Pollack, last minute, scheduled the final exam for 11 days ahead of the university mandated exam date. We are now cramming four chapters of material into the last week in a flurried attempt to finish early. I am told by peers that they suspect he is doing this to take an early vacation.",0
"His lectures are very interesting, he kept my attention the entire semester. Don't even buy the book, his exams come straight from lecture. He doesn't post his lectures online, but even if he did he talks more in detail about the slides, so I recommend good attendance. He somehow made physical science interesting and he's got a great sense of humor",1
"She is a nice person and a good professor, but she is not a good lecturer. She is not clear when she lectures on a subject and wanders off on tangents with each ideology. She knows the subject very well, but she does not do a good job of teaching it AT ALL.",0
"Dr. Bibza is a student favorite at Grove City, but only because what he teaches can be understood by even the most unintelligent of students. You will definitely learn the material, but do not expect to be expected to think critically. Do not let this defer you from taking his classes, though.",1
Knows what he's talking about. Listen to him.,1
"This professor was the worst professor ever! He doesn't grade anything until two or three days before the withdraw date. He creates study guides with answer sheets AND DOESN'T ANSWER THEM CORRECTLY and if you use that answer on the test , he marks it wrong. So unorganized, rude, gives tests that have the hardest problems! DONT TAKE HIM!!!",0
She is great! lots of fun,1
"Not a very difficult class, especially for a history major. Even if you're not a history major it's really not difficult. Really only have to buy the book for quotes to use on papers so if you can figure a way around that, don't even get the book. Again, if you already know the subject material, you can skip lecture pretty freely.",1
Her class is the best in my opinion she makes all the classes interesting and she cracks a few jokes here and there. Makes sure you attend all the classes or else you miss the concept for the next class meeting.,1
Shes an amazing professor! All around great and always works in your favor if deserving of it so just do all the work and youll be great!,1
Good professor all around,1
"I had him for a visual concepts course and I swear that was a trial. He was so particular when grading but explained nothing when giving the assignment. It was so annoying. I almost wanted to quit the art program. I mean, I got a B. But no matter how much I pestered him I could never get a clear answer on how to get an A.",0
"Dr. Carroll was kinda bitter and rude in lectures, and had very poor communication with lab TAs so everything was posted last minute with very unclear expectations. I got nothing from lectures and only rewatch them a day or two before exams for the highlights. Not a difficult class just very frustrating and unenjoyable.",0
"The lectures were reading off slides and were not effective. The class was fun to chill and waste time in but nobody actually learned anything. Studying for midterms and finals meant reteaching yourself the course. If anything, first midterm is easy and then its downhill from there",0
"A very funny professor who wants the best for his students. If you do not understand what he said in lectures, you could always go to his office hours, and his practice tests are almost exactly like the real ones.",1
"Mr. Rivers is such a kind soul. His class is a breeze if you are looking for a stress free english class he is your guy. If you come to class keep up with the work you will be fine. He is very understanding and extremely flexible with deadlines. He does not grade harshly. Only 3 papers, an easy group project and a few minor homework assignments!",1
Prof Wheeler is brilliant! She loves what she teaches and you can really tell. There is a lot of readings but you can still do well if you skim and pay attention to her lectures. She is also very accessible outside of class and I've had so many wonderful conversations with her. She really levels with her students and wants them to succeed,1
"Ms. Dixon-Brown is an amazing professor. She is super kind, and probably one of the best professors I have had. Make sure to participate and do your weekly assignments. Even if this class does not pertain to your major, it's interesting for our day to day life!",1
"funny professor, tests are easy if attend lecture! however, the powerpoints and recordings are posted online! his grading scale makes it difficult to get A's, but he does offer make up essay for missed questions on exams. very interesting class!",1
"This class is awful. An insane amount of work and the homework consists of questions with up to five different parts where if you get just one part wrong, it gives you a 0% on the entire question. The professor does not help in any way as I have reached out through email multiple times with not even one reply. Please don't take this professor!",0
Really cares about her students.,1
"Not organized at all. He ended up not finishing the class so we have to study 1/4 of the course material on our own. A very biased Calvinist. He uses Lewis's ""Problem of Pain"", which is not properly a philosophical book, as the representative position of free will, and trashed it in class while using 3 scholarly articles to defend himself.",1
She was not all that clear when explaining material. You could not study for her exams because she would not tell you what to study and her tests were confusing.,0
Be prepared to teach yourself MATLAB... And then be prepared for your next semester in  MAE 305 for the teachers to tell you it's not  their problem you didn't learn MATLAB in MAE 205 and not to blame the professor you had. Just telling it how it iswas for me and the majority of my peers in MAE 305 now...,0
"LOVE Dr. Pierce and would absolutely take another class with her.  She's very helpful and understanding, and her tests are pretty simple.  She also gives excellent feedback.  Be sure to visit her office hours.",1
One of the best Math Professors you could get at the university. He breaks down very complicated calculus 2 concepts and makes them easy to understand. He does the perfect amount of theory and then example.,1
Funny guy with a nice accent. He goes through examples extremely quickly and sometimes you cant read his writing. Read the textbook before lecture. Also attend tutorials because some TAs can explain a lot clearer. Midterm was fairly difficult; had to know the formulae because there is no formula sheet. Demos were entertaining.,0
he didn't teach us anything he just talked at us for an hr and gave us 30 hw problems a week. Test were weighed really heavily too so if you did poorly on the mid term you were screwed.,0
"Prof. Caldwell is a very specific grader, however he does not specifiy what is expected of the assignment. He can be very rude and insulting, without being helpful.",0
Interesting!  I wasn't sure I would pass at first because his style of teaching is a lot different. But as long as you read the chapters and go to class you will pass.  His lectures are awesome.  You will learn a lot about life.    Brilliant man!,1
"He is awesome guy.  He is now my advisor.  He knows his stuff, not boring, very helpful and very clear.",1
"Really interesting professor. Extremely hard grader - don't take her class unless you're really willing to work for it. She has favorites but is really helpful to anyone who asks. Keep in mind though, prepare to work your a** off.",1
"This is an online class. You're supposed to watch videos and take weekly quizzes on the videos, but if you ONLY look at the flashcards, you will get 100% on each quiz, because the flashcards are EXACTLY the same as the quizzes. The questions on the midterm and final are all from the quizzes, too, so just study those, and you WILL get an A.",1
"Great teacher and interesting class, easy A if you come to class, listen, and do the work",1
"Not difficult to get an EASY A. Didn't show up for half the classes, because it was a 9 a.m., but still managed to get an A. GOOGLE DOCS are your best friends. Lets you use notes for all the tests. Don't forget to do the 5 question quizzes on BB for easy points. 10/10 recommend.",1
She's great,1
"If you want to fall asleep in class you should really take him for english. He talks waaay too much, but nothing he says makes sense. He leaves too much work and theres alot of reading, talks more about history than anything else. Does not know how to teach I dropped his class and if you are smart you will too!",0
"Professor Turull explains his content meticulously, making sure to take his time so that his explanations are precise and understandable. His class was not easy, but I would say that he made learning the content easier than most professors would. It is complicated material after all. He is also really funny!",1
"While Jen herself is nice, her quizzes don't line up with what is covered and are worth 25%. She gives 15 minutes for 10 question quizzes. She often says not to worry about things and then puts them on the quiz. She picks small phrases from the text instead of main concepts. Effort and putting in the work do not really correspond to grades.",0
I loved Lockyer.  She makes you think and challenges your ideas and various people's assumptions.,1
She was all over the place!,0
"Mike is incredibly nice, a very enthusiastic and crystal clear lecturer, and a very interesting fellow. The class content was easy and presented very well. The assessments were straightforward and simple. Mike also is a very unassuming high profile astronomer; his anecdotes are amazing. One con: uses Comic Sans on his slides.",1
"I really enjoyed the class discussions and it it seemed that as long as you show up, participate, and do the work you will probably get an A.  There was a substantial amount of reading, which can be a bit much if you have other classes with heavy reading.  Overall she is lovely, knows her field, and makes class fun.",1
Fantastic Professor.,1
"He doesn't seem to understand that people can have different ways of understanding concepts than himself, often having 5+ min arguments with students who dont understand something, while he just keeps saying that the answer is obvious from the slides. He doesn't care about the students at all, and I cannot believe that he is still a professor here.",0
I would not recommend taking this guy. He has a ton of homework which is by no means easy for a basic level class. His labs have absolutely nothing to do with what your doing in the homework and test. There was a ton a work to get done and not enough time to do anything. I wouldnt recommend anyone taking this guy for anything ever.,0
Mr Boehm is AWESOME! I actually like english but he made it even easier!! very helpful and went above and beyond to help me with my final. I passed with an A,1
"Honestly, one of the most horrible teachers to learn from. Amazing person, but I feel bad for him when he's teaching/lecturing and NO ONE is listening. The most monotonous voice possible, and the tests are very different from what he talks about. He takes attendance. Tests are unbelievably hard. But 3 out of 5 tests were on koofers as a reference.",0
"I did so badly on the first assignment, but she let me redo it and gave me the best feedback. She was so genuinely happy that I did better, I could tell she REALLY cares for students and just wants everyone to learn something. Assignments are a bit weird, and she often goes on tangents, but they are so funny",1
"Meyer makes you think his class is really easy throughout the quarter, but then he's really obscure about how he grades. Basically, the only feedback I got was A/A- on the midterm and then he dropped an A- on me for the quarter even though I participated and was in class every day.",0
Do me a favour and don't take this prof,0
"I have taken a Moses class about three times now. Study, do things his way and sit there and listen in class. I think the value of his teaching style won't be apparent till you are older. When u sit in class and think to yourself ""is this guy an a**hole"" you'll come to realize that the answer is maybe, but so is the rest of the world so deal w/ it",1
Math22al is a do it yourself class composed of 9 reused online HW labs. - 0 Lectures - Bad office hours - 0 communication Labs aren't difficult but they're useless busy work which is NOT good for building a foundation in linear algebra. Dad-del is no where to be found. His TA responds to emails for him. ABSOLUTELY AVOID.,0
One of the worst online professors I've had at laurier. Her methods are stuck in the past and she shows no adaption to the future of online learning.,0
"Does not make expectations clear. First paper almost the whole class received C's. She lectures like below average professor, struggles to get her point across, and only has you read the books and post on discussion board...yet grades like we are grad students. Even grades low on participation if you are active! I would not recommend her class.",0
"Dr. Hedlund is awesome and her class is extremely straight forward. She lays out everything you need in detail, you just need to do the work. Overall easy and interesting.",1
I would like him to stay more focused on the subject of contemporary law.,0
Great prof! Really wants his students to do well and is willing to help when things aren't clear. The assignments are tough and long however they really prepare you for the tests and final exam. Lecture slides are always posted online so class can be a bit tedious and note taking isn't really necessary. The course is very math heavy!,1
"I've taken his Cybersecurity class and another as well and overall the man has no clue what's going on. He is unhelpful, especially when it comes to difficult things like labs and online certifications, and is unclear. He does give good internships but he never really teaches or does any real work with his students.",0
"Really strict, she will call on you at random, she gets annoyed easily with students asking questions, talking, or even if your phone accidentally rings. She is really difficult to follow sometimes. Her exams could be challenging, if you put the effort, she will notice.",0
"Professor Nejat is the cornerstone of the physics department. He loves the subject and really wants his students to succeed. However, his classes are by no means easy. You have to definitely be willing to put in work to do well. He expects you to read ahead and do homework that in addition to the labs and Loncapa take up a lot of time.",1
"I had Professor Vroman for Honors Micro Theory. I absolutely HATED the class. Her lectures are so unclear, and she goes through the material so quickly. Going to class was a waste of time. I had to teach everything to myself. Definitely do not recommend.",0
"Kotzman is easy in the fact that she assigns no tests, just projects and most grades are group-work. BUT she gives very little explanation on any assignments and be warned missing even 1 class can lower your grade significantly. To top it off the final is the biggest joke of York College.  Initially seems easy but the work is not what it is worth.",1
"Bill is very helpful if you go to his office hours and also is a fair grader. He offered I think 100 points of extra credit, and the labs are fairly easy as well. Pop quizzes and exams can be annoying, but it's still a good class.",1
"Despite the low numbers that I gave him and others on this page, he really isnt as bad as he might seem. You will have homework due before EVERY class, two different reviews for a grade before each tough exam, and a case project that is intimidating. But staying on top of everything and getting Cs on the tests still got me a B+. It's manageable.",0
"I think he goes through the lectures to fast, its to the point were I can hardly even keep up. I would read the textbooks for a little bit more of an insight but I cant see it being a have to, unless its for the bi-weekly tutorials.",0
"She's hands down the worst professor I've ever had. She talks down to students, assigns 50+ pages of reading for almost every class, and expects everyone to be passionate about the subject. She acts disappointedfrustrated if you aren't. Instructions are very confusing. She claims she'll meet with you, but is always ""too busy"" to actually do it.",0
I swear I learned more about Pakistan in this class than I did economics. This man gives such unclear notes and he is so hard to follow. He gives many reading assignments but you can get away without ever reading. He knows what he's talking about but he doesn't know how to explain properly and encourages questions but makes it seem like theyre dumb,0
"One of the WORST professors I've ever had. Starts well but goes downhill. Lied about the Final. Was told 140 MC ?'s instead it was half that. When communicating an issue with her, you are made to feel like it is YOUR fault when it certainly is her fault/I.T. problem. Materials provided don't always line up with tests/exams. Avoid if you can!",0
"He seems like a very nice guy, but that truly does not outweigh the insane amount of classwork he gives each week. He is also completely inaccessible outside the classroom, and will take off 1% point from your final grade if you email him something that could be discussed at office hours. PSU offers a variety of ECON courses, TAKE ANOTHER ONE.",0
Professor is very accessible and provides good feedback. Cares for his students,1
Prof. Keeling's class was tough. The class consists of 3 tests & a 2 page paper. The tests cover 5-7 chapters at a time & are 27 questions. There is a ton of content to know!! He tells you what is  on the test in the PowerPoint but sometimes its the opposite. You don't need the book. Just study the powerpoints. An A was merely  impossible for me.,1
"You have to teach yourself the whole course. He is hard to understand and just reads off of a word document the whole semester. However, tests and midterms were fair and he provides lots of good homework questions. In that way, if you are very independent then it won't be that bad. Lacks teaching ability.",1
"Tom is an amazing professor, hands down my favorite instructor I've ever had. He loves inspiring his students to be good people and exudes a genuine passion for history. He does lecture and show videos almost every day, but he keeps it interesting. He also frequently stops videos to insert extra information. Everyone should take a class from Tom.",1
Stay away !!!!  he is the worst prof I ever had. ,0
2 Projects in a math class! Seriously? Some Questions on midterm weren't covered by him until a week later. 1 Topic on Final wasn't even in our textbook. Found him annoying and a jerk. Don't take him ever.,0
"Nice enough person, but makes things more difficult than they have to be",0
I have taken a lot of classes at Arizona Western College and this professor is one of the better ones. He is very helpful and makes things very understandable. He was very fair and I definitely plan to take him again.,1
"Dont take this dude, he knows what hes talking about to some extent but the class is very opinionated, purposely makes the class harder than it has to be. If I had a choice between he and a squirrel as my teacher Id choose the squirrel.",0
"I am a typically an A student, I took Sarah's class throughout the summer and averaged 60's on my exams. I would never recommend taking her for an online class. She gives you study guides that do not pertain to the exam and does not lecture at all, therefore you must teach yourself everything. Very slow at responding to emails. VERY DISAPPOINTED",0
"Professor Rojer is probably the best professor I've had in college. She's incredibly smart and very helpful. She cares a lot about her students and loves to see them succeed. No matter what class you take, you'll learn more than you ever expected. (I've taken Intro to Translation & German Film). She's so nice and I would always recommend her.",1
Tries to cover way too much within the 75min class. having the homework & quizzes online makes it very difficult to keep up with assignments because she gives no reminders of due dates. she is a very nice lady but a horrible teacher... would definitely NOT recommend!,0
"very patient, ignores snoozes with great tolerance. just the course is hellish",1
Jeff Rules!,1
"For prospective students, try to complete all parts of each assignment well before the due date. He is very approachable will give you good feedback during office hours on your code. Have something to show him and be prepared to explain your work. Don't let the opinions on here define your class experience.",1
"He made me wanting to transfer to management major. He is great at teaching, easy grader, just 3 essays through the whole semester. Take him.",1
Professor Jahani is super nice and sweet! But he is not a good professor. He is very unclear and confusing. Half the time he doesn't even know what he is teaching and asks the class. I think I could have learned more at home on my own honestly. But he is a very kind person.,0
"Awful teacher, gives way too vague prompts for essays and doesn't hand back graded ones until way after the next one is due, It could be months past the first essay and you still will not have it back, also assigns homeowork late at night due he next day in the morning",0
"Very nice indeed, plus the class is pretty interesting.",1
"She is helpful, and allows for the ""champagne excuse,"" not to mention she has a sincere interest in her students. Very highly recommended!!",1
The one class that taught me the value of having a prof who doesn't have a speech impediment. You'll spend most of your time learning on your own as trying to understand anything in class becomes a gut wrenching chore.,0
"Ok class, ok teacher... He does a great job with the lectures, but not so much on feedback for homework and exams.   Only emails I get from him are for the class, mostly about not cheating and doing your own work on the homework, nothing about how you did exactly on your homework or exams (just a number grade)",0
"He is pretty entertaining when he teaches, and really into what he teaches. Pretty funny and super cute.",1
"Moves pretty fast through lectures and doesn't allow electronic devices, so prepare to do a lot of note-taking. Understands most of us aren't stats major so she jokes a lot to keep it light. Tests are usually 5 questions each but lots work but write down EVERYTHING you know, she gives points just for trying even if answers are wrong. Enjoyed her!",1
"Professor Kerr was a very nice lady but in my opinion, she was not teacher material. She only grades on tests and it's kind of difficult to pass her class if you are not very test-savvy. I am not a good test taker, and I usually get all my points from homework and participation. She is solely based on tests. She had a mono-tone voice too.",0
"Dr. Heske is the go to guy for chemistry classes, (and from reading below)especially if you don't have to take a freshman course full of whiners who had the good taste and time to trash him on the internet but were unwilling to study.",1
Me too. I'm enjoying the class more and more.,1
"Although he is rather quiet he does want his students to pass. I'm not sure of his computer knowledge saying ""I'm not sure"" for almost any question asked. It *is* very easy material though- Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, Excel and Access. Easy 100% on simulations and HW. Don't expect to get a lot of help- read the eText it gives the solution!",0
"Good teacher, great guy. Take him.",1
"He sucks at teaching. Doesn't teach anything from the book. Most all of his Spring 2005 Students fail, because he doesn't teach well. I will never take him and i also do not recommand him. save your money don't waist it on a stupid professor that doesn't teach his students anything and also doesn't care about his students failing.",0
deadass the easiest class i've taken. maybe studied an hour a week and it was chill. prof is super nice.,1
"If you can get past the surface, he's incredibly funny, though he is usually very dry.  Lectures can be tedious, but they're usually only once a week, so in the general scheme of things it's not that bad.",0
"This prof is hard to understand and has no idea what she is talking about. Very bad instructions on how to do anything at all, not the right person for the job. You will be using 90% of your brain power just try to figure out what shes trying to explain. Will blame your sitting position if you say you dont understand. Voice makes your ears bleed.",0
"Peter is a funny guy. He's entertaining to talk to outside of class. But his lectures are dry and boring.  His tests are not overly easy. There are easy, mildly fun in class assignments for points on random days. He doesn't give many homework assignments, but the ones he does give are time consuming. He gives Extra Credit out like nobody's business",1
"Professor Dyer is not fit for online teaching. The only thing he was consistent with was posting quizzes late. He told us at the beginning of class that the exam would be open book but then required a lockdown browser. When asked what to do, he said, ""I don't know, print it out?""",0
"Its obvious that Mr. Mock knows a lot about government, but he makes it very difficult to learn. Its a very lecture heavy class and he doesnt give much for notes so you have to write what he says and half of what he says isnt relevant. Minimal grades, only a few tests and two papers. He also makes students feel stupid and is extremely rude.",0
"The work itself isn't difficult, but he makes you take quizzes before the lecture is available to make sure you have read. It makes it difficult since the book doesn't explain well. The amount of work is crazy and it's difficult to keep up if you're fulltime. You can pass but if you have the option avoid him.",0
bad prof.  avoid if you want to actually learn something.,0
"SHE IS A GREAT TEACHER! CARES ABOUT HER STUDENTS. I TOOK ASL 115 AND 116 WITH HER AND GOT A BOTH SEMESTERS, UNFORTUNATELY THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO CLASSES SHE TEACHES BUT SHE DOES PREPARE YOU VERY WELL FOR THE NEXT LEVEL. YOU WON'T REGRET TAKING HER CLASS!",1
"Awesome professor with a fantastic interest in the material. Incorporates 'real world' scenarios in the form of literary reviews relating to pertinent concepts in order to demonstrate strengths and weaknesses within the field. He's helpful outside of class, and has a genuine interest in his students. Tests are fair are based solely on lectures.",1
If  are a  geology major  takes  this class,1
"If you're into theory, then this is the Professor you want. Not enough actual problem solving happens. Good luck!",0
I've heard the other teacher of this course is a lot better. I spent waaaay more time trying to please him via the ridiculous format requirements of his papers than I actually spent researching the topic.  I was in a car accident and asked for an extension one time on one paper (explaining the situation) and nope. would not take his course again.,0
"Same guy who submitted the comment below. I meant to give a 5 for clarity, clicked incorrectly.",1
Great guy and a great teacher. A really enjoyable class,1
Great guy.  Most likely brilliant if i could understand a word he said.,1
"Dr. Horner's lectures are unhelpful. However, to be fair, I do believe the grading system has changed. The practical is now only 25%, and lab report and quiz grading are generally fair. As long as you study very hard, an A is not beyond reach. I do think overall experience in this class has very much to do with the TA you get.  ",0
"Lectures were not helpful, she doesn't explain anything clearly.. pretty useless.. DGD/Tutorials were all the help you got, all textbook questions... quizzes at the end of each one. Exams were based off of old one... Got old midterms but no old exams... hard course to begin with, need to study and understand everything.. either get it or you don't",0
"Damn easy, she gives all of the questions and answers to her test (word for word).  memorize them and you'll get an A.",1
"best professor at pgcc for anatomy, i wish i can take him for all my nursing courses. Take him you want to learn and pass the class with an A. Highly recommended",1
"She is a decent professor and sometimes funny, but she definitely wants you to agree with her ideas and isn't really open to other perspectives. She grades tough so make sure to do the readings. Get on her good side and do the work and you'll be fine",1
"Not nice to students when asked for help. Everytime I had an appointment with him at the engineering office, I was pissed off.",0
"He is an awesome guy.  Very good professor, and really wants students to do well.  He will do whatever it takes to help students pass.  He held review sessions for us before every test.  I would recommend him to anyone.",1
"His teaching methods are quite vague. His lectures are more like one-on-one conversations with himself with almost 0% class input. He's an intelligent professor in his field of study but teaching is not one of those fields in question. Does not push students to do their best or participate or care for the class. It's a shame, he could've been great",0
"She's very pippy. She posts powerpoints but annotates them in class so if you miss a class you're on your own. She is helpful when answering questions, but goes very quickly in class. Basic marking scheme: 2 midterms, 1 final. No assignments or anything extra. She marks relatively, so if everyone did super well on a question she'll mark it harder. ",0
"I did this one online, the content was nothing I hadn't studied in high school. Just a brush up course really. No homework online and you can do the exams anytime you like. I finished early so I could focus on other subjects. He was always quick back with emails but you're probably better off getting help in the LRC.",1
Horrible as a lab professor. Very hard to understand her accent.,0
"What is wrong with this course?!  How can this even be a course!  The class consists of the ramblings of a psychotic engineer, preaching on falsity.  1950's clips in class? STV100 has NO application to the real world WHAT SO EVER, STAY AWAY.  Only artsies would be stupid enough to take this course.",0
"Dr. Knapp is extremely organized and efficient in his teaching style. His lectures are informative and thorough, and he always makes sure that everything is retained by his students. He wants you to succeed in his class!! His office hours are flexible and he is incredibly helpful to anybody that needs assistance.",1
"Dr. Hardie does a very good job at explaining material. It is almost difficult to not understand the concepts if you pay attention. That being said, he takes FOREVER to get through a concept. You might do 10 examples of essentially the same problem before going on to the next section. Still very good at explaining, you will understand the material.",1
"I wouldn't recommend taking this course while it's online because the tests are incredibly hard to do on eClass, she gives about 50-60 seconds per question (multiple choice). It may sound like it would be easy but you're not allowed to go back and check your answers and when you're on that kind of time limit, there's a good chance you'll mess up.",0
"Worst Prof I've ever had, made us buy 3 of her own books to get $$$$ and they were required for every assignment. She didn't have any sympathy for students living elsewhere and wouldn't record the lectures. Failed half the class for assignements and would make us write 10+ pages of essays. The final exam was so hard and so long to do.",0
"Coffey is a nice professor overall and if you need help, he's always willing to help you out. However, his class can be extremely confusing. He tries to teach math in a ""new"" and ""different"" way that comes across as scattered and confusing to most people. The lectures don't have much of a point and he doesn't teach much math at all.",0
SO RUDE. DOES NOT HELP. TESTS ARE HARD AND QUIZZES DO NOT MAKE SENSE.,0
alright guy... pretty boring class,0
Do all the problems and master them. She's tough but a great teacher. You will learn a lot if you try. ,1
Margaret is an absolute sweetheart. She shows that she cares and wants you to be successful. If you show her respect she will show you it back. Midterms can be tricky if you don't study the specifics. If you aren't good at writing papers you're going to have a hard time although you can re hand them in. There is a group project which isn't too bad,1
He was terrible.  He refused to help students and when he did he was very vague and just confusing.  ,0
"Roman history, what can I say? She goes a bit fast at times but it is very easy to follow. You must attend class and take notes, she tests you on things she says and you won't find it in the book (don't buy it, its useless). If you go to every class and read your notes before exams, there is no reason for you to get below a 90.",1
"Back again after finishing the class to its entirety to say.. that was a waste of my time and money. Professor Martin said she would make a ""special exception"" for those who turned an essay on time to grade said essay by the day of the final. Come to find out, she has not even started. This essay was important as it was needed for the reflection",0
"Super funny guy, he easily keeps up with the class (and the trends.) The homework is easy to stay on top of. Hes super socratic so if you state an opinion be ready to provide solid reasoning behind it. I plan on taking classes with him again. Great dude.",1
Stay FAR FAR FAR AWAY from this teacher. He is awful. He is useless when it comes to getting help. On discussion posts he will give responses that don't go with what was asked. He puts questions on tests that were not learned during that unit. Like previously mentioned don't take him. Find someone who knows what they are doing. He is really bad.,0
His notes can be confusing. You have to read the book to help get an understanding of the topics. Can't use calculator on tests. Best to try to get a hold of his old tests to help study for the tests. He does curve on the grades.,0
Katie is an amazing teacher! She finds time to help you even if yo are not in her class. She is very clear and makes it fun to be in class. Grading is easy as long as you do the work and are there.,1
"Professor Travers is passionate, knowledgable and considerate towards their students. They are always available to meet during any time, however, they expect you to read a heavy amount of material each week and lectures are all conversation based rather than notes.",1
"Won't provide any keys, will ask questions you haven't seen in homework or in class, will not curve, lots of useless POGIL, writes on board often (cannot read his handwriting). Recommend taking lab at the same time because he will ask stuff in lecture that you've only learned in the lab. Only positive thing I can say is that he's pretty nice.",0
"He is a nice guy, but admits the first day that he is monotoned and prepares us for a boring course.  His quizzes are hard for the pure fact that there is so much material to cover for a 10 question quiz.  He isn't helpful outside of class and is very hard to get ahold of. DONT TAKE. Take learning!!!!",0
"She is a great professor. She is incredibly smart and she is also fair. However, you should really read the text book if you want that A, this material is not easy. Taking her again for corporate tax and I'm looking forward to it. Structured class, clear grading structure, great presentation slides, nice person overall.",1
The man is boring!,0
"Great Professor. You will have about 3 papers per class with him that range from 3-8 pages in length. He grades papers tough but if you get them revised early on, you will make a good grade. Although he takes a long time to get feedback to you on your papers, he gives you many opportunities to re write if he does not think its good. No tests",1
"He's definitely enthusiastic about what he's teaching but he makes so many mistakes. Mistakes in the powerpoint, mistakes during class exercises, even made a mistake on an online quiz once making everyone get it wrong. He rushes a lot in class so often students leave feeling confused. He's an alright guy, but overall he was very frustrating.",0
"Listening class, over the summer. Of course, the material is compressed and you go over a lot in 5 weeks. Duff is a great guy, and he definitely has personality. Be prepared to take lots of notes during his lectures because that's where a lot of test questions come from. Speech Comm is my minor, so had to take this class, but he made it enjoyable.",1
"Dr. Rhoads is a very nice guy and will go out of his way to help you, however I had a very difficult time fallowing him in class. He was all over the place and was not specific. When he gave us review questions for our test they were not even close to the information on the test. No matter how much I studied I would still do bad from lack of info.",0
"If you have at least a passing interest in world religions and you come to class, this is for you. He does assign frequent reading quizzes from the (cheap) class book but they're easy to skim and ace. Tests are on readings and class discussion, essays and group project (2) not graded harsh. Drops a few missed quizzes and in class assignments.",1
"Took his class that was adapted for covid-19. It was definitely easier since there were no exams. He's a really great lecturer and teaches you how to write better code. The projects were fun to do, and most of them were straightforward. Couldn't have asked for a better professor and class.",1
"Even though I failed because I didn't like going to lecture, he was a pretty chill teacher after all. He was concerned about my lack of presence in class and that made me feel special",1
"I withdrew from the class and took the W. This professor is hard to understand and does not give you enough time for the quizzes, which are the majority of your grade. Bomb one and it is so hard to recover, emailed him about a question and got a rude response back. Take Finite Math over the winter or summer with another professor. Kapoor is bad.",0
"this class super boring, never go to take it, and this professor soo mean, super unfair, just like an evil, don't take her.",0
Not impressed with him at all. Found him to be a good lecturer but didn't really find him to have much depth in his content or his thoughts. I also didn't enjoy his style which was too rigid with students and lacking understanding about their perspective.,0
"Great teacher, very funny, cool experiments",1
"He has a terrible Russian accent which makes understanding him near impossible. His writing is illegible which makes the notes almost useless. Along with he doesn't explain anything so you have to self teach yourself the material. Also, there is no calculator use. DON'T TAKE THIS PROFESSOR.",0
"HE IS AWESOME, I am taking his class now and he is a really nice guy who really knows his stuff. He kept class fun and entertaining. Even though it wasn't in my major I really enjoyed the class. I might take him again if I can. Bravo Professor Betts. I am taking his forensic science class and I am not sure the code",1
"I took the Compiler course TWENTY years ago when Professor Ranev was teaching. At that time there was no online assessment. Taking the time now. The course took a lot of effort - but that's what life should be. You won't really appreciate something if it doesn't take work. Pay attention, listen, and work to pass. Great class to attend. Thanks.",1
"She is the best Statistics Professor in LIU. The Covid-19 pandemic forced us to transition to online studying, which got me a bit worried because I prefer taking classes in person, this Prof. made the classes easier by recording each online lecture and uploading on Blackboard, which was very helpful. lots of work, but its worth it!",1
This is the only real  prof in the dept! he's brilliant and humane. Learn so much in every class.,1
"He's really a great man and super understanding when things come up for needing an extension or extra help. You need to be in class for his lectures because his powerpoint have very view words written on them, and he speaks more elaborately about the words. He's super specific, but gives good feedback on writing.",1
"lectures are very helpful as long as you don't skip class you will pass. if you miss a class go to office hours, or if you don't understand something. He will let you know when all your exams will be and which chapters, he might let you use an index card during exams. Also, he makes the class funny sometimes.",1
DO NOT EVEN CONSIDER THIS AS AN ELECTIVE IF YOU LOVE YOUR GPA!!,0
"Professor Chung doesn't take any nonsense from anyone but he is the perfect choice if you really want to understand the material. Show up to class, do your work, participate in lecture and you will get an A.",1
"I had Bro. George in the mid 1980s, two lit courses. But the lifelong lessons were in writing, in composition. ""Fat paragraphs! I want to see fat paragraphs!"" Thank you, sir, one PhD later and successful lifelong career involving writing in everything I do. I now have a very popular blog too. Fat paragraphs, yes sir. Thanks, George!",1
Reads off a PDF and does not ever do the math on the black board.,0
I was so incredibly disappointed. I took her for online semester of psych 002 and she responded to the class maybe 3x. I had to call the psych dept. and even called and emailed the dean. She never clarified why she wasn't giving us lessons or exams or homework. Halfway we were given a new professor (Monica B Coto) and she's an angel.,0
Kraszewski is by far my favorite professor at King's. He is hilarious and absolutely brilliant. I always looked forward to his class; he made it interesting and you could tell he was very passionate about what he taught. The work load is not that much compared to other classes but he wants you to have an opinion about the readings. ,1
You'll do better by not going to his class!,0
He is the best,1
"There's more material in this class than you can shake a stick at, but the instructor does a really fabulous job in structure and format. The notes are clear and concise, and you know from the start what's expected of you. You really have to work hard for a good grade, and you have to spend many hours with the material. Do this, you'll succeed.",1
His wording style in his tests and homework is horrible. You will get confused at some point. His lecture notes aren't really that great either.,0
"He is more interested in talking about his past work than about actually teaching the class.  Don't bother asking questions, you won't get a direct answer and the answer you do get will be riddled with condescending or rude remarks.",0
"Dr. Chiu is amazing. Accounting is definitely not an easy class, but she explains it very well. Honestly, she could probably teach accounting to a rock. Have a problem, she has flexible office hours and does in class exercises to make sure that you know exactly what you are doing. Lecture heavy, but that's the best way to do this class.",1
Hardest class I ever took! I dont know how people do well in this class. So much to read! I read multiple times and took notes on everything and would still fail tests. He gives so many tests!!!,0
"Prof. Roeder makes the tests harder than they need to be. She is also very precise on grading. The class seems easy, but her tests cause you to study more than you should have to for the class.",1
"Taken during the COVID-19 quarter. Professor's teaching style is practically reading the textbook to the class word for word; as the textbook is an advanced read, this is not helpful. Nice guy, but was not well-equipped to teach online-- there's a problem if the class average is  68%. Nonetheless, he a goat for dropping final grade cutoffs by 10%",0
"One of the BEST professors I've had a JMU!!! I took him for the dreaded 395 and he was really helpful! I hate writing papers (still do), but Hyser made writing the paper enjoyable. He learns everyone's name and he genuinely cares about his students (asking if every thing's okay when you're having one of  ""those days"").  Take him for 395!",1
Dr. Hall is good at what she does but she wasn't transparent about my grade the entire semester. She kept handing me back A's all semester to hit me with a B+ as my final grade. She assigns several readings a week which isn't so bad since the material is interesting but she expects you to remember so much for the exams which adds hours of studying.,0
"He knows his stuff, but is terrible at teaching it",0
"He had moments that made the class really interesting, a lot of ""umm"" that may be distracting to some, but wasn't much of a problem for me.",1
"Professor Taiani was horrible. Shes incredibly rude to students who ask a question, will yell at you and call you dumb if you dont understand what she says, and at the end of the day, doesnt know how to explain the problems well. Her tests are ridiculous and dont correlate with her practice problems in class. STEER CLEAR OF HER!!!",0
"He talks extremely fast in lectures so its hard to get all of the information. Also, I never understand his explanations. Exams are so hard because almost all of them are story problems. I usually get good grades in all classes and find it nearly impossible to do so in his class. Very difficult and stressful for a gen ed class. Dont recommend.",0
She is very condescending and patronizes students. Not helpful and just plan rude. Avoid taking this class if you can.,0
"The most boring class I have ever been in.  He goes in circles when he speaks (which is always in a monotone). He is older and tends to forget what he was saying leaving your notes incomplete with major holes in them.  90% of the students dropped it, I think an online class would be easier as you are teaching yourself either way.",0
"Super great professor in my opinion, he is very intelligent and knows what he is talking about and tries to put things into a way we can understand them. Though the class is very challenging he is one of the best teachers to take it with, and he is funny!",1
"Great prof really, go to his class and pass BUT something I found is that he never emphsizes on crucial aspects of problem solving, he has the same montone voice when explaining an important aspect and a not so important point which can make you think the really important aspect is not as crucial as you think. Seperates elite profs from great ones.",1
Patton is awesome and his class isn't stressful. Really recommend him.,1
"I really enjoyed VanOrnum's class! It's super easy and attendance isn't mandatory. He's very passionate about the material, which is pretty interesting.",1
"I dont even think this guy knows what hes doing in this class. He doesnt give out syllabi. He is unorganized and he mocks students in front of other students. Even worse, he is the only professor to teach this class. If you can help it, dont take this class.",0
Very helpful professor as long as you talk to him about your thoughts.,1
"This class consists of 2 lectures per week. It doesn't seem like a lot, but each lecture is over an hour long and the material can be very boring. Make sure to take good notes while watching each lecture and always use the study guide and review video before the exams! Easy A if you put in the time and effort.",1
"extremely nice professor! Class was kind of confusing, but the online homework really helped. Study what is on that to help with the tests. Easy assignments as well. Very glad I took the class with her, easy A.",1
Ask him about his cats,1
"For the second part of the course, it was 90% ""online"" which basically meant he provided a ""guest"" video, lecture slide and what chapter to read. When it came to the exam he was not clear at all on which part of the chapters was going to be on the final.",0
"I loved Kim, she really cares about the topic and she knows a lot. However, she is quiet and it's a little easy to fall asleep during class if it's early in the morning.",1
I showed up to 2 out of 15 lectures. This prof was VERY annoying in class. He would go off and talk about random things. He also does disrespectful jokes about students. I loved the content of this class but the teacher just discouraged me. He will take his time on the first 5 chapters and then realize he is behind and speed through the last 12.,0
Great professor! This material and class itself are very straightforward. The exams are similar to the homework and lecture videos. Very organized class. Curves the tests.,1
It's a solid course and she's organized but I was a little taken aback by her self-promotion.,1
"Very nice prof. Gives very good lectures, lots of notes but they are very useful. Gives examples of practice questions that could be on the exams, very useful for studying. Exams are fair, multiple choice questions are hard, short answer questions are fair.",1
Great prof.  Ones who succeed in her course are the ones who give a great rating Ones who dont always have something bad to say,1
"I took him for microbiology and initially dreaded it because I hate science classes but ended up really enjoying his class. He does a great job answering questions. He is sarcastic and likes to make jokes so his class isn't boring. Offers extra credit, quizzes ate easy if you don't miss labs or lectures.  Highly recommend him to anyone taking micro",1
"I really do not understand the bad reviews. Unless she has changed her teaching style recently, these bad reviews are just slander. The lectures are perfect for the course, showing examples and telling you everything you need to know for tests. There is a lot of homework, but that will be the same in every accounting class.",1
"Prof Humes is really knowledgeable, but her lectures aren't very clear and she often gets sidetracked. However, she's very willing to work with you outside of class. She allows little time for written exams, but she's flexible with deadlines if you just ask, and tries to thoroughly prepare students for such assignments, quizzes or research papers.",1
He is brilliant.,1
Really chill class. Take the quizze online and study for the tests and you'll do fine. He really knows what he's talking about and very easy going,1
There are weekly discussion posts and assignments each week. I thought it was a little too much but they weren't so bad. There were 3 exams ( short essay questions) with no time limit and you have one week to complete it. He's a very laid back prof and allows students to turn in assignments in late which can be good or bad! Great person!!,1
Appalling! Should've video record his lecture and compile a case consist of notes and test to show it to the ProfessorTeacher Community network and let them validate what being said in this review!,0
"Worst class ever! She never puts grades in on time, or sometimes she doesn't even put your grades in. The grade you get on assignments is based on if she likes you. I did the same work as this other girl and i got a 60 while she got a 100. So basically, if you're not the kind to want to be a teacher's pet, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!",0
"Jesilow uploads powerpoints and audio of the lecture, so if you miss a class you can catch up online.  There are attendance questions on the test that are based on his thoughts  or on certain subjects.  You really have to read and study hard to get a good grade in this class.  This class is not for people looking to get an easy A.",1
"Don't take this class unless it's absolutely necessary for your degree. This is a ridiculously hard 100 level class for no reason. There are no PowerPoints, only lectures. He tests on literally ANYTHING in all of the assigned chapters of the textbook. if you spell a word wrong by one letter on a test, the whole answer is wrong. Don't do it.",0
"Lectures are long & dry and half (probably 3/4) the time you have no clue what's going on. Also, he likes to spend 30-45 mins every class recapping the previous week. However everything eventually comes together & its not an extremely difficult or time consuming course.",1
"Best. Language Class. Ever. If you've heard that Chinese is super hard to learn and are worried about taking this class, don't be. Yue Laoshi is an amazing professor and you can really tell that she cares about teaching. If you're looking for an easy A, this isn't the class for you but if you want to learn Chinese, there isn't a better class.",1
"Wasn't a fan of the class, she did not seem to care for many people had her select favorites, not a good class for a Caucasian male(history of urban america) class was very anti white",0
Very nice and funny guy. Tough class for 104. Just go to him for help and show  that you are putting effort into the class and you will be fine.,1
He was not helpful at all. He gave you one thing to review and tested you over something totally different. He grades VERY hard. I would not recommend taking him.,0
His class on arab-israeli politics is transparently biased.  He actually did try to argue that Hamas was a moderate group.  His assignments are intentionally vague and subjective so that he can give any grade he wants.  He subverts students' opinions.,0
"He's very nice but KEEP IN MIND he's a harsh grader on the speeches. My major is journalism and I've received A's in all my writing classes, i'm a great public speaker I never get nervous, but he still gave me a B even though I did all my speeches and came to class. The girl next to me missed half her speeches and did a terrible job but got an A...",0
"Pretty easy class! 3 assignments and 2 tests and by the end of it you have yourself a working website! The assignments have video tutorials so all you gotta do is follow them and you'll be fine. For the tests, I just used quizlet and also merged all the powerpoints together and just control f searched everything and made A's on both exams :)",1
"Professor MacCabe teaches a tough subject so bear that in mind before signing up. He gives more assignments than any other teacher I've ever had, but I will say he is also very FAIR in both grading and allowing late work to be turned in. You take his class you better be ready to not only read the textbook but also get ALL your assignments in.",1
Professor Seals is a great instructor. He is very helpful and understanding. He will explain math to you over and over again until you feel comfortable with it. I highly recommend this instructor.,1
"Professor Sullivan loves what he does. He reads a lot to you in class which is nice because you can understand the text better and he makes it interesting! He was also very helpful, compassionate, and flexible when I went through a family tragedy. I would take his classes any day!",1
Great teacher all around. Really enjoys teaching and helping others succeed.,1
"He's a good teacher an very knowledgeable about art, the fact I did not like his class is because he is very sarcastic replaying to emails. He made me feel so dumb and I think that was not professional from his part. If you made a mistake or made errors please be ready for a smart remark.  ",1
He was down to earth,1
"his lectures are unclear, and the final was a no calculator and nothing like the review which destroyed my average. i'd avoid if i was you",0
"Tom Darby is a phenomenal professor; I had him for 2301 and I loved the content and his style of teaching so much, I took his third-year course. It was a three-hour 8:30-11:30 seminar but Darby was always ready to teach and to get us to engage with the text. The course is very reading intensive.",1
The class provided little in the theory/perspective which made me love anthropology. I learned a lot about South America but too much was vague.  I think doing a short historical overview country by country would've imparted a lot more than going by area topic.  A few test questions could be tricky or focus on tiny details that were not of focus.,1
Dr. Reich is a nice guy but is a very harsh grader and gets political during his lectures. There are online quizzes every week but they honestly don't do anything to your grade. Everything else is essay based so whatever you get on the other 4 assignments is pretty much what you get in the class. take another hist 225 professor if possible.,0
"His class is border-line impossible. I actually paid attention to his lectures (which is very difficult) and took crazy notes and studied for days and still did poorly on the exams. He expects you to read four 250+ page books which is ridiculous. even if you understand the material, you can still easily fail the class cause he words them so weirdly",0
Wainwright was hyperactive...way too fast paced for first year students. He insulted everyone in my class' intelligence by assuming that our (useless) highschools had taught us anything.  I'm glad I make more money him now.,0
"I don't understand people's  complaints about this class or the Professor. This was by far the most enjoyable class of my semester. The class is very interesting, and Dr. Rees knows what he's talking about. Tests are not hard at all: 50 multiple choice questions. Just take good notes and look over them before the tests. No need to read the textbook",1
Professor Kim had really long and boring lectures.  He flew through powerpoint slides and didn't really explain concepts well at all.  Never actually had an in-class test until the final so I had no clue what his tests were like until then.  Just was not a good teacher when it came to teaching or testing.  Somehow got a B-.  Would not recommend. ,0
"Dr. Puneet tries her best during lectures but does a lot of rambling and quite frankly, no one listens to her. She can be hard to understand and doesn't explain things clearly. For the in-class questions, there were several instances where 50% or more of the class missed a question and she would leave it without explanation.",0
"Professor Stolarik provides a genuinely entertaining view of history and its content. It's a shame that due to Covid the class was made to be online, but I can easily imagine how much better the class would have been with more fluid discussions and in person dynamics. Absolutely a professor every history student must take at least once.",1
"He takes a little getting used to, but MO'D is one of the best professors I've had at UST. He's hilarious, is always willing to answer questions and genuinely wants his students to succeed. As a COJO major, I will definitely be looking to take more of his classes in the future. ",1
"Very knowledgeable about subject, but tends to move through lectures very quickly. Homework quizzes twice a week, plus a lab quiz once a week. 4 major tests; usually once a month. She can be sassy, but I think it actually keeps students paying attention so they don't get called out lol Gives lots of opportunities to ask questions, holds reviews.",1
"Oh my goodness. I didnt show up to half the classes, and I normally do for all my classes. But this guy laid it out so well, and knew his stuff that it made it easy. Loved it!",1
"Show up to class and take notes. Honestly just goes through the notes on the board every class, making it extremely easy to follow with very little effort. He emphasizes certain topics (especially the ones outside the books) so make sure to know those for the final exam. Also, make sure to review your midterm and final exam; TAs often make mistakes",1
This professor really enjoys biology but seems to think that everyone should memorize his notes and the book for a intro into biology course. He blames students for doing poorly even though usually 1/3 of the class gets 0.0 on each exam. I studied every night for a week  plus 20 hours the weekend before to get a 4.0 on an exam. avoid this prof!!!!!,0
"Worst teacher I ever had. If she likes you, you get good grade. She collects Homework but never gives you the grades. Do not take her class. She will ignore you if she doesn't like  you.  She is not fair to all. ",0
"The best professor I've had at JMU (and I'm going into my senior year). I really enjoyed his class; he constantly changes things up by using videos, guest speakers, and group activities. I highly suggest taking him! Such a sweet guy.",1
Docked me points for knowing profit ratio's not mentioned in textbook in the Discussions (its bad to know more). Online Group work was miserable and worth literally 50% of grade. The project instructions are not clear and got docked. She changed the grading rubric unethically after submissions! And yes she is very disrespectful like everyone says.,0
terrible. rude and goes way too fast on the power points. expects way too much out of you.,0
First day of class stated that she rarely gives an A grade. Doesn't feel that students can write on that level. Don't expect her to put grades into the computer until the last day of the semester. Quizzes for the first half of the semester on homework reading. I would attempt to avoid her class if possible. Formal writing for an informal world.,0
"Your grade is 3 tests and a final. Attendance is not mandatory but the tests are based completely on the lecture and if you do not go you will fail. Overall a knowledgeable guy and is available during office hours. Go to class, do the example problems, and go to office hours and ask questions and you will be fine.",1
She cares. If you are overweight like I am and at least try she will work with you and respects that in a person. She insists on class participation so don't think you can hide. It's part of your grade. She explains everything that is due. Make sure you write it down because that's the best way to make sure you have it all. ,1
"my biggest regret. his first test is 11 questions out of the 121 topics you have to complete before taking the first test. you get 3 tests and 1 exam. that means you can only miss 4 per test before you get a failing grade and there are over 300 topics you're supposed to master over the entire course. i already suck at math, this class ain't helpful",0
"miller is a genius, probably the smartest man teaching at ud. however, this doesn't make him the best professor..he is almost too smart for his own good...take his classes if you are really interested and already know a lot about poli sci..he is so nice and friendly though..cool dude!",1
One of the best proffs I have ever had,1
Professor Buehler is the best English teacher Ive ever taken. I took her in the fall of 2019 and I loved her! I got a B in her class which for me is amazing. Ive always struggled with English and I havent earned a B since middle school. Her classes are entertaining and she makes sure the class understands everything before she moves on. Take her,1
"I took this teacher a few years ago and have never had an issue with a teacher as much as I do with this guy. I literally failed because I was tardy by less than five minutes, a few times to his class. He mentioned that if we are late a lot that he would drop us from the class. Never mind the good grades that I got an hard work that I put into it.",0
Not a good lecturer. All he does is assign youtube videos to watch at home and tests you on it. His classes consist of answering questions about the homework and correcting quiz questions you got wrong. Only reason I passed is because I took Calculus in High School. I chose to take 75B with him after 75A because there's very little work to do.,0
Gupta's idea of teaching is to read the textbook's provided slides while waving his hands around in front of the class as if the students have come in to class knowing the material. Anything that becomes difficult for him to describe is ultimately left out of the lecture. There is also no curve in the class.,0
"Dr. Hunt offers courses designed like graduate courses (to make you think), but his students increasingly do not rise to the challenge. Often those who criticize him are those averse to thinking. If you plan on going to graduate school, make sure to take Hunt's courses. If you are more concerned about your GPA than learning, avoid.",1
"You walk into class and he has the notes pre scribbled all over the 3 chalk boards. Good luck reading anything, a kid can write more legibly. Tends to talk about things that are not going to be on the test, but brushes over the stuff that is actually critical to the exam. Dont take him if you want a good grade.",0
"A brilliant teacher. She knows her subject and loves it too, which makes it fun. She is peppy and smart. All of you pinhead engineering, math and chemistry majors need your horizons broadened from the realm of worthless numbers and equations. Music and the arts are what make us human. To people who can't manage to stay awake, good luck with a job..",1
"Definitely learned a lot from him this semester. While I understand this is graduate level, he still should be willing to meet with people, which he is not. Kind of rude and arrogant. Very intelligent but extremely hard to get an A on his exams. & he is the Program Director. Avoid his classes! Luckily he only teaches Abnormal Psych & an elective.",1
"WORST PROFESSOR EVER. Francis was only with us for half a semester because he mysteriously left our class, now we have a different more understandable and interesting prof. He screwed up our whole timetable which had to be redone by our new prof. He was a extremely difficult marker and always came in 20 minutes late. A very irresponsible man.",0
Scary professor and certainly not my favorite. Design class was fairly simple but the labs take anywhere between 5 and 8 hours. No way anyones going to finish in 3 hours. Have to pay attention in class because you never know when hes going to call you out on something.,1
"He is a very ""pro"" and nice professor. He knows the material very well. But he is a little lacking on explanation. A few of the material he covered are a little unclear. May be I suck at it. His assignments are hard and it gets you to think. He really challenges you to think about CS deeply. His exams are pretty challenging.",1
Although I thought Dr. Hoffman was a nice and funny guy...he was just an absolutely TERRIBLE teacher...this class was just very very bad...and i would avoid it if possible...the homework took hours to complete...the tests were just impossible...the clicker questions were annoying...and the labs were boring...overall worst class ever...dont take it!,0
Best Prof. ever :),1
"Fantastic professor, really enjoyed showing up to lectures every day because he was very excited about what he had to say and his enthusiasm was very infectious. Felt that I became more interested in the subject following his class. Very heartfelt, personable guy.",1
"Professor Kotman's CIS 160 is a very easy class to pass, but you will learn little to nothing. His lectures are all over the place and usually don't pertain to the content that you are currently working on. But besides all of this, Professor Kotman himself is a very kind man who seems to be very invested in his field.",0
"Long, hard to understand readings. 2 exam essays along with a very unclear research essay and even more unclear public facing project. If you're a quiet student he will make you feel bad for not participating. Got graded down on my research paper for not including a section that was not a part of my topic. unclear grading.",0
"No point in attending his class. All the powerpoints are word from word from the book. He just rambles with no point to what he is saying.If you are interested in Psych, I don't suggest him, his teaching will kill your desire.",0
"I enjoyed this class! I have a lot of interest in environmental conservation, so maybe I am biased. This class was online. Her lectures were through VoiceThread. Very long and somewhat boring. She made the lectures the length the class was supposed to be (1hr 15min). And the lectures were necessary to watch. So they were dragged out, but doable.",1
"Great, funny, very helpful, the best teacher i ever had. He Makes the class fun. explains everything clearly and if you need help he is always there. 
 P.S he lets you lay on a bed of nails for fun. His test are alittle tough you have to put in sometime for his classes",1
Incredibly arrogant and disinterested in students. Encourages students to drop out and is punitive towards those who are dissatisfied.  Far too impressed with herself and her work.,0
Tough prof. Slightly less evil than Barby.,0
Tool,0
"I get pretty much nothing out of this class, except what's in the readings.  The books she chooses are boring and fairly irrelevant, and the class discussion seems wandering.",0
"amazing fun teacher. really tries o lift up the class. knows what she is doing and wants you to succeed. gives a ton of extra credit(there's literally a ton of ways you can get extra credit and make a good grade) but you do have to work hard for the grade and read the powerpoints, notes and the book",1
"you ""bet"" he was a stoner... as if there was a doubt about it... and as if he still isnt??  This guy is a loon, but an easy A. --  allowed me to spend plenty of time looking at the fine women that tended to take his classes instead of paying attention to him.",0
"I do not recommend anyone to take him. It is so incredibly difficult to understand him. I have to rewatch the lectures multiple times, and sometimes I still don't understand what he is talking about. If you actually want to learn something, stay away from this prof. I dread attending the lectures, it irritates me that I am unable to learn anything.",0
"He is a terrible professor. I would not recommend if youre looking to get a decent grade. I am an A/B student and ended with below a C. When I went to get helpful tips on how to improve, he told me to review my essay from the beginning of the semester on study tips. He is very passive aggressive and demeaning. Does not have students best interest.",0
"Professor Luckett is not a difficult instructor but you do have to read & complete all assignments to pass his class. He is very knowledgeable in the Social Work field. He expects the same dedication from his students. Discussions, quizzes, and an interview assignment was the semester. He was accessible and always prompt in replying to emails.",1
"Little to no help with assignments, no reply through e-mail, constantly arrives late, & blows off anyone with questions after class. I was lost from the beginning because the concept of law baffles me. He didn't make it any easier. Nice guy and all (and funny), but as a professor he's not getting  a high rating from me.",0
"He's a laid back professor. Especially with attendance. If you read the book, you don't have to show up to all of the classes. Some call him a hard grader, but he actually has his own grading scale that makes his tests easier to pass. Good with getting grades up quick. Occasionally his tests are hard. Don't expect his lectures to be interesting.",0
"MIGUEL IS THE BEST. Great lecturer, did not over-complicate any of the material and as long as you put in the effort the tests were very straight forward.   Such a shame he won't be at NYU anymore. Truly great professor.",1
Forgets what she puts on the syllabus so you have to remind her about dropping the lowest quiz and homework grade. quizzes easy 1 question  homework vital. takes off 5 points for not stapling. hard to understand. makes mistakes on grading constantly. 0-100 grade did not correlate to her final grade. BEWARE you need to work for her. textbook online.,0
"Not much of a personality in class.  Great workout, very intimidating professor...not too nice in class.",1
Terrible! won't help you. nasty to talk to. goes way too fast. assigns work before he has ever mentioned anything about how to do it or what it means but expects you to know how to do it. should no longer be employed. Wish I could give him a zero.,0
really funny...Has a strange obsession with cheese. Easy exams,1
"Hands down one of THE BEST professors at MSU. He has a skewed rating because he is teaching quite a hard class. I honestly loved him, and i know a lot of people who did bad in the class, but would have failed after a month if it weren't for him.",1
"I don't even have this guy as my professor but I hate him already from all the reviews I have been reading, I genuinely despise these kinds of people.",0
"Took this class online and was decent. Homework is time consuming and done on McGraw-Hill but helps you with the tests. Discussions are simple but was slightly confused with due dates. Overall, Professor Casada seems very laidback and easy going. Responds to emails quickly. As long as you pay attention to homework for tests, you should get an A.",1
"This was the worst class and worst teacher I had in 4 years at OSU. For a backcore class she expects way too much. She grades really harshly, isn't clear on expectations, and the workload is extreme. I wouldn't reccomend this teacher to anyone. She's not helpful when you have questions and is never in her office during office hours.",0
"Prof. Ozment's class involves a lot of work, but she grades everything easily.  Her tests can be long and tedious, especially her final, but they are fairly easy if the student studies for a sufficient period of time.",1
"THE MAN! He's so super nice, and although the subject is itself confusion, past his accent he is very good at explaining things. Have to do the work but he's much easier that other physics professors. Nicest guy in the world and if you want to learn he wants to help. He doesn't like people just wanting the answers though.",1
Really nice guy.  Fair tests.  Cares about his students.,1
"The class was Fields (a branch of abstract algebra).  The content of the course is difficult but Dr. Yanik chose a good textbook and was willing to explain concepts over and over again.  There is a lot of homework but the exams are straightforward (if a tad long).  After struggling at the beginning, I scored an A on the final exam!",1
If you want to experience a condescending instructor who believes that the only way to test students is via hard essays this man is for you.  If you just want to learn and have a good experience avoid him like the plague.  If you take him dont ever miss class or he will fail you for not coming to hear his sermon.,0
"Ron doesnt help any students.  He is unclear and assigns so much reading and homework I didnt even have time to do work for other classes.  When i asked him how i could raise my grade he said it was ""very unlikely"" that i would do well.2 thumbs",0
Best science professor I've ever had at Carleton.,1
"Do whatever you can to avoid taking this class with Professor Nizielski. He is by far the worst prof I have ever had at GV. He does not respect his students and he thinks he is the only one who knows the info. His exams are SO impossible, so get ready for some bad grades! He goes off topic, and his lectures are so detailed that it is overwhelming.",0
Smokes like Cheech!  PICKS FAVORITIES AND SNUBS OTHERS,0
Took her for my 1st and 2nd econ class online. She responds to emails quickly and always answered all my questions. As long as you do your work you will like her. If you turn in late assignments or try to skim by without doing any work she is NOT the teacher for you. You will learn in her class :),1
"Its not a blow off class, you have to do the reading and take the projects seriously to get an A. If you do you will have a great experience. I learned a lot and she just wrote recommendation letters for me even though it has been years since I took her class.",1
"Frank is the bomb dot com. His lectures are rough, and exams are definitely tough, but his class is one of the most inspirational.",1
"Hes a good teacher and doesnt ever spend time on what you need to know. However, I occasionally find him to be a bit stu",1
"Gordon did a poor job of switching to online class in the spring of 2020. He changed the grading scheme from being curved to not being curved at the very end of the semester, which was extremely unfair to students.",0
"Mays is very quirky but its obvious she cares about her students and understands that not everyone is a math whiz. As long as you do the homework you should be set for the test. Attendance is judged based on group ""quizzes"" or worksheets done in class and she only counts the 1st 12. BUT, lecture is important to pass the class.",1
Took his class after reading the reviews. Best professor ever. MAT is a hard subject for me to understand and somehow he made it easy to understand. Plus he is funny.,1
"Went into the semester looking forward to having her as I've heard she was a great teacher. All she did for our class was powerpoint after powerpoint (and they are not posted online). She is very passive aggressive, and got angry when students would take notes on their laptops. Won't take another class from her.",0
"Dr. Hartman is an amazing teacher, intellectual, and person.  He is the best professor I had in my five years of college.  Do NOT pass him up.",1
Needs everything to be very specific. do not be general ever!,1
"This professor is horrible. Does not make time for students, has no grading criteria, rather just reads your hard work and give you a random grade based upon her mood at the moment",0
This guy is a freaking joke.  I'm am astounded as to how he hasn't been let go. His packets and handouts are extremely hard to follow. His lectures make zero sense and he can barely speak in a coherent sentence.  Grades tough. Good luck understanding his annotations because his handwriting is impossible to read.  DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS!,0
Intelligent but an ineffective communicator. Lecture materials are outdated and wrong. The free-PDF text is worthless. Impossible to see during office hours because all of his students are there. Use the practice exams he posts but know that the answer key is always wrong. Make friends with your lab TA and pray that your lab grade will save you.,0
"He's not great at lecturing. He has clicker questions, so attendance is mandatory. His tests are taken from the examples in the book, just with different numbers. If you get the right idea in tests, but the wrong numbers he'll give you most of the credit. Tests are typically 3-5 problems with about 3 parts to each. There's also homework on Pearson.",0
"I've taken 2 online courses with this professor so far, and it feels like a burden has been lifted off my shoulders, and in addition, I learn so much more than what I already know or more. No joke, no BS, just do what he assigns, even if it's alittle late and you'll pass with flying colors.",1
"The nicest I can say about this guy is he is a condescending professor who is grumpy 247 and has a stick up his rear, easy tests that are straight test bank but over all just a pain to work with, he will test your patience to no end. That is all ",0
Terrible Doesn't know anything about the software,0
"Rhoads is a really nice guy. His lectures can be very boring at times, but the material in the course was interesting. We had two exams, the midterm and final, and both were online. Most of the grade is dependent on the final project, but he gives you all semester to work on it.",1
"Professor Simons is a wonderful professor, and I appreciate his competence as a professor. He teaches visually, using the whiteboards to illustrate his examples rather than sticking to a powerpoint. He is always willing to clarify and or reexamine examples he made. Assignments are two projects at the start and end of semester and three exams.",1
Probably my favorite teacher here at GU so far. I have him for a FYS that is no longer being taught but I would definitely take him again for another class if I was given the chance. HIGHLY recommend!!!!!,1
Really mean,0
If you like being stressed out and failing classes because of a single pass or fail exam then she's the right prof for you.,0
"Mrs. Langill is the WORST teacher ever. She is completely unorganized, she will tell you to study one thing and then test you on another, she doesn't provide any help to you, you either get it or you don't.The material is hard enough, and she is completely useless as a teacher",0
"she is tough but if i can pass anyone can. she makes u repeativally correct ur work. but it helps ur grade. essays are to be redrafted over 3 times. she is tough but at least some of the info stuck in there. SHE PREPARES U FOR THE TOUGH TEACHERS, GREAT SO BE READY",1
Shang is bad,0
"There is a good amount of homework, although if you read up you'll be fine. She doesn't teach much in class, mostly YouTube videos and she jumps from slide to slide without explaining how they relate to another. TESTS are ridiculously hard and confusing. Half of the content has never been gone over or even mensioned. You're in for a ride.",0
save your gpa and don't take her class. trust me,0
She can be confusing. First few weeks I had no idea what was going on. I know some people who dropped CSC altogether because they just didn't get her and some changed professors. Although I hear she is open to help.,0
This class was so much fun. Definitely try to take it if you are interested in films. Professor Engle is really enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the subject matter. The exams were fairly easy and he gives you study guides that tell you exactly what will be on the exams. His lectures were always entertaining.,1
Hard tests for sure,1
"I think Doug is a great lecturer and learned a lot from ART 208. But, he had his TAs doing all the prep work, grading, etc. I had him for another smaller class. It wasn't good. His syllabus was unclear and the course unfocused. We had no real idea what he wanted us to do, nor did he.",0
"A lot of extra online videos, but they are funny and you learn a lot. His classes are fun, if you pay attention. He makes it easy to learn, but he has very little patients for those who don't even try to learn. You will learn and really enjoy this class with just a little effort. Come expecting to just be given a good grade and you will fail.",1
"I've taught this stuff for decades and Jerry explained it better, and way, way faster, than I ever have. Inspirational.",1
"His main interest lies in Music and art, so if you are a music major or an artist you will do fine. All his readings involve some form of music such as jazz or art (cubism). He is very condescending. Very unhelpful and condescending during office hours. He put me down a lot instead of helping me. Marks hard. I don't like him. Has attitude problem",0
There's a big project that was interesting but Jerry is an awesome guy who really cares about social work and his students. I would 100% take him again and probably will. Lectures are a bit boring but I can't complain!,1
"Test are difficult, sometime quite different from homeowrk.",0
"Easy online class as long as you read the online textbook. Lots of points available through the online text to help boost your grade. Offers two chances at online exams with lockdown browser, and there is no final exam! Don't even need to view the powerpoints, just read the text. Weekly discussion board, and a couple of writing assignments.",1
"He is a terrible professor. He flies through the material. His book & teaching style is different from every other math professor. Which confuses tutors when they try to help you. By the end of year, he gives up on his students. He also has terrible office hours. I dont recommend him at all.",0
I loved Dr. Smith for ED280! Her lectures were mainly relating to the book with her own connections in them. She is very homework heavy so plan accordingly. The environment for her class was very helpful because it made me want to come to class. You do have to come for class because she hands out exit slips. She is very passionate and I loved her!,1
"This professor will not give you the grade you deserve; plan on spending massive amounts of time on assignments of which she will nitpick over very minor issues. She will make it close to near impossible for an A, even if you put in the work which is very frustrating. Though, I will say she is a nice woman and genuinely cares about her job.",0
"He is really quirky and energetic. Sometimes he can be a grouch, but he's really generous when you ask for help and is a fair grader. He's a little scatter brained but he's smart and knows a ton of cool stuff. Class is discussion oriented, homework is light.",1
"One of the BEST profs at ConU. The course is easy, but what makes him great is how he tests our knowledge. His exams consist of 5 questions (200-500 words/answer), that allow students to explain what they know about the concept & list relevant examples. This is a much more effective way to test learning than those standard multiple-choice tests.",1
Great professor. Very intelligent and easy to understand. The best advice is to READ THE BOOK!! All of her tests come straight out of the book and not from lecture. Tests are very difficult but the class is fun overall.,1
"Andrew is a great experience. He will challenge you. He wants you to question ideas and think critically. Some people will feel attacked, its not what it is. I have done a lot of college and had many legit bad professors, not this guy. This is not a class for the lazy, its intellectually stimulating.",1
"I'm about to be finished with this class and dreaded every minute of it. Every other word he says is ""Um"". The course work is extensive and the best part about it is HE DOESN'T GRADE IT! Honestly, there's a week of class left and less than half of the insane amount of work we did is graded. The grades he does give are so random as well. Have fun.",0
I had professor Rogers for Real Analysis years ago and looked him up here just to rate him.  He is hands down the BEST math teacher at SUNY Fredonia & about the only one who is a sort of a normal person.Most other math professors there are social misfits who take out their dysfunction on students.Dr Rogers is one of the best teachers I've ever had.,1
Prof Tefera is the hardest professor I have ever had. He expects that you undersand something after the first time he explains it. His exams are exactly like the practice exams but he marks you down any chance he gets. He is very hard to understand and goes way too fast. Expect to put in A LOT of extra work outside of class just to get a C.,0
"Great conductor and teacher, expects alot from you!",1
"She isn't a tough grader but she's very politically correct. Often brings up discussions about race, discrimination, and the like which can sometimes make you uncomfortable. She's a decent professor overall.",0
Worst teacher I have EVER taken. Test have nothing to do with what you study. If you think you can study homework and pass a test you a mistaken. Any test is completely different from any hw you will be doing . He never uses canvas . Don't I repeat DO NOT take this horrible teacher.,0
"This class sucks, so much busy work it really is ridiculous. He punishes you for taking the class online by assigning needless papers!",0
"Professor Legg is the best professor I have had in college. I learned more through his lectures than I ever have in a history course and found myself very interested in the material he was teaching. It is important to write down everything he says during lecture. Participation is not mandatory, however, it makes the class far more beneficial.",1
DO NOT TAKE PSYCH 1000 UNLESS YOU NEED IT FOR YOUR MAJOR. This class is so all over the place it is almost impossible to follow. 3 tests- ALL IMPOSSIBLE even if you study like crazy Lecture heavy & reading heavy - if you don't do both you definitely will not pass. Forgie was very condescending.,0
Dr Liu is very passionate and I really believe he wants you to succeed. Although he has a very thick accent which makes his lectures hard to understand. Without his powerpoints I wouldn't have been able to pass the class. Be sure to read the textbook because his exams are extremely difficult with both multiple choice and short answer questions.,1
Great Teacher and Gives as much Help as you need. Papers are pretty easy. You hand in 3 papers at the end of the semester that makes up 90% of the grade but he gives lots of reviews on your paper before they are graded.,1
"He rambles a lot which made going to class pointless. No practice exams and expects us to follow from his printed handouts (were not that helpful). His 1st midterm was difficult and long (avg was 30%) , the 2nd was more reasonable. Final was extremely hard. Pretty much had to self-study from the book. I regret dropping this class when I could.  ",0
"I've had Hickerson for four of my PR classes and can honestly say that he is awesome. He's not easy, but you'll learn than you'd expect and will leave the class glad that you took him. He's very understanding and teaches from a practical viewpoint which is very helpful. If you have the opportunity to take him- do it. You won't regret it.",1
"She will grade you down even through you have included everything she asks for--she will simply say she wants 'more' without explaining what that is?  Loves to hear herself talk, and is unrealistic in her expectations.  DO NOT TAKE HER! SHE will screw your GPA--for real!",0
just don't,0
"Super boring lectures and very unclear assignment criteria. Even when he hands assignments back you cannot read any of his corrections because his handwriting is horrendous. But if you dare ask him to decode it he will talk to you for 15 minutes about completely irrelevant information. Very, very boring class but not too hard as far as grading. ",0
"very anal and self-centered, easy but will die from boredom first, have to go to class to do well",0
"This Professor was a great professor. There is quite a bit of homework, but I believe it definitely helped. Also when doing the homework, if you show work, he will give you the points regardless of the answer. With online homework, there were countless times where he would extend the homework because students didn't do it. Also he is very outgoing.",1
"Only he knows how he grades. The rest of the students have no idea. I was expecting a B, and he gave me a C. With no explanations, he decided to leave on a sabbatical leaving all students stranded. ",0
"Her class was awful. Tests are not the problem- they're long but fair. The problem is her complete unwillingness to teach in class. We are expected to do all of the learning from the textbook on our own, and class time is spent only going over examples have and talking about our weekends. We were also at least a chapter behind all semester.",0
"This professor is extremely nit picky, and he was not satisfied with any of the projects in the entire class.  Told me that my project should not have been so comprehensive. I had worked the hardest in this course.  Avoid, unless you want to lose your head trying to make sense out of his unfair grading, and illogical reasoning for that.",0
"Had her for online Sociology 101 and it was by far the easiest class I have taken at MCC. She is very helpful and clear about what she expects with each paper. Every week you have an essay (500 words) due, you have to respond to at least one other person's essay on blackboard and you take a test (16 questions) on the chapter. I recommend her class!",1
"Dr. B was an amazing professor. She showed she really cared about her students and took time to explain everything. She gave us exam reviews that were really helpful. We had a lot of homework each week, but totally manageable and we were given loads of extra credit just for going to help sessions with our TA's which got our homework done quicker.",1
"HARDEST 100 LEVEL COURSE  HE EXPECTS WAY TOO MUCH FOR EACH EXAM; THEY ARE ALL CUMULATIVE, CONSIST OF EVERY KIND OF QUESTION.. SHORT ANSWER, FILL IN THE BLANK (NO WORD BANK) , MULTIPLE CHOICE, TRUE FALSE QUESTIONS SOMETIMES DONT EVEN MAKE SENSE  ALL MEMORIZATION  I DONT EVEN THINK HE  WOULD PASS HIS OWN EXAMS  FINAL IS THE SAME FORMAT ",0
"Whoever said his accent was difficult to understand has him confused with someone else. You'll love him. He's very loud, friendly, and funny, and he'll learn your name very quickly. He kinda speaks in hashtags, it's funny. Also a brilliant organist. Makes everything super easy to understand/remember. Do whatever you have to do to take his class.",1
amazing professor! his lectures are extremely easy to follow and he shows funny videos in class! he's also extremely approachable and answers emails quickly.,1
"Horrible teacher! If you can take someone else, do it. I put a lot of time into this class and got no rewards for my efforts. Absolutely pathetic prof!",0
"He's a good teacher and knows what he is talking about. However, he has many mistakes in his exams which is very frustrating. Also, he takes a week to answer emails. All of his exams are multiple choice. His final exam was extremely difficult and hardly covered any material learned in class. Would not recommend him.",1
"This man knows absolutely nothing about Muslim Fundamentalism. However, that does not stop him from giving his ""expsert"" opinion every time he can ""grandstand"". Stay away!",0
She does not post any PowerPoints or lecture recordings. She has tests and quizzes weekly. The due date for the tests and quizzes are random and she never post them the same day of the week. They are also not open for the same time. She sent an email saying the exam was going to be due on Wednesday and closed it early. She does not respond to email,0
"One of the best French teachers I've ever had...she's clear, fun, and she genuinely wants you to learn French.  Take her class...you won'w regret it.",1
"I struggled after the class went online mid semester because of relocating and not having reliable internet access. Dr. Gaby was very helpful understanding and flexible. He was patient with my internet limitations and I was able to at least pass the class. Thanks, highly recommend.",1
pretty cool teacher... not too bad...  he gives you a test review and he pretty much takes questions from the review.  so memorize the review and your set.   but lab... you stay till 6pm doing a lab with him on the final week  and the day after he turns around on you backstabs you and doesnt check it off for you....,0
"great guy, tough tests and exams. i pissed him off lol :p , not fun.",1
So calc is hard anyways but if you do his practice exams they are really similar. I went to his office hours and he sat down with me until I got it. Pretty curved grading scale and drops two worst quizzes. If you go to class and pay attention you should be fine. He has an accident but it's not hard to understand.,1
"Prof. Hines is a nice guy. His class is extremely difficult. Doesn't use power points, he talks the entire time. Can be very difficult for students that aren't accustomed to this teaching style. Talks very fast, which can be difficult to write notes. He speaks to the class as medical students, which we aren't. Wouldn't recommend.",0
"Took him for FALL2020 online, there's a quiz after every chapter (8) and a final concert report. Activities are done through a required online program which is also the book, some writing assignments, nothing is difficult, the book has all the answers you need, just read through. His work is organized and can be found in your canvas calendar.",1
Gordon was a great prof with great lecture material. He prepared you very well for his exams as he provides old exams to study from. I am not an economics person so I found the course material difficult but it would have been much harder to get through without Gordons help. He is helpful in explaining questions during office hours as well.,1
Dr. Brown is a fantastic professor. I had him for 2 classes this semester and it was great. Definitely need to attend classes as the textbooks aren't used. He's very clear and concise with good examples and he keeps it a fun class! Definitely recommend him :),1
"Dr. Cheers is one of the most difficult prof. i've had to deal with. He's rude and there are days where you want to punch him in the face. But know this, he was the only prof. that made me reevaluate my decision to be a journalist. He made me see you have to find your motivation yourself. I'd recommend this class for those who need a reality check.",0
"Dr. Prior was one of my favorite professor that I have had at Liberty. She is engaging and very sarcastic which I love. She  gives detailed notes. I did not think she was difficult - I got an A in her class. Yes you have to try, but we are in college. I hope to take her again!",1
Seriously AVOID at all costs. She loves to see her students fail and is not good at teaching in order to prepare you for her ridiculous exams. Almost dropped out of the business school because of her.,0
"When a professor walks in with no notes, no computers, no textbooks or what-so-ever, you know it will be a great professor",1
"If you have any aptitude for mathematics or physics, this class will not be difficult. Lectures go at a snail's pace. I did not show up the last month of lecture and still received an A in the course. When he lectures, he confuses more than he helps. Great sense of humor; nice guy  overall. Take Estrada if you already know Physics, not to learn!",0
"Easy online course, answered all my emails, very glad I took this class online vs in the classroom.",1
"Ehh.. how should I say this. Weird teacher... She is a joke, too easy for teaching a science course and she is not that good at teaching. She writes almost the same examples on the board 24/7 and asks you to solve. She doesn't really care if you get the materials or not while she sounds like she cares... Oh well.. take her for a mickey mouse class.",0
Dr. Barton is such a sweet lady. Her notes are hand-drawn figures - really cute little diagrams. Lectures are pretty boring but her notes are good and she explains things well. I found her exam questions really easy.,1
Will destroy your grade if your ideas don't align with his regarding your essay.,0
"Incredible teacher.  Not easy, but they don't pay him to be easy.  He makes sure you really learn.  He will go above and beyond the call for his students and maybe even invite you over for dinner.",1
"Patti is one of my favorite teachers here. She's kind, helpful and very understanding. It's so easy to talk to her and I have had no problem asking for extensions on assignments. I would definitely take one of her classes again and recommend you take her class.",1
He says it like it is. He provides interesting lectures. All you have to do is raise your hand at least once a class and you will get an A.,1
"I didn't really like him as a person, but respect him as an instructor. He is very passionate about teaching and actually gives good lecture. However, I find his lecture notes somewhat vague and it makes assignments really challenging and takes very long time to complete. So, I highly suggest that you go to his office hour for questions",1
Awesome teacher!!!!!!,1
Made my programming learning much easier. Will take him again in later semesters.,1
He was very passionate about what he teaches and knows how to keep it interesting. He focused more on the important concepts of history and not specifics which really made the class a lot more enjoyable ,1
Literally helps you out with everything! He's super nice and always there for you to help you with the projects if you can't seem to get it right. Just make sure you show up and do your work cause you don't want to be behind with the projects!! Would definitely take him again!!,1
He's a really chill professor who wants to see everyone do well. Definitely make sure you go to class and try to participate!,1
"Dr. Crockett is a phenomenal teacher who challenges his students to do more than simply memorize. If you take this class seriously, you will emerge prepared to intelligently discuss American politics and critique a sometimes convoluted system that so many people today do not understand.",1
"Even if you're not interested in taking this class, you'll end up liking it; which was my case. As long as you do the papers on time, participate & show-up, you have an A guaranteed. He's very polite, calm and professional. You're able to take really good notes from him-enough to pass almost the entire class! Highly recommend him! Nice guy too.",1
"Only showed up to class to sign attendance sheet (gives you some attendance credit) and would leave. His lectures are useless. I learned the material by myself. Do the homework and study it. Quizzes once a week entail 1 of the homework problems from that week. Great TA, otherwise I don't know what I would've done. He is NOT good at teaching.",0
"Charles ""Chuck"" Warner is a communications god!!! Ive taken at least 7 classes with him in my tenure here at ESU and each was extremely enjoyable. He actually makes people care about the things hes trying to get across and truly believes that there are no such things as stupid questions...I know i asked a bunch!!",1
"This man is an awesome lecturer. Comes to class experienced and prepared. His exams are relatively difficult, but he gives students options on how difficult it will be based on how much information about it he will give. Ultimately, the final paper is the most difficult. He looks through it thoroughly. Make sure you take it very seriously.",1
"There is a lot of reading and not a lot of time to do it in, but that's really the hardest part. He points out all potential test questions during lectures. Partial credit on exams, and I don't know anyone who got less than an A on their final papers... and trust me, those were not all 'A' papers. ",1
"do NOT take ANY of this man's classes!!! he is SO hard!!! the tests are impossible, he doesnt fully go over all of the material, and then goes on to test you about it. he is a nice person, im sure, and very smart...but DOES NOT, i repeat DOES NO belong teaching in a classroom!! just turn around and run if you value your gpa.",0
"class time was COMPLETELY useless.  his lectures are completely what he thinks about the text and doesn't really entertain alternative ideas.  He pushes back deadlines very willingly, but gives no topics for essays and grades them really hard.",0
Very interesting class. I learned a lot. 5 mandatory papers have to be done. Not too hard. Test are very very hard! Extra credit helps a lot! Go to class and get the extra credit!!,1
Falk makes his class unnecessarily difficult. He gives homework on topics that haven't even been mentioned in class until after the homework is due and these topics are not in the textbook he recommended. He runs the class like a graduate class and will spend all your time on his class. He is very understanding about life circumstances though.,0
I personally work very hard academically but have never never been very comfortable with math skills. I worked extremely hard in this course inly to  play catch up. Mainly because her lectures are next to impossible to learn from and the textbook wasnt much better. She grades with extreme scrutiny not just your answer but all of your work.,0
"Horrible studio teacher.  You will get pegged by candy from across the room, he will destroy your models, and he will constantly be giving all of the cute girls in your class all of the attention.  Do not plan to gain much from his studio.",0
"I was skeptical about Sledge, but I totally ended up loving her. She's different, and she's REALLY into her material, but if you read your assigned stuff and show up ready to talk about it she won't go too hard on you. The people posting rude things are probably can't handle actually learning something in class. She's weird, but I enjoyed her a lot",1
He is simply the GOAT of Chemistry!,1
"Don't take this class, especially online. Can't learn anything, I've gone to the resource center and still get none of it. I've spent at least 50 hours on homework and have spent more than that trying to learn the material with no success. Homework only accounts for 25 percent of grades rest are on his impossible tests.",0
The best professor at ACC.  Has an amazing ability to explain complicated stuff in a way that makes it fun to learn.,1
"Mrs. Rogers' class has a really poor implementation for online class (COVID-19), and because of this, I would never recommend anytime take this class until changes are made. All her class is, is watching her lectures that she recorded in 2016, 2 times a week. Each video is an hour and fifteen minutes, with poor audio that makes learning difficult",0
"Don't be scared by pervious reviews of this professor. She was also readily available to help, quickly answered emails and quickly graded assignments. She gave clear instructions on what she was looking for and truly wants to see students succeed. She can give intense feedback during presentations, but it is only to help you achieve a better grade!",1
"She really is not that great of a professor, some of her email responses to you can harsh and really does nothing to assist you on passing. Worst teacher ever!!",0
Lectures are not useful for social work practice.,0
when students were dealing with bad wifi or other issues she would laugh in disbelief and thought it was convenient but when she would have technical difficulties it was all okay.. How is she a dean if she doesn't empathize and holds you accountable for problems out of your control?.. I would not take one of her classes again,0
ah he is so boring.,0
"Dear Black Students, DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. Unless you want to sit in a 3 hr night class and listen to your classmates demean us. If you can handle that then its a super easy A. But if youd like to keep your peace of mind. STEER CLEAR. Discusses black topics. Without the discussion. Great for your gpa, horrible for your mental stability.",0
"She is a wonderful teacher who is a tough grader and makes you work for your grade, but all around I loved her class. She posts notes online and definitely works with you if there was a personal problem and could not attend class.",1
"He is on ANOTHER LEVEL, an enlightened way of thinking (big picture). Has his own way of teaching, but his exact words REALLY make sense. LISTEN to him! Some will be lucky enough to get a copy of the Bush Bible, but it's easy enough to make your own. When he provides you formulas that look like math equations MEMORIZE THEM. Case law won't help.",1
"Horrible teacher, the man has delusions of marxism and will insult you at least once if you dont agree with him. For those who said he opens you mind Savellos is 10x better for philosophy.",0
"Most confusing class. Randomly starts speaking Chinese or Japanese. . If you don't know any of those languages and you don't know anything about Chinese or Japanese culture and history already do not take this class. Since its a first year course I thought it would be a bit basic. No, its not. The amount of reading given is insane in online class.",0
Prof. Anstee never prepared for lectures. Messy lectures. He just randomly picked up things here and there. Quiz and tests are quite easy. No need to go to class cause it doesn't help.,0
This was the worst class I have ever taken at GVSU. She was rude and hard to understand.If you said something she disagreed with she hated you and ostracized you as a student.They really need to do something with her. The whole class complained how she made no sense.,0
"She loves class participation which really slows the class down. She provides practice questions, but provides mystical answers. The midterms only contain application questions that she doesn't prep you for in class.",0
"Personally I think he was a great teacher, and I enjoyed most of his jokes, though some students in my class did not. He gives you everything you need to know for the test and Quia is really important for your grade. He's definitely passionate about Spanish which helps you learn more. I recommend him over other teachers I've had here.",1
"Good teacher enjoyed his class! even though I barely went managed to skeet off with an A. Assignments consisted of paper, midterm, final, oral presentation(no ppt needed) which was easy you just talk about fun facts on your country.",1
"She is one of the best prof at FIU. They should really hire more professionals like her. She knows the material and likes to answer questions. The class was really interesting. 3 exams, which are not that hard, you get a review for it. There are 4 group assignments, if you have a good group, you should do well. Attendance is mandatory",1
Schramm was a bottom of the barrel prof. Her lectures were pointless as we had to read about the lecture material before the lecture. Each lecture was spent going through code at a snails pace with little to no engagement apart from the stretch break that happened every class. Reading quizzes had numerous mistakes. Avoid her if you can.,0
"It is a pretty easy class. You don't really have to go to class to do well. All of the tests are online and if you just read the textbook, you will do fine. You have very few assignments, but they are super easy. Her lectures can be boring, but she is really passionate about what she is teaching.",1
"I found him too easy. For his tests, he provided a study guide and announced that ""every question on the test is on the study guide"". He also allowed us to bring a 8.5x11 cheat sheet to each test. Consequently, I simply wrote each study guide question that I didn't know on the cheat sheet and thus rocked every test.",0
"Nice class, lots of interesting logics and applications.  She's friendly and teaches well most of the time.  Open-ended term project where you can explore whatever topic in-depth you like.  Bonus points available on homework, doing optional presentations, and even for just showing up to presentations!  For a graduate course, it was pretty relaxing!",1
"Ih, what can I say. The class I guess you can call it straight forward. He always reads his notes in a very quirky way. He does like to play with his vocal strings. map quiz is pretty easy if you are good with memorization. The term paper is pretty iffy, but nothing bad. His midterm/final tho is most likely going to destroy you. Not an easy B even",0
"Hes an awesome teacher! My favorite one here at FSU! Hes easy to talk too, gives good feed back. Makes learning about physics, fun! Its a hard class but he makes bearable with all of the real demonstrations! labs are always fun as well.",1
"He prerecords his lectures and they honestly do not help at all. In class iClicker questions are useless, and homework and quizzes are nothing like his exams. I failed all of my exams, but somehow still passed the course. I genuinely thought I would have to retake this course, which heightened my depression.",0
"Dr. Collins was great! I had her for PSYC 301. I'm by no means a ""math person,"" but she helped me to make sense of statistics. The multiple choice sections of her tests can be difficult, but if you study your notes, review your homework assignments, and occasionally read from the textbook, you should be fine!",1
"One of the most difficult professors to understand, does not go over anything that is expected. I highly recommend taking any class instead of his!!",0
"Garyen is very sweet and hilarious in class although he is completely different online. Took both 1190 and 1191 with him, and his exams are fine but the quizzes are horrendous. In class as well as online, his quizzes are very challenging and if it weren't for them, my grades would be much better.",1
"One of the most intelligent professors I've ever had, however, I would not recommend taking him. He plays favorites and if you are not one of them, expect a final grade that doesn't  match your work. Does not offer any help and expects you to accept his interpretations as truth- anything else is incorrect. Don't take him if you can help it.",0
Take him as a last resort.  He wrote the book if that tells you anything.  His lectures are boring and the homework load is sometimes crazy.  The guy could make a paper mill a fortune with all the homework and handouts.  Only the gifted math majors should take him.  He does tend to have favorites.,0
Insanely boring lectures. Literally reads the notes he posts aloud to you. He conveys no passion for the subject whatsoever. Worst computer science class I have taken.,0
"This class was and is an great option for anyone who needs a history credit. The readings and videos are informative and easy to keep up with unlike many boring options we could read and watched. The quizzes were very easy for you read the material, I would just make sure you read every question carefully as the wording can be easy to mix up.",1
"Nice man with an interesting career, but that alone does not make this class worth your time. Unfair grading scale, off topic ramblings every lecture, and the exams and work are a little overboard for a class at this level. Learn from my mistake and save yourself the trouble, AVOID THIS CLASS.",0
"Lectures were very boring but he was super nice and caring. 3 tests and 1 final, average difficulty so you'll have no problems if you do the practice questions and pay attention in class/read the course pack, no surprises on the tests at all. I wouldn't take again only because I hated logic but great prof!",1
"Nice guy. Hard tests, should be able to do well if you go over the book and supplement it with the things he goes over. Lectures are not very interesting. You will have to put in work to do well on tests. Homework might be just busy work, but some problems will be on test. Tests have only around 8 questions, know your stuff.",1
"If you are a student who expects him to teach you step-by-step on AP, he is not for you. You are expected to read and understand all BASICs and he emphasized hard on the chemistry behind AP. I enjoyed his class a lot but not so much on the exam questions. However, he curved generously!",1
"The professor is very compassionate and resourceful. If you're stuck on an assignment, he provides a lot of good feedback and is willing to devote his time to assist his students. There are 5 quizzes, a midterm, and a final exam.",1
"Hilmar is an excellent professor. Yes, the way he grades is tough but he spells out his expectations very early in the course so there are no surprises. He also does not give final exams and his tests are not cumulative, so that means less work!",1
Be prepared to teach yourself. Lecture slides and assignments were taken directly from the University of New Mexico's CS department. Assignments were not discussed in class. TAs did not understand them well enough to know how to help.,0
"Lectures were outrageously boring. I was genuinely interested in the material, but listening to him read a power point to us in monotone for 50 mins strait felt like  torture.  Nonetheless, the exams were easy because he gives u the topics b4 hand so u just need 2 do a little research the night b4 and you'll be fine, even if you didn't attend much.",0
I admit I hate English classes and especially poetry and if you are like me DO NOT take this class! Thompson is entertaining and a really cool guy but he is the Michael Jordan of poetry and takes it so seriously that he can't help but make the class WAY harder than a 200 level course should be. I repeat...DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU HATE LIT.,1
hard grader with a thick accent. pretty much your standard rbs professor.,0
"Great and wonderful! Tells it like it is, whether you want to hear it or not! Love her!!",1
"Dr. Smemoe is literally my favorite professor at BYU. Her classes are always super interesting, and she uses fun examples that are actually relevant to her student's lives. She's also the most caring professor I've ever had. She cares about her student's mental health and constantly addresses it. Seriously take her classes!!!",1
"His class is not easy, but hes a good guy and cares a lot. Show up and study and youll do well.",1
"Good lawrd. This professor has NEVER worked in real life, his ideas are all theoretical with little to NO real-life experiences. To which he cannot relate to AT ALL. His examples are often of Indian Business Strategies, and is completely nonsensical. He spends have the class just trying to figure out how to use the projectors, AVOID.",0
"I love Dr. Shiba as a person, but I can't stand her as a prof.  She is disorganized to the extreme, and it's extremely frustrating.  I won't take another course with her if I can help it.",0
He got carried away talking about Mullis so many times.  Nice guy though.,1
When you dont want to leave class because he makes Thermo so interesting thats the sign of a great professor. If you do the homework and study you will do great. He goes over examples and makes the subject come alive. He is by far the best Professor I have had so far! ,1
"Business communications was an easy class and a waste of time. Mrs. Bowlin is a wonderful person, but it honestly doesn't take much to pass her class. Just do the stinkin assignments!",1
"Not many study materials are provided, so you really have to do the reading and know your stuff. The tests are 15 multiple choice, 10 T/F and 2 essay. He gives you four essay questions  a week in advance and he'll pick two that are on the test. Lectures are boring but important to attend! Only things in the grade book are the four unit exams.",0
i loved him! he does assign a lot of homework but he opens up the modules at the end of the semester so you can make up any that you missed. we had no exams in his class and the labs were super easy. all you have to do is just watch the short videos under the modules and look at the powerpoint and you'll be good! such a good teacher!!,1
He knows his stuff... but not there for his students. Very distant professor and not very approachable. VERY harsh grader. Do not take if you are not an English major!,0
Don't take this class from him. You will have a very hard time understanding him. He doesn't explain good to questions. We doesn't review the examples on the book and most of his reviews for the test didn't help me it all. He does have a heavy accent. I'm not racist but he needs to improve his teaching skills.,0
"I had her for Harlem in Vogue. I was so excited to take this class, but she ruined it for everyone. It was really sad.",0
"Unethical!  Lowered my grade when I challenged him about it!  Rude, condescending, arrogant and I could go on.  Don't take his class.  I did not feel comfortable in his class as he liked to berate many students.  You won't learn much and you will dread going to class.  UD needs to investigate this one.",0
"Amazing prof, he knows the material quite well. His tests are fair & he also gives you old versions of it. His lectures tend to be kind of boring but he is a very nice guy and helpful during office hours. The course is quite heavy on proofs and is a continuation of 110.  He tends to not make eye contact when he is not talking to you.",1
"Goose, are you adding all theese entries for your self :-)",1
"Andronis is a pretty smart guy and has had quite a bit of experience. He is really unorganized and doesn't update his syllabus. Make sure to ask him about everything listed on it. If not you may end up finding out that a have a ten page paper to write the day before it is due. Pretty funny, but some references are obscure. Likes to repeat himself.",0
Great person. VERY knowledgeable on the subject matter. she gets a lot of negative feedback but a lot of it is just due to the fact that she tends to teach classes that are just a lot to understand anyway. holds office hours often and is very generous when it comes to getting points back on assignments when you go talk to her.,1
Wouldn't take him again he was a much harder grader than other lab professors I've had before. Take a diff lab instructor if you can.,0
"Some students in this class who had an inorganic text book and got A's on the first test while others who tried to use Google, etc got D's or F's.  Get Meissler & Tarrr 3rd edition or later to pass the first test.  Not sure why Doc didn't tell us all to get this...  This class was really interesting.  Do not miss class to get the most out of it.",1
She's the reason I decided to drop my psych minor. prior to her class psych classes where the least stressful because professors were always too nice and had their students wellbeing in mind but this professor was so not understanding even in the middle of a pandemic. how did this class stress me out more than a calc 2 class.,0
"she is absolutly wonderful, fun, and there is no way you can get below an A. i recomond her for any class she ever teachs!",1
"LDL is a real gem for all SASAH students. He genuinely cares for teaching each one of his students and is the most down-to-earth guy. Get used to long lectures and LOTS of reading, but also enjoy the many interesting stories that LDL tangents on in class and share them over and over again with your friends with all your friends.",1
"Aight so Idk if other bio curriculum has the poster project, but it was pretty time consuming especially near the end of the semester with other finals. There are 3 exams, 1 final. There should be a 4th exam instead of that poster project imo. 6 quizzes with lowest one dropped. Bio MCQ are always tricky so go to her office hrs to review em. Gluck",1
Took this class during the summer. He isn't so bad. He expects you to follow the rubric. Picking topics for the speeches was hard as he isn't really clear on what he wants. He gives good feedback and clarifies what you need to work on. There were 2 small assignments and 3 speeches. I did notice some awkward/inappropriate comments.,1
"HW due on test day; tests are multiple choice YAY!, 4 ques. pop quiz for every chapter, very low stress and he is very understanding to your needs. He is willing to help you! If you put in the effort you cannot fail, he wants you to pass! This was my 2nd semester with him for these reasons! I could not have passed without him",1
"If you goal is CPA, her class is not helpful at all. She is not even patient or nice.",0
GOOD GUY. KNOWN HIM FOR A WHILE AND HE'S REALLY HELPFUL. WILL LOOK OUT FOR YOU - TAKE THIS CLASS!,1
"Victoria is a horrible professor. She's a nice person, but should not be teaching. She is extremely unorganized and unclear about everything in the class. She is rude and always confused, and goes on rants about how she lived in NYC. No one cares that you lived there Vicki it's not that cool. Overall a horrible professor",0
I loved this class. I was so terrified for accounting and taking it online was perfect for me. I had time to learn at my own pace and had the ability to go back and relearn previous things at my leisure. Loved the way this class was set up and prof. Reeves was so nice everytime I emailed her with a question. 10/10 would recommend.,1
He is a very tough grader and attendance is mandatory. Arriving a minute or two after class begins gives you an entire absence. His tests are easy if you study. If you are taking this class because you like Shakespeare be prepared to take in a lot of visual performances and analysis not only reading. You read about a play per 2 class periods.,0
" she was always personable and ready to talk. in class she seems crazy and all over the place. never on a one topic but many on the same time. IF YOU CANT DEAL WITH A PERSON WHO JUMPS FROM ONE SUBJECT TO ANOTHER DO NOT TAKE PROFESSOR. she is a easy grader, all you have to do is be inspired in writing. never is clarifying, have to respect her.",0
Horrid professor. I've taken 4 coding classes and this is the worst one by far. Reads off slides expecting students to actually pay attention in her class and gives out far too much homework for the little to no effort coming from her end. Avoid her at all costs.,0
"Mrs Schwartz is very blunt, if the class does badly youll know about it. She is not into euphemisms or sugar coating and I respect that. To the weak hearted she might seem mean but she's really a nice person. She is full command of the material and makes it interesting by elaborating on specifics. Labs are graded fairly be sure you calc uncertainty",1
"For context I got almost all a's last school year. Ok is class schedule its a compressed version of a semester class, but he puts like 3 quizzes and a discussion which is already 400 words and a paper all due on the same day. His grading is wack, for quizzes no matter what I wrote with the correct answers he always took off points on the written.",0
I have already graduated and have taken every single lab with him. Hes for sure the best prof and the only person that ever teaches you stuff that are actually applicable to the field. I owe him alot,1
"Very sweet guy, but I almost died of boredom. On the first day, he told us he repeats himself at least 3 times so that students won't forget the material and he wasn't kidding. Super easy A if you don't mind wading through busy work every week.",0
She's nice. But I won't give more than 70 out 100 for her teaching method.,1
"Missed out on good candidates for workshop because he focused too heavily on GPA as an indicator of intelligence.  Unfortunately, it is apparent that there is more to being successful and ""intelligent"" than a GPA.",0
"Doesn't let u have ur own opinion but says u can, sucks as a professor.",0
Wow do I wish all classes were like his. Not many points in the class so be sure to do well when there is something assigned. I did this class online and over all only 3 discussions and 3 homework with an easy midterm and final exam. As long as u get the stuff done you will get a good grade. Love this class! No busy work just right down to business,1
"Nice guy, funny.. but made me feel like I was wasting my money so I could listen to him talk about things that didn't relate to class. Rambles A LOT. Read your textbook, even though he never mentions it. He is horrible at teaching. He just needs a class where he can tell stories all day because that's all he does.",0
"Great summer class.  No big projects.  Check out Quizlet before exams, & take notes on the lectures.  He is a fast on responding to ?s & grades.  The study guides for each module are SUPER important.  Fill them out completely & you'll be fine.  The practice exams are pretty worthless, but give you an idea about the format of the exams.  Do online.",1
"This class literally sucked the life out of me. It required only 4 tests and 4 papers. However the papers are intense and cover a ton of material- over 200 textbook pages plus multiple videos, lectures, and powerpoints. Each of my papers was over 10 pages and truly required all of the 4 weeks you have to complete the assignment. Take another prof!",0
She made Econ 201 which is a GE unnecessarily difficult,0
hard class. if ur not smart he wont care about your questions,0
Doesn't teach. Only plays youtube videos for all topics.,0
"Worst experience with a teacher I have ever had. Does not care about his students and his lectures are boring, don't bother going, just teach yourself. Tests are ridiculously hard. During this whole COVID thing, he was the most nonempathetic person. Moving home? Bummer, do the homework anyway while you pack and move all weekend, no extensions.",0
I don't know why this course is only available in 3 hour once a week sections. It gets incredibly boring but showing up increases your grade so just tough it out. Bring a lot of snacks and your laptop to class you'll need them. Class material is not interesting and he will never let you leave early. Just avoid this class unless you must take it.,0
"Dr. Rumenik is very knowledgable. I genuinely enjoyed the 3 hour class. Show up, read over notes and exams will be super easy. She hands out 90% of the notes which is nice. Presentations are big in this class but the material is interesting.",1
"The worst instructor ever, and forever.",0
Super easy class for a GE. He was really funny and made lectures interesting (given the inherently dull topics). Great teacher. Reviews everything that will be on the test. No ambiguity in the class. You know all your assignments at the beginning of the semester and they are all really easy. Good class.,1
"friendly and tries hard to entertain the class with pictures, but his notes are very disorganized and doesn't tell you which parts of his version arent in the 'student' version so unless you print them, try to sit with someone who does; relatively easy, nice to have all multiple choice with bonus questions and not cumulative",1
"Enthusiastic, but demands too much time. His classes are a waste of time but riduculously easy. You don't have to show up to class very often but you better not miss band or watch out for the wrath of Art.",0
"Great teacher.bright,well-read and expects you to do the assigned work.Really learnt alot in his class.Approachable,and cute in his own way.",1
"All homework and quizzes are done online on a site you have to pay for. That's where the textbook is as well, but I never used it and passed. English is not his first language, so it may be difficult to understand what he says, but powerpoints are clear. Pay attention, show up to take notes and you'll pass. Hands out a clear syllabus.",1
I still know absolutely nothing about tax; exam not based on what was taught,0
"I'm a third year and Phillip is THE most engaging prof I've had. His lectures are crucial to attend. If you skip, you will not understand the specific emphasis on the topics of his powerpoints. His study guides are key, because he literally has test questions on them. The tests and exams are easy, but properly research and structure your essay.",1
"This was not an easy class. You have to go to class to do well- the exams are super specific to what he covered in class. Extra credit isn't that helpful, but can be good if you're on the edge between two grades.",1
"Extremely unreasonable. Unwilling to help students, spends most of her class giving long lectures that aren't related to the syllabus. Whoever reads this, please don't choose her as your professor.",0
He is awesome. Great teacher. I actually like Econ now.,1
"Chris is a pretty awesome guy. The class topics were not always that interesting, but the way he talked about them made them interesting. He's also really clear about info. Make sure you take clear notes, it'll help you for the T/F 5 question quizzes. He's really funny and I enjoyed his class a lot.",1
"I took his world literature class over summer and man oh man, I highly recommend not taking him if it's hard for you to tune into the actual content amidst irrelevant tangents. His lectures are incredibly boring and his writing prompts are confusing. I honestly had to teach most of the content to myself bc the lectures were so disorganized. beware.",0
"This professor seemed okay at first, then as the course went on he started getting off topic and would talk about his personal life and not talk about the information. Theres no homework and barley any extra opportunities. The class is based off of 2 exams and a group project. I wouldnt recommend the class AT ALL if youre not good at test taking",0
"A COMPLETE and TOTAL battle-axe. I absolutely detest her condescending speech and that way she just ""looks"" at you when she thinks you've said something stupid.  It's a wonder she's still allowed to teach here!",0
This class is the type that have people kill themselves. Put in nearly three hours a day to keep up with material and yet i scored a 40% on the midterm like most of the class. This stuff is not easy and Gary doesnt do much to help that. Avoid this teacher if you are not a DEANZA student. taking him at UCSC where ochem is condensed into 2 quarters,0
I have never in my life met a teacher so unwilling to teach in my life. I emailed Dr. Williams and accidentally called him Mr. and he went off on me and belittled me. I was marked points off for calling him Mr. and we are doing this final project that is 40% of our grade and Im personally scared to even ask questions.,0
"oh my god, are we in india? no this is america. we speak english.",0
Fell in love with Paula. She left the department last semester and I still talk about her everyday. Simply the best.,1
Dr. Wallendael is a witch. I would not take this class with her as my teacher because I had covered up the webcam by accident while taking the syllabus quiz. She sent an email with a threat regarding that I will be reported for an academic integrity violation and will receive a non-droppable score of zero on the exam in question.,0
He only helps people he likes. He will help you only if he likes you .,0
"Really great professor overall. Makes lectures interesting, and explains complex material in a coherent fashion. Provides plenty of material to study for exams, and even offers review sessions. Classes themselves are very laid back and comfortable. Offers a ton of extra credit if you complete all assignments, so it's pretty hard to fail.",1
"Even when I am doing my 4th year of latin you can be sure to hear me down the hall humming ""eram, eras, erat, eramus, eratis, erant"" (tune of the Mexican Hat Dance), and the same for those Mickey Mouse Verbs! She makes Latin fun, and is a great Prof, although a little hard on those quizzes! Yes, Professor, I am doing those flashcards!",1
"Prof. Somers is not only scatter brained, she tends to be rude to her students. She does not organize her power points, and she only puts a couple power point slides on canvas. She does not answer questions very clearly, and she gets irritated when students ask too many questions.",0
"Not a bad guy, had some interesting off-topic conversations with him. However, we had a 2 hour class scheduled, but only received about 15 minutes of very ""meh"" lecture per day. Class was very book-heavy. That's basically all it was - reading the book. Didn't learn anything from the teacher.. Like, at all. Chapters were long. Don't fall behind.",0
This is the WORST professor I ever had!! Don't listen to the few (fake) positive reviews he has. He is all over the place and it is never clear what he is talking about or wants. He gives an insane amount of work to do and you are never able to do it right. When you go in for feedback you will walk out more confused than you did in the first place.,0
Ms. M was a great teacher. Not very interested in subject but made it very bearable. PowerPoints have lots of info but all of it is needed to build concepts. Replaces lowest grade with attendance % if it helps you. Emails back very quickly and easy grader. Extra credit available. Very nice and approachable. Really - a great prof! Recommended.,1
"I had to drop this class due to the tests. There's homework every week that is very hard-even on test weeks we had 3-4 hours of homework due. The tests are 3-4 questions and he grades very tough. I went to his office and he said I shouldn't be working so hard because his class is common sense, elementary and basic. I couldn't deal with that. ",0
Amazing professor and person!,1
"It was an elective, so it was pretty easy of a class. She will tell you there are ""pop quizzes,"" but she ALMOST always told the class ahead of time. Look at the notes or listen to the lecture and you should be fine for vocab. The text book is not super important, but there will be some test questions, so either know history or look it up",1
"Her lectures are boring, but this is economics after all. She has a heavy accent and sometimes it is difficult to understand her. Her tests are easy. She gives you almost all the answers before the test. You will not learn much, but you can make a good grade.",0
Tests were so difficult and pure memorization of stuff he said in class. Often exams had nothing to do with anything mentioned. Make sure you read the textbook. Random stuff from there will pop up in the exam too. Only reason I did well is because he bell curved it. My classs average was 40%.,0
"I took her during the fall while covid was happening and she was not helpful at all. She taught it like we had been it for 20 years like she had. I had to teach myself, not sympathetic about mistakes on her end. Argued with students.",0
"His exams were fair. However, his assignments are horrific. He doesnt explain anything regarding them and is very unclear as to what he really wants. They are marked by himself and we had to submit it over 5 times just to pass.",0
"Talks entirely too much during class (especially for a 400-level one), talking points are incredibly repetitive, extremely flaky.  He does have extensive and interesting knowledge of critical theory, though.",0
"When I took this class years ago I hated it and didn't understand anything in the class. Now that I look back on it he had the right idea of covering the material he did. He is a nice guy if you talk to him, just can't explain things well. I passed the CPA exam and this class helped make studying for the exam a little easier. I have had worse.",1
Mr prey does not give feedback. He is not availble to answer questions concerning assignments.,0
"Great guy but though prof. Especially the midterms and exams, those were brutal. I walked into the final expecting an A and walked out thinking I failed the exam. (I probably got 57% on exam) Just work on your practice midterms and ride that curve!",1
Did a good job teaching DiffEQ/LinAlg.  Nothing too tricky on the tests.  Do the homework and you'll be fine.,1
"this prof seems like a super nice guy, but not meant to be teaching. his classes are definitely not mandatory to go to, his tests are fairly easy- though the midterm was not (stupidest midterm) however I would not recommend taking him because he leaves you so unprepared for the final and does not actually TEACH you anything",1
"In this section, all the homework and quizzes were online.They are very difficult to pass by your self, although you are allowed to use your book.He is the worst accounting teacher in America!He doesn't care if you know the material by the end of his class, he diesn't even take the time to know his students because he knows they will drop his class",0
"Random quizzes to check if you read, usually two easy questions, no funny business. Reading list is very fun, out of all the readings, I didn't enjoy two. The rest are great and I've recommended friends to read for fun. Class consist of three essays and an in-class final exam (passage ID & close reading essay). Fav class so far at Cal.",1
"Wow, what do I say? She lulls you into thinking this class will be an easy A, since there is only 1 legit paper and that's the final. She never takes attendance either. I expected an A and when I checked my grade it was a B. I was totally shocked. Apparently the paper is like 99% of your grade and she grades VERY VERY hard. That is ridiculous.",0
she does play fav. not very clear on explaing what to do on potters weel. come to class do all (6) the way she wants u too. u can make up time class by attending her other classes. i recomm. this class uf u need to get intouch with ur innerself not an easy A. shes a great prof but hard grader :),0
"Best class ever! Dr. Johnson is a great professor, and she loves what she does. Her class is very interesting and she makes it fun. The textbook could be used for studying but is not mandatory since she provides Powerpoints. Attendance is important! She grades tests/assignments super fast! I would definitely take another class with her If I could.",1
She was awesome,1
"Very chill professor. Only four tests in lecture, two lab tests, and one lab report. He played some pretty cool videos in class too. He ran lecture very well, was easy to learn from, and if he didn't discuss it in class it wouldn't be on the test. He also let run and grab a coffee even if I was late.",1
"Terrible...Awful... there really are no words. For the price we pay to attend this school, we deserve good faculty. Maybe he is a brilliant academic, maybe he deserves the Nobel Prize for his research, but he is the worst professor I have ever had. Do not take him for any reason at any time... I would seriously change my major to avoid taking him.",0
"she's great! very clear on info, very interesting and she is soo nice you can tell she is interested in what she is teaching. quizzes are a bit difficult but as long a you read the book and go to class you'll be fine",1
"Turull is the best professor I have ever had. He always has an answer for any problem. He is always able to assist his students, and he is also very patient and organized. I would give him 6 out of 5.",1
"He's a really nice guy, class isn't too tough but you've got to put the effort in, weekly homework assignments can be annoying, tests aren't nearly that tough, doesn't go into much depth in class so you kind of have to do it on your own",1
"Worst prof I've ever had. She talks in circles and never actually anwsers your questions. She cannot teach!! Her TA's do most of the work and she does not know what she's talking about. Her lecture slides are the worst, there disorganized and scattered. Her notes contain a lot of non factual information. She made an easy course very difficult! ",0
Good teacher who likes what she's doing. The labs she gives are interesting but long. Cool class with good lectures.,1
"Great guy, hard marker. Don't expect an easy grade. Alex or Macissac more likely to give you higher grades then Maltby. Despite this, his lectures are interesting and thoughtful and I learned more than with any other prof.",1
SHE IS EXCELLENT!,1
DONT TAKE THIS CLASS! Lectures are so off topic and irrelevant there is no point listening to them. You watch videos every class that are also very pointless. The only assignments are 3-4 essays and he didn't even put my scores into Blackboard so I wasted my time even doing them. He never uses Blackboard or answers emails so good luck passing :),0
"I wouldn't recommend him for IFT372. His exams are mostly confused because most of them are different than from homework, previous quiz, and study guide. He doesn't teach well for IFT372... class average for every quizzes & exam were failing. Also, this class doesn't have pre-requisite.",0
"I would not recommend this professor to anyone. Has 3 tests, homework is not graded he gives the answers to it every week. Mumbles over a very long powerpoint but doesn't really teach concepts. Forces you to teach yourself. Can download the textbook online, that's where the homework is assigned. I learned nothing from this class.",0
Je l'ai détesté... il se prend pour un dieu! Moi je trouve que c'est un trou de cul... Il n'est pas professionnel pour deux cents.... Je ne comprends pas pourquoi on le laisse enseigner...,1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS AS AN ELECTIVE. 5 long papers, one midterm, a presentation, and 15 journal entries. Shannon Roper made our lives a living hell. Class is way harder than it needs to be. Unless you need Gender to graduate, pick a different elective and save the headache. She also rambles until the very last second of every class.",0
Gives lots of interesting tangents and stories. At times he can seem kind of full of himself. Also can seem like a bit of a jerk but he is usually joking. Because he gets off topic frequently and for long amounts of time he often goes through the material very quickly.,1
Nice!!!,1
"Overall a really nice prof, who knows his material really well. The only complaint that sometimes he will go through things quickly. Apart from sometimes being a little fast, he's really easygoing and nice. 100% will take another class with him if there's something that piques my interest. When you have a prof that wholesome it's a great time.",1
"He's one of the better profs at seneca. if you can't handle him, consider switching schools. He's a fair grader. He doesn't really teach but if you have a specific problem or stuck on something, he will help with that. Go to class, study hard, and teach yourself (because no one else at seneca will).",0
"She's a hard teacher, but she's wonderful. I just wish I could have taken Calc 2 with her. He test are super hard, but it makes you a better student. I would definitely take another class with her. Best math class I've ever had.",1
"At first his demeanor is kind, and enthusiastic. As the semester went on I realized how much of a socratic teacher he is. He needs to learn that not everyone is a auditory learner. The way he teaches is not repetitive enough to actually make me learn. His notes are brief and expects you to immediately understand. Questions are barely answered. ",0
"unfortunately he was not the easy grader people have bragged about. Recently, been hard to understand and tells you to do a problem one way, but when you do he marks it wrong on exams. not helpful, should think of retiring..he tries to be nice but dont be fooled",0
"Dr. Zhang is a great professor. He mirrors his quiz & tests questions straight out of the homework he assigns. Not very many grades, but if you pay attention & DO the homework it's a breeze. He's hilarious & very willing to help during office hours also. He loves what he does- one time he stayed after class to help me finish a worksheet.",1
Engaging prof.  Definitely recommend.,1
"Ive had nothing but boring profs at york, Jeff is a rare gem that actually cares about his students.",1
Questions in emails were never been replied.,0
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!!!!!!!!! STAY AWAY! this professor does not use canvas or know how to work technology. you have to buy 10 books and you have to read them all and write papers on them. and exams. she changes the syllabus every single class and passes out a new one. the inconsistency makes the class even more hard to follow. AVOID I promise,0
"Great guy, very intellegent. Tests were a little hard.",1
"His online tests were given over blackboard so there was multiple choice but the free response questions were either right or wrong, no partial credit, since he didn't see your work. Very boring, long lectures and not much material to study from. Would not recommend taking an online class with Cook.",0
Clearly wishes he were retired.  So do we.  He's not interested.  Lectures are poorly organized stream-of-consciousness ramblings that lapse periodically into incoherent mumbling.  Study guides are much like lectures--incoherent.  Flunked nearly half the class on the first test and rather seemed to enjoy that.  Run away from this one!,0
"Professor Kanchi's Cloud Computing class is awful. The lecture material doesn't cover the topics you need to know in order to succeed in the lab, she frequently doesn't respond to emails and has difficulty picking up on questions. Much of the material she provides for the lab is both erroneous and out of date. To do well, you need to find a student",0
"He's ridiculous, puts things on tests that he never goes over in class.  Tests VERY unfair.. basically by the end of the semester you'll hate him intensely, so just save yourself the trouble and don't take anything he's teaching.",0
"I took Backgrounds with Leslie and she is undeniably brilliant and passionate about her profession. Not only did I learn an enormous amount in the class, but when I had trouble with attendance near the end of the semester, she was very understanding and allowed me to earn back her good faith. Only negative was the lengthy reading assignments.",1
"Tom Lee is one of the best professors I've ever had. If you have the opportunity to have a class with Tom, take it. He is passionate and cares about how well his students do. I have never regretted taking a class taught by Tom Lee.",1
"I think he was very creative as a professor and assigned us interesting work. I learned a lot from him, however I found myself very frustrated with his personality. He has a tendency to be very passive aggressive and condescending towards his students. Overall, he gets the job done but I wouldnt take another class from him due to his attitude.",0
Good teacher but needs to take a breath during class he never stops talking.,1
"Really nice guy, very understanding. Important to make a connection with him so that he knows who you are. However, he's a very hard grader, and a little difficult to understand. I would only suggest taking him if you have some knowledge and genuine interest in the subject.",1
he is great online. very easy... quiz are 5 pts and short essay are 14pts. give you enough time for everything!!! ask questions he can help!!! great teacher overall!!!,1
"I would not take her. She makes things difficult on purpose, and for no reason. The class is very boring and there's a lot of weekly work.",0
"Roberto is the man.  He has so much passion and enthusiasm when he teaches.  And I love it when he deviates to discuss real world issues.  He tells it like it is. He doesn't give homework, but tests are easy enough with multiple choice/short answer.",1
"i genuinely don't understand how he has such a high rating. yes, the man is very nice, but the work load is absolutely ridiculous. you're expected to type papers of 1000 (aka 4 pages) every week in addition to the research-based discussion board posts. also, he's very vague about the final project. don't take him. trust me.",0
"he keeps class interesting, give lots of homework & cases, you kind of have to teach yourself",1
"I don't even know where to begin with this guy. I've never disliked a teacher as much as him. His methods of teaching are enough to confuse anyone. You never know what his expectations are, and it seems that he constantly sets the class up for failure with all the information he expects you to study, with little help or clarity. Very disorganized.",0
"If you are looking for an easy A, then you chose the right class. For those who allocate an below average-average amount of study time this class should be a walk in the park. The entire class is based on a single concept IMO and doesn't take much effort to learn. Slackers still get As.",1
"Planned China trip to occur during semester-required deadlines moved up a month! Fun in class, but wasted too much time talking about elections; made it clear that only liberal opinions of interest; allowed class to make disparaging comments about religions. Caring; available via email. Grading silly-same points for a major project as for journal.",1
the most irritating teacher i've ever had.,0
"Material is incredibly difficult to learn, and especially when you can barely understand a word he is saying. He uses an overhead projector and frequently makes mistakes, leaving a jumbled mess on the screen. Easily the worst professor I've had at Drexel. Does not curve AT ALL, tests are 25 minutes and crazy hard.",0
"I absolutely loved this class. This class was pure lectures, but Professor Cone made you very interested in what was going on. I would 100% take this class again. If you do not show up to class don't expect to pass because all the material is from his lectures with a couple of questions from the book.",1
"Dr. Zentner is a breath of fresh air and offers a different perspective that is hard to find on a college campus. I would I highly recommend taking his class! As everyone mentioned, he can go a bit off topic. Read your assigned material before class and you will do fine!",1
Dr. Conner is a good teacher. She doesn't use the text but it's good to have for a quick referrence if you need one. She sends lecture noted to your e-mail and usually will accomadate you in any way possible. I took her for 2 semesters and an A both times. I would recommend her.,1
Prof. Khadka is one of my best in SJCC. He want hes students successful in the subject. I recommend to all who interested in Phys 4A to attend with Him. ,1
He would have to be my favorite teacher of all time. The projects are entertaining and the class has a great atmosphere!,1
"Mrs. Johnson is an incredible teacher. Her lectures are interesting and engaging. She provides numerous sources for her points throughout the class. She uses PowerPoints and often shows videos. Students are asked to participate in class, but that's part of what makes the class fun. I learned a lot about social behavior/society in her class.",1
"Seeing other reviews that this professor is mean/rude; VERY TRUE! First time dealing with a prof like him, & its very disappointing. Guy sure does love the course & the course is loaded w work, but couldnt care less if you swim or sink. ENC1101 was a breeze for me, this class & teacher was just a nightmare.",0
"He is very smart, just a terrible teacher though. I think Kettering keeps him around so he can fail students after the refund date. Good guy, just very twisted. Sorry, very poor quality prof. Gives KU a bad rep.",0
"Professor Leslie is my favorite in the English department.  Very fun, warm, caring, helpful in all of the assignments.  Her class was great, I felt very respected and comfortable.  I highly recommend Shakespeare's Comedies with Leslie for your Shakespeare requirement.",1
"Taking notes on a laptop recommended, so u could type all his ideas or add to the PowerPoints. Class is important; his ppts have basic bullet points that he'll explain fully. the main ideas he discusses in class are what you need to write about for the essay midtermsfinal. Honestly pay attention, prewrite the essay Q's beforehand, and u'll be good",1
"Jodie is super cool. She's a very fun teacher. She's really passionate about literature and really tries to make it fun for the whole class. lots of reading though, not many written assignments. In ENG245, we did a lot of class discussions so participation is important.",1
This teacher assigns way too much work.  Lots of projects that take way too much time.,0
"Excellent, humorous, down-to-earth professor.  I never bought the book, but he does go over everything thoroughly in class (if you choose to go).  I would highly recommend him.  As previously said, his GA's do all of the grading and they tend to be VERY tight.  I did much better in the more advanced LITR courses.. go figure.",1
"I'm not sure why Prof Farris has such negative reviews! Although I am taking this course online this semester, he has been working well with the students during the transition. This class is not an easy subject, so of course it is going to be more difficult. I think he explains things well and provides additional materials for studying if necessary",1
"Excellent Professor, fun in class, teaches from experience, very open for questions and down to earth. He has been one of the best professors I have ever had! I recommend this class to anyone who is interested in criminal justice and policing",1
"Fantastic Prof.  Very passionate about what he is teaching.  Readings are a little on the heavy side, but really interesting.",1
"This teacher is very difficult to get along with.  She is very demeaning to students and does not seem to want to help students learn.  She is a very hard grader, to the point I would say unfair.  If a small aspect of a lab write up is not exactly how she feels it should be, she will gouge your grade severely.  If you can avoid her DO SO!",0
"Dr. Wright is a good professor!! She is clear and is test heavy. She gives a practice test so you can study so if you do the practice the test will be fair to you. She gives a lot of partial credit too. However, she gives A LOT of homework on Aleks and lecture always has iClicker questions. If you put in the work you will pass.",1
"Not a bad professor when we has teaching, but would often go off topic on random tangents about halfway through class. I honestly only passed because of my TA who went over homework in great detail. Definitely need to have prior knowledge of calc",0
" Dr. Beymer-Farris is my absolute favorite professor at UK. Her classes are more discussion based than lecture based, and expect to write. If you are interested in the subject matter, she is a wonderful resource. She is not only a good professor, but an overall good person. She's genuinely interested in the lives and well-being of her students.",1
"He loves Astronomy.  His lectures are not clear. He's all over the place.  If you go to the SI Sessions you will understand better and pass the class with a C or better.  Do the EC, it helps your grade.  ",0
"Micaela was wonderful. Comes across harsh and very strict in class, but do yourself a favour and go to her office hours. I loved her. The course was tough for sure, assignments are very long and hard and the final was brutal, but put in the work and let her see you working hard and she's a lamb.",1
I took him for both Intermediate and AIS.  All tests and quizzes are online for both classes.  You have to go to him during his office hours to get a couple of extra points.  He tries to look out for his students by postponing quizzes but a lot of times I feel like he plays around too much.,1
Nice guy!  He is so enthusiastic about teaching gym that you can't help but like him.  Highly recommended!,1
Brilliant and fascinating and one of my favorite people ever. She is very very difficult but you WILL come out of the class a better writer!,1
"Probably my least favorite professor that I've had. His tests were harder than what I was prepared for, and he could be rude. At one point he told the class something like, ""If you're having a hard time, you should consider switching majors."" Would only explain things one way. Taught myself by reading the textbook. Went from an F to a C this way.",0
"HORRIBLE!!!! Crude humor, and horrible teacher. NOt helpful in the least bit! He did help our class out by allowing take home tests but all in all i don't really know what hes doing here.",0
Play to spend a huge amount of time with the textbook and multiple problem sets.  Professor marches through pre-set lecture.  Two tests are primarily computation.  Professor is passionate for subject; But he has very little tolerance for the learning process; finds questions distracting.  Many students found him arrogant.  Worst class of my UD MBA.,0
"More of a hybrid class. You need mymathlab. the subject is harder for me than most but hes a great teacher, funny and laid back. practicing the math concepts is a must. Hes Not a fan of extra credit so do well on all exams for good measure of your grade.",1
"You must attend class in order to get credit for daily exercises. This professor does not seem knowledgable on the topic at hand, and she doesn't properly answer questions. She will tell the student to research outside of class, rather than saying she will get back to them. She is not engaging at all, and most people end up teaching themselves.",0
"I love Dr. Gabrosek as a person, however the way he taught wasn't exactly best for me, and I know it wasn't very good for others as well. He did not have any lectures. Everything we learned was straight from the book or activities in class. I enjoyed the in-class activities, but I personally find it difficult to learn strictly from reading a book.",1
The class is extremely helpful it allowers dancers to learn the beginning steps/basic. Only negative is the classes are a little slow at times and the songs we listen/dance to arent really Latin songs they are mostly English old pop songs.,1
"Baeten is a very nice person. She knows her material, but it wasn't always well-delivered. I really appreciated the several opportunities to remake a test or rewrite an essay. The grading criteria wasn't very clear. lectures can be very dull. I'm completely disappointed at what she said in the first class, ""Most of you won't get an A.""",0
Worst professor I have ever taken. This class is not an introduction class and he is very unclear on what he wants. I would never suggest him as a professor! Was also very rude in emails.,0
"He speaks quietly, which can make it difficult if you sit in the back, but he really knows his stuff! Wonderful pedagogy, fun and always cheerful.",1
I love the professor he's super sweet but I don't recommend the class. This is one of the hardest classes that I have and it's a PRINCIPLES class. He only offered one thing of extra credit throughout the entire semester that you had to decide if you were doing within the first two weeks. Overall really disappointed.,1
"Great Prof. Tries too hard to be friends with students but overall, effective, understanding, and dedicated.",1
"Has a very thick accent and is very hard to understand. Also, his notes are not readable. Be prepared to teach yourself. The only BIG plus is that his review for the exams are almost identical to his actual exams. Also, drops the lowest test grade. Takes attendance randomly.",0
"I love this professor. He is helpful and neat with everything. He even decided to make the quizzes a group. When you do the clicker, it is just to show that you are present in class.",1
"He is tough. The man is a genius and the material is fun if you like reading. But he expects next to perfection from students. He tells his TAs that if a student's paper isn't above the TA's level, they cannot earn an A on that paper. Most TAs don't follow that, but it just shows that he is hard. Good lectures, but don't mess around with him.",1
"I would highly recommend taking another professor for corp finance. Very unclear with what is due and when. He does not seem particularly interested in corporate finance as it is not to involved with his line of work. Good thing is he fails almost nobody, the bad is you will not learn much at all and can learn more with a better grade from another.",0
Majority of his tests are whats on his slides and his slides are always accessible to students. His exams are also not hard and pretty straightforward and it's easy to pay attention because he makes the lectures entertaining.,1
"By far the worst professor I have ever had the displeasure of taking. 100% biased and disrespectful as well as unprofessional. does not care about your grade and does an inadequate job of teaching the material. He basically turned the class into a debate hall and sat back instead of teaching. His averages on every test were horrible, DOESNT TEACH.",0
"Big oof. Probably one of the hardest classes to sit through ever. The class isn't hard, and the tests are super easy, BUT GOD AWFUL BORING. The problem with Mrs. Ayers is that she repeats herself many MANY times during lectures. She also likes to go off on tangents about personal life, etc. She's not a horrible teacher, but she's not a great one.",0
"If you are a student with accommodations do not take this professor ! When simply informing her about my accommodations of extra time she acted completely unprofessional and did not understand why I needed this extra time, when clearly I have a reason approved by the SSD office! Terrible experience all around!",0
"This guy is not a good professor, especially for first year students. He would not spend much time on examples, and mostly just talk about theories and proofs. The lectures were the biggest waste of time ever! None of the material taught in class had anything to do with the assignments, on top of that the exams had nothing to do with the assignment",0
Ray was an excellent mentor.,1
The best teavher i'ver had,1
"While she does well at teaching the material, she reads the course notes verbatim. Going to class can be helpful but it's nothing you can't teach yourself anyway. She also goes to through the material very slow which can make the lectures extremely boring.",1
"A real stickler when it comes to attendance and grading and doesn't forgive mistakes at all (won't even reply to emails for explanations). I accidentally turned in a wrong paper and even though he knew, didn't mention anything until giving back my grade and wouldn't accept my actual paper. Jerk. Take this class with a different professor.",0
I did not enjoy this class as much as I thought I would because it was an on demand class. He was spotty with when and how often he posted lectures and assignments. He kinda waited until the end of the semester to post a lot of the lectures. The quizzes are tough in my opinion but the exams are made from the quizzes.,1
Professor Garza is one of the sweetest and caring professors i've met at CSUN. This class is mostly based off of the homework. It has a large amount of reading to do & answer the questions in the homework. The exams that you will take will exactly be based on the homework. The 3 tests are open book (Homework) and there's a final presentation.,1
"He does not believe in giving A's. He says ""unpack"" constantly.  The material is dreadful, and he makes you read as much as possible.",0
"Mr. Adamek is an amazing teacher! He is extremely knowledgable about philosophy, and he teaches it in a way that can be understood. He lectures, but he's not just reading off of a PowerPoint, and he gets everyone involved that way he can make sure you understand the information. I would definitely recommend him if you're taking Philosophy!",1
I want Bidgoli to teach me CS216 next semester ! Don't leave us please !!!! He is the one who knows what's best for your future. He raises you on a good programming foundation. ,1
If you have the option to take literally any other professor I would highly recommend doing so. Poska is the rudest professor I've ever had and requires you to excessively visit her office hours despite being extremely unapproachable. She is unclear on grading criteria and her feedback is borderline bashing.,0
"When I didn't drop the class like he asked me to he treated me with sarcastic politeness. He is unorganized, unreasonable, manipulative, and basically a jerk. He acts like he wants to help the students, but he is never genuine. His lessons are fine, but I will never take another class with him as a teacher.",0
"Tests you over rote memorization of schematics. Schematics are very detailed. You talk about a horrible approach to teaching. Why does it matter if I can remember the exact location of a capacitor if I can tell you exactly how the circuit functions. Essentially, he is the teacher that dissuades you from becoming a teacher. Nice guy though.",0
"AWESOME bio teacher.  the best yet.  He's really clear, he'll go over stuff if you ask.",1
"Excellent professor!  She is very approachable outside of class, and she doesn't make you feel dumb when you don't understand.  She is really interested in helping you get a good grade, and if you do poorly, she'll help you or let you make it up somewhere else.  She is one of the best profs I've ever had!",1
If you're continuing with chemistry TAKE WENDY's CLASS!!! Her tests are SIGNIFICANTLY harder than any other prof's and they will whip you into shape and really force you to truly understand chemistry. If you're NOT continuing with chem; AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE her tests are so damn hard and if chem doesn't mean much to your program it's a GPA dropper,1
"this prof is not good, makes a lot of mistakes for the assigments and clarifies way later, often repeats topics in class many times over and seems to get distracted easily with mundance topics, overall i learnt coding from the textbook and slides (from the tb as well) and skipped most lectures. the course is easy tho if you have prior program exp.",0
"His class will kill your time a lot. It has so many readings, if you are a bookworm this is a perfect choice for you. If this is not your major class and you want to focus on your major classes, don't take his class.",1
"No passion for teaching, doesn't seem to care if students are learning anything of value. Sits at the front of class for 3 hours writing equations with very little explanation. Rocket propulsion is apparently basic chemistry and thermo all over again. Do not take this class, it's a waste of a senior elective when he's teaching it.",0
"There's a lot to read. If you don't keep up with readings, class will be ... confusing and you'll have trouble following along. He's really passionate about his classes and is willing to work with you if you're having some trouble (school and personal). I typically prefer to take classes with less lecturing, but I would register for his class again",1
"She was a great teacher, very helpful, and easy to talk to. Plus side she gave a TON of extra credit, even though she said there will be NO extra credit at the first class. This is not a hard class, but intensive I advise you take all the ec u can! downfall.. she talked about herself and personal life too much!",1
"Great prof, hard class! Keeps you entertained with experiments and then goes over examples and does a practice midterm to help. Really knows his stuff. You have to put in the effort to do well. Review, attend lecture, do the examples and you will succeed. Given the course difficulty he's great at explaining that much material. Prepare to work hard!",1
I took for Texts and Contexts: Major Writers..A midterm and final along with about 5 essays... He is a difficult grader.  Very enthusiastic. It is impossible to read his comments on the paper so good luck learning and getting good grades,0
Applied Chem for Engineers for a Fuel Cell minor. She knows her stuff and wants students to succeed but can be unclear at times. Recommended.,1
"First class I have ever failed. He teaches way too fast and expects you to know how to do problems he never explained. I tried to get help but I felt like I couldn't talk to him. Unless you are amazing at calc, don't take his class. Your grade is based to three tests and about 5 quizzes. Worst experience ever.",0
"A L&S counselor suggested I sign up for this course. I was so overwhelmed by the structure and subject of the class. Two-class lectures with her and a discussion group with one of her GSIs.  Prof. Joyce lectured as if she was performing in a comedy club, and her lectures were hilarious. It was a struggle yet I was surprised I did well in her class.",1
"Had this prof for my PhD. She made fun of students, and would attack people if they questioned her. No grading feedback the whole term. She seems to have a big ego. I'm super skeptical about the 7 separate 5/5 glowing reviews submitted on the same date January, 10th. Didn't feel I learned anything, and that's the worst part of all.",0
I took him for organic chemistry and I do not recommend! He goes by notes only and doesnt really teach you anything. One time during a lecture a classmate asked if he could go back a slide because she did not understand and he told her its on the slide show in moodle Also does not really reply to emails or sends short replies,0
Class is confusing. He talks like everyone already knows the stuff. Plus he's not helpful.,0
"Horrible glass to take. All he does is lecture the entire class with a very monotone voice and doesn't use any powerpoints to teach, instead he writes very small on the board. Extremely hard to follow. The tests are open book and you get a cheat sheet, but even then neither helps that much as the tests are very difficult. ",0
"Really nice teacher, not a hard grader at all. Just do the work and you will get an A.",1
"I dont even know where to begin with this one, other than do NOT i repeat DO NOT take this class with this teacher unless u absoutly have to!!! it requires a lot of time and work more than u will ever imagine!! like 2-3 hwk asgn. that takes 5hrs he is not helpful, not flexable on office hrs.doesnt even grade his own papers u r just another# to him.",0
This dude knows his stuff. I love this class and this prof. He will drop truth bombs left and right. He's funny too,1
"Mary Furey is a Good prof. I received an A in the course, though my average GPA is bellow 3, if I can get an above average on it, you should be able to as well. You just have to be content/relate to what she teaches. Intro to Entrepreneurship is meant to be an easy course for those who have interest in becoming an Entrepreneur.",1
Amazing class. Very useful and applicable to real life. Really easy too. Lectures aren't mandatory but you will not regret the things you learn from this guy.,1
boring material.. he did a good job with it though,1
"do not take this lady if you have too... she is very annonying. Likes a certain set of people, and if you know that you are not best at sucking up to profs, she is not the one for you...it would be much easier fot you is you play basket ball or hockey to get through her class",0
"He was the best professor I have ever had! He's very funny, and he always successfully engages his students. He's very understanding if you need extensions or extra clarification. Lectures aren't necessary to attend, but he is the best lecturer the University has to offer. I will take anything offered by him in the future! I recommend this class! ",1
I took Bergert for Marketing online & she was good! The assignments are pretty easy & you will also do a marketing plan throughout the semester which is pretty easy as well! I ended with an 89.6 but she was nice enough to round it up! :),1
"He was a great prof.  He made a boring subject interesting.  He was very helpful especially when I was really sick at points, he was understanding and helpful with homework.  I would highly recommend him!!!",1
"i was excited to take this class and it made me so unhappy and feel so inadequate i'm ashamed i ever looked forward to it in the first place. awful professor. no matter how hard you work, you will never be good enough to her. that is across the board... no matter who you are, what you know, she will always look down on your work.",0
"Ginsburg's teaching method could be summed up as chaotic and confusing, with no indications as to what is essential to the class and what is just random asides. The class itself has a deceptive name, since the material is almost identical to the mandatory PSY4391. Bottom line, get a different prof for this class Class has 3 tests, 100 points each.",0
"Honestly I don't see why everyone dislikes this professor so much. Hes one of the nicest and most caring professors I've had at UB. Yes he goes off on tangents sometimes in class but is that really a big deal? Take him for bio 201, he makes the class so that it is easy for his students. And if you go to class there's no way you won't achieve an A",1
"Hands down the worst psych professor at EMU. The class was a little easier because I had JUST taken basic stats before his class. He was not clear and he had terrible lectures. I would not take this professor again. If you can, take someone else for stats and save yourself a headache.",0
Not hard at all. I never went to the class after the first exam and I still did great. He posts the PowerPoint online and the information is pretty straight forward so no need to go to class unless you are struggling.,1
"He makes the course rather fun and humorous. You may want to go to class for those essays, and if you know the lectures well, the exams will come easier, even though he gives you the exams before hand. I'm not fond of the website he's set up for the sake of not seeing grades, but I'll settle.",1
He believes this is the most important course. Throws things in that are way above the norm for this course- I say this since the exams reflected VERY specific information while lectures were broad or covered something specific that was not on the exam  SO SPECIFIC! You can avoid by taking Kai at Extended learning (more $ units  through EL) READ!,0
"It was an ESP class and the professor plus the tutors were very helpful. Easiest class I've taken my first semester. She's always in a good mood, especially with her Coca-cola :) . I wish more professors are caring friendly to their students like her. The atmosphere in the class was also very welcoming. ",1
"Soo much work! An excessive amount really, almost a hundred questions per chapter and you do two a week. Always includes a post with the work and she is an extremely hard grader. The work itself isn't too bad but it's very time consuming and very pointless.",0
"He's a nice guy and tries to explain whatever he's teaching using analogies. Whilst some of them make sense a lot of them are difficult. He's a little bit funny but his accent made it hard to understand lecture, so I stopped going halfway through. Recitation and HW will guide you to the A, just keep up and don't save everything for the last minute.",1
"So much information is covered on the tests that its difficult to study for them. there are so many readings. I went into her office hours to see how I could do better and she's very sharp, but not unfriendly.",1
Do not take this professor if your not interested in history and just taking it for a core requirement.,0
"I took Calc 1 in the active learning classroom, and I learn better in his interactive style rather than a lecture. Pay attention to the facebook group because he'll put up solutions that end up on homework quizzes (you don't turn homework in). Labs are a pain but they aren't impossible. Tests are hard but he adjusts the grades afterwords. ",1
"I would strongly recommend not taking this class. Speaking to my experience with Barreto online, I can tell you two things: 1) He teaches nothing. It's all ""fill in the blank"" reading assignments (easy, but you don't learn anything) and 2) He will not Email you back, no matter how many times you email him. Incredibly unresponsive and unhelpful.",0
"Not an easy class.Tests are based on lecture. Use the book for clarification. Most students record lectures. 85-100% is an A. After each test, he'll offer 1 to 1 meeting to go over the tests. Slackers unwilling to study shouldn't take this class and take up seats for serious students. Only 5 people with A's and 2 more tests to go.",1
"A lot of reading and writing!!!!!  Only two tests with a majority of the class grade based on writing assignments. TAs do most, if not all, of the grading. I should also note that assignments are graded very critically and harshly.  One must be willing to work to get a good grade on anything in this class.",1
"She was a great teacher, who cared about the success of her students. Took for her a summer class and was very pleased!",1
"MUST read textbook, assigns 1-4 readings before each class on top of it, various lengths. Super into presentations. Blue book exams. This class was harder than my 600 level class for my major, he throws a lot of information at you, most of which will go over your head if you skip a reading. Be prepared to participate, if you don't you won't pass.",0
"I took McCartneys Civic Engagement class which turned out to be a little bit about civic engagement and more about the United Nations. You are required to give 3 presentations, 2 in class and one to a high school class. I am not sure how it relates to civic engagement but be just prepared to focus specifically on the UN for the 2nd half.",1
"Wow, I took a class from him the year before I went to law school(11 yrs ago). It was the most difficult class at NCSU next to Dr. Holly's Chaucer. That said, Lit Crit was hard. Dr. Thompson has a NPR sense of humor. He was awesome. The only caveat: if you are trying to get into a competitve grad school program,his course might drag your GPA down.",1
Horrible professor hes very short with his responses and horrible sarcasm he doesnt clarify how he got the answer he just does the work in his head without explaining I learn more from the In class tutor than the professor himself.,0
"He is the best history professor I have ever had. You will have two quizzes and discussions every week (summer class). It sounds crazy, but if you read the articles, you can find all the answers there. It is highly recommended to have his class. Easy to get A.",1
"Cute and affable exterior, but avoids every concievable point of interest in the course. And he's got himself a clever little scheme; the reader he makes you buy (his won, naturally) is re-released every year with minimal changes, so used ones can't be re-sold in the book store. Major ripoff.",0
"I love physics and it is a class that can be taught in a really exciting manner.  Not with this class.  It might as well be an online class.  It's robotic. Nothing but numbers and arithmetic for 2 hours of lecture.  He records himself, so if you have a question, you have to wait until the end of class to ask it.  I'm very disappointed. ",0
"You won't fall asleep in her class, unless you didn't get enough sleep. She compacts the material in the chapters into easy to unnderstand format. Don't be late for her class. There are 3 group projects, midterm & final.",1
Law and Ethics. Great person.  Adds her own interpretation of laws and rulings that makes the course more relateable and encourages the development of opinions and argument.   Not difficult at all.  She allows one sheet of paper with whatever you want on it during exams.  I typed out all my notes from class (I went to all the classes) to get an A.,1
"Kind prof (took another class with him in person), and he's knowledgeable about the material. BUT never responds to emails, literally. Also grading criteria for exams is too specific. For online class, you won't be able to reach him and won't see him during exams. Get ready to read!!!",0
"I'm now in the final part of my Master's at York and she's still the worst professor I've had. Even when I dislike someone or find it hard to work with them, I can usually acknowledge their expertise and learn something. She's awful. Learned nothing from the class. Disorganized. Rude. Very inflexible  Had to get the dept. involved for accommodation",0
"Y'all need to go to lecture & basically write down everything he says ever because it will on the test. Don't bother going to office hours, he is not helpful & very condescending, nothing you say will be totally correct and he will let you know that. He gives no feedback on the exams so on the MC and TF you have no idea what you did wrong or right",0
"Definitely try to avoid this guy if you can. He's a nice guy to talk to and he truly cares about the class but I feel that he just approaches everything in the wrong way. He will have stupid discussions on the books we read and everyone will stay silent. Snow day? Too bad, he has an online class and marks you absent if you don't ""attend"". ",0
"Allen is enthusiastic and the class is pretty good overall. Definitely not a complete ""easy A"" and requires some studying, but easier than most Berkeley classes. 2 hours of lecture and no discussion for 3 units makes up for the annoying field trips.",1
Dr. Giroux made the class extremely enjoyable and easy to comprehend. He made the class feel welcoming and I found it easy to participate in class discussions. He's a really hard grader when it comes to papers but if you put in the effort and pay attention to the discussions you shouldn't have much of an issue. One of the best professors I've had.,1
"Tons of homework, very hard class.  His heart is in the right place, but behavior often times is not.  Has blown up at the whole class numerous times for minor problems, then turns into mister best buddy nice guy.",1
"I like Mark, and he is definitely a solid choice as a professor. But, be prepared to spend a lot of time on his assignments, since he gives out a lot over the course of a semester. Mark gives good feedback on assignments, but it takes forever to get your grades (as mentioned). I recommend office hours if you need help with any of his assignments.",1
"I think he's impossible. After four years of honors highschool math and the honors program at college, I'm struggling terribly in his class. He moves fast. The quizzes are fair but the tests are incomprehensible and unrealistic. Students are dropping out rapidly in Calc II. Maybe he's easy in the other classes but not in this one.",0
"Explains concepts very well, gives plenty of extra credit, is lenient on grading. He can be a little combobulated at times but will always make an effort to help students.",1
"All the people here complaining about losing points for indentation, etc. The truth is thats what the real world is like. Style guidelines exist for a reason. Get a linter and set up rules or something. His course is easy. Hes a harsh grader, but the content itself is cake. If you cant hack it, rethink your major.",0
Stay clear of this professor. He is a hard grader and teaches the class like we are supposed to know everything already. He writes in front of where he is talking about on the board so no one can see what he's writing. He goes too fast on lectures as well. He made me feel discouraged and stupid like I did not know anything. Would no recommend.,0
"Very misleading and she does not teach by discussion, she teaches by internet sites posted on Angel and typed note outlines on Angel.  Study hard for tests, memorize all review sheets, remember small details from class.  She purposely tries to trick you on her tests!",0
His voice is super boring.  He does not teach you anything and reads off PowerPoints you could read yourself. The real grades in the class are based on SAM (online program for computer class).  Just do the trainings and do well on the quizzes and exams then you're get an A. Also contribute to your group project. ATTENDANCE MANDATORY! ,0
She is very boring. The first 3 classes have been about GALILEO and research. She seems to mean well but her teaching style is so bad. She tells long unimportant stories that arent relevant to the course. Best part is the open text/ open google tests. Shes really liberal about device usage. Dont ask questions cause shell go off on a tangent.,0
"I LOVED Raquel!!!! She is definitely my favorite professor at LSU! She is so smart and knowledgable about a lot!! Her quizzes were pretty hard. There are two exams, a midterm and final, but she believes in group exams so you get to take them with someone. I failed almost every quiz but ended up with an A. Speeches are not bad at all!!",1
"Worst prof I've ever had. Ignores emails, 10+ minutes late to class (yet lectures about ""professionalism""), every quiz/lecture has errors. He often makes mistakes trying to solve problems on the board and his students have to help him out. 1/3 of class time is him talking about nothing act related. Very condescending. Get ready to teach yourself!",0
"Likes to help. Read his notes, and do the practice tests, they are very similar to the actual tests.",1
This class was hard and easy at the same time. He gives you study guides and thats mostly all the work. About 20 terms per chapter and three to four chapters per test. DEFINE the study guide and use it for the timed quiz and you should pass. Four exams thats it but they are tough.,1
His lectures tend to be extremely dry & boring but his dry humor and his tendency to have shorter lectures can make his lectures easier to deal with. He is a very interesting & knowledgeable person. There are some inconsistencies in grading on papers but that might be the T.A. You can easily get C+ to a B+ with minimal effort,1
"Probably the smartest man in the world when it comes to music history.  This class is soo much fun, tests are tough but the class is interesting, goes by quickly, and work for each class is minimal.  Has a tendency to call on people randomly in class.",1
"Ridiculously hard evaluations (Midterm, Final). Does tend to take questions directly out of the assignments for the final, therefore, memorization of the answers is a must. Otherwise, a nice and funny prof, albeit a bit arrogant.",0
"I'm not one to give such a poor review, but this is truly the worst class I've ever taken. He doesn't tell you how to do well, games are often unclear, way too much reading. I was so excited to take an untraditional class, but the stress and confusion was overwhelming. Don't recommend if you need structure, reasonable class load, or applicability",0
"Don't take his online class, ESPECIALLY during this pandemic. Totally unclear with his directions and doesn't provide clear feedback. Tests are difficult and study guides are confusing. Doesn't even teach, he just gives A LOT of readings and papers. To top it off, he's a VERY tough grader. I'm just taking this class because I have to. Horrible.",0
"Horrible teacher. If you want to do well on the tests, you have to read the book and study on your own, because he won't teach you. He talks a lot about things that do not have to do anything with the material.",0
Sure she knows her stuff on political analysis but she is a horrible professor. Pop quizzes on the days most kids are absent(like the day b4 thanksgiving) and 7 memos total in the class. She couldn't care less about her students and literally makes sure they do bad. The class is extremely boring and she makes sure we go overtime every class.,0
"A pretty awful professor (her lectures/powerpoints do not focus on what is on the exam at all -- it's like you're taking an exam for a different class). Goes on tangents about the importance of not being stressed but just stresses you out. After we went online due to virus, she completely abandoned the class and only did weekly ""check-ins.""",0
"This prof is amazing, knows his material very well. The things that bother me about him is that he does not have a book for this course, which sucks ass...and all lectures are by him...and he speaks too damn fast.Exam was easy",1
Great professor to teach an intro to psychology. He has had alot of case experience as a clinical psychologist that he uses in class. Test are based 1/2 on lecture and 1/2 on the text. He is very easy to talk to and made this class not horrible.,1
"Greenberg is probably one of the best professors I've had at UD. His class is very clear and if you pay attention for at least a little bit of it and read the notes you should do well. The topics  are very interesting and really not that difficult but you HAVE to read the notes otherwise they're impossible. Exams weren't bad, Final was a nightmare.",1
"The contents were not easy but Dr. Carpenter managed to explain almost everything. The paper is the best part of the course, it's challenging and you learn how to write a quality paper.",1
dont take her if you arent willing to study everything outside of class because youll have to. Takes the majority of time on hw problems so shell only lecture for 15min so you pretty much dont know anything. Shell throw random things on the board and expect you to know it. Doesnt explain the material at all.,0
Strongly recommend his class,1
Great all around teacher. I had her for first year as well as second year and I loved her teaching style.,1
George is a great professor. He provides his students with the necessary tools required for his essays. You can tell he cares for his students and their grades from the feedback he presents and the amount of discussions he has in his class where he allows students to voice their opinions and ideas on the subjects he offers.,1
"Dr. DeMicco was one of the best professors I have had at the University of Delaware. He has some amazing stories and is well respected by all of the students. Imparticular, his cruise ship management class was fantastic. He is very knowledgeable about the subject and provides us with the opportunity to see the operation first hand on a real cruise.",1
"I like Dr. Che, but his teaching style leaves much to be desired. This was a networking class. Everything is done in the Packet Tracer software. Che did not once open up Packet Tracer during the semester and actually DEMONSTRATE how to do basic configurations. Instead, he just scribbled some unintelligible drawings on the board. Nothing was learned",0
"His questions for the lab are unclear and you can interpret his questions in many ways, if you were lucky to interpret them his way, then you're good. He's also not really nice, sometimes he gets frustrated when we ask him questions. I decided not to attend his classes because he just vibrates negative energy, so I would try to solo my labs.",0
"Andy is a good guy, and his class is boring but okay.  The material is at times interesting, at times excruciatingly boring, but it's a required class, so you deal with it.",1
"His tests are ENTIRELY unpredicatable and the notes are sometimes useless.  His lectures are hard to follow, as he goes off into random sprees of talking about things that have NOTHING to do with the topic.  He also is VERY VERY biased and heavily liberal.  If you are conservative, he will assault all your values.",0
"Not accessible outside of class. She rarely answers emails, missed many office hours without giving notice, and does not post most grades. The tests and quizzes were very error prone so make sure you check all of your assignments. However, she makes it extremly difficult to do so. The class was much easier before we transitioned to online though.",0
This teacher was horrrrrible. she was so unorganized. her tests were so long and nearly impossible to ace. her grading makes absolutely noooo sense. she doesn't know how to do math. she makes absolutely nooo sense and doesnt understand herself either.,0
"His class was just really boring. The material wasn't bad, and you only have a few papers to do, but I always dreaded this class simply because he wasn't good at engaging the students.",0
"Overall amazing professor and would highly recommend to everyone! He has extremely dark humor and makes you look forward to coming to class. He helps you with essays and makes everything easy for you. 4-5 essays, easy final, and just a great time every class. Im taking him again for ENC1102 and would recommend for others!",1
"She's a very nice person but terrible professor. All we ever did was critiques, which are important, however she has given us hardly any instruction and is very harsh when it comes to critiquing.",0
"A very difficult class to do. I took her online so I didn't get to meet her in person. She was a very difficult grader and had very unclear instructions on her assignments. She has a lot of work for you to do, and I honestly would not recommend her unless you like difficult classes. A lot of the highest scores for assignments weren't even 100%.",0
"Spanish 1, great class. Very good professor, I felt like I learned more practical things about speaking spanish in one quarter than years in high school. Rolland-Mills is very nice and a good speaker. I love her facial expressions for some reason, lol. There is a LOT of oral group work everyday, which I really learned a lot from. 8AM's rough tho.",1
She was very helpful for lab. She knew what she was talking about and explained it until you understood.,1
"Pyrros is a funny old woman, she will make you laugh.  However, she has trouble understanding students questions and often goes way too quickly in class for students to understand.  If I did not take calculus in high school, I would not have done as well as I did.",1
"Hated this class but honestly, I could've worked a lot harder. Ahmed is a funny guy, and very knowledgeable about economics. He teaches lots of complicated stuff, but he almost always puts it into dumbed down real-world examples (they're still hard but at least you know its useful info). Tests are MC and homework is an easy 100/100. Not a bad optio",1
"IMPOSSIBLE!!! His lab quizzes are impossible, and his manual is full of random information not pertaining to the actual lab. It's basically loads of background information noone cares about.",0
"Dr. Collier took over this class for another professor who passed away. He is intelligent but is not personable. Grading is very hard but seems fair when feedback is given, however this is rare. For instance, on my final writing assignment I received only 2 comments on the entire paper. He stuck to the syllabus and course schedule. Do not recommend",0
"Easy class. Do what he says, study, and you'll pass with no problems.",1
Dr. Holt is extremely easy.  All you have to do is 15 assignments all year and take open book exams.  The assignments consist of you typing some numbers straight from the book and sending them to him over the internet.  Extremely easy.,1
"Only 1 final paper about 8-10 pages. 10 small assignment to lead you to your final paper. Those assignment were really helpful. She gives good feedback, and you will actually learn how to write a great paper.",1
"Very engaging lectures. Makes things that most people find boring fun to learn about. Will crack jokes about the material to keep you engaged and interested. His tests and homeworks are fair and challenging. His lectures may bounce around a lot from subject to subject, so be prepared to keep very good notes. Would definitely recommend.",1
"Dr. Hughes is a really nice guy, but this class is really difficult.  All of his lectures are online and he doesn't/rarely teach physics in class.  Defiantly do the homework and group work because it will help raise your grade. Take him only if you have time to learn physics on your own and not dealing with the stress of other classes. ",0
"The guy is funny ill give you that,but he already expects you to be almost perfect in GRAMMER.He calls his class ""grammar land"" fun right? His teaching method is horrible..The final was on a regret we have, I should have wrote about the regret i have for not dropping his class. Dont buy the fiction book only the Rules for writers(helpful)",0
"Has the ""fun teacher"" personality but publicly exploits students when they do something wrong or harps on when they ask a question he doesn't feel like answering. Also provided mandatory course content that wasn't even accessible for most students and told them to ask classmates to do it. Basically could fail if a classmate doesn't do me a favour.",0
"People like him a lot for some reason, but hes super full of himself and is just 100% wrong sometimes. He takes himself way too seriously, and to pass the class you just have to agree with whatever he says and even though its not at all what you said.",0
"Possibly one of the most vain, egotistical and uncomfortable professors I've ever known. He does know what he's talking about though. Just be sure to attend class and memories the slides.",0
"This class changed my life. I thanked him when I graduated, but it really wasn't enough. His wisdom saved me from myself. I owe him big time.",1
"Pretty good, certainly very nice.  Possibly not the best at teaching concepts, but teaches methods and reasons pretty well.  Test were a little too easy this year since lots of people got 100s on the first couple.  Good teacher overall though.",1
"he teaches the second half of the course, and i liked him and his exams way better than Fay Murrin's. Great proff, and good notes. This course is intersting, and i would have liked it alot more if it didnt have such hard labs. they are horrible and the lab instructor is such a pain in the ass. i truly hated those labs. lab final exam was brudal.",1
"Al certainly knows his stuff, but he's also a bit...awkward. He talks about sex every single class period. Really, he always manages to find a way to do it. As long as you follow the guidelines to your analysis you'll be fine...he can be a tough grader though. I went into explicit detail and managed to get an ""A"" on each analysis and in the class.",1
"Bruekner is an excellent professor. I would highly recommend his American Lit I course.  His lectures are very enjoyable. I only wish that the class was longer, so that I could learn more from him.",1
"Good prof, and has good lecture notes. Easy to follow, and you don't fall asleep in his class. Funny stories, less funny jokes.",1
"Make sure to read the book!!He gives out a 3-5 question quiz over the chapters. His tests consist of study guide that he wrote (it's like $20 in the book store) and random facts that he says in his lectures. Overall, he is a good prof, he cares a lot. Also, I think he might be one of the better RELI teachers. Quizlet is your best friend.",1
Got good grades for all three tests given during the semester. By the end he was making us do the same projects as CSC 142. The final was made up of concepts he said would not be on it. Did bad on the final and it dropped my grade down completely. Nice guy but does not know how to answer questions correctly.,0
"He is a nice guy who I think means well, but is not accomodating whatsoever. Tough marker without clear feedback, very tough class to get through for a whole year.",0
"Im not the kind of person who usually says this and I dont mean to be disrespectful, but I strongly recommend avoiding this prof! He mumbles, he doesnt answer questions clearly, and hes a tough/unclear grader. Very nice man and super knowledgeable, but this was one of the worst classes Ive had at uOttawa!",0
"Williams is nice enough, and I really like that he has projects along with exams. He's just, well, boring. He never has discussions, and considering we've all taken American History at least 2x before, it's annoying he only does the basics. This is a class that could be really cool-don't waste it on this guy. All the answers are APUSH answers, FYI.",0
"I have no doubt in my mind Professor Wright is good at what he does, but teaching is definitely not his thing. He will spend the first half of the semester telling you that he doesn't need to explain certain things because it is ""Basic high school algebra,"" let me tell you, it is not basic high school algebra. You need a lot of dedication to pass",0
"Awful prof, he doesnt teach, he only goes over whats in the book once and expects you to know it fluently. Expects you to be fluent in the oral exam(its a requirement to get 100%), give hours worth of homework a week. Exams all open ended, will give a zero On a problem for missing a letter in a word,no word Bank. Class runs over almost everyday.",0
"- An absolutely inhumane amount, most of which is incredibly un-interesting. She essentially assigns the same assignment four times a week. - rude, pretentious. - Half of the work is from the NYT which would be fine if the website didn't force me to log in six times - Giving a lot of work is one thing, doing it without teaching is another.",0
"She is a very nice lady but a terrible teacher. Her power points are pointless and they don't really explain anything. She doesn't explain the content also, making the class extremely boring. She makes study guides but they have up to 300 terms and statistics you need to know. So get ready to study your ass off.",0
"Professor Calkins is one of my favorite professors at JJay. The course materials were incredibly diverse, interesting, and engaging. Minimal work was required: 4 discussion posts, 5 quizzes, 1 final (MC/Short Response), and 1 written assignment. She's always accessible by email, quick grader, and provides good feedback. A true gem, take her class!",1
"After receiving 100% on all assignments and quizzes taken, she gave me a C because of a stupid analytical essay that she basically gave a failing grade to the entire class. do not take her because you will hate it, she never responds to your emails and if she does she will say ""it is what it is"" no compassion for her students",0
I loved him he can talk alot but he makes sure you know what you are doing and if yo dont he will help after class,1
"Chris is so funny which makes a pretty boring class super fun! He is so helpful. He does give pop quizzes quite often, but as long as you listen and pay attention, you'll do fantastic. Plus, it's only 5 T/F questions. Chris' tests are quite hard, but again, if you listen, you'll pass! 10/10 would recommend.",1
Great professor. Extreamly helpful after class and easy to talk to. Also had him for Recent American Lit and Philosophy of Everyday Life. Would highly recomend him to any English major.,1
"Dr. Igo is a very poor lecturer. This is a classic case of an Ivy League educated teacher who couldn't teach a high school biology course. The exams are based heavily on the readings. Also, the postlecture quizzes are a must if you want to do well. Save yourself some time, give your clicker to your friend and stay in bed for an extra hour.",0
"Great teacher! Has a sense of humor and brings food in for his students sometimes. Passing this class without studying every week for the quiz is difficult, so just study before the quiz. All of his lectures are posted on D2L so if you miss class you will still know what is going on.",1
"He is the worst professor ever, it is very hard to understand his accent with a very small English vocabulary to compliment that.  There are only 3 exams in the whole class which are nothing like the sample exams. Try to  take his class, he is a waste of time and has no idea how to teach. ",0
Best prof.,1
"Super nice professor, and he really tries to help and raise the class average. He covers everything exactly like he said he would. I would take him again. This class itself is pretty challenging, and for most people, it is the toughest in their degree. So be ready to study and work hard.",1
It was a class the met twice a week but it was all on the computer. My first day of class he told us to return the books. You basically taught yourself. he was a jerk. He had smart replies and made me feel dumb. I have always had an A in math classes and I told advanced math classes then I had his class and got a C+,0
"I really enjoyed this class to start with, but I found that Martin made the content more confusing than it should have been. You can learn the same amount from going to two weeks of his lectures as you can from watching a 12 minute YouTube video on the subject. He gives no application type questions, everything is theoretical, and only grades tests",0
"Madame Aunave is one of the kindest professors and long as you participate in class and ask for help when you need it, all she cares about is that you're trying to improve your French. Homework is usually just an activity or two every night that doesn't take longer than 30 min. Only complaint is when she does assign final projects its all at once.",1
"This was the weirdest class I've ever taken.  Still not sure what kind of geography it was.  Dr. J is hilarious and actually talks about interesting things.  Textbook homework was absurd, but necessary because the tests were half open book.  The key is to not leave the homework until last minute.  Easy A if you do all of the assignments.",1
Dr. Mark was absolute hell to deal with. This courseload is beyond ridiculous and she is not understanding about you being in another classes that require your time. She does not respond to emails and if she does she is beyond rude to you and does not offer any help. There are major projects due each week. Her husband also attends every class.,0
"Dr. Aktas knows his stuff. Lectures typically consist of proofs and practically no worked problems. If you consider not going to class, at least just go and listen. Gives multiple one question quizzes throughout the semester as listed on the syllabus. Quizzes and tests come straight off the homework. Seemed generous w/ grading all things considered",1
"Great professor that really knows physics well. Funny and cool guy, highly recommend him",1
"Best Acct professor EVER!  I learned so much from Dr. Schisler.  Take notes, go to class, and listen to his great stories.  You'll have an A, promise.",1
"Worst professor I have ever had in any department. He is very old fashioned and quite chaotic in his teaching. It was impossible to follow what he was talking about. There wasn't any assessment based on the content of the course just the readings, but he made it very clear that if you missed class (he took attendance) that he would grade you poorly",0
"He wants to help students learn, but expects much too high a level of understanding for a 100 level class. The exams are VERY difficult (average student getting under 40%)and require a much deeper level of understanding than the homework. Harsh grader. I would avoid his class at all cost unless you can do vector calc in your sleep.",0
"Bad teacher, even worse curriculum. For being a professor of education, she has a lot to learn about teaching college students. If you have a choice, DONT take her, you'll be thankful in the long run. Very demanding class and Wong isnt helpful.",0
"Metzger is the worst professor I think I've ever had. IF YOU HAVE HER DROP NOW. She doesn't address the class until 20 minutes after class begins, she expects you to learn on your own, and she calls last names from the role to answer questions in lieu of teaching.  Your grade is based on 6 tests and a presentation.  Avoid at all costs.  Seriously.",0
"Waste of time completly, no feedback from teacher, talks about random irrelevant stuff most of the time (e.g. his children), I regret taking him for the second semester in a row.",0
"Hardest class ever. He makes you buy his textbook, which is full of errors. He makes Calculus 1 the hardest class. Don't recommend him, take someone else to save your grades.",0
"Good guy, putrid teacher. He's  nice and funny and will try his best to help if you ask but don't expect anything. He talks very slowly and boringly, but still can't communicate his expectations or assignment criteria. Seems like he doesn't want to be there. He refuses to even give you your grade. Mandatory attendance makes it absolutely unbearable",0
assignments not clear; he did not return emails or calls promptly if at all; had favorites in class,0
Professor Ostlund provided timely and valuable feedback. She would not accept late assignments after 1 week. She followed the rubrics. In all she is an excellent instructor and I would take another course from her.,1
"Super easy class. The lectures are too slow in my opinion, but she certainly explains everything. I've heard that if you need help, she will take the time to work with you outside of class.",1
DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR FOR ANY BIOLOGY CLASS. HORRIBLE GRADER AND HORRIBLE CONTENT. SPENDS SO MUCH TIME ON ONE TOPIC AND THEN RUSHES AT THE END OF THE SEMESTER FOR EVERYTHING ELSE,0
"not super helpful towards of the end, and information is not entirely clear, especially questions on exams",0
He doesn't follow the syllabus to teach. Hard to understand.,0
"I liked Dr. Amstutz, he has immense personal experience, and teaches through stories-- you must read the book to do well in the class.",1
There are 5 tests and 2 extra credit opportunities. I advice you to take part of the extra credit to have that as a boost for your grade bc if you flop on all the exams its a wrap for your grade. Knox isn't the worst but he isn't the best either. Assigned seating. The class was interesting as far as speakers & videos. Fairly recommend. Late course.,0
"It's a shame he was the only option for this course. Took it over winter. Definitely should have waited to take a different professor. He is the most arrogant professor I have had so far. If you love unnecessary busy work and ridiculous grading policies then you're in luck. Also, read the syllabus inside and out, DONT miss anything.",0
Smyth is extremely organized and is very passionate about his subject of expertise which makes learning it a lot easier. All of the assignments and papers directly relate to the subject matter. He encourages in-class discussion and is happy to answer questions. And dont worry- youll get used to the lisp. It adds character to his lectures.,1
"Mr. Moulds is part of the ""Jones experience."" He has a sarcastic sense of humor that I enjoyed. Great man and great class.",1
"Prof. Lombardo is da bomb! Lecture powerpoints are posted on Blackboard and assignments are super easy. Usually 10-15 question assignments online and they're due the night before class. There was a syllabus quiz and two concept quizzes, of which he will only take the higher score. He sincerely cares about his students and is always willing to help.",1
I thought he was hard in statics.  Boy was I wrong..... get ready for some unwanted anal sex if you take Design 2 with him.  Am NOT looking forward to taking Controls....,0
I really never read the assigned reading and still made a B in the class just from listening to his lectures and soaking everything in! So fortunate to have sailed on the SS Silverman during my time at Winthrop!! I'd take more of his upperlevels if I had more time.,1
"Read word-for-word from Powerpoint so didn't really teach the material. Tests were extremely difficult in comparison to her level of teaching and included trickily worded questions. Was very vague when it came to project instructions and would then grade very strictly, claiming aspects where missing that she didn't ask for.",0
"Took the course in Fall '08. Lecture notes are clear and easy to read, but they're available online, so don't bother going to class. She just reads her notes anyways. I only went to about 4/5 lectures the whole sem. Assignments require some thought and work, but plenty of time to complete paper. Her final was impossibly easy, mostly knowledge q's.",1
"Dont recommend him. Assignments arent necessarily hard but hes a tough an unfair grader. Dont take this class unless youre an English major and know everything about humanities of the modern world, because he will find many writing errors. Grading is pretty inconsistent. Would never take another class with him.",0
The class itself is kind of tedious but Prof. Lange is great and makes it interesting. Also a genuinely great guy.,1
"Do not take this teacher. Extremely unorganized and never responds to emails, also barely puts work up on time for online class until half the class emails her so she has to extend the deadlines and make assignments due in 2 days rather than the week. Many long, pointless assignments 10+ pages that she won't grade until 2 months later. Just don't..",0
"For a communications teacher, she does not know how to communicate at all with her students. I took this as an online 16wk course and I wish I could've taken someone else. She doesn't give any real guidance on what to do with the speeches or the assignments so you're basically on your own. And she's an extremely tough grader so beware.",0
"dan was a nice guy, but was always late, and frequently didn't even show up at all! there where many times when we went to class on wasted train/bart/parking tickets 'cuz he stood us up or was sick. he wasted time by showing internet videos of silly irrelevant to the class videos, and he never used the makeup classes to teach us missed material!",0
"Unfortunately, I thought professor dutz was going to be a lot better than she was taking into consideration all of her positive reviews. she organizes the class in the most inefficient way possible, 2 tests practically determine your grade and all you do the entire class is a packet full of questions and a meaningless lab. Go to OCC for chem",0
"He is a great professor, and goes into depth with his lectures. Just make sure you read the assigned chapters and the class will be a piece of cake.",1
She made me want to drop out of college and move to another country.,0
"Im not going to say what every1 else did. yes, his test is hard, and no, his class is typical. read the books and know it like the back of ur hand... bc u will regret it if u dont for the exams... make sure u do chem everyday but u sophie losers should know that... and yes im still in sophie davis!!!",1
he knows his stuff..makes you do like 3 things at once..curves tests..2 presentations for each group..plays simulation game,0
I think 17 out of our last 20 days shes given us assignments. Some things are easy but some VERY time consuming. She makes class significantly harder than it should be. My main issue however is not the amount of work its the due dates. If you have something going on that day you're going to be up late trying to get it done by 12.,1
"She isn't the most sympathetic professor, but it is so easy to pass the class. She offers so much extra credit and you can take the quizzes until you get 100% on them. Show up to class though because there are little in-class responses that add up to 150 points throughout the semester. You have to attend 2 concerts and write about them. Overall OK.",1
"The worst professor ever in NC state. He doesn't teach, and he's not organized at all. Try to avoid him whatever costs you!!!!",0
This person is extremely unpunctual and disorganized. He is probably an excellent researcher but university should not definitlly allow him into classroom to teach students .,0
Dr. Foster is simply AMAZING! :) I really enjoyed taking her class. She makes you want to be a middle school teacher.   She gives really good feedback and she is a perfect motivator! Take her if you can :),1
"She gave extra credit on her midterm (most of the class got a 70 or less), but she also gave grades that seem arbitrary (there were no explanations for the grading). As an honors liberal arts student, this is the only B I have ever received in an English course. Her lectures are nonexistent so don't expect to learn anything (class is mandatory tho)",0
"Nelson is old school all the way.  Well, at least he's old.  He's a very nice guy, who does a good job giving lots of examples, so if you do poorly, it's your own fault.  He loves to say fooey",1
"This professor is my favorite professor I've ever had. You do get homework every week but it takes maybe 10 minutes, his exams are easy as easy can get (he goes over the entire exam the class before) and there is no way you'll fall asleep because he constantly keeps your attention. I adored his class so much, I took this semester his Into to Anthro",1
She is a great teacher but a bad tester. She expects way too much on her quizzes and tests. Grading scale is rough too.,1
very laid back atmosphere,1
"Looking for an easy A, this professor isn't the one. The course is unorganized, unclear what assignments are, doesn't clarify where to submit assignments, requires you to attend meetings outside of the class time. Lectures are interesting & interactive but the course work is too much. Don't recommend taking this course with other difficult classes",1
"He seems to know a lot, however he is a scatter brain, VERY hard to follow... I would never take him again",0
"I would have preferred the term challenging as opposed to ""easiness"".",1
Great teacher!! I took her class as a hybrid and was able to get an A no problem. Just do the work and you'll be fine. She's really nice and helpful too!!,1
"not the most interesting prof, but not horribly boring. Nice guy who explains well",1
She is sooooo boring. All she does is read ppt slides. A bit of a flake. Did not learn a thing in her class.,0
"Let's be honest, it's bio so there's a lot of material and reading which is understandable but the way she manages the class is horrible. There are so many things you need to do and they don't even relate to each other. I like biology and don't afraid putting the work for school but she makes it so bad. A V O I D H E R A T A L L C O S T S.",0
"Makes Math 31 super easy. Added bonus: she cancels class alot-4 times this quarter already. I agree with what others said that you won't like how she talks to you and that you don't really learn much,but who cares? Hardly any homework,tests are just like homework, lets class out early alot, cancels class. Horrible prof but easy class.",0
He was just awesome in every aspect and was able to work with you.,1
"Debbie is a great professor and kind personloves teaching and wants students to succeed. I found her entertaining and appreciated her candidness. She explained concepts well and illustrated their relevance. Final was stressful, but all other exams are easy if you attend class, do most of the HW and study for a few hours. Group project was painful.",1
"Incredibly boring lectures. I was able to teach myself out of the book and still do well in the class. The group project isn't too bad, but the directions are incredibly unclear and he had to be asked multiple times for things to become clear. Easy class if you read the slides and do practice problems. So boring though. ",0
"Cailtin Burke means well and is very sweet, but if you have no prior knowledge in calculus I don't recommend that you take her class. All you do in the class is very heavy note taking to the point where it is impossible to read what you just wrote and it made the weekly quizzes hard to study for. I barely passed even though I put in so much effort.",0
His lectures were useless as they were very hard to understand and the tests were difficult.,0
Brown was my favorite teacher in the psych department and I can't really understand the issues other people have with him here. He presents the material (that I actually find interesting) in the most easy and straightforward manner so that it's very easy to get an A if you simply take time to study your class notes.  He's very openminded and kind.,1
"Sam is a great guy who really knows what he's talking about. If you have questions, he will definitely answer them. He really seems to understand students. His lectures are interesting, but my only complaint is that they lack structure and are quite repetitive. Overall, if you come to lecture and take decent notes, you will probably get an A.",1
"Funny, but an early riser. Prepare to read a lot, and some pop quizzes are easier than others. He's actually such a little pumpkin. I don't mind him, but sometimes I feel like it is his opinion or the highway. I learned a lot.",1
"real jerk. but a good lecturer, I guess.",1
"I took this class online for the January session so it was extremely condesnsed. Homework almost every day which was to be expected but if you're good at time management, it's a really good way to knock out some credits. Prof H gives really good feedback and grades fairly. I never met him in person but he seemed nice through email.",1
"Be aware. He'll say that he wants you to get a ""general understanding of the concepts presented in lecture"", to focus more on the lecture than the readings, which are supposedly to ""complement the material covered in class"". What he will expect on the exam is to refer to several readings per question by both title and author and use specific terms.",0
"Sweet lady, gives out bonus opportunities, but tests are hard. Whenever she gives out the reviews, its hard to understand what she is asking for on the test. Overall, the class is good, but the first test made half the class drop. You must study a lot in order to pass her exams. Also, she mainly refers to the textbook, so read lots of that.",1
"DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID!! I thought this course might be an easy elective option, but no. The lectures are recorded but they are literally just close up videos of her face, NO powerpoint or anything. The syllabus is extremely misleading and the evaluation criteria is very unclear. Plus, very unorganized. Dropping it ASAP.",0
Getting an A in this class is impossible and do not count on getting a B either.  Avoid him at all costs,0
"I took an ELI course with Professor Parker and she was extremely helpful. It's not an ""easy"" A, but what part of college should be? It's math and it requires some learning. She is responsive and explains things so students understand. I'd take her again in a heart beat.",1
"The average grade on the first exam was a 52%...I don't know if it's this class or the department or what but students are feeling like they have no way to succeed. GVSU has a serious problem in its accounting department. If you want to take the class ACC 212 good luck, truly.",0
Ron is a great prof. He's worked in the business not only as an actor but as a playwright as well. He knows what he's talking about. I can see how people might not enjoy him but take a few extra minutes outside of class to talk to the man and you'll find he's incredibly understanding and intelligent. Great guy.,1
"I never liked Biology, but when I took it with Schulze, he made it much more tolerable than anyone else. He's good at keeping your attention in lecture and also cracks jokes to make bio not so boring. He'll also turn you into an environmentalist.He Rules!",1
r,0
"I had this class at 8am and it was online so that itself was a little difficult for me. He puts out a lot of information in his lectures so make sure to take a lot of notes and study. There will only be 5 grades, all tests. The final is worth 25%, the other four are worth 18.75%. If you take notes make sure to study them. You will have to read too.",0
"His class appears way easier than it actually is, for much of the first half of the class it will seem as though it is not an upper level class, but that is not how the 2nd and 3rd exams are set up. The grading scale is also sneaky tough. I would say go to every class for extra credit, read all power point slides and use them on practice quizzes.",0
"Took this class last minute as an elective and thoroughly enjoyed it. One of my favourite classes I took at McGill. Learned a ton, and it was a great intellectually stimulating experience.",1
"Great professor, great guy! Dr. Cogan loves sharing his knowledge on cinema. He teaches Irish cinema, Eastern European, and Japanese cinema.",1
"so Hamilton is a super sweet lady, she can be forgetful and jump around a lot. There's 3 test. the last one is the easiest, and the first 1 will be the hardest bc her grading style is VERY unique. So you have to see what she is looking for. Do the readings bc those are the pop quizzes. Theres no final just can easy project the requires some effort",1
Ask questions. Morgan will always get back to you and keep working till you get it.,1
"I took SB113-114 with Compeau my freshman year and had a great experience.  He doesn't teach in the normal sense, as he puts you through real life tests, as he sits back and keeps an eye out for problems. The class itself was easy, but Compeau knows that the best way to teach is through experience, which leads to the business creations",1
"Was probably born with a silver spoon in his mouth. Arrogant. Talks down. He's a philosophy professor, but if you go four years at UVic in the Philosophy department without hearing about his association with the Law school a million times, you deserve some sort of medal.",0
"O dear God, worst class ever.   Very nice man but teaching is not or should not be this mans profession.  Stick to digging up rocks my man.",0
Unfair grading,0
"Dr. Amato is a great professor. He isn't easy, but he knows his stuff and has a great sense of humor. As long as you show up to class and pay attention, he'll be a big help.",1
DO NOT TAKE HER. Her attitude is poor. She hands back work very late. She talks more about history than english. She gives out work but does not really teach.  ,0
"Great professor. He really cares about his students and wants them to be successful, but you have to put in the work as well. The tests were somewhat difficult but if you study the study guide and homework (he gives a short hw assignment a week before you have a test), then you should do well on the tests.",1
"Started on campus, was very lecture heavy, speaking almost entirely in French from day one. Transitioned to an online course (Covid) and the lectures/teaching stopped for the most part. Zoom sessions were mainly review for what you learned on your own with VHL/HW. Offers little to no help outside of the classroom. Don't recommend.",0
"Passionate about his subject, but lectures can be hard to follow. He tells stories with no relevance to the curriculum. What you read and what he lectures does not always equate to the same. To do well on his test, take notes on what he says in class and write that as your answer.",0
arthur was my advisor and then also my thesis advisor and he was absolutely the best.  i am going to grad school in structural biochemistry bc of him.  number one prof at reed in my opinion.,1
changed my entire perspective on english,1
"worst professor ever, his quizzes are straight from the textbook, so if you dont read it, you wont pass at all. i read the book over and over and gets 40s. class is pointless, yet he takes attendance all the time. thank god this is online now because i dont know if id pass at school",0
"If you read the syllabus, did your work, all should be fine.  Stop complaining about the most challenging, helpful, resourceful, and structured instructor in the department. Need I say he is well published? Get a life slackers!!!",1
great professor. get him if you can. he takes his time to explain and teach his lessons. show up to class though!! understands how it's like to be a student.,1
"Doesnt teach, avoid his class",0
I learned a lot from her.,1
"He does a great job of teaching math so that you understand every step. Material gets hard towards the end. He curves so that's good. He is a caring, relaxed and fair professor. I would recommend taking a class with him.",1
"The worst professor at GW by far. Not only is he a horrendous professor, he is one of the rudest human beings I have ever met. He makes you feel like you are dumb when you ask questions during office hours. If you don't do the work his way on the homework, exams, and quizzes, he penalizes you. He should not be a professor. Do NOT take him.",0
"Very interesting lectures. Not always the most understanding though and you have to work hard to get a good grade. Despite surface appearances, he does care about students, as long as you put in the  effort he will try to help you. Not an easy class but I enjoyed it. He also gave you a textbook for free, but I never actually used it.",1
"Sorry to say, but this professor does not need to be teaching. I don't think he understand the meaning of what he is suppose to do, TEACH. Reads off projector and always states that everything is self explanatory. Study guides only given if he feels like it. Cannot handle constructive criticism. I would strongly advise not to take.",0
"I really loved this class and his lectures. There's a lot of reading but I just skimmed them and read in depth for the readings I used for the papers, so it's doable. Papers were the toughest part for me but there's help available from TA's and Professor Kim. Discussion participation is worth a lot so be ready to participate",1
"His test are hard, questions come from in class discussion and the book.  He gives three busy work projects and has no since of humor.",0
"I took him for contracts and then went to law school. Turns out if you actually want to learn contracts this isn't the place to do it. Bizarrely he teaches torts. I don't even know how he got through law school. If you want an easy A, take him. All you have to do is read his power points. If you want to actually learn contracts run far, far away.",0
SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
"Easily the worst prof i've ever had. Not only are his lectures horrible as he writes everything tiny on a chalk board, he is also easily the rudest and most condescending man I have met. If you want to pass, buy the notes from the tutor company.",0
"She is a respectable scholar, but not necessarily fit for the teaching profession. She pretends very hard to have a balanced way of thinking when it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but her bias shines RIGHT THROUGH. Not the most accommodating instructor either.",0
"Professor Gulick was just terrible. I did not like the class at all, and the TAs were not very helpful either. Overall, just avoid her at all costs.  ",0
"Can explain things clearly enough, but don't expect much help if you have a question. Refuses to make eye contact with anyone & is really moody. You basically need to set of fireworks to get his attention.",0
"Goes off topic 90% of the time during the lecture. Super tough grader, always said we would do workshops in class to help people with what they were struggling with, but it never happened.",0
I love Professor Lee. He's so helpful and his class was so interesting. he's also just a gem of a human being. My one complaint is that his lectures and powerpoints are slightly all over the place and I couldn't really follow enough to take thorough notes.,1
"Taking travel class with him and he's great.  A lot of work for the class but the stuff he taught you is important. Even though some people say they take summer course with him and got a lot of work, that's how sumemr courses are. You have less time but need to fit all the work. Prof. is very helpful.",1
Extremely tough grader. Assignments are due in the middle of the day. No clear instructions. Just assignments and tests. Communication was horrible. Grades would be input incorrectly on multiple occasions.,0
Professor Lam issa GOAT!,1
"The grades were based heavily on the test and quizzes. The homework did not match the lectures, the quizzes didnt match the labs or lecture. And nothing matched what we were supposed to Learn",0
wrong...just wrong,0
"Maybe it's just because i took this class online, but i felt like i was completely alone in this class. I kept emailing him to give me feedback on what i need to do better to get better grades, but when he would email me back he just made me feel so stupid. He would never tell me specifically what i got wrong and what the correct answer was.",0
Gives little to no information about assignments.,0
"Text book isn't used a lot but is definitely a valuable resource when studying for tests. Dr. Racine really cares about his students and is always willing to answer questions you have. There is an 8 page news paper analysis research paper, but Racine is very good about helping and doing everything he can to make the paper easier for you.",1
"Class can be ""slightly"" boring but this is probably the easiest  comp class I've taken. Just don't skip class, cause he gives examples that later come on the midterm and final.",0
After the first day of class I knew exactly what hw I would need to do and when to turn it in for the entire term. He gives good feedback on tests and hw after 2 or 3 days. His lecture are well structured and he is able to explain things in multiple different ways so everyone can understand. attendance only matters on the weekly workshops.,1
"He is not an awful professor, however if you have no background of Calculus whatsoever I would find a different professor. He goes quick and a lot of the concepts he teaches I learned differently in high school. He also has an accent which makes it more difficult to listen and follow along. Tests are straightforward and you will have online hw.",0
"Text is an easy read, esp. for people not fluent in lawyer speak. Discussions are 2-3 questions per week, easy if you do the reading. Mid-term & Final are indepth, multi, T/F, essay. Prof is SUPER helpful and stays on top of everything. Would recommend him.",1
"Professor Lenhart is very nice but way disorganized. He rarely uses canvas, grades at the last minute, and assigns random group projects that don't apply to the class. He put off the quizzes he wanted us to take until the final so we had so much work during finals. If you take a class from him prepare to be bored and frustrated.",0
"I forget the course code, but it was Early Modern Europe.  Awesome teacher, great subject. The TA I had was gorgeous.",1
"She is one of the most responsible prof i have throughout my university career. She cares about students: She spends extra 20-30 minutes after class to answer the questions students have in the course material. Also, she gave non-graded quiz to the class and solve them in class to test our understanding on each chapter. One of the best prof!",1
"Teaches from pictures from book. Not very helpful, hard grader,must read the book to pass.",0
"She is VERY vague in her instructions for EVERYTHING.  So you never know what is going on or what she expects. But she takes you for walks outside and cancels class all the time just so you can go walk outside by yourself, so there's that. Also, don't buy her course pack, it's a waste of money.",0
"took the honors section. I also got a 5 on AP BC calc b4 the class.  Honestly, I think this class is hard as anything. He explains all the proofs, but also is hard to understand.. Homework is extremely tricky.  Leave plenty of time for it.  Tests are hard&short, don't spend too much time on ?'s.  review notes & the text & should be fine.",0
Dr. Joe is great and really wants everyone to succeed. He tests if you truly understand the material as opposed to memorizing everything. He's the best professor I have had up to this point. I highly recommend taking him.,1
The information in this class was really interesting and he was a really nice professor. I thought the lectures were interesting but he would only cover a very small amount of the material that we needed to know and he writes very little on the board so it was challenging for me to take good notes. Reading the book is necessary and lengthy!,1
"Not bad. Gave good feedback on drafts and papers, but was very rude in emails. Made me feel like I shouldn't email her for questions.",1
"Hard to understand. Hard class, lots of homework. Just not my kind of learning",0
"Really good prof, just realized he looks like Todd McLellan :P you can get by with just past exams and midterms that he posts. Lectures are rlly helpful",1
"I wish I could tell my past self to ignore lectures, read the textbook, do the (not graded, but helpful) homework, and use the slides for review. There are 4 exams in this class (one is the final) and nothing else, so it's difficult to keep your grade up. If ochem doesn't click for you, get a tutor, spend lots of time with the text, and work hard.",0
She was very confusing and hard to understand not very relateable or helpful. Easy class if you watch the videos from mrs. ryan online on mymathlab.,0
"Best professor I've had here at Texas State! As long as you did the homework you could just copy the work, we had a total of 15 quizzes and she dropped 5!  extra credit opportunity, and if you took all 15 quizzes you got extra credit as well! explains content very clear. Tests are easy as long as you study quizzes and HW. QUEEN OF PARTIAL CREDIT",1
"Madame Gray was a great help throughout the entire semester. She always made herself available if you needed some help outside of class so as to better understand the content that you were going through. She does give you some difficult assignments, but after you feel very accomplished and much better about your french knowledge. Greatly recommend ",1
Absolutely loved his class! will definitely make you have to think. very laid back. easy homework. no tests just three essays due at midterm and final.,1
"3 assignments, 12% each. 1st assignment was unorganized, 3rd assignment was vague. Expects you to memorize little details word for word from the reading assignments. Everything covered was too general. I feel like I learned nothing in this class. Hopefully next time he will use a textbook.",0
Lectures the whole class with little room for student feedback and overshares during lectures. Gives very superficial remarks on assignments. Expect no grades online the whole semester. Expect emails to go ignored.,0
"Tenure is his saving grace. Professor Hua Lu is a knowledgeable and respected researcher, but he is also a  confused  and incomprehensible instructor. Attendance is lecture is remarkable, with maximum 7-9 students during lecture from a 150+ course registry. I recommend buying the book, do your homework, read every chapter, and pray. Good luck.",0
Fail me although he knows my difficult situation,0
"Lectures are dry when he is talking about the course content, but when he goes off topic those are the best lectures. If you are able to understand all the assignments, you will easily get an A. This course does take some self learning, but trust me overall you will do fine, don't overthink/over react about anything in this course.",1
"Stat/Math can be a hard topic if you've been out of school for awhile, however the professor makes it extremely difficult to feel like you get it. The hw and test questions were confusing. I had 3 different tutors, and they even seemed confused about what he was asking. Class avg for exams was 50% I think that says a lot about his teaching ability.",0
"Brother Peck is nice person, however, he has too high of expectations of us. Yes, I understand history is a lot of memorizing, but this is ridiculous. The amount he expects us to memorize is too much considering we're just learning this and its only a 14 week course. I think he believes that our lives revolve around only is class.",0
Tabea is a well groomed teacher. She always look professional and is always ready for her lectures. You cant use your cellphone in class otherwise you will et deducted professionalism marks. She is an easy marker and tries to crack once in a while. Make sure you choose a great group for your project otherwise you will fail.,1
"Horrible professor. Seems like a good person, but will not help if asked. Had questions with a case study. Basically looked at me and said she won't help me. Tests are tough. Math is easy, but multiple choice will cover stuff not said in class. Take another professor if possible.",0
"Professor Wright is always accessible out of class and for the most part responds to emails very quickly. She at times is a little dull but I would take over again because she really does care about her students. Although she assigned a lot of homework, it prepares you for the exam. She also gives extra credit.",1
"Prof. B is an excellent teacher and really knows how to break down the material. That being said, she is a very tough grader and it is hard to get an A in her class. She moves extra fast but the end of the semester is not too stressful.",1
"You read a different book every single week. If you don't read the books, you will be SOL for the final, and the two essays he assigns. Once you chime in on a question, he will hound you for what else he wants to hear so make sure you actually read the materials and not just skim through. Dull material unless you're into that kind of thing.",0
"Probably one of the more harder classes Ive taken at Cal. If you dont like to read, please dont take the class. The amount of information covered is unrealistic, regardless of your familiarity with the region (middleeast/neareast) you still have to work just as hard as your classmates for a good grade. You will def learn loads in this class",1
"I took a condensed semester, and she was really helpful and made sure that we weren't overwhelmed. Our discussions were easy as were our other assignments. A very pleasant class.",1
Worst Professor.,0
Great prof. Funny. Easy going. Smart. Good in-class arguments and participation. One of the best profs. in Philosophy. Would have him again,1
I have always gotten As in my classes besides this one. He grades crazily and will give you an 89.9999999% before he gives you an A. He expects you to put the date a person took their first baby steps and their blood type on tests in order to give you an A. Dont take him,0
"Really nice guy, really smart, should NOT be teaching this math class.  This guy is so smart that he tries to simplify things to the point where it makes absolutely no sense.  If you take his class, prepare to be extremely confused.  He never really answers your questions but if you go to his office hours he's kind of helpful.  Try to stay away.",0
Tests are easy and they are done as a group he also give tons of extra credit,1
Quizzes were out of 5 and weighted for a large portion of your mark and questions were ambiguous,0
"Excellent teacher, extremely brilliant. Dr. Pellathy is one of the biggest assets to SVC. Even in you do not take Poly-Sci or Criminal Law courses, I would reccommend taking at least one course from the good Doctor.",1
His online Exam due to the pandemic was absolutely brutal. The exam was 22 questions in 30 minutes with very hard questions. He did not do us any favours. Will most likely fail the class due to the lack of time on the exam,0
As long as you do your work every week. The class is fine.,1
Guy is a clown. Lectures make no sense and aren't helpful for the exams or HW. At least the exams are fair. Just cram the textbook and don't even listen to him,0
"Awful prof. It's a miracle that she made it through grad school. I have actually witnessed her throwing an eraser at another professor. She is an abusive hack. Dido: Publish something besides a travel brochure, you lazy low life.",0
Just teach yourself. Not worth the money. Must be a part-time job for him.,0
"Good slides, tough grader though. She is passionate about what she teaches but be prepared to blindly agree with her viewpoints on your homework and papers for better marks. She knows her subject though, and if you show and follow her guidelines, you should be able to grab an A- at the least. Bonus: Pay attention to her films!!",1
"Professor Walsh is AMAZING! I have taken CJ 300 and CJ 400 with him, and I must say that those have been my favorite classes at SFSU. For CJ 300, it consists of 2 Case Briefs, 3-4 take home quizzes, a field study paper at the very end of the semester, and a response final exam. Walsh is a great story teller and helps you picture the cases. TAKE!!!!",1
He literally left for almost the entire lab and left the I.A. to do everything(who couldn't explain anything). They've been using the same confusing labs for a minimum of ten years.,0
"Trust me, RUN THE OTHER WAY! She is one of the professors that when I was asked, ""What did you learn in her class?"" I replied, ""I learned that Denise is impossible to please."" She grades at an unreasonably difficult level. Her directions are vague and if she asks you cite 10 sources in your paper, if you want an A, you'll need to cite 20-30.",0
"I thoroughly enjoyed his lectures, he's hilarious!  He does his best to make a very dry topic interesting and relevant, which was easy this year given the election in Nov.  Come to class, read the material he posts, take good notes (if he writes, you'd better write it too), and you'll be fine.  Always willing to answer questions and clarify.",1
"A true living saint. She loves St. Mary's and all her students she really wants you to succeed. One time I was taking a test and she could see I was questioning if I was right or not and she made the comment ""I really like the look of that graph"" would take her class again just to have her as my professor again",1
"For a three hour online class she assigned hours of homework every week, typically given only 4 days prior to the due date and made you stay for the full 3 hours online with only a 15 minute break. She gets very behind on grading and is hard to get ahold of by email. Because of this it is hard to receive feedback on how you are doing in the class.",0
"Her classes are only 50 minutes per week and they are completely useless. She is so lazy and does not want to put any effort into teaching. A student ask her questions during class and it took her weeks to get a proper response. Shari also uses past cases as her exams, so for the student that have access to internet, the solution is seconds away.",0
"I hated this guy while I had him, but in the end he passed me. This is not to say I didn't bust my backside trying, and in the end that is what made the difference. Study hard if you take him because that is all that will save you. Accounting is a miserable subject no matter who you take.",0
"Hilarious start to every cl****. Knows how to keep the ""flow"" going, knows how to ""read"" the crowd,and knows when to change gears.",1
"These kind of person, we should not even call them teachers, yet I don't know why they are hired as a teacher.",0
"I honestly think he's tired of teaching. The class is super fast paced so make sure you go and pay attention. The tests are extremely difficult and he makes them himself. If you have trouble, go to his office... He will literally be open to help with anything. A lot of students dislike him but I think he's a decent professor.",1
"Do yourself a favor and STEER CLEAR of this course/professor. She has terrible rapport with students. Unpredictable, unkind. And this coming from someone who did well in her class.",0
"Don't want to take Jazz from her, she has no idea what she is doing, cant do a double turn to save her life. She is MUCH nicer than Jonette though, so put up with her, cuz Jonette will make you cry. Just go to all the classes and do well on journal.",0
She was nice but the class was not well organized and you kind of get set up to not do well.,0
"I chose this class as an elective to finish my Masters Degree and just dropped it because the required reading was insane. I was sick the first two weeks of the class and got behind in reading and was never able to catch up. I took notes and highlighted and when it came time to take the test,nothing I had read was on there! I do not recommend.",0
"Feedback is rude and condescending, makes you feel stupid even when you get the right answer. I was told I used the word ""or"" wrong",0
"He is a really nice man, extremely helpful.  I'm in a history class for university studies and he's in the process of making it more computerized.  In that aspect, his class is easier than previous semesters I have heard.  Overall, he seems like a very clear teacher who outlines his expectations for his students.  If you ever need help or advise on a project, he is more than willing to meet with you to help.  I would recommend him for his classes.",1
Very boring professor who seems to drag on lecture as everyone falls asleep. Does not seem to care about students or their situations and is not very helpful in person individually either. Would try to take another professor.,0
He makes no sense. Will talk about the same topic the entire semester and expect you to understand the test material. This class was a joke. Nobody did good.,0
Most terrible teacher. Never teaches anything and wants to screw everyone all the time. change rules of grading in the middle of the semester so everyone can be screwed more.,0
"Dry teaching, takes herself way too seriously. and just an all around unkind person. The only William & Mary professor I truly dislike. When I was struggling w/ depression over sexual assault and not doing my best work, she was cruel, unprofessional, and had no leniency. Clearly does not care about her students mental health or wellbeing at all.",0
I found myself often feeling very upset in class. She centres people out in front of everyone and embarrasses them. I felt sick most classes wondering if I was next to be picked on that I couldn't even focus. My advice is to try your best to go unnoticed by her.,0
"He likes to have a lot of classroom participation and is very energetic, but does it in a wrong way. Tries to take feedback from students but lots of times gets lost in what the feedback actually is. Picks on people a lot, and attendance is taken every class, so if you sometimes skip, might not be the best choice.",0
"The class would benefit from having a textbook alongside lectures. He goes through the material pretty fast, but he does cover everything. The class suffers from the same problem as every MGMT class, which is that the tests are subjective and extremely vague. During COVID, the final was a two day test that took students an average of 7 hours",0
"I took this class during winter session. So it was a 6 week accelerated course, with a lot of information to take in, in a very short period of time. She did an excellent job of covering the material so everybody could understand it, and was willing to help students personally if they were confused on anything.",1
"The online course for this had no attendance requirements. Prof is very easy going, is open to feedback, and shows he cares for his students. Busy work is a minimum, and the content can be tricky. Lectures are good for them being about economics, and sometimes curves tests and quizzes if the class somehow doesn't do well.",1
"Definitely one of the best profs at UofG. Very friendly, helpful, funny, and super nice. He's very welcoming and doesn't make you feel bad if you make a mistake. For sure made we want to keep studying Spanish, and I still am!",1
"Mrs. Johnson is very nice and wants her students to succeed.  Notes are printed off of blackboard and the tests are based off of these notes.  The only marginally hard part of the class is typing up the Sociological journal which is due mid-semester.  After the journal is finished, just study your notes and the tests are a breeze.",1
"Dr. Betts is overall a good professor, but there is little things about him that are annoying. Such as being picky over lab reports and other grading materials. Also, he claims to be open to all questions but actually gets annoyed at you at times because he thinks you should know something you never used. Overall, a nice guy and wants you to learn.",1
"Requires you to memorize TONS for his comprehensive, handwritten exams.  Homework is posted late at night the day before it is due.   Class is him ranting about nothing regarding the exams and you're then expected to spend hours in study sessions with his T.A to learn the material that should be taught by him in class.",0
"Had one of his classes in during the pandemic, still felt like I was in a room with another human being.",1
"Dr. Bailey is so far my favorite professor. Even if you're not going into juvenile justice, she really inspires you to care more about that population. Exams are okay, but you do have to write a lot. So if you actually study, you should enjoy your time with her and get a good grade! Do purchase the small book, as she asks questions from there.",1
"She is kind hearted and helpful. Under stress and often poorly organized, she can be frustrating, esp. when she assigns things and then forgets about them. But overall she is easy to deal with and not a harsh grader. She makes herself available so you can ask questions outside of class. Pay attention and do the reading.",1
"Professor Sivathayalan made Geotechnical Engineering a breeze. I will say that the lectures were quite boring due to the material, not the professor. He gives you everything you need to succeed, meaning that assignments, the midterm, and the final were all fair game and straightforward. Would highly recommend.",1
Be prepared to teach yourself calc 3. Weekly quizzes. Because you teach yourself the material its going to be very time consuming. Its really difficult when the material is read of slides. No live math.,0
"Interesting class. She's very good at explaining and clarifying the text as well as going beyond it. But be warned - if you don't like Rawls, you will not survive. You MUST like Rawls.",1
"A math student's student's math teacher. The greatest I've ever had. He comes from a tradition where it's more important to help students UNDERSTAND material, as opposed to covering everything. Work to understand, and he will upgrade your mind. You don't need to be a math major or a genius to do well, but you do need to be eager, flexible and open.",1
Her lessons are very concise and on point. Her final exam review was excellent too. She is always available for you no matter what. Make sure you ask a lot of questions and attend class continually.,1
This class is extremely difficult so if you want to do well you have to put in the time and effort. I would highly recommend going to the tutors if you are struggling. And try not the leave the homework to the last minute because it can take awhile.,0
"Will confirm your figures for your essays, goes to answer the exact same question but it's a different group and he'll say that it's absolutely wrong. Doesn't know what he wants. Has said ""i dont care"" and ""do better"" when people come to him for help. 80% of his neuro class have F's. Dont take him. You've been warned.",0
"This class was pretty simple. You show up, take a test. The tests are hard though.",1
He knows his stuff and he can teach it. His short fiction creative writing class is excellent and his feedback is really excellent. I can concretely feel my abilities are improving. One warning though: you only start writing in 2nd semester. Sometimes he has sentences that don't really make any sense but he's always willing to explain himself.,1
"5 Quizzes with extra credit and you are able to drop your lowest quiz score.  I got 100% of all the quizzes because they are pretty clear as long as you study all the material.  Reading is optional.  Focus more on the powerpoints!  Exams are a little more difficult but if you put in effort, you can 100% get an A!  Online lectures are available",1
"I dont think shes a good teacher for first years. Her notes are unorganized and she updates the new notes for an 8am class at 5am. If you are not the best in chem sciences you should try to choose another prof. She is a fast replier to emails, however, Ill give her that. But I wouldnt take a class with her again.",0
"I haven't seen a single ""funny"" thing about Prof. Gaidos. He basically calls his students idiots, Ie. Announcement he made saying most of the students posts are ""completely outlandish"". You ask him a question, and he responds in a disrespectful manner. I will pass this class because I will do the work, but I don't recommend taking him!",0
Greatest prof. so good.,1
"Maby didn't show much interest in the class as he went missing for a few weeks after assigning the project. I would ask questions at office hours and he would look at me as if I were stupid. The TA was the main reason I did well in the class. Be sure to have a CourseHero account, it will come in handy.",0
I wouldn't wish this class upon my worst enemy!!! DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! The grades are only from quizzes and exams. She has browser lockdowns for her exams and makes them impossible. No matter how much I studied I never received anything higher than a D. When I personally asked for help she literally did nothing.,0
"boring, can't hear her, not clear on essay intructions, terrible notes and the most impossible person to try and contact. she was very relatable to the students but i would never take another class with her again.",0
"I didn't have Jamie for a class, but can attest for her personality having had Eng W020 meetings with her. After my first meeting with her, I have only met up with a different professor once. She's so sincere, intelligent, and compassionate. Really cares about helping students and will hear what you have to say. I wish I had taken her 100 class!!!",1
"Leamy is very nice and helpful. She breaks things down so it's very easy to understand. Make sure you go to class because she gives EC at the end and I felt lost when I would miss a class. Do the WebWork, it matters. And watch the pre class videos because it's the only way to understand the quizzes.",1
"TAKE HIM AS YOUR PROF FOR MEC 311! but go to Bill's Lectures. Even though Hua Lu has really bad teaching skill, his midterms are super easy (you can get 80+%). It makes the difference between passing or failing .",0
Lane is one of the most disorganized professors at GV. He doesn't utilize anything yet always talks about innovation. All assignments are scattered around the discussion boards and his grading makes no sense at all. Has no clear guidelines for assignments and grades randomly.,0
"Great professor. Does A LOT to prepare you for tests and it really helps. Explains things very well. When she talks about a concept, she always tells us the reasoning behind it which will help you remember everything, not just memorize it. Use the materials she gives for test practice and u probably won't get lower than a B on a test. Def take her!",1
"taught the endocrine section. very old school, hand drawn figures and notes making class very monotone. Exam questions were fair.",1
"This is such a good class to take for Criminal Justices. He explains the material REALLY WELL. Do the group work, get the textbook, and you will be successful in this class. Getting the book is crucial since it is where all materials come from.",1
Very condescending and unhelpful. No desire to clarify anything about the exam. Has very little respect for students.,0
"it is just impossible to learn something in the class. He explains some advanced stuff though that might be interesting for some. But if you're looking for a good mark, the book and lecture slides will get you an A.",0
"I truly believe that Dr Tigner may be the greatest teachers I have had in my life so far. Whenever the I am getting ready for class, I get a feeling that is beyond motivation. Whenever the time comes to actually walk into her classroom and learn, I become ecstatic. I honestly want to express how thankful I am for her. 350 characters isnt enough!",1
"Dr. Cheers definitely picks favorites and picks on students in the class. If you do not stand out in the class during discussion, you will be unacknowledged by him. If you do not participate, you may as well not be in the class at all because of how he treats his students. Definitely participate if you plan on taking this class.",0
"You really do not learn much from Ian. If you are just taking THEA 281 because it is a requirement for your major/minor and want an easy A, take him. If you are serious about becoming a theater designer, take someone else.",0
One of the best professors I have ever had! He definitely knows what he is talking about. He always makes sure you understand the lecture! We also go over a practice test before the day of the test which is really helpful. And always record your lectures!,1
"I took every soc class at scc and had her several times unfortunatly.  She is a terrible professor.  If she likes you, you'll do well but don't disagree with her or your grade will suffer.  As a soc major, I hardly passed her classes and yet managed to maintain a 3.8 at Eastern.  It was pathetic.",0
"She is an awful professor. She does not care in the slightest about her students or if they're struggling and trying to do well. This class was impossible, and she thought D averages on quizzes and exams was sufficient. Do not take a class with her, you will regret it and your life will be that much more stressful. Oh, and make sure you call her DR",0
"She does not know her stuff. At all. Had to correct her on her own lectures and tell her what she was supposed to be teaching because she was ""confused""(her words, not mine) by her own course material.",0
10/10 would recommend. Makes you work for grades but gives good feedback. She cares a lot.,1
"Very long and difficult assignments, midterm was easy but the final was incredibly hard. Very hard to follow / keep up with him in lectures, he goes fast.",0
"She is OK. She can be very condescending and rude, and she likes to make fun of you in front of everyone if you do not do a good job. She rarely explains things fully. She is a fairly easy grader, and all you do is like 4 or 5 speeches/debates. I wouldn't suggest taking her, but if you have no choice, she isnt terrible...",0
"AWESOME!!! Lecture is always a hoot! Take him if you get the chance!!! Very helpful with course work and tells you outright what he expects of students for exams. b/c of his relaxed teaching style it's much easier to absorb info, especially when tied to one of his hilarious stories. AWESOME!!! ps. you do need the book",1
"One of the rudest professors I've ever encountered. Felt like if I didn't understand a part of his lecture, I couldn't ask a question or else he'd be ill-mannered about it. Always seemed knowledgeable about the subject, but was never approachable about the content. I'd recommend taking his class as a last resort if you want to learn the content.",0
"I feel like I learned a lot with Mitty K, Lord of the Brocean. With that said though, this is NOT an easy class. My friends in other ITrade classes had much higher grades than me, even though I had a much better understanding of the material because of Mitty K. If you love Econ or want to learn more at the expense of your GPA, take him.",1
"Sheridan is a fantastic professor. He does expect a lot - there is a lot of reading and the lectures are heavy content wise. However, he does a great job clarifying what you may need help with and if you put in the work, you will do just fine. Taking him again in the fall and I am so excited.",1
"It's math, so overall grade is mainly midterm (30%) and final (50%), with 20% homework (weekly problem set). The problem sets actually help you learn the stuff. Prof is really nice, very accessible after class and during office hours. He explains things to you and answers questions very patiently. As long as you want to learn, he is there to help!",1
"Dr. Sperling's lectures can be long and boring but other times they are very interesting and you want to know more. With there only being three exams, studying a lot is a must because they are pretty hard but this class is not impossible if you put in time and effort. Make sure you go to class to get the TLE points, they're life savers!",1
This professor is the best. His lectures are interesting. He tells you what you need to know for an exam. I wish he taught more of my science classes. Take this profeessor; if you don't pass it's not because of him.,1
"Your grade is 4, 50 multiple choice exams. Exams do come straight from the notes, but are pretty tough. He does not post notes on Moodle, so if you miss class you have to get them from someone else. Nice guy & funny but I think he likes making you work for it. Textbook was not opened once.",0
"Dr. Ballard is tough, but knowledgeable. She is very clear about what you are and are not expected to know. Don't let the anatomy scare you, practice and use the root words she teaches to help. She is very approachable both for class and graduate school help. She is very intelligent and has a lot of experience.",1
"It can be a little difficult to follow her at times because shes very smart, and struggles with putting things in terms everyone can understand. She just wants you to work, and to use some common sense. If youre having trouble, see her during office hours.",1
THIS TEACHER SUCKS....BORING....STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!,0
"Nice guy who is willing to help, assigns a lot of reading but he is very fair to the students. Take his class!",1
"She was super frustrating. Algonquin has a college that teachers are supposed to respond to emails within 48 hours, and she would reply a week later, most often she didn't bother to reply at all. Very hard to get any real help. Will take the course again with a different prof.",0
The tests are very hard and you have to care don't grammar mistake because he point off for a little bit  and bring your GPA low. every week you have a lot of cases to read because he asks you every week. The class is boring and students wish to finish the class time. in general BLAW 308 is not interesting and he makes more boring.....,0
"Seriously people, she cannot have a good rating on this. The woman hauls marks out of her... area... BAD",0
Genuinely rude and uncaring. He will call you out if you're late or if you get up to throw something away and keeps you over class time. Feedback on my papers were contradictory to what he says in lecture and on the hand outs he gives. Overall the most incompetent professor I ever had. Planning on dropping the course.,0
Mailing it in. An Abomination.,0
I am a criminology major so this course was very important for me. Our first test was supposed to be over 3 chapters and was only over 1 because she got so off topic while lecturing. She is not very organized and poor at communicating with students (especially during finals week). I have never been this unhappy with a teacher.,0
"To be completely honest, he terrified me. He's blunt and can sometimes come off as rude, so I wouldn't recommend taking him unless you're thick skinned. However, he's great at teaching and his lectures are entertaining. There's a lot of readings and the tests tend to be really hard, so you definitely need to spend a lot of time studying.",1
"No recorded or live lectures, basically teaching yourself the material. Have to watch a show (paid by student) and 1 season per week plus reading and then homework on the show and readings. Little to no engagement with students and assignments seem non-educational and unnecessary. Grading is late & professor is unorganized.",0
She explains things fairly well and her tests are pretty easy.  Overall a good professor.  She grades very easily with partial credit and has extra credit questions on her test.  I recommend her.,1
"While he is passionate, Dr. Keele's lectures often run late. Participation points only count if you answer clicker questions correctly. Anxiety students BEWARE: Keel will stare you down during tests. The midterm/final are VERY stressful as they make up most of your grade. I received an ""A,"" but at the expense of my mental health.",0
Dr. Schwartz is not an easy teacher but he cares about his students. He wants to make sure you know the material so he is a tough grader but fair. I can say that I am well prepared for the classes to follow.,1
Boring lectures are inevitable He doesn't give any review sheet whatsoever for the exams You basically need to read all of the chapters and try to guess what is he going to ask  Exams are all multiple choice and tricky Avoid him at all cost,0
is not clear on the assignments that are given. Do not take him,0
He is one of the best prof. in Mech. Eng.. Great choice of material with a very clear presentation!,1
"AWESOME TEACHER!  If you have the opprotunity to take her classes, def. take it.  Best prof. I've had at this univeristy!",1
"This class was a nightmare. The class moved online due to the COVID-19 pandemic and it was hell. Most of the class was spent tutoring him on how to use Zoom and being asked to ""speak up"" since apparently volume buttons don't exist. Even though Zoom shows who attended, he still took attendance and singled out those not paying attention. DO NOT TAKE.",0
She is completely unorganized all the time.,0
"Worst professor I have taken till date. Very boring lectures, feel like they never end. Very unfair grader. Please save yourself by taking another prof for 1700.",0
She expects a lot of memorization. SHE DOES NOT LET YOU USE FORMULA CHARTS FOR THE EXAM! You would have to learn the formulas by memory :( She's not a great teacher. Don't take her.,0
"Professor Singha is a lovely teacher, and I enjoyed her lectures and sense of humor. She was my favorite lecturer of BIS 2C.",1
"Before I signed up for Boydston I looked at the reviews, they were low but I kept an open mind that I had to work for my grades regardless who the professor was. But this professor designs everything so you can fail, she goes beyond measures to make sure her exams difficult. Either than that I see no effort from her in anything else. DON'T TAKE",0
"He is an overall sweet old man, but teaching is not his thing. If you never took calculus in high school or anytime previous to his calc class, DONT take his class or you will struggle through it all teaching yourself from youtube videos or the math center.",0
"Took online for 101 and 102. Received an A for 101. The assignments are super easy. Just read the chapters, do the discussion and quiz every week. One of the easiest online courses Ive taken. She isn't a tough grader.",1
"Avoid at all costs. Does not want to help and very condescending. When you actually get help from him, makes you feel very stupid. Hes basically still at seneca because hes been here since the 1980s so they cant fire him even though hes one of the worst professors and program coordinator.",0
"Jane Thorngren's class is extremely difficult -- one of the most difficult online classes I've ever taken in my life. Her feedback is terrible, the modules are tedious, and the exams are ridiculously hard. However, most of the answers are easy to find online.",0
I wish all the CSI courses at uOttawa were taught by professor Boyd.,1
"This class could've  been really interesting, but the mixture of off topic monotone lectures and the ridiculous grading scale made it horrid.  60% of the class grade was papers, which he graded outrageously and unfairly.  Save time and tuition...take another class!",0
"Was very clear in his lectures, 4 chapter tests and one final. Mostly based on his power points but does throw in facts found in the book. DO THE EXTRA CREDIT EVEN IF YOU HAVE AN A, you will thank yourself later! EXTREMELY EASY A CLASS, if you actually study for tests. : BTW, he is HILARIOUS and always has a real life example for EVERYTHING. ",1
"Lectures are all over the place - she has difficulty staying on topic and sometimes struggles with basic facts. I basically had to teach myself the course, which wasn't too hard, but I'm a history major. On the good side, she is an easy grader, there are a few papers and tests throughout the semester but they're not very difficult.",0
"Easy-going, helpful lectures and slides, I would take another class with him.",1
"Terrible teacher and advisor. Never there, doesn't know anything but plants and gas lines. Hates his students and especially the ones he has to advise. Always late and gives packets of junk.",0
One of the worst professors at CMU! Avoid him and this class at all cost if possible!,0
"They broke the mold, and then they made Lunsford.",0
he is the worst professor i have ever had. he has his own opinion and if you disagree you fail. most closed minded person i have ever seen.,0
Always seems stressed and high strung in class. Communicates clearly though.,0
"If you want rote memorization and an Easy A, don't take his class. But if you want to be challenged like a college professor actually should challenge you, there's no better prof. Discussion based classes where you delve into the deeper meaning of the words on the page. Be prepared to read and have original thoughts.",1
"I don't understand what he's talking about in class. His handwriting is very difficult to read. Although he wrote the textbook, the whole concept is still very confusing. I got A in both his midterms, but I struggled a lot watching his lectures...",0
"Excellent professor. Wants her to students to understand the course topics. However, Cotes grading strategy is hard to come to terms with. Double check your work! Also, a friendly tip will be: dont email her about a question you received no credit for on your exam or quiz, she will review your whole exam and maybe deduct more points.",0
"Excellent Teacher overall, crystal clear on all projects. Very helpful, consistently helped defer cost of material by bringing in supplies she bought then gave to the students for free. As far as cost of materials go this class was by far one of the least expensive of Art classes I have ever taken.",1
"Dr. Ryder is very good at what he does, and it shows. He pushes everyone in the Pride to be the absolute best and doesn't accept anything less. He's very into tradition here at UTK, and wants to keep it special. You will work extremely hard in the Pride, but the payoff is extremely rewarding.",1
Lots of essay questions. You never knew exactly what he was looking for in an answer.,0
"AWFUL! He is rude, condescending, and refuses to help students. I studied for hours and barely passed. Avoid this prof!",0
"Brent's class is easy as long as you do the work, but if you really want to excel just ask him for advice and he'll make you the best.",1
Do not get me wrong English 1020 is the definition of boring and basic however this professor exceeds even that. Not only was she rude to certain students but she treated us all like we are in 2nd grade. Every class was mandatory and if you are not the best writer don't go to her for help because chances are you would be even  leaving.,0
"Do not recommend if you are not an ENGL major; its a hard pass.  Not approachable at all, and puts himself before his students. Attendance is mandatory and participation is crucial (in class + online discussion boards and he keep track of how many times you post).  Midterm and Final, both essays. no other assignments. Tough grader.",0
Her class for meteorology was kinda hard for the quizzes but there was no homework other than take notes. The notes can be used for the quizzes that are given every class. My only complaint is the slow grading,1
"unpleasant.  theres a reason she looks like that mean doctor on ER.  the school's in general over-reliance on ""distance education"" puts people on site at a disadvantage I believe.  you have to wait for all this other technical nonsense in a class nearly four hours long.....",0
"This is my 3rd class with Dr. C, so I'm a little biased. Her teaching style speaks to my method of learning, though, so it's a good arrangement. Lots of extra credit. Gives all that you need to know on Powerpoints, but be sure to bring your book to class! Sad that she isn't teaching 142 next quarter.",1
"I think Dr.Giannet was a wonderful Professor. Not only does he teach with enthusiasm, he is VERY SEXY! :)",1
"Dr. Chandler is extremely knowledgable and knows how to teach and reach students.  Her discussions are interesting and her choice of readings are always relevant.  There is a lot of reading and writing but as was said by the previous student, that is to be expected.  She assigns a variety of different papers which helps your writing skills.",1
This man is my absolute favorite. I have never been good at math and he made me understand and was extremely helpful. He's so sweet and really cares about his students.,1
"Very understanding, caring and loving . Makes sure youre well informed for the test. Gives 5exams, drops the lowest and has extra credit that worth a lot and can boost your grade up if youre struggling.",1
"He makes the lectures interesting, if sometimes a bit too crazy and off topic. If you just go to class, pay attention, and make a serious attempt at your papers, you'll get a good grade. He never responded to a single email however.",1
"Definitely an easy A! Work unfortunately is nonstop, but it's easy reading, a short essay, and a 4 question essay test per unit.  Due dates are negotiable and papers can be rewritten.  Not a lecture and listen class, but group discussions on the material.  Just write the essays and take the tests and you're golden!!!",1
"He is a sweet man, but a pretty awful prof! He counts for participation, but it is not really about your attendance. The only reason he counts for participation is because he is incredibly strict about how people are in his class. If you yawn too loudly, or open a wrapper, he will stop and threaten your participation points.",0
"This was a painful class to take. His lectures are all over the place; he writes messily all over the chalkboard and jumps from topic to topic randomly. He also tends to focus on small details that don't really matter and won't be on the test. He didn't have office hours, instead we were told to ""find me at round table."" ",0
"He's funny.. that's about all the positives I can give. He goes on and on about a subject and then says ""But that won't be on the test"", so basically he wastes like 20 minutes on a single subject that won't even be on the test. His lectures are sloppy and unorganized, and if you ask a question he probably won't understand what you're asking.",0
"He is the kind of professor that you want teaching you no matter what the subject of the class is.  I am so glad that I took this class with him; he made this the most fun and memorable class that I have had in college.  He is extremely approachable, easy going and he understands a lot of the hardships that students go through in their lives.",1
"Phenomenal Prof, cares about the student body and always brings a smile to class, easy for CP102, I would strongly encourage students to take it!",1
Great proff. Nice Lady. Very tough marking indeed by herself and proffs. Writing a well thought out and carefully edited paper to get between 70-73 is tough to deal with.......,1
"309 is generally more about your ability to teach yourself rather than what you learn in class. That being said, Mitra is one of the most dedicated professors when it comes to answering questions and helping you with your project. I spent many Saturdays with him over the semester fixing things. Great guy!",1
"A little scatterbrained and distant, but gets the job done. She knows what she is doing but isn't condescending towards those who aren't as familiar with the subject.",1
"BORING, awful, avoid as many of his classes as possible. Not a difficult marker, but he's very rude, and often downright MEAN to students.",0
"attendance is mandatory, but going is pointless. everything you need to know is in the book. SUPER boring. curves the test average to 80, so its possible to get over 100 on any test so the class is relatively easy.",0
"Dr. Jensen constantly changed what was in the syllabus, was rude, and did not care about her students whatsoever. She discouraged questions and was unorganized. She also did not grade in a timely fashion, and there was no way to check your grade in the class. I cannot stress enough to steer clear of her class! Everyone in my class hated her.",0
"Great teacher for a beginner class.  Explains everything pretty clearly, but any additional questions are given vauge answers that make you figure the rest out for yourself.  Quizes are fairly straitforward and easy but everything is graded very hard. She makes the class a lot of fun though.",1
"The professor is very intelligent, but has poor teaching methods and or common sense.  I think has  Aspergers or he is a high functioning autistic.  He doesnot speak english well.  But he is good at heart and will help you if you treat him with respect.  If you dont, watch out.",0
This was a good course. Uses different materials to present information.  Covers parts of history that are not covered in HS US history.,1
"Really nice, and approachable.  Liked her style of teaching, but sometimes is a little bit repetitive in her lectures.",1
"She's VERY smart, and will be able to help you with almost any question you have,  but attendance is a huge grade. Brought me from a D- to a C+. Exams are very difficult if you don't go to class, take good notes, or pay attention. Study! And BUY THE HANDBOOK!",1
I loved all of his lectures eventhough at times they made no sense at all.  The only thing bad about the class was the weekly papers.,1
"I am a hard working student and willing to do whatever work a professor throws my way. However, this class is something that I recommend to stay away from. I could not understand her half the time and the communication was quite bad. Only class I have withdrawn from.",0
"Dr. Cook is a little bizarre and hard to follow at times, but he is incredibly intelligent and interested in his subject matter. His tests are all essay formatted, but he is lenient. As long as you do the readings and retain the information, you'll be fine. I don't suggest taking him for intro courses because he can be hard to handle.",1
"Do not take Intermediate Finance with him. He does not teach! Half of your grade is the cases (1 presentation, 1 paper). He randomly lectures during class with no organization or structure. The midterm and final are each 7-8 ch of material. The only way to study is off these ""cases,"" which students present, so exams are impossible. Dont take him!",0
"She'll give weekly quizzes, and if she sees that majority of the class did poorly on a certain problem, she will stick it on the next quiz without warning.",0
"Sooo much extra credit! This class was really interesting, even kinda fun. He could stand to clarify what he wants for the practicals and group work sometimes, but he's good about making sure everyone knows if he gets asked a question about stuff like that. The guest speakers are pretty cool too since they have a lot of experience and examples.",1
Dr. Dougherty is one of those professors you never want to have. The class less about her teaching you but more about you doing the research on your own to understand the materials. If you aren't good at writing papers you will suffer immensely. All she does to aid you is destroy your paper and uses a modified APA makes it difficult to follow.,0
"Seventeen years after graduating from UCCB I still consider Nicole to be one of the best and most influential professors/counsellors I had from the three PSE institutions I attended. Easy to talk to, offers constructive criticism and when necessary positive vibes to help get you over the hump.",1
"Amazing summer class. Consists of 7 Modules where each one you watch a video, complete a quiz & write a paper for. Literally copy wording out of the books for the paper and you are golden. Definitely a lot of work but much less than it would be during the regular semester. Best online course I've ever taken. Easy grader and great prof. Got a 99%...",1
"Chris' lectures are interesting and easy to comprehend. For marks, he clearly states what he wants. He often inspires me to become better.",1
"I found him to be horribly rude, dismissive, and demeaning.  I'v never had such a bad experience with a professor on a personal level before.  He does post great online resources for students to review before quizzes and exams.",0
Prof. Pol was chosen as Outstanding Engineering prof. in 2019 that confirms his extraordinary teaching skills.,1
My computer froze when I tried to register for her class. Should of taken the hint...,0
"I love Palmer. He's interesting, helpful, funny, and I never find myself looking at the clock.  Probably the most fun I've had in an Alma College class!",1
"He is such a funny, quirky guy. In-class discussions are never boring. The readings were long at times, but so interesting; and he definitely provides a new perspective on the material that you may not have ever considered before. He is a great professor and will accept any argument as long as you can back it up with logical statements.",1
"If you can avoid her, please do. The exams are hard...you read 11 plays and are expected to know who said what lines...the papers are long (10 pages) and she is extremely critical. She has a touch of arrogance and will willingly fail her ENTIRE CLASS.",0
"Book work every class. Buy your textbook ahead of time. Best advice, dont take this class. Not being him is a reason he takes points off your exams. Also, the exams are super long and really hard.",0
"Maybe my favorite teacher ever. He actively engages every student, teaches in a very stream-of-consciousness manner. P.B. is very knowledgeable about a lot of things, including literature. He is enthusiastic about teaching, learning, and life in general. If you have any interest in literature or learning, take Middleton.",1
"Johnson never posted grades on Blackboard and he always made us do debates. I never really knew what to expect grading wise from him. I always came to class, listened to his lectures, watched the videos and did my homework. His take home exams were really long too. I ended up with an A in the class, which was crazy.",0
Asynchronous class. Your grade is based on 10 quizzes which are timed for 10 minutes. The video lectures are 3 hours long so you are expected to remember a lot of info for 10 questions. Same deal with the final exam which was 45 min with 40 questions with no study guide. Don't take this class. Save yourself the grief.,0
"Genuine interest in students, funny guy.  Not really hard, but not overly easy either.  Over all a great professor.",1
Withdrew from her class.  She seriously will give you a hard time.,0
"I took her online and yes, everything seems daunting, but I failed every test and still got an A. She gives an ENORMOUS amount of extra credit and always answered my questions immediately. You'll have to do some work, but it's not hard work. If you just want to skate by without doing anything, don't take her.",1
He is a nice guy but should not be a professor. He does not teach anything and expects people to know the material before we even mention it in class. His idea of teaching is going over problems that we have not learned yet. Avoid him if you can. The only saving grace to taking him is the curves you will get since the tests are so hard.,0
"A lot of the assignments in this course are hand written, either I did really well or really crappy and her feedback was vague. The course is very interesting however, Sophie isn't the best prof. It's manageable to do unlike cps420, you have to learn the new visual basics on your own, she will not teach you how to code at all. Lectures are useless",0
"Blake is by far the best teacher ever. Shes lecture heavy, but no matter the material its never boring. She allows you to not take final if u dont miss more than 2 classes. Dont need book, if u show up youll be fine. Shes a TRUE inspiration. TAKE HER!!! You wont regret it.",1
Best Teacher of All Time! I love this class and I look forward to going every day! She is such a great teacher and you can tell how much she loves teaching it! She is extremely helpful! The exams aren't too bad if you study. There is homework almost every night but it normally only takes about 20 minutes. TAKE THIS TEACHER! I want her as my grandma,1
"I took the 8-week online course and wow. If you don't pick up concepts quickly or if math does not come easy for you, I suggest taking the full semester or another professor. There were no lectures, just textbook and videos from the textbook/WebAssign. The amount of homework was almost comical, totaling close to 1000 math problems for 8 weeks.",0
Such a nice guy! Understands that you have other classes to take and will be more lenient with due dates.,1
"Professor Seibles is fantastic. He is an amazing poet and really helps you to improve your writing skills. He knows we are students, so he doesn't expect perfection, but he does expect a basic knowledge of proper punctuation and sentence structure (you are in college after all). I highly recommend him if you are interested in being a writer!",1
"I want to start off by saying I love the way she teaches and I think it's the best way to learn chemistry. HOWEVER, the amount of work her classes take should honestly be worth like 6 credit hours. If you have a very low workload and can study a lot, take her. If you have even a medium-level course load, this will be extremely challenging for you.",1
"HORRIBLE! I read the reviews on this website before I took him, but because everything else was full - I had no choice but to enroll in his class. I figured that if I just studied more than usual, I would do fine. BOY, WAS I WRONG. I studied so much for his tests, and still did terribly! If it wasn't for his homework and labs, I would have failed.",0
"Dr. Brennan is the best professor that I had at Penn State. The homework is long, but actually interesting most of the time. He is very helpful in office hours and after class. Preprinted notes are awesome and the tests are really easy compared to the HW. The average test grades were like 89.",1
"Tyrel Moore is a nice and funny man who clearly has a deep understanding and care for this subject matter, but that's about all he has to offer. Tyrel Moore is the grim reaper of your gpa. I strongly recommend taking this course if you want to fail every exam, never know what is going on, and if you enjoy being told to study the wrong materials.",0
"Professor Blake is an outstanding educator. At first, it was difficult for me to establish myself in the classroom because I was shy. However, I realized that I needed to create a relationship & properly communicate. The worksheets for SPA 101 have the same questions that will be on the quiz & exam. Pay attention and get the answers in class.",1
"I have taken 3 classes with Joe and would take them all over again plus more. He has SO MUCH WORLD EXPERIENCE AND SO MANY GREAT STORIES. He is a bank of knowledge! Attendance isn't mandatory, no quizzes either. He really is a loving, caring man. If you want to laugh, get an A, and learn real world useful information, take him.",1
"He never let us have discussions on what we were reading, which is essential for an English class. Went off on tangents a lot, and does not let you use a computer. He also kept talking during the exam which was very distracting. In addition, his essay questions were very specific and his exam did not match the format we were given.",0
"Doug is great! I love his ""ramblings"". He is a well travelled and interesting guy. Super kind, happily clarifies & answers questions. In fact, I'm taking another class with him through the summer and will continue to take as many as offered. Thanks for reinforcing my love for anth!",1
"Cost accounting is not easy, but Gillespie has a unique personality that doesn't make the class too bad. He is always available to help and is the nicest guy! Go to class, do the homework, ask questions, and go to office hours and you'll be fine.",1
"Close to retirement & she could care less, skips steps when teaching, Hates 2 show how 2 work problem fully, 2 HW assignments & quizzes online wkly, Shell never know how well u do individually because all work is done & graded online, Test are in class & must show work & thats the only time shell know if u know how 2 do prob & still wont care",0
"Not too shabby...little to contradictory, but knows his material",1
Her grading and instructions are inconsistent. She can be very hard to get ahold of. She didn't really provide her own notes or any guidance at all. It was mostly just teach yourself.,0
"Talks fast and doesn't have notes, just talking points so you have to write down what you think is important. Final Grade is made up of exams and portfolio. Wasn't vert helpful during office hours, just made me feel dumb. Exams are hard and scenario based but drops lowest grade and has a curving system. Basically the class is boring and hard.",0
Absolutely terrible!,0
"Amazing Professor .. his lectures are heavy but he explain it thoroughly, makes sure everyone understand what is he saying. quizzes are tough but fair. If you focus with him and practice Linux you will ace the class!",1
"This class is fair, but you must study a lot for the exams to do well. The tests are short answer only. If you put in some effort you will be fine. He is a nice guy, I would recommend this class.",1
"OKAY THIS PROF IS THE WORST. He just reads slides in class, slides which he neither posts on Moodle nor is gonna test you on. If you haven't done IT for a while it's gonna drain you (the first assignment was coding a webpage). Clearly a tough grader and doesn't appreciate your efforts. DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL trust the ratings.",0
"I went into Shakespeare dreading it, but I left with the intention of signing up for her next class. If you want an easy teacher or someone who will put you in a clearly defined box, she is not the teacher for you.I have learned so much in her class!",1
Amazing prof he is clear in his lectures. Doesn't use a PowerPoint so you need to go to class. He is very friendly and is willing to help you during office hours  ,1
"The best. He has deep knowledge of data structures, and is one of the inventors of the Tango Tree. Not recommended for beginners or slackers. Unfortunately he isn't teaching undergraduates this year. When I took this course in Fall 2016, everyone in the class had taken AP Java. The students in Spring 2017 had not, and grades suffered dramatically.",1
"Great professor. Her lectures are very clear cut. She tells you what you need to know for the test and what is just ""FYI"". She is very funny and tries to relate what we learning to our level as young adults. She keeps you paying attention during her lecture and not in a bad way. No homework, except tests, which are easy if you know the material.",1
"Blair is highly respected and incredibly smart. Copy down anything he writes on the board and SHOW UP. This class was one of the hardest I've taken so far, but also my favorite I've taken. Blair will match the effort you put forward, so apply yourself. His teaching style is mostly speaking lecture based, so write fast!",1
"Honestly the worst prof at SFU, don not take this course, I needed one history credit to graduate as a 4.0 student and he ruined it all. I do not understand how he is employed. All he wants is students to fail. I can get over the reading and homework, but honestly just help people succeed not fail! On a power trip and just plain rude and unhelpful",0
"I REALLY enjoyed her course ! It's clear from the beginning what she expects from you during the course. She provides excellent feedback. She responds almost immediately to emails and questions. She's very timely with grading, so you know where you stand academically in the course. If you are looking for a dedicated and caring professor, she's it.",1
"As a first year student who needs a good professor to help me understand the curriculum better; she was awful. She would teach class and skip important parts, do work and then say ""oh this is what we just did!"" Truly didn't care if you understood it or not. DO NOT TAKE FINITE WITH HER. I didn't believe it when I read these comments, but trust me.",0
"He has such a good personality but he is not very good at teaching or grading. He is VERY picky on exams if you miss one little detail he will mark off a bunch of points. He gives no extra credit , he does give another opportunity to retake exams but overall I would suggest not taking his class.",0
"Dr Lemon was real cool. He explained everything very clear, accept late homeworks, he gives points for attendance. If you miss the class, he also has video on blackboard for each chapter. I learned real cool things and enjoy it very much.",1
"He is not great at explaining things. You will rely on the textbook, classmates, or SICE tutors when you're confused. He has plenty of office hours available but he can be kind of... aggressive. He allows you to make up any HW and retake tests so it is possible to get 100 in the class. Beware: to make up HW you must write the entire code by hand.",0
SO PRECIOUS!! take this class.  he actually makes history interesting... and he looks like the cutest little turtleman ever!!!,1
Horrible I mean REAL BAD professor I do not know what I was thinking when I choose her over the others. She is not consistent with formats of quiz and does not even gives a heads up changes from 10 questions to 20 then back tracking for some quiz and then some allow. Never answers emails does not send send reminders like every other prof. STAY AWAY,0
"Good prof, problem sets can get hard but nice and easy final",1
"The prof has more potential, but doesn't use it. The class is easy and you would have to make a deliberate effort to fail anything. However, he is cold and unapproachable outside the classroom, which is unfortunate as he can sometimes be funny in class.",0
Easiest math class you could possibly take. He gives you the test questions and then lets you retake the tests if you dont like your score. He is really nice.,1
It is unfortunate this class is required & only one Professor teaches it. Grading on important group papers can take up to three weeks and is extremely strictly graded. PowerPoint Lectures and custom-written required reading are lengthy and do not always connect to the text. Tests have unrealistically short time limits. Avoid Dr. Pharr if you can.,0
Dr. Silgler was one of my favorite professors. He was to take abratract theology and make it much more practical. I would recommend him as a great teacher and a caring friend and mentor that looks out for his students.,1
"Dr. Guerra-Pujol is hilarious! He is also amazing at keeping students interested during lecture by being very animated and passionate about the topic. The grading criteria for the essays isn't clear but if you make an effort, you should get a decent score. There's a lot of reading but he talks about it in lecture and brings it full circle.",1
Dr. Zemoudah is a good professor compared to many other professors; However he is not an easy professor he explain the subject really well and therefore expects you to put in a lot of work and understand what you are doing. he is known to give Ds and Fs. if you want an easy class then avoid. if you want to learn then he is your best bet.,1
"I started struggling very early on in her class. Her office hours were during the time of my other classes so I could never make them. I asked after class to go over material from our first test, which I did not do so well on, and she basically told me its not her job. I studied my butt off the rest of the term and was barely able to pass her class",0
Learned more in this class than in any other class I've taken so far. She relates the material to life experiences that make it so much easier to remember and understand. Extra credit for working with kids at elem. school.  Extremely rewarding. Mrs. Mattox is one of those rare teachers you hardly ever find anymore. Would be dumb not to take her!,1
"Gordon Anderson is the worst prof at York. He doesn't communicate with students at all, takes forever to post grades and doesn't give any feedback whatsoever on assignments. He has extremely high expectations for students but holds himself to a very low standard. I will never take another class with this prof. Lesson learned.",0
I have heard that Calc 4 is supposed to be much easier than Calc 3 and I am going to be lucky if I pass this class. Kaminski is an awful prof. He explains the concepts fairly well in class but his assignments are so hard and his tests are even harder. Only take a class with him if you absolutely have to.,0
"Great classes, great instructor, very knowledgeable and caring...very hot!",1
The most enthusiastic professor I've ever have; and he really knows his subject.,1
"Absolutely would never recommend this class to anyone. from day 1, i struggled and went to tutoring 10 hours a week. He didn't know any of our names, he mumbles, marks people wrong for using advanced steps, tries to make his tests ""tricky"" and only gives like 7 problems a test. Doesn't look up when being talked to, or fully answer questions.",0
James Barby is a total sick baller OG.,1
"Professor Rider is a good person and you can tell she has had an eventful life with her stories from the past that she will share during class. With that being said, all you will hear is her talking all class, each and every day. The amount of work assigned is unreal and there are just so many easier professors for this course that can be taken.",0
"Loves what he does, community choir is an easy A as long as you go to EVERY rehearsal.",1
"Kirschvink is one of the worst professors at SDSU. He does not explain the material very well at all, so if you never took calculus in high school then you are pretty much screwed. I had already taken it before but I can tell that if I had not, I would have no clue what was going on. Very boring in lectures but necessary to come for clicker points!",0
He needs to be more clear in his instructions,0
This is the worst professor at UH. He doesn't care about anything at all and gives absolutely no effort. He uses his 1980 lectures. His tests are completely random and he intends to trick you. The only way you will do well is if you read the textbook very very very thoroughly. DO NOT TAKE HIM if you have an option not to. ,0
DO NOT TAKE THIS MAN FOR STOR435. JUST DON'T DO IT YOU WILL HAVE TO LEARN EVERYTHING ON YOUR OWN AND HE GIVES A HOMEWORK DUE EVERY CLASS PERIOD. He cares not at all about teaching this class,0
"One of the most well-balanced profs I've had: explains clearly, grades fairly, relates well to students, challenges you and keeps you interested.  Tests aren't impossible but test the limits of your grasp of the material.  Best reason to be a EE.",1
He has a nice personality one-on-one but he doesnt really converse with the class as a whole about anything other than history. He doesnt exactly create a comfortable atmosphere where people look forward to talking and answering questions.,0
"The most boring prof ever. I like the course, he taught it well, but the man is so boring. Anyone whose had him will tell you not to go to class if your tired because your guaranteed to pass out. The notes were very clear and made up for any lack of interest you may have in the class. Good course!!",1
"This man is WILD. There was one day he barked and meowed at us, instead of just drinking water he'd lean his head back and gargle it, and he danced around sometimes. Definitely an interesting guy, and very passionate about art, but taking this as a gen ed was not a good idea. His class is based around memorization and a few essays.",0
The class wasn't bad at all even when I took it at 8am. Interesting class. A lot of reading. Terms are easy and essay question is given out a week before the midterm/final. There's 1 paper. Meyer is not the easiest professor but you'll learn something.,1
"wow, def. not a fan of Dr. McClure. He only does what he has to. He's boring, takes the SLOWEST tempos possible, and makes music annoying. I loved orchestra until I came here. He's weird and completely annoying. He's never said anything profound or inspirational. I hope we get a new orchestra director soon!",0
This class is terrible.  It's Gibson at her scatterbrained worst.  She seems obsessed with relating everything know to mankind back to the holcaust.  If this course were not required by the program I doubt anyone would take it.,0
"Won't tell you your final grades. Makes you do impossible math equation to figure it out. Tough grader. Says out loud ""4 people are failing"" won't tell you directly. Causally said 7 in last class failed. 5 people I know changed majors after her. Art isn't creative, it's a chore in her class. Homework given like you don't 5 other classes. Avoid her.",0
"Blacker is a really intelligent guy who stands in front of the class and just talks about the material with no notes or power points given.  His tests are tricky, but if you study and make sure you understand each court case you should do fine.  Very interesting class though if you enjoy learning about court cases and the evolution of education.",1
He is the best teacher hands down at CSUDH. He explains so even a kindergartener can understand. He is not only easy but he tries to make sure everyone understands. I highly recommend talking him.,1
Dr. Kennedy was by far the best professor I've had. I was never a fan of chemistry but he honestly made learning organic chemistry very easy and fun. His knowledge and enthusiasm for the subject was astonishing. He's an awesome guy and will help you at all costs. HIGHLY recommend taking organic with him hes amazing and so helpful.,1
"If you want a professor who will give it to you straight, then Jeff is your guy. The class is centered around self-teaching among groups. There are lengthy projects that he is deeply picky about. If you show him you want to learn, he is easier going about things, but he will never coddle you. Not my type of professor, but maybe someone else's.",0
"Dr. Gould is a terrible professor. The classes I've taken with her have been online, so I don't know what she's like in person, but judging from my virtual conversations with her, she has absolutely no respect for her students. If you ask any questions regarding class material or assignments she will gladly speak to you like you're an idiot.",0
"Queer Theory was an awesome experience! There's a lot of reading, but that should be expected in a 400-level class. There's typically homework due every class session but its doable. She is very nice and flexible with deadlines--just talk to her and she'll understand!",1
Total 'hack',0
Amazing prof.,1
"Disorganized prof who failed to complete the course schedule. The chapters she couldn't cover, she assigned them as readings and still included them on our exam. She would waste our time telling useless stories in class which was the reason to why we didn't cover all the course material. She talks about random things like her sweater for a long tim",0
"This is the worst class in the history of the world. The professor is horrible, antipathetic, and has a ego problem. I had never disliked a class so much until I took this one. The course is completely irrelevant and useless if you're not going into research or Ph.D. This class shouldn't be required.",0
Very rude. Tests are hard and she goes off topic!,0
"Lectures aren't lectures. Does problems going from A to Z but wont explain anything in between and if you do ask he just says ""well its right there in the problem just look""and thats it. Very boring. Lots of homework and random quizzes through out the semester.",0
"Great teacher, great class. Crystal clear expectations, quizzes are based on the text. Discussions are interesting and engaging. Plenty of extra credit. Highly recommended!",1
Professor Showalter is awesome! Go visit him in office hours because he is extremely helpful. I was not interested in economics at all and planned on getting a B since it was a difficult class. I went to visit him in his office hours and he helped SO much I ended up with an A. Lectures are relevant and keep you interested.,1
"I took him for an online class, so maybe it is different in person, but all of his lectures were SO unprofessional. He said um every few words, couldn't get his thoughts out, and couldn't remember basic biological/scientific terms. If he is going to be a biology professor, it would make sense if he knew what he was teaching. Take Peterson instead.",0
"He's a nice guy, and teaches ok, but that's about it. he's not AWFUL, but... well, he could be a bit clearer. And can you say ""mathaholic?""",1
"Vince is not boring, just tough. He enjoys the subject matter but only looks at it from one point of view. It is a hard class and the exam and class questions are difficult.",0
"He overloads you with info. I agree that you can spend every waking hour reading and still not get through the lectures / assigned chapters each week. He assigns a lot of long, complicated papers (most of mine ran 10+ pages), then doesn't give any feedback. He told my class he ""didn't have time to write comments."" Worst class I've ever taken.",0
"Professor Vanhorn is literally one of the easiest English teacher's I have ever taken. 90% of assignments are discussion board posts, which she won't drastically reduce points for going under or posting a day late. Her essays are easy as well. Very non-academic in nature. She lets you write in first-person, and doesn't really require sources.",1
"The questions are confusing, the reading material is absurd, and the professor is extremely hard on grading. If you don't answer one part of the 2 or 3 questions it shows drastically on your grade.  Don't take this professor unless you're prepared for a stressful class andor major headache.",0
All HW was online. She gives up to 10 bonus points on each test if you get a certain percent correct on the bonus HW. There was an SI for this class and it was helpful. Only grades are HW and Exams. If you dont understand at the beginning its hard to catch up. The class is challenging.,0
"I absolutely loved Professor Anderson. He was well-informed, approachable, and excellent at facilitating the class discussions, which constituted most of the class. There are lots of readings, but theyre interesting and deliberately selected, so dont be intimidated. Would take again!",1
"Well, let me put it this way. If you want to be challenged for an A &feel mentally challenged by your professor. Go forth & take this class. I've never been so discouraged by a prof. I appreciate the fact that he tries to be hard on his students because its a professional course. But, being in a summer course, I expect as much clarity  as possible.",0
"not the most exciting professor, but I have definitely learned a lot in his course. He's very sweet and it was cool to learn about journalism from someone who was actually working in that field.",1
"This professor taught management and did a horrible job, so they moved her to business communications. It's horrible too. At least she is consistent but the lack of knowledge and preparedness show. If you get have to take the class take it with the part-time guy that used to be at DSC! My department should have hired him! This class as is stinks!",0
"Try to take any other professor... The first few weeks I only used class notes and found his teaching method to be really confusing. After performing poorly on the first test I started to use the textbook to study, that saved my grade. If you have to take him, just use this textbook. Only 9% of the class made an A, compared to 30% w other profs.",0
"Do NOT take this professor if you have other options!! He was really rude and unprofessional when I went to see him during office hours (also feedback  useless). He doesn't accept paraphrasing on the examinations so if you want to pass this, you need to memorize his lecture notes word for word and his cases. Drop this class asap!",0
"A horrible communicator for someone who teaches communication. Due to covid, I took this course online, and never received a single email from the professor, while I did for every other class. Near impossible to locate assignments and instructions; good luck finding them before the due date. The professor seems nice but avoid if possible",0
"Extremely theoretical (doesn't show you eg. on how to do a problem). Homework often takes time if you're unclear what it's about. You won't know where/how equations are from/derived, just use them; it's like real world engineering. This prof is extremely friendly when u go see him. scored 17,23,19 in three tests and full 8 on xtra credits. Got A :)",1
"Her feedback was never helpful.  She rambled and didn't teach much.  She could go so much deeper into subjects, but chose to only skim the surface.  She picks on people and can be quite mean.  condescending.  I always hesitated to talk or ask questions because I was afraid of what rude comment she would make.",0
"Hes an okay teacher. He picks on people in class alot. I am his main traget in class this semester. Hes a hard teacher, some of his assignments are difficult. The papers we write seem to be graded as if we are in the writing profession.",0
Dr. Acker is a pretty fun teacher. She's real easy. Just do the homework and your good.,1
"He is by far the worst professor I have taken here, the only class I have ever failed at pace, he makes the material so difficult to understand and teaches like you already know it with little to no help at all ... if you want to waste your time take him",0
"Extremely disappointed and upset with Cyntha's teaching/behaviour this term. Questions on tests are misleading, marking schemes are strict, and do not follow the nature of the question asked. Rude on class forums, over email, and in person. Extremely unprofessional, and makes people feel degraded with how sarcastic, unhelpful, and mean she is.",0
Online class.  Must stay on top of work.,1
"Dr. Drew will forever be one of the best professors at SVSU. He's hilarious and even though lectures can stray from the material a bit, I always looked forward to the zany antics that ensued with each class.",1
"He might know philosophy, but he not sharing it with the class. Seems to say whatever random thought comes to his mind.",0
"I was really disappointed by this class. He always seemed disorganized or unprepared, and gave us little to no direction on any of the assignments. We ended up writing only 2 stories for the entire class.",0
"Shari is simply not a nice person and not fun to deal with for a term. Avoid if you can. If you cant, good luck and dont expect any kindness in terms of exam content or subjective marking.",0
"I dont know what he is like in person but his online class sucks. He has two sites that for assignments which can be confusing, and no notifications for when he makes a new assignment. For due dates some quizzes don't have a due date while others do which is misleading. Also you don't know if a certain assignment has a due date until it is too late",0
"Hes not all the hype that this page says that he is. Halevi is kinda rude to his students, especially if you dont understand the material. Hes also a goof; spends the class telling jokes and doesnt teach. Most of his essays/writings tend to be very vague and he expects his students to write like grad students.",0
Material is very hard but this professor is AWESOME. Keeps students interested and is extremely helpful and available. Definitely recommend this class!,1
"His instructions were vague, due dates often changed, and even though his attendance policy is strict, several times class was dismissed after just a few minutes. Nice for students living on campus, but really annoying for those who drove to campus just for that class. That said, I liked him and I usually agreed with his assessment of my work.",1
If there is any other professor for you to take. TAKE THE OTHER OPTION! Biochemistry is an complex subject that requires a lot of explanation and he doesn't go a good job at explaining. His lectures are boring and it's like he's just talking to himself. He puts material on the test that don't match his teaching. I had to teach myself everything.,0
"Professor Hesford encourages students to look very critically at course texts, and does not encourage any particular line of thinking. Assignment descriptions were often unclear, but she was a surprisingly generous grader, despite being very critical when giving feedback on assignment drafts.",0
He is clint Eastwood!,0
"very rude professor, puts everyone down to let everyone know that she knows better than everyone else. Ever met a petty professor ? well now you have. the class itself isn't bad, but her manners are elsewhere. i don't know if shes going through a serious case of menopause, but she shouldn't have to take it out on other students.",0
His quizzes are extremely tough . He gives a lot of places and only asks for 11 on the map quiz. His tests are difficult . He does however let you use your book but it is not much help. His test questions mainly come from the notes. If you miss a lot of classes or even a week of classes you will miss a lot of material.,0
"Thom lets the students teach themselves, he just points them in the right direction and organizes class activities. He's great for discussion too. Not a good lecturer, which is why his teaching style works best.",1
"James is a really nice guy who really likes tables.  That said he is a decent prof, class attendance definitely isn't mandatory, and he teaches almost straight from the book and is very clear about what will be on exams.  He had some cute in class experiments too.  All around definitely a good engr 225 prof.",1
"I have taken Ralph for multiple semesters at Brockport! He is a real gem who genuinely cares about students success and students mental health. A father figure to English majors! He the usual amount of work but as long as you do it and be respectful, you will succeed. My first semester not in a class with him and have gone to visit a ton already.",1
"Adorable professor, very nice. Tries to be funny at times. Rambles on a lot but pay attention to topic that will be on exams while he is talking and you will be fine.",1
"very great teacher, however not my subject. she tries, and does a great job.",1
"Professor Reynolds is one of the best professors I've had the privilege to meet in college. He tries his best to maintain neutrality when class conversation arises, but definitely is well versed in complex social issues. It was a great course and I learned a lot.",1
Good teacher and always there for you.,1
"Rombo is an easy teacher to have a class with. The class does have some more assignments than usual but nothing too hard to comprehend and she offers help. Her accent is NOT BAD AT ALL. People made it seem like a heavy and thick accent, maybe if you have never been exposed to someone from an African country it would throw you off guard.",1
"He is really hard to understand, I feel like. He engages students in class but the material is not clear. There is a lot of homework and you must come to class if you want to pass.",1
"basically impossible to get anything less than an A. it's so easy like i haven't had tests this easy since middle school. but dowden is just so boring during lectures and she is not clear when it comes to grading essays, also beware of the group project - most of the people in the honors class aren't motivated students so they'll be a pain.",0
"he is wonderful, i would recommend taking his class. he is very helpful and keeps the class fun",1
He is a great teacher.,1
"he's an amazing teacher. he thinks everything you do is great art, and really encourages you to find your own style of painting. he gently criticizes with helpful hints for a better painting which is really good for new artists. he rarely lectures but when he does, they're interesting. he's always happy and energetic. pay him more money!",1
"Self-obsessed, boring, reads, completely textular, scope too wide",0
"One of the best profs I've had. His lectures are interesting and he's often very funny, and I had the 3h lectures. I would take any English class with him. Heave reading but it's all literature so if you enjoy reading novels, take his class.",1
Everyone hates on Malkawi and I don't get why. He's so respectful and has great communication. He had to teach babychem after teaching ochem for 20+ years which sucked b/c information was taught super fast but it's not complicated. Don't underestimate studying. Barely any homework assignments and just a couple tests. Doesn't care about attendance.,1
Why are we forced to buy his workbook? It isn't even for the required textbook! It's full of errors -- what a rip off!,0
Worst online teacher. Im a 4.0 student and he grades DQs super hard.,0
"Jose is an inspirational guy, someone whose classes I keep taking just because I enjoy having a prof who is not caught up in all the politics.  He sucks at teaching.  He doesn't know how to lecture or lead discussions, and talks forever about whatever.  Still, he is more passionate about social change than any other prof i have met.",0
"I had the pleasure of taking Dr. Shek's graduate level course on Ancient Chinese religion: Confucianism, Daoism, and Zen Buddhism. Spectacular. Shek has a great deal of knowledge and understanding, and his lectures are always informative.",1
"I had him for both 1000, and 1010, he is not someone I'd recommend. Firstly he does not post teach anything, just monotone reading the power-point out loud. Does not post the slides either. He is not clear on what's on the exams, and is not accessible outside of class. Final exam was insanely difficult, especially with it online.",0
"After 2 degrees and many exemplary profs from Wheaton, I rate Dr Borden the best I ever had. Her Hist of Philosophy class is superb. Philosophers are often ambiguous, but Borden is a very clear, prepared lecturer. Those wanting all Wheaton profs to be conservative conformists may be threatened by her intelligence.  No one else will be disappointed.",1
I didn't learn anything from him. All we talked about was sports and news that was not relevant to learning anything in his class. His overview don't help on tests and the test is made up of random small facts in the book or news that you'd have to watch every single day all day to know the answer to. I would recommend taking Geog with someone else,0
Good class to take very interesting topics discussed in market research,1
"After orientation i felt i would do well. Then i forgot  about the 1st exam which was due 4 days after orientation. She wont reset a test if taken 2 days from due date. Must take exams early to receive help with resetting exams regardless of whether the site crashes or you get locked out.  --stupid rule, she should be available att all times.",0
I had Mark for lab and you could tell he was really passionate about teaching and wanted his students to do well. It took him awhile to explain things and he is a little disorganized but is always willing to help and answer whatever questions a student has. I really enjoyed having him as my professor and makes the class very easy to get an A in.,1
She should be a kindergarden teacher...horrible at giving lectures.,0
"lol that all what I got to say... this man is ridiculous, in somehow I find him funny, maybe the way he looks, sorry, but as described below in almost every comment. He might be a little worse than what those comments says. Don't Take",0
"Rude, Ignorant, Barbaric, Uncivil, Gruff, One Sided, Callous, Rough, Sour, Narrow Minded. This is a woman that has no room for your opinion in her world. She is right! You are wrong! Until you accept this you will never make it in her classroom. Why can't the University bring in Professional Educators for their students????",0
This guy is a jerk. He did not even give me a recomendation after I spent 6 years of my life at UD.  Nice on the surface but is a backstabber.,1
"Log into the lecture on time, TRY to pay attention to his lectures, and do the homework and you'll pass. He's very confusing when it comes to what expects. Be prepared for one day he wants you to just randomly download respondus lockdown for an exam WITH a webcam with no explanation. For technical issues, he wasn't good at assisting.",1
"While she does seem to want her students to pass, she's not very helpful for those that need help. She expects you to rely completely on the tutors, which I don't find appropriate. You cannot have technology whatsoever. Do not schedule classes back to back bc you'll never get out on time. It's difficult but not hard to pass bc of the homework.",1
"really good professor, great guy, makes damn good lasagna.",0
"Dr. C is dope.  He goes super fast, but his work is really clear and he explains well.  Go to office hours.  His tests are based off his notes.  Great professor.  Cute Greek accent and has a funny sense of humor.",1
Prof Gagnon is not approachable and made me feel nervous in class. He picks on students sometimes and is not politically correct. Only applies material to HSA and does not consider other majors in the class. Would not recommend.,0
Dr. Gea seems incapable of speaking like normal person. It's like he's trapped in a world where he can only communicate effectively with other physicists. I HIGHLY recommend learning the material online from Mr. Palmer of Flipping Physics. Watch his videos before attempting the homework since Dr. Gea's textbook has very few helpful examples.,0
the best prof at LU!,1
Didn't really like this prof. She was very nice but rather disorganized and kind of just wrote all over the board which made it difficult to understand what was supposed to be studied for tests. Seemed tougher than it needed to be,0
"He is honestly a hard working great guy. I am by no means a History person adn that showed in his class. I feel that he is to smart to be teaching a 100 level class. He is unable to dumb things down for the students who aren't History majors. Be sure to read for his class and you will be fine. He's hard, but a great guy.",1
"Class is really not needed because she covers the material from 335 all over again. Then at the end of the semester she goes over some new stuff, which can be covered in a few days. She requires attendance, has two projects. The way she words things is very unclear, therefore ask questions in class, she will give answers in class.",0
Hes a great guy and is always willing to help you but he really loads on the work and its not always clearly explained,1
"Not very understanding, especially considering we're in a pandemic. Sent her an email after I missed two classes explaining my situation and she basically said withdraw bc my participation grade wont survive. If you're not a suck up she'll ignore you. The reading is insanely heavy and boring and her weekly 3+ page papers suck.",0
"Professor McCoy is a tough grader on papers, but less so on tests, and his test questions come right out of his lectures, so if you've been taking good notes you shouldn't have any problems. You definitely have to keep up with readings if you expect to do well.",1
"Best professor in the his dept Short papers arent that hard if you make sure you read & cite from the text(prim&second sources) Does assign a lot of readin BUT you learn a lot! So nice & understanding Discussion based so you must go to class & if you do only SOME of the reading, make sure you participate w/ whatever you can She is awesome TAKE HER!",1
If by chance there is another analytical teacher definitely go with the other choice. TTS is cool but she is very unclear and unorganized with lecture material and lab material. I was completely lost the whole semester despite asking for help as much as possible. Online format may have posed an issue for her.,0
"Shin is from South Korea, so he does have an accent, which isn't as bad as you might think. If you do your work and review the chapters in the book you should at least get a B in the class. He really cares about his students and is passionate about Sociology.",1
"Great guy, always willing to help, wants you to understand, but moves fast.",1
"She talks too slow, I cannot understand anything from live lectures, I have to rewatch the videos with speed 1.8x :) her assignments are mostly from SOP, which is boring. She doesn't give so clear instruction, and she even gets confused by the things she gives to us. Not organized structure, she replies mail kinda rude, but she's an easy marker.",1
"Professor Dimkoff's class is extremely easy. So easy it's almost a joke. I don't think I understood anything I did and still got an A-. His lectures are incredibly boring and he goes off on 45 minute tangents that don't relate to anything. If you want an easy A, take his class; Just know you're signing up for mindnumbing lectures.",0
DO NOT TAKE HER! She makes you buy an app and has in class quizzes EVERY DAY and she starts class on the dot and ends on the dot. She will not let you leave and takes attendance before and after class. She words the tests / quizzes in a really uneccesary difficult manner. She is also really rude and her lectures are super boring.  Tests are hard!!,0
The guy is kinda dull and doesn't make the lectures interesting. Tests are tough as well. He's an adjunct so don't expect him to be able to help you with any questions. He seems like he has a more important agenda than teaching in the classroom.,0
"By far best teacher at Cuesta. Helpful on exams, provides food at study groups. FUNNY and informative. Take this class if you want to learn something!",1
"Pretty much the Gem of Clarkson Social Science Section. His lecture is a discussion and he encourages all of us to participate not a ""light-close boring powerpoint"" way. His clarification is perfect in the course materials (but if you believe in something too much it might contradict to what he said). Conclusion: Take him if have a chance.",1
"Literally worst professor I've ever had. She is rude to students, doesn't helped when needed and her tests are ridiculously hard. Especially for a class that is required for a lot of majors. Never take her.",0
Very Difficult. If I could give her a 0 I would. The learning style is horrible. When Ms. Lewis go over the lesson its like she never taught them before. She do quizzes portfolios and Aleks as well. Not will to work with you.,0
Tells students to teach themselves and then screams at students that she doesnt know why she works harder than them. She is AWFUL. Told students to take someone else who matches their level of understanding. Extremely insulting. Screams at the class. Expects students to memorize stuff for an exam on a one day notice. Solid -10000000/10.,0
Amazing teacher. I was so worried cuz I've heard bad things but he really was excellent!,1
One of the best.  She really cares about students and journalism.,1
Awesome professor! So nice!,1
Definitely the funniest dude on the entire planet. Very condescending but it's so ridiculous it's funny. Dude literally broke the oldest artifact in the world,1
"Attend class, turn in work on time and don't interrupt when someone else is speaking. It's that simple. Those who rate him low just don't know how college works. There are rules and generally professors are suppose to be odd. Sure, he has a Holier than thou attitude sometimes. You wouldn't want some meek little man without confidence to teach you.",1
"The tests are made to take more than the allotted time, he is extremely vague, and does not post grades until the last minute, and he NEVER posted homework or participation grades.",0
If you can take a different prof. for drawing then do it. He expects you to know how to draw already even though it's an intro class. He spent more time lecturing on his art and places he's traveled or reprimanding students for being attached to technology than actually talking about drawing techniques.,0
Dr B is the man. Enough said.,1
"3 exams, 3 labs that's it. The labs are left to the TA and you learn them the day of, so pray you get a good one. The exams are 90% of your grade and the class average is less than 50. He'll never through anything with you or helps but instead keeps telling you to work harder. He curves the course but only at the end, so you have to wait to know.",0
"She is very disorganized that it just blows my mind. Gives lab reports like it's Christmas, like chill, your class is not the only class I'm taking during the summer and I have other responsibilities that are more important then her ineffectual labs.",0
"Dr. Carroll is very knowledgeable about the materials. An awesome Linux guy :-) hates WinBlows. He forces you to understand deeply the concepts, so if you just memorize the problems or just copy them down to your cheat sheets for the exams WON'T work. If you're the type of person like to get free grades and don't want to work, pick someone else :-)",1
"Tests are graded toughly and graders are very nitpicky. Homeworks have little to do with lectures, so help from TAs is necessary. Lectures are boring and contain excess and useless information.",0
"AWESOME, fun, easy, tests are straight from the book problem, very laid back, very easy A as long as you do the home works :)",1
Don't bothering taking this class unless you WANT to fail. You will not learn anything with this teacher.,0
"Can be aloof and enigmatic, but hes a tremendously perceptive and thoughtful teacher. Worth stopping by his (usually crowded) office hourshe will chat about almost anything and is genuinely interested in his students. His classes on Dante and Zhuangzi are both excellent, well-organized, well-paced.",1
"I've taken two classes with Dr. Shapiro, all I can say is I wouldn't take his classes if I didn't have to. He's arrogant and fills his classes with lectures where he just tries to show off that he's smarter than everyone. It's been an easy A , but I don't care for his condescending demeanor.",0
"This lady is not only awesome because she gives you many opportunities for a great grade, but she also genuinely cares about her students success. Replies quick and offers bonus points which can increase your grade by 2.5%. Ask questions if you don't understand, she enjoys questions! Retake quizzes for easy points.",1
Best prof ever.,1
You have to read at least 12 books in a semester. Enough said.,0
"Class was a joke. Ron is not only a boring teacher who rambles on about nothing, but the way he treats his students is as if they are in grade two. You will find yourself frustrated, bored, and if you love drama, you will hate it after having this teacher. Run as far away as you can!",0
he's a great guy! pretty cynical but I personally loved it. book quizzes are pretty tough but his lectures are good.,1
A great professor with a ton of experience! Will teach you to work hard and love music. Very encouraging and relatable. Would recommend.,1
"Good teacher overall, just keep up on the practice problems and study for tests and quizzes. People say he is hard but he is not hard at all, the tests and quizzes are easier than the homeworks.",1
"Hunt had decent lectures, he explains things well in the videos he posted, but he's terrible with emails. Everytime I have sent him an email I've gotten a response that made me feel stupid for asking a question, and they've just been overall very rude. Better off just watching youtube videos.",0
"Professor Matchett is MY FAVORITE PROFESSOR!! If the tests are hard, it is because the materials are hard, so you have to work for it. He likes linking the materials to real life (focus on ""why"" and ""how""). There will be readings written by him and homework. You may think it's a lot, but they definitely helped me with understanding. TAKE HIM!!!!",1
this man is too smart to be teaching undergrads.  He takes the study of evolution to a whole new level that went beyond myself and the people i studied with in that class.  very condescending becuase the stuff he teaches is a joke to him (no good),0
"This is the hardest class I've taken. He gives you 12-17 lectures for each unit and expects you to memorize all of them word for word. For the exams he will ask you to write down one of his lectures in correct order, word for word. If you miss information, spell something wrong, or get it out of order, you get points taken off.",0
"Lacher's classes are never easy. However, he does a great job explaining things if you attend his lectures or watch his videos. His notes are so good I would recommend not buying the book. Also, all the material is online, so you can skip class every now and then. Overall great professor.",1
"Mrs. Wenstrom is a great professor, sometimes her methods are questionable. . The only 2 cons for her is the projects and the exams she creates. Her exams are extremely tough compared to what the Hcc finals are. You'll breeze the finals if you get at least a C+/B on her exams. The projects are 15% but it took me 2 days to complete .",1
"Dr. Evans-Nguyen's class is very difficult. Your grade is 95% tests and 5% homework. He does ALL sample problems for you, does not explain well. ""Review"" sessions are the night before a test and you can't ask what to expect- entire semester is fair game. Never unwrapped book. HW is very time consuming (2-3+ hours/chapter). Very poor experience.",0
Has no words except Awful,0
"Unnecessarily difficult exams that may contain anything from the book. Power points provided in class have very little information on them and are no help at all for studying for the exams. BUY the book and get used to reading full chapters if you want anything over a C. If you are in search of an easy A, AVOID this professor.",0
"Professor Yeager is, without a doubt, the best professor that I ever observed.  He is a motivator for those students that coasted through every other class.  No matter how smart you are -- he will make you work, and will make you love to work.  The comment about him being easy is unquestionably a lie by a student forced to change majors.",1
"Take Prof. Welsh's course if you like dry PowerPoints, monotonous writing assignments, and being talked down to.",0
"Prof. Scaltriti was honestly THE best Professor I have ever had. He is a native speaker with a sexy accent, so that made class more enjoyable. On the plus side, he is very handsome and that was a good motivation to study Italian. I hope I will have him next year! He is THE man!",1
Nicest guy! He made class fun and not scary to make speeches. Not a hard grader and says funny jokes! Makes class enjoyable and you want to be there. Highly recommend him!,1
"Worst  , professor  , very difficult, and boring  course . I love biology , but   this professor , scare me  to love biology , science   I didn't learn nothing  from his course , I'm feel sorry for myself . This professor is out of my list .Never , ever again classes  with  him .",0
"Not good in teaching. Book won't help much, you will have study from the lecture. If you get average or above average in the exams you will be fine. This guy doesn't care about students. but he curves at the end.",0
"Kate imparts wisdom from years of teaching different states and even other countries. So really take a listen. Very useful and meaningful for future teaching. She's also familiar w/the CPS schools and our class material is based on them, which is also helpful. In her evaluation of students, she'll be constructively honest - so don't be offended.",1
"I learned a lot about people and myself. I liked the relaxation sessions as I have anxiety from an accident,it help me to relax in other classes as well. I learned how to counsel people with problems. Great man respectable too.",1
Terrible! He is truly all over the place with his ideas and thoughts. His exams do not relate to the lecture or the readings. And why does he make us watch a movie about CORN?!(great nap time though),0
"Disorganized, boring, draconian, bad feedback, etc. Easily the worst SOC prof at Temple. Perspective: The only other prof offering this Required course has their roster fill quickly w a long waiting list while Allen has open seats. $160 for vaguely relevant books is excessive. AVOID THIS PROFESSOR!",0
As a third year ID student I feel that it is necessary to look back on profs I have had. Harry was definitely the safe bet for me. I chose him for 3/4 drawings classes and to be quite honest with you I did not learn much. He was very repetitive with his content and got called out by many students for his remarks and lack of effort. 4/10,0
Bury students with tons of homework without enough guidance and explanation.  He has no sense of fairness! Only care about himself. Make students suffering as if the course is not already hard enough. Lots of ridiculous and tedious rules. No sympathy for others.,0
"i wrote only policy but each one of his classes are a walk in hell...seat in the front row and smile a whole a lot, if you are lucky and he likes you, you are on the clear otherwise...like me...you dont stand a chance, homework and tests and hard and not very helpful for future knowledge - waste!",0
"Great Professor.  Helpful, cheery, excited, easy to talk to, explains very well in multiple different ways.  Great explainer.  She is hilarious.  ""...well some of us would like to think we're still important."" Recommended for any class.",1
"Poole is one of the best uOttawa professors! She is very understanding and makes so much time for her students outside of class. She also teaches very well and thoroughly and truly understands what she's talking about. She gets a bad rap because she challenges her students, but I have taken 4 courses with her and I have learned so much from her.",1
"I don't understand how she is still a professor. I have great grades, except for in her class. No it is not because the work is ""hard"" it was easy but her explanations were unclear on how she wanted the assignments! Half of the class had past assignments from friends to copy from. I hope one day she takes a better look at her teaching.",0
This teacher is just really annoying and accuses students of cheating with no proof. A friend of mine failed his class just because they did good enough on a test that he thought they had to cheated so he decided to fail them.,0
This class was a step above CIS106. It was easy enough to get through this person's lectures on one day and having lab time the next class. I enjoyed class with him and I would take another class with him.,1
"It is true that he tends to mutter, but really he is a good guy and if you make an effort you will get a pretty good grade.  You really have to be self motivated if you're taking a class with him.  He really makes an effort though, and if you try, you will be ok.",1
"I thought I never wouldve been one to make one of these reviews. Well I was wrong. Professor Goussak is an absolute joke of a professor and I would avoid taking her class at all costs. The work load to complete on a weekly basis is laughable, but whats worse is the fact that shell change grades from 100s to 0s at the end of the semester. AVOID",0
Best math class and teacher that I have had. Professor Drake cares that you learn material and will go over as many times as needed. He is available outside of class and answers emails promptly. I highly recommend his class.,1
"Extremely rude,Breaks her own rules by being habitually late and constantly contradicts herself. You will NEVER have the correct answer for her. Her lectures are Long and Boring and at the end of them you still haven't learned much. English is my best subject and she has ruined the class for me;with her poor teaching style.",0
"Professor Sosa is hands down the best professor I have taken at Cortland. Dont go into this class thinking it is your basic ""Pred&Discrim"" class, because it is not like any class youve taken. He opens up you mind to see things from a different light and really can change your mind about some topics. Nicest & most knowlegable prof at Cortland. ",1
"This is one of the best teachers I have had in college. She is by far the most helpful if you are having issues. She will work with you and is understanding if you miss an assignment, just talk to her. She does tend to get off track a lot but in the end we learn the material and have a good time while doing it. She can be strict if someone acts out",1
Did not really teach the Econ material for this macroeconomics course. I took it as a hybrid and there was hardly anything we were asked to do outside of class or even for that 3rd credit hour of the week. He spent way too much time going over unnecessary material like the financial crisis.,0
"He talks about literally everything in the book and when he tries to help you, he gives you a half-(you know the word) correction and doesn;t even have the decency to help you through it. You can't read his writing,so it is really hard to make corrections. Hate the teacher, but if you do the project with extra credit and do decent on tests,it=pass.",0
"Parker, is unsual for a Classics teacher: He is cool and funny AND smart!!!",0
"The better professor's class was full so I had to take Felber. She is a very strict grader. I'm a senior and have never encountered such harsh grading. Sociolinguistics can be a challenging subject. Don't add to that difficulty a teacher who subtracts points for petty, nonsubstantial reasons. If you must take the class, choose someone else.",0
"Nice and funny person, but very confusing professor. I wouldn't take his class again. His notes are all over the place and he doesn't explain much.",0
"I would say it was a relatively easy class. He was kinda confusing at times. The test that he gives are dumb, and very obscure, and the answers weren't in the book. I didn't use my book at all. Don't skip class. it's 40pts per class just for attendance.",1
Love this guy! Easily the best 202 teacher and one of the best in COB. He has high standards but also very fair. Classes fly by. Amazing,1
Took this class as part of a major requirement. Hardest accounting class I've ever taken here. She lectures too fast and tests are extremely difficult. If you study hard for the exams you will learn a lot but it is hard to get a desirable grade. ,0
"Cast is a very vague and inconsistant proffesor.  I stuggled with his class, but went to his office hours.  He was very rude to me and did not help me at all.  I was able to recieve a B in the class, but it was a struggle.  I would recommend a better professor, or at least one that's willing to help you if bio isn't your thing.",0
There are quizes every class which do nothing but waste time.  Over head projection of other students papers that are very little help.  He does not help one on one at all.  He says... looking at a certain persons paper would be unfair to the other students before gradeing.  You will learn nothing but its a easy B.,0
"Kenny G is the man. Fun and interactive speaker, very knowledgeable, one of my favorite profs.",1
"Prof. Driver is very knowledgeable about what she teaches, but most importantly, she is a nice lady. also, she has NO DUE DATES, you can turn in a paper whenever you want, how awesome is that?! all too often professors who are knowledgeable but not good at teaching pop up, but Driver is crystal clear, and relates her topic to the class.",1
Tests are NOTHING like the quizzes given,0
She is the hardest grader I have ever encountered in my life. Based on this alone I would avoid her.,0
He is a great teacher but he also works full time so he doesn't always have the most time to teach.,1
dont do ittttt... dont take it,0
"Lot of material class moves quickly took it over summer session. The final is cumulative, which is 12 chapters. Literally 12 chapter in 1 week to prepare for. What kind of dipsh*t makes a cumulative exam for a 300 level course?",1
"Just Awesome. The best professor I have ever taken. Keeps lectures entertaining, and tests and quizzes come straight from the power points. Would definitely take this course again if I could. The book is important for the reading assignments that might be asked on the quizzes and exams.",1
"Professor is nice and understanding. Expect a pretty full (but bearable) work load, but she gives great feedback and makes the class fairly interesting.",1
"This was the toughest business class ive taken a jmu so far. She's a great teacher and youll learn a lot but the class has no easy grades which makes it tough. There are 4 HW that are difficult and graded hard. The are also 4 tests including the final which are even harder. She means well, but not an easy class. I would find a different professor.",1
All classwork is completion grades and he is very lenient about late assignments. As long as you turn your work in you will receive points.,1
Asks a lot for a class most people are taking for core. ,0
"Janson is a pretty easy professor as long as you PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT HE SAYS. I learned the hard way that if you don't take thorough notes on the things he says about each piece and artist, the tests are going to screw you over. Study for the essays beforehand and really go over your notes and you'll do just fine.",1
"Textbook was assigned, but I didn't use it. Her lectures were enough to pass the exams for me. You get to drop an exam if you need to, or, if you get a high enough average on the three exams, you can skip the finals. Only three tests and the final, plus extra credit. She is funny and uses a lot of videos in class. Definitely liked listening to her.",1
He is knowledgeable. He is open to questions and clarification. Hard to follow lecture. Easily gets sidetracked to give extra examples (not necessary). Lectures are interesting due to examples doesn't leave enough time to cover material. Thus need to read all chapters to understand concepts.,1
"I loved taking Dr. Fischer's class. His lectures are very dense and it can get a little boring, but as long as you do the readings and go to discussion it'll be fine. His midterms and final were a bit tricky because they're all free response. You really need to understand the material and expand upon it with your own objections and/or agreements.",1
The only bad thing about him was that he takes way too long on each problem,1
I may be a little biased since most of the semester was online but Professor Dee was super accommodating! All the tests became weekly quizzes and we were allowed to use the book so they were easy! There are about 15 homeworks but those are all super easy and on quizlet. This class is also really interesting in general and she does test review raps!,1
Laverty is a cool guy and really smart. Succeeding in this course depends on listening to the lectures and trying to gather the important info from the extra info. It can be hard because the lectures can be all over the place and he posts them at really weird times with little notice to do them before class. Also no office hours so good luck,1
He gives us a 20 minutes presentation to do and 8 page research paper when the class is just elective. He should have given us a option to choose between presentation or writing the paper. Not do both. 12 people drop out of his class because of it.,0
On day one you are given a syllabus that contains about 12 textbooks required for the course & are told that your entire grade comes down to 3 major tests.  He has a very thick accent that can be hard to understand at times. Does not curve. Majority of the class will fail the exams. Every1 tries to check out the book for the final exam all at once.,0
Prof. Browning is a true professional who has many years on the hazmat front lines herself. She will work with you if you let her. I would love to take another course with Prof. Browning at AMU!,1
"I'll start by saying, ""Oh my god. He is so boring."" He speaks in a deep monotone voice and even jokes about it in class occasionally. His lectures cover really deep material, but the homework covers the absolute basics. His tests barely change between years so if you can find a previous year test, you can easily pass using it as a study guide.",1
"Pretty much ruined my Freshman year. Moon Kim would spend an entire 50 minute class going over an extensive problem, then at the end stare at the board and announce to the class that he did the problem wrong and to forget what he just did. This happened on multiple occasions. Avoid at all costs.",0
"She's great.  She tries to make things interesting and fun.  It was a bit of work at times, but it was worth it.  Can wait to take another one of her classes!",1
"For a beginning programming class he makes it very difficult to understand and he moves very quickly.  Will not work with you. He will gyou an F on assinments unless it is EXACTALY the way he wants it, even if  program works PERFECTALY. Not a very nice guy.",0
"Lectures are useless because his explanation is not clear enough and you are on your own. The labs and lectures are unrelated to the tests. My third test is in two days and he haven't announced our test 2 results yet after about a month, so we know our situation and what to aim for third test. Try to avoid him.",0
"I came into this course very nervous, through what past students have told me. At first it was very easy and I thought I was getting the hang of it. She didn't tell me what I really did wrong on my essays and told me ""it was a good piece of writing"". She ended up failing my final portfolio, and told me I didn't fix what she told me to. Do not take",0
You need to have a good math background for this class. She focuses on certain topics in class while the test rely more on the book. I had to figure things out with the homework. Sometimes she doesn't explain what she's doing so you may have some confusing classes where you just copy what she does without knowing what it means.,1
i would take one of his classes any day. b/c i never attended to class or did much of anything for it and still did good.,1
"Dr. Bibza is a great professor. However, don't take his class if you do not wish to work hard. He is very helpful though, he's always in his office and he responds to e-mails very quickly.",1
"Karim is a great professor! Explains well, takes things as slowly as students need, tests are straightforward.",1
Datt is a tough professor and teaches by the textbook word-for-word but if you study gradually up until the exam date you should be fine! If you don't want to work for a grade or study often I would not recommend him. He does give lots of extra points/credit on every exam. It takes a little bit to adjust but he's nice and will look out for you!,1
"Extremely wonderful instructor and truly cares about her students. Because of her, I found a love for Philosophy that did not exist before. Wish I could take all classes with her.",1
"A very challenging but informative professor.  Grades came from three multiple choice tests, no final.  He has a ridiculous amount of insight into politics and history, and is a really nice dude (as long as you ask intelligent questions!)  Would recommend for anyone seriously intersted in history.",1
Homework was online and easy. Study PowerPoint slides for test and youll do fine. Required to buy iclicker for questions during lecture.,1
"Great teacher. I truly learned. Really tough class though. Her grading is tough and usually unforgiving. If you come to class and at least try to answer questions, she'll learn your face and will be more willing to help you with grading, though. She is really nice and really loves to see students succeed.",1
"His lecture content is very good and thorough. Doing the physical and WeBWorK homework should prepare you properly for the exams. He is a real gem when it comes to online professors at Tech and his course is truly exceptional. There is no ""self-lecturing"" in his course unlike how other professors at Tech describe their online courses.",1
Wayyyyy too many readings from various books. No tests except for a take home mid-term. One paper that you work on all semester and pop quizzes on the readings. Real cool guy who will help when needed. ,1
Professor Baruch is the first math professor I really liked. He made the information easy to understand and really cares about his students. His economics statistics class is definitely one I'd recommend,1
"Absolutely incredible professor. She is so well-versed in psych and neuro, and offers her class a wealth of freedom. On labs, we don't get points off for the ""wrong"" data if the lab is done properly and we explain the data/why it is wrong. She also tells exactly what to study for exams, and the questions are straightforward.",1
"Contrary to other reviews, Peter does not know what he is talking about and often pauses in class to think of a possible solution. He does not answer questions clearly, leaving the class mystified most of the time. He does not give you two weeks to complete assignments, but a week if you get a head start. Test are difficult. Avoid this professor.",0
"If you take good notes, make flashcards of your notes, and commit them to memory, the class will be a breeze. His tests do not require application but rather just memory recall. His powerpoint slides don't have all the information: write down everything he says too! The online textbook was useless for the tests but you do need it for the quizzes.",1
"I actually really enjoyed this class and learned a lot. However, lots of studying is required to make an A, and you need to treat discussion posts like ""mini-essays."" I recommend seeing her in office hours if you are struggling; she can be very helpful. Don't plan on skipping- after 2 absences, she starts taking percentage points off your grade.",1
"He is by far the worst professor I've ever seen. He has a very thick accent and I barely understood what he was talking about. Not only he has a thick accent, but he also did not go through the materials very thoroughly. He will explain something without reason, and he expects you to understand the concept. He repeats stuff over and over again.",0
"Basically just reads of PowerPoint slides. Tests/Projects/HWs are extremely easy. Very accessible outside of class + very caring towards all students. He is glad to help you any time. The class would be better if he taught more advanced stuff, wouldn't just read off slides, and make us learn more contemporary Java frameworks.",0
"Professor Chen assigns one, two-paged paper a week. They are only for completion but still, try your best because he does read them. He gives out a study guide for the exam that have the exact questions as the exam, so it is easy to get an A. Just read the book, take notes, and you will pass the class.",1
"Professor Miller expects high quality work of his students. At times the workload can feel like a bit much, but he is an incredible lecturer with impressive connections. If you want to do well in his courses, pay attention in class and demonstrate your effort by attending classes and going of office hours.",1
"He is good by nature/not rude but his accent is heavy which makes it complex to be attentive in class which makes everything 10X more harder and sometimes he gets lost while explaining, he doesn't accept late homeworks at all and no compromises but he does give extra credit work. You can ask him questions if you don't understand but it doesn't help",0
"I would definitely take this professor again. Great attitude, the writing assignments actually make you think, and you will learn a lot about yourself that you didn't realize at first. My only complaint is he seemed to try to push his liberal views on us during in class discussion. He never brought both sides to the argument, only his side",1
This teacher is so boring. would not recommend this class for anyone looking to pass with an easy C. Do not take unless you LOVE to read boring long books.,0
"So many unnecessary online quizzes that she does not mention in class, but expects u to know as they are on the syllabus. Toughest grader ion essay and if you expect to get an A in this class, best of luck to you as I don't know a single person in my class that has gotten an A. Super boring lectures as well, almost fell asleep in every single one.",0
"Don't get me wrong, it's an easy class worth an easy A, Especially if you don't have much of an issue with speaking in front of people. Wolfe is a great professor, and he has the best interest and intentions for all if not most of his students, and I appreciate that. My only criticism is that his his assignment structure is a bit unorganized.",1
"Literally 316 and 207 2.0, so you need a good background in both. Don't expect any help from her office hours. The only redeeming part of the course was the TA's solutions which made much more sense than the ones she posted. Exams are slide fact memorization, and (Slides+selected assignment) problems. updated Formula sheet posted at last minute.",0
"Took him for Senior Sem, very funny, cancels class a lot, but is down to business when we have class. Somewhat unorganized and hard to follow when giving directions. Your grade is based on 1 reading  that you present to the class, a final research paper (60% of grade) which is somewhat challenging. Attendance is significant as well. Rate it 7 out 1",1
"Terrible teacher! Absolutely hated her class! She cusses more than a sailor and it makes you really uncomfortable. She complains about the school she teaches @, other teachers, students and classes. she doesnt want to be there. She graded a work and gave me a D, another teacher said it deserved at least a B. She ""doesnt believe in perfection""",0
"I had Mr. Warren 5 years ago and he was one of the best professors I have ever had. He is very intelligent & does not leave room for ignorance in his class. I loved the fact he expects you to come to class to learn at a college level & doesn't pussyfoot around any topics. If you are a special snowflake who needs a ""safe space"" this class is not 4 u",1
He is a tough grader and he gives u 4 essays and the final and gives u grades on those and thats all and then for extra credit u have to listen to his Boring friends talk. Gives u a lot to read and it is almost always on the same crap ok get your note card out today class we gonna talk about the sublime and how It is good to use Forget him,0
Avoid if possible...okay teacher but too strict in grading!,0
"Robert Mustard is without a doubt a terrible teacher. He tries to throw everything at students, confuses them on tests and puts unexpected questions. He purposely wants his students to fail. Please do not take him. he always puts on a fake smile in front of everyone. He throws curveballs on tests. Please avoid this man, I just want to help everyone",0
"Moody, always has a frown on her face; dry and boring; there are better profs out there - take somebody else",0
Lecture was long and tedious..........,0
"McDowell's exams are crazy difficult. I copy and answer the study guide questions for every exam and cannot make above a 70. His lectures can be interesting at times, but even when you listen and take notes you'll struggle. If you have to take this class, good luck.",0
He is the worst teacher I have ever taken at Pace. Does not explain this when need be and tries to blame the students for his confusing guidelines. How do you teach english when you cant even explain a syllabus correctly. Do not take him. Trust me.,0
"Lectures are good you do lean a lot , but beware of test, Quizzes,he grades them very very and I cant say enough harshly. Very little partial credit on test no partial credit on quiz. Also, beware of a loophole of RE-TAKE TEST, re-take is much harder then the original test. Tests are scrambled from homework to quizzes to examples from lectures.",0
I really think the Dr. Hill is a great professor. She really cares about her students success and has a great attitude and outlook. Her teaching style is also awesome as she reviews everything before testing that we need to know.,1
"Jawad is a really nice guy that you can joke around with.  I really enjoyed him as a teacher.  However, he is sometimes hard to understand.  I recommend that you try all your homework problems and go into his office if you have problems.  He takes questions off the homework for the test and quizzes.",1
"Siddiqi is a caring professor who teaches in a clear and organized way and always keeps in mind whether the students have understood the content better. Admittedly, some of his assignments are tedious, but I am very thankful for that. (Remember to start homework early :)) The mid-term and final are not hard if you review thoroughly.",1
"If you have a choice, I'd take this class with someone else. Professor Kuo is a monotone speaker with dense slides that number upwards of 100. The tests are worded in ways that make every question seem like a ""gotcha."" The type where he'll put in a little detail at the end of a question that makes it false but you'll want to answer true. Good luck.",0
"I absolutely loved this class. Dr. Sears is extremely intelligent and really knows and loves what he is talking about. The class consists mostly of watching his online lectures and taking quizzes/exams. The exams are pretty hard, but everything is open note so it is definitely doable. I would highly recommend taking this class.",1
"Professor Perkins lacks in the area of professionalism. I have never been so offended by an educator. She constantly berades her minority students and passes it off as having a "" unique and hands-on"" teaching style. There also have been several instances where I have feared for my personal safety under her leadership.",0
"Cliff is brilliant. I've had him now for Federal Jurisdiction, Evidence & legal reasoning, Law & Society, and I'm about to take him for Judicial Process and Administrative law. Only has two grades: midterm and final so if you don't like that or tests for that matter, don't take his class but you will learn a lot from him (great if you're prelaw)",1
Great class!,1
"I liked the way he went over the homework in class. If anyone had trouble or had a question, he wrote it on the board & explained it. I also liked how he gave 4 tests during the semester & averaged them for the grade + points for homework. I think it's much easier than just one test at the end & you can see how you are doing before it's too late.",1
"Dear god what an immature ****. After years of schooling a prof should be above taking his dislike of a studuent out on their grade. I questioned him and argue some of his statistics in class, and coincidentally i failed BOTH exams. If taking, kiss ass.",0
"You go in blind to all of the exams and final. There is no study guide. When asked, she does not even divulge how many questions there will be and if it is multiple choice. All she says is that whatever is in the book, lecture or previous courses is fair game. It is a incredibly difficult class and extinguished my interest in accounting. ",0
"He assumes a position of intelligence, but lacks the acting skills to see it through...tragically, he is not aware of this.",0
"She goes through material very quickly, without giving many examples. She basically expects her students to already understand what she hasn't taught. She does not grade homework so your entire grade depends on how you do on the tests and quizzes. She grades extremely hard, if you don't write out every step she doesn't give you credit for it.",0
"Dr. Conner is an extremely interesting and knowledgeable professor.  He has excellent communication skills.  If you are willing to read the textbook, study his powerpoints (posted in Blackboard), and listen in class, you will pass.  Be sure to use the rubric for his papers as your outline.  If you do, you will get the full points every time. ",1
"He seemed alright, but turned out to be really bad. He is misleading and not genuine. He plays favorites. If you're one of his favorites then great. Otherwise... Also, he's very bad with communication.",0
"Prof was unclear in his expectations for assignments and exams & never had enough material to cover a 3h lecture. More than half the class was review from the previous week & all the new material is crammed into the last hour, often resulting in keeping us until 10PM. He means well but doesn't explain concepts well so i relied entirely on the book",0
"final exam was a joke. focused a lot of class time to things that weren't even on the exam. the group project was so time consuming. he is not a nice person, doesn't have time to help you, doesn't answer his emails for days. avoid taking any class with him.",0
very strong accent. very hard to understand.  I didn't learn anything in this class.  He teaches stuff that should be common sense to most people.  If you know  how to use a computer this class should be easy for you.  He gives out multiple choice tests which arent too bad.  pretty boring lectures.   Veryyy easy to pass class just do all the work!,0
"Madhu has a very specific expectation for the work done, there is no space for differing opinions or varying learning styles. She seems highly sensitive of Indias stereotypes and uses this to share her own of Americas, and the recognition of a broad gender spectrum is lost. Patience for full time workers getting tired at the end is nonexistent.",0
"thinks more of himself than he does of his students, real opinionated",0
"Took his class during COVID. I faced a lot of obstacles that were out of my control during this semester. I had explained to him in an email but he did not make any accommodations, not that he was supposed to. I lost two close family members and found it difficult to concentrate. Tests are difficult and homework is done in groups. 1 group project.",0
"As long as you attend class and take notes, the class should be an easy A. The tests are straightforward and he is very clear about what is on them. He is clearly very knowledgeable about the subject, and makes the class very interesting. No textbook required either.",1
"Kumu Keao was amazing.  His lectures are a little redundant because he sticks with the same story over a period of a few classes, but that's just to help reiterate the lessons that are being taught   You have to turn in assignments on time, ONLINE on Laulima, but he is very understanding if something comes up.  Communication is key for this class",1
Waste of time and money.,0
"The only thing discussed in class is farming rather than English. She rants about how the class should be doing better but rarely gives any feedback to improve upon (if there is any it is useless to most of the class). For a first year English course this was an excessively difficult class, marking is harder than it should be. avoid at all costs.",0
"Not the best at office hours. DO THE HOMEWORK. The homework is optional but if you don't do it you won't pass. Lectures are pretty boring but they do the job, mostly. It is hard, but not Fink doesn't make any harder. The class is by nature tough Fink does not make it any easier or harder he is just sort of there. average.",0
Amazing professor! You will be really lucky if you get prof Schloss in clinical. You will learn a lot!!!,1
"I think Prof. Minden is a pretty good teacher. As usual and obviously, I disagree with most of people's opinions. He is just a good teacher and for a 388/programming class you don't need too much instructions.",1
Open book and notes on tests and exams. Class is easy some of the projects are hard. Ask him for help.,1
"You don't have to go to class, but you would be stupid not to as he gives so many hints and his lectures are really good. Overall a great prof and really cares about student success and always talks about postgrad opportunities and gives you an idea of what those might look like.",1
"Dr. Parkerson likes to go on tangents and talk about ""the good ol' days"". I did not learn much in Digital Design, and I am not prepared for Computer Organization. The homework was easy, midterm easy, lectures too complex, and final exam extremely hard. When asked to explain something, he repeats himself or says look in the book. Get help from TA",0
Have a beer with him and you will do just fine,0
"Easy A. Lectures are useless and do not help for tests or essays. Professor Stott is difficult to understand as he rambles and his lectures are very disorganized. The class consists of two essays (the textbook and discussion help a lot for information) and two tests (know the IDs and essay prompts, be specific)",0
"Honestly dont see why everyone hypes him up. He isnt horrible, but hes one of those teachers who thinks their class is most important or the only one youre taking. Hes a funny guy and makes it interesting. Theres a lot of tests that are long. Homework was easy BUT there was a ton of it. Go over note packets before each test and you will do ok",1
"and Phys 2 lab. She knows what she is doing, just she sounds like she is scared all the time (really low voice) and she has a thick Indian accent. CRIBS, Mastering Physics, and Study (I'd suggest group study)... That is all. She gives partial credit so even if your stumped, write down similar equation stuff, you might get lucky.",1
"Best professor in DePaul's college of communication. She is a rarity as the rest of the department, save two or three professors, is the complete opposite of Dr. Murphy...take every class you can with her, it's not easy, but it's helpful and career-based",1
"Calls himself ""Lib Daddy."" If you dont have an interesting class to go with this professor, the class is terrible. I had a VERY difficult time even going to this class because it felt like such a waste of time. but the assignments are easy, the hardest part are his quizzes at the beginning of the semester, you really need to read/study for those.",0
"Students discuss the subject, while she moderates. She never taught in the class, thus after paying 5K in uni fees you get opinions of ur peers & understanding from readings She is unable to keep her prejudices out of class & grading. If she dislikes you then it gets difficult Her approach is idealist & not policy based Take another professor",0
"The content of this class isn't difficult, especially if you've taken public health. The professor is not awesome at communication - she takes several days to respond to email, assignments are assigned to canvas without her telling the class there was homework. Exams are relatively straightforward if you read the textbook and PowerPoint slides.",1
Great Teacher that knows his stuff.,1
"Extremely reasonable prof whose primary flaw is what one might consider and unhealthy obsession with ardvarks. Initially the material was difficult to follow (probably a consequence of the (lack of) effort invested on my part), but became easier toward the end. (Advice: read relevant chapters BEFORE going to class).",1
yells at you when you ask questions about the grade you got on an assignment. hard to understand,0
"Dr. Pohjadak is an example of what every prof should be. He is knowledgeable, informative, funny and cares about his students. He admits to marking easily; just make sure you go to class as anything that comes out of his mouth could be on the exam! Great prof. One of my favourites.",1
"Means well, super  nice, a little crazy and loves to talk about jam and laundry detergent. As long as you read the textbook and attend most of the lectures, you will do fine in this course with this prof.",0
She is so lenient with grading. Never ever have i met such a caring and understanding professor like her. Her lecture is boring but it is not necessary to attend her lecture but you gotta read all the books.,1
"Unorganized, does not teach properly, not even a recommended textbook to refer to. He doesn't give out proper notes nor proper explanations about the concepts. Just goes straight to showing his Matlab examples without proper explanation and jumps from one topic to another, which is very difficult to follow since the class doesn't use a book.",0
"Sometimes we make opinions about people based on their personality.  No doubt he has a great personality, in front of a group ""when he's on""  But, there is another side.  Personality does not mean great teacher",0
Awful professor. He only reads off of slides and does not actually explain the content. No point in showing up to class if you can just copy the slides down from online. Tests are hard and tiny mistakes usually means full loss of points (even for misspellings). Would never take this course again because of this professor.,0
"Overall professor Mattox was a great guy, I knew almost nothing coming into the class and he was always available for extra help and loved answering questions. It is clear how much he enjoys teaching and it radiates to the students, highly recommended.",1
"I honestly would not recommend him. He will give a certain type of example on the board during class, but will give you quizzes and tests on a completely different example you DID NOT do in class. Coming from someone who took Calc in HS and understood it really well and could do it in my sleep, I find it really hard to learn from Tripp.",0
"Taking this course online will NOT be easy. You need to dedicate time to read each chapter and take your own notes. She gives her notes per chapter which help with the assignments. She also gives practice tests to help study for the exam, use them. This is a difficult course to be only 8 weeks and it's all on you since she doesn't teach.",0
It was a great class we did lots of interacting in projects and discussions.  I really liked the individual research and the professor edited my papers and gave me advice about how to improve my work. She was inspiring.,1
"Very smart and interesting professor! Class can be a bit boring, and it is hard to know what she is looking for on papers if you aren't too familiar with art history papers. Attendance isn't mandatory, but you will get thrown off if you miss. Ok class, but i wouldn't reccommend it if you are a non-major.",1
"The class is hard but Natalie makes it so interesting! Shes an amazing teacher and def take her if you can. We were graded on easy pop-quizzes, a midterm, a group project, and a final. Read the textbook, attend the lectures and work hard on the project and youll be good to go.",1
Prof Blazer is an amazing professor. I took buad 341 with him over the summer and it was a lot of work but worth it. He will always answer your emails and helps you with any problems during the semester. Expect to spend 8 hours a day on his class work.,1
HIlariously bad,0
"Not a very good teacher in class. Tests are hard and you need to study a lot for them. Lectures are extremely boring and not helpful. DO THE EX. CREDITS! their tedious but they give back so many points to your grade. You can do bad on the tests and do fine in the class. Also, go to her office hours before tests. She is extremely nice & helpful then",1
"Love professor Thompson! Took his course for Fall 16 he was the best. There really is no reason to fail his course, he explains everything and gives a great test outline that prepares you for the exam. Brought in donuts and treated us to breakfast on the last day! Take him if you can!",1
Terrible communicator. Makes material way more difficult to learn than it needs to be.,0
"Great professor, easy to work with an a pleasure to be in her class. She is dedicated, responsible and very knowledgeable in her field.",1
"I was at first very intimidated by Professor Shapiro's qualifications, but she is very down to earth and interesting. I was lucky to have her for my fys, because it gave me a good idea of what future classes should be like. She did not treat us like freshman either, which was nice. She expects you to be prepared, and that makes discussion better.",1
She's a great instructor and very easy. I even emailed a lab report a day before it was due to her to see if it needed improvement and she sent it back less than 30 minutes later. she's very dependable and willing to help. She'll even tell you the answers if you just take the time to ask her. she's great!,1
"Professor Tigner is one of the BEST professors, very interesting lectures. Make sure you hand over you home quiz every week. don't be late in her class .",1
"SO SAD SHE'S RETIRING. my absolute favorite teacher i've ever had. i had heard that this class was going to be so hard, but it's one of those classes where you get what she teaches or you don't. definitely a weed out class but in the best way. hate she's retiring, have loved her! so funny, and i've learned so much more in this class than any other.",1
"The class was extremely boring because he just reads his slides, and he often diverts and talks about something unrelated to the subject, that's when I get lost after trying my hardest to pay attention. And he's not funny, although he certainly think he is.",0
Never received grades back for any assignments or the final project. Class was confusing and not much guidance was given. Midterm average was not very high for a technical elective. Final exam was very hard.,0
"Great professor. Loves the subject. He is very helpful and you can tell he wants everyone to be able to pass. If you don't study for the tests you will not pass this class. It's not one you sleep through for an A. He takes attendance twice. Overall, great class. I would take him again.",1
WSU obviously was desperate for a director of bands when they hired a high school band director. Music Ed Students: Do not tell other music teachers that you have any connection to him or you will be looked down upon like he is(especially in some MSBOA districts in oakland county),0
Hard to understand and extremely boring. Picture a slightly overweight Ben Stein but from India!!!!,0
"One of the nicest, most helpful people I've met since starting at Marist. ITS130 is not supposed to be hard, and if you have any interest in computers/internet at all, you will enjoy it and get an A. Don't slack off on the mini-projects though... they count a lot.",1
"So far I'm loving the courses I'm taking of his. He tells you exactly what he's looking for when it comes to papers. It is very clear that he truly cares about his students and their grades. Amazing professor, you're very lucky if you get him! ",1
not always right.  loud.  but passionate.,0
"Had Dr. Baldwin for Calculus III. Takes attendance during lectures, but I don't think they factor into your grade. Final grade determined by 3 100 point tests and 1 200 point final. Assigns HW at the end of every section, but it is optional. If you can do the HW, tests should be fine. A little boring during lecture, but he speaks good English",1
Don't recommend taking her class,0
Great teacher! He is very clear and will explain everything completely. He is very patient and will go back to anything you didn't understand.,1
"Worse Teacher ever. I got "" B"", but he is busy talking bout his life n some other things. try to finish everything at the end.  Doesnt knw how to average out. Not good at replying back.",0
Professor Brown is a nice guy outside of class. In class he is very into himself and thinks his opinion is the only opinion. He expects you to know what he is talking about at all times even if you've never learned about it. He is an extremely hard grader. Lots of quizzes and if you aren't there for one you can fail the class. Dont take this class.,0
A top-notch professor! She was completely knowledgeable in the field and the clicker tool sharpened my listening skills beyond belief (and was fun too!)! I was totally interested and NEVER bored in this class! DO NOT believe any negative comments posted about her. Her teaching style is untouchable! Only regret: she only teaches one class at RIC!,1
Doesn't cover material that is needed for his tests.,0
the worst teacher that i ever taken,0
I was always late in his class... he did not give me that evil look... but he gave me a C-...  His exams are no surprise. I screwed up because I didn't study for the final.  and for them midterm... I did really good.. and studied only 1 day before exams.  His notes are very complete.  If you do his hws and study class notes..you'll be fine.,0
"This is by no means an easy class, but I want to do all the work. Duke is a hard-ass, but he really wants everyone to truly learn and become a better student. He's truly one of the best professors I've ever had, and I have such respect for him. It's a lot of work (a lot) but it's all essential to the class and so rewarding to complete it. ",1
"dr nerdberg. boring boring boring class. grade isnt that hard, but you will def dread her classes.",1
He is a really nice guy but is not a fair grader. Only one student gets an A in his class. Many students have lost their 4.0 because of this class. Material is not hard but he makes it confusing. He gives pop quizzes that are rather difficult.,0
"Professor Orozco is super hilarious. Throughout this semester, his class was the only one that I was mostly looking forward to attending. He should have been a stand-up comedian. His lectures are super funny and entertaining. Apart from that, you learn so much. The class has 3 quizzes. The 3rd is the final. Homework for every lecture. Take it!",1
She's nice but its a pointless class with lots of busy work.,0
"I don't believe I've ever disliked an English course this much. The course should be amazing - we have a really great topic. But her policies are unusual, and very strictly enforced. She once stated that, ""Due dates are more like loose guidelines,"" and then proceeded to deduct points harshly on late work. Inconsistent, and no compassion at all.",0
"This class is super easy. But this professor is the horrible at explaining the content. He is a super nice guy, really caring and cool, just sucks at explaining math. I taught myself how to do everything in this course.",0
"He is funny, at times, and you can tell he LOVES geology,which is good, but he doesn't know how to teach this course effectively to his students. He doesn't let us go over our test results and he is a bit condescending at times. We only used the text twice. Our lab prof. had to pick up his slack. Cage is a good man but not the best instructor.",0
"If you can take classes with Cliff. He is a great guy and likes to tell a story or two when the class gets bored. He also grades like a ""G"" anything above an 85 is an A. No final if you get the grade you want.",1
"Dr. Sanford is probably the most underrated professor at Hope College. She is a great professor, and I've always wondered why she received such bad reviews. Although I think there are better professors at Hope, she really isn't too bad.",1
"This is a very interesting and easy UGS. There are many grades that are gimme 100s. You must show up to weekly discussion sessions but they're easy and enjoyable. Lectures are optional. He is invested in his students, really cares about their questions, and wants to give you the tools to make your own decisions. Very fair and well taught course",1
"Made a formal complaint on him. His lectures are boring and monotone, literally doesnt care for his students. This man must be out to get everyone cause he's ""retired"" but had to come back cause his wife kicked him out. His test and quizzes were confusing and SUPER hard for no reason. Mid term was SUPER hard for no reason and unrelated to PDFs.",0
"Prof. Spainhour is very passionate about journalism, and is a clear and knowledgable communicator in the classroom. Her excitement for it all helped me to get excited about journalistic writing. She gave us assignments that would mirror the work that journalists are doing in the field. The big assignment at the end of the semester is worth a lot.",1
"I would dare to say that this is the worst Writing Professor in NYU. She's vague, except when it comes to her ridiculous and tragically terrible prompts. Then when you don't write exactly she wants, she gives a bad grade and never gives any helpful criticism. There is absolutely no room to engage with your writing on more than a superficial level.",0
"Intro to Geology - ""ultra-liberal philosophy"" comment from before, not true.  Gives info, then shows info to back it up, allows for questions.  You'll do well in class, and like it!  Great teacher.  Kind of a hippie.. very effective.. 2 thumbs up.",1
"This professor is an extremely hard grader. Although she may be very knowledgeable of statistics, she is very particular and grades harshly. Expect a lot of homework. There are a few quizzes and a few tests; however, they are tough. I really worked hard for my grade in this class. I was not a fan of this prof, and would not choose her again.",1
"He is a very difficult grader, but he doesn't seem too bad overall.",0
"He cares a lot about students performance, he is very fair and tries his best to benefit students. I took Chem 3021 in winter 2014 and he made me like mechanisms. I was doing bad at the beginning but boost my grade to B+ in the final. I might take 4021 with him but I am scared of stereochemistry. I see him sometimes now I am taking summer school.",1
"Horrible class! After reading the reviews I thought I'd give him a chance...huge mistake! So boring, and the tests are pretty difficult. Don't waste your time, take a real class, that is actually interesting, that people will take seriously",0
"Not very clear. Fast paced, doesnt try to clarify. Assumes that you have a very strong algebra background already. Would NOT reccommend.",0
"All assignments must be in complete MLA format. Even if the information is there, if it is out of order, the assignment will be given a zero.",0
Mrs. Wedemeyer is A Great Teacher She Is Somewhat Weird But Overall She Cares About What She's Talking About.. I've Taken 2 Different Accounting Courses With Her As My Instructor And I'm Taking Another Class Fall 2016 Where She's My Instructor. I Like Her Style And With Me That's A Great Thing !,1
"The class is an intellectual joke. Take home exams and everybody cheats. If you want to ""get over"" this is the class for you. but it really is an insult to college.",0
"Dr. Haynes is wonderful!! He is lively and keeps the class moving. This is not a blow off class at all, and you do need to do the readings and attend class, as the lectures are what everything is based off of. Two essays, Two MC tests, and that's it. If you can take him for any class, go for it!",1
SHE IS EASY BUT STUDY HER NOTES AND HER REVIEW. STUDY HER NOTES NOT ONLY HER REVIEW. SHE IS NICE AND CLEAR. GOOD LUCK!,1
"I loved Latin before coming here. He is a horrible language teacher, he offers no support in or out of class.",0
"Best Sedona professor on campus. He made this class easy to understand. He gives you everything you need to pass this class. All the tests were based off his lectures. If you take notes,show up, study, there is no reason why you dont get an A. Anyone who says that his tests are tricky or hard just didnt study. 4 exams, easy homework assignments.",1
"Dom was AWESOME!!!  He was very Helpful, Understanding, respectful and Fun. Easily my favorite Instructor/courses.",1
Answers emails back extremely fast but the course load is a lot. You work for your grade. Grades critically.,0
Literally just go to khan academy and watch how-to videos instead of going to class. Study her past exams that she posts and you wont have a problem. Tough class to get a straight A. Take her classes online or hybrid to get out of clicker questions.,1
"Took SOC100 with him, and it was awful. Our final exam was nothing like any of the content we did, we were tested on the most random, and menial facts from more than 500 pages of readings, and that does not include lectures. This class will not teach you sociology, and its uses. It will teach you how to memorize every little detail. DO NOT TAKE IT.",0
Professor Walsh is a very sweet lady and really cares about her students. She does clicker question every class. They aren't hard but it really helps your grade if you go to class. She also uses course capture so if you miss a class you can watch it online. She always offers extra help and has review sessions for every exam. I would take her again!,1
"8:30 class, in Winter. Slides last updated in 2010. TAs unable to solve issue ""why won't Assembly programs compile"" for 3 straight labs to the point they told me to use other people's computers in the lab. Doesn't respond to e-mail.",0
"This is the second class I've taken w/ Sean-- great prof! No homework. Just lectures, sometimes shows boring movies, and gives study guides for exams. There are always short answer Q's but he usually tells you one, if not both, of what they are AND how he wants them answered. Pay attention and you'll pass easily.",1
"I do not think Kirshvink is as bad as others make him out to be. Is he really good? No, but there is really no reason that a person should fail this class. Kirshvink spends 75% of the lecture on the proof, and the other 25% doing a practical problem. The T.A.'s are there to help you, the MLC will help you, and SI sessions will teach you even more",1
"Not a fan of professor Sikora whatsoever, terrible lecturer, not easily accessible, taught myself the whole course the textbook. However, his tests are a joke so I guess that helps.",0
"Dr. Sewell is a horrible professor and does not listen to his students. He is all about him and the school does nothing about it. He allows subpar material, then assigns tasks in which students spend more time figuring out what the actual tasks are than what they spend on the assignment. I would not recommend anyone taking courses under him.",0
"Readings required for this course were very difficult to understand - did not tell us what material Quiz 1 and 2 covered - when asked no response was given. Extremely tough course; did all readings, and extensive research and additional readings but i just found this course to be very dry and poorly executed. certain surprises on the final exam.",0
"I would suggest any other professor for this course. Ridiculously confusing, and as someone else stated, it's more about writing styles of papers. I didn't learn a thing. ",0
He was not a good professor. He assigns things last minute and does not give a lot of time to complete assignments. He does not explain things well and expects all of his students to already know how to do everything. He moves very fast and never answers questions. He is very unorganized and does not seem to care.,0
Prof. Burg is so sweet and kind. She truly wants her students to do well. Get to know her and visit her outside of class. Must study for exams cause they are not easy.,1
"I took intro to Journalism thinking it would be he basics in journalism, it was the farthest from that she acted like we already had a background in journalism which many of us did not, I endned up dropping the class. do not go into her class expecting to just learn the basics, and she is very particular on her editing, she critiques too much!",0
"No comment other than TOTALLY HAWTT! If only my grade were dependent on the total number of fantasies i have about him in my spare time, i'd be set!",1
"very cool lady, she doesn't like it when you don't show up, so go, she usually lets you out early anyway... her finals can suck though cauz they're usually long papers, but the class is easy, if you listen you will pass.",1
"This is the easiest class i have taken. you can easily get an A on every exam, All you have to do is show up to class. She basically gives you the answers to the tests in her lectures so definitely take notes. She is not the friendliest person but as long as you do your work you will be on her good side. textbook used for hw and classwork",1
I had the professor last year and had a very poor experience. He got angry that the class because we failed to participate when he asked us a question and threw his headset on the table and stormed out. He did come back a few minutes later to continue. Embarrassed multiple student for simply asking a question(reason for the lack of participation).,0
"Wanted the midterm average to be 60%? wtf? this is a 4th year class.. give us a break.  No review session.  Seems to help his favorites in class/lab.  I was an idiot to take his class as an elective while in Systems.  .. and its called an ""Intro"" to dsp.",0
"I took him for Swimming for Fitness. The class was fun and he explained how to do strokes perfectly without even getting in the water. If you miss more than 3 classes you fail the class. If you show up, participate, and do the modules on time you should pass. Do not take this class if you have another class right after it though",1
"class was pretty dry, but the seminars were good (depending on your TA)",0
"Lazebnik is a nice guy who really loves math and wants you to do good, but he is insanely specific in what he wants & not good w/ partial credit. He is willing to help you in office hours but it didnt help me. Most of my class withdrew/failed. Collects/grades hw, 4 tests &final. attendance is mandatory. Wouldnt recommend esp for non-math majors",1
"This class has been the worst class I have ever taken at WCU. He never gave clear instructions, and he struggled keeping the class engaged. No one respected him, and his tests were ridiculous. I learned nothing in GEOL 140.",0
His tests are online and okay. Take notes and read the articles. His lectures are extrememly boring but he takes attendance so you have to go.,1
Gives quizzes for 20 min timer,0
"WARNING: DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Dr. Wilson's class is too all over this place. His instructions are so unclear, he makes basic algebra seem like rocket science. he is very rude to his students at times. he doesn't care if you are on your phone. if you have to take him just show up, sit in the back and bring headphones.",0
"I enjoyed taking this class. The information I learned is invaluable, and the way Dr. Kelley supplied several realistic examples made the content a lot more interesting. Initially, I thought that it'd be extremely boring to learn about adult stuff; I thought it'd be high school health class all over again. But, she proved me wrong!",1
Great teacher but here is how it goes 7 question quizzes out of 5 points so you have 2 extra bonus possibility for each quiz. Never tells if there is a quiz or not on the reading 20% of ur grade. 2 Research essays about the themes or anything about what you read 20% each essay. Midterm 20% and final 20% all that added up and thats ur grade.,1
You will understand JavaScript and be able to make fun little applications by the time you finish this class.,1
She made us take an online exam on Respondus+Monitor and then have our phones set up on Zoom behind us with our screen in view (i wish this was a joke). She is a heavy grader and has multiple assignments due a week. They are not listed in canvas and are due on odd days of the week (I.e days we don't have class or weekends),0
Doc is WAY into music and it rubs off on his students.  Fun outside of class (KKY) and an awesome person all the way around.,1
"He may have been good in the past but this semester he was confusing, unnecessarily complicated and EXTREMELY unhelpful. ",0
"I loved this class, and it was really easy. If you have any interest in Music history or Classical music take this class.",1
comment below is so true! save yourself! flee from this guy!,0
"Ok, I have NEVER done a professor review. But Guetter is that bad. He is the worst professor I've had in my entire schooling. Get ready for LOTS of mathematica & nothing that expresses your Calculus knowledge. Get ready to be laughed at, belittled, & mocked for trying. I did well in the class, but I can't believe hes still employed. -stars for him.",0
I respect him as a researcher but I was a bit disappointed in his lecture style. He spends a lot of time just showing pictures of animals. He goes too fast to take good notes. Upside- he's very clear about what will be on the exam and repeats important things incessantly. I finished feeling I should have learned more during lecture.,1
"If you like poetry then take any of his classes. He knows exactly what he's doing. He's written books on t.s. eliot. I mean, seriously. I took intro to poetry and modern poetry in succession, and I liked his classes immensely. It seems that people who like to think they know poetry better than he does dislike his class.",1
Tries to throw you off on exams. Didn't round up my grade when it was within 0.4%,0
"Great class overall! Learned a lot, good lectures, some in class group work but it's not too demanding. Would take again.",1
"Professor Cook was an amazing professor. He was given a tall task with two big obstacles in my semester: COVID shutdown, and he was thrown into a class he didn't teach in the first half. He covered all the material he could very effectively and gave everyone a fair shot with as many assignments as possible. His lectures were funny and great!",1
My 1st media class EVER.  Instructor didn't explain things well & assumed we had a prior history of media study & I had non whatsoever. Syllabus says quizzes will come from textbook but questions show up from videos or something entirely unrelated. I got nothing out of the late nights I stayed up studying for this class except for a bad grade.,0
"At first I was apprehensive of Ms. Fedorchak because she teaches an english class, but I came out really enjoying poetry. I didn't know she was doing her MFA at the same time in poetry, so that addition to the class was really cool. I learned a lot from the poetry alone, more so than reading essays. I wish we talked about poems more in class",1
"The class was extremely interesting and entertaining as he knows everything about everything and loves showing it. There were 4 articles per 3 hour class, and you must know them (main topics as well as subcategories) in order to do well on the exams. I would recommend if you like the subject and are ready to work. You will learn a lot!",1
"Excellent lecturer. The course content was quite dry, which isn't his fault, but his explanations are very clear. He is willing to your questions during lecture, right after the lecture or during office hours. Moves through the content at a good pace and does his best to make the lecture interesting.",1
worse class I've ever taken. Lab reports take forever to be graded and she take points off for every little thing wrong. get out of this class if you can ,0
"I HAD MR. SHARP FOR BOTH 1301 & 1302. HE IS A VERY GOOD TEACHER, LOUD AT TIMES, BUT VERY NICE & HIS CLASS IS NOT HARD AS LONG AS YOU READ YOUR BOOK & TAKE NOTES!!",1
"I looked forward to every class with Dr. Banerjee and was never disappointed. such a great prof- she cares about her topic and her students, and that really fosters student engagement and a sense of community in classes. has quite a few assignments, but mostly little - felt like a lot by the semester's end, but very manageable. take her class!",1
lectures = no relevence to anything in exams or life.,0
Terrible professor. Has an awful way of teaching that makes it impossible to do his homework. The homework he gives absolutely does not relate to his lectures. would not recommend taking any of his classes.,0
"Stated that certain things would not be on the exams that are on the exam such as stats. Had to grade on a curve because over half the class failed both mid terms. Highest mark before grading on a curve was 75%. Can not have your own opinions, and belittles students who differ from his own opinions. STAY AWAY.",0
I am a student at UCSB and took this CC English class to get some credit done. SHE DOES NOT TELL YOU YOUR GRADE so you have no idea how you are doing in this class. This class was harder than any UCSB class ive taken(math and bio double major). GRADES POETRY as if there is only one interpretation (C on midterm because didnt like my ideas. DONT TAKE,0
"I actually enjoyed this prof. I loved the hybrid part of it, watching a lecture in bed is awesome! However, there is a LOT of material. Videos, slides, lectures, textbook... The textbook is super useful to stay on track and not get confused. Beware of his exams: MOST of the questions are on anecdotes and real life examples, so don't skip class.",1
Really fantastic. Funny and helpful. Willing to work with you instead of against you.,1
I loved him. He made everything so easy to understand. Plus he's cute,1
"Wasn't grasping a concept very well asked for help, dude straight up asks me if I have a learning disability.",0
"class is easy. tests are online. essay was a final, open notes. she is very nice and knowledgable but I feel like I didn't learn too much from this class. If anything, my spanish got worse. This class isn't a grammar course, but we didn't learn anything. culturally yes, we did learn a bit, but she was boring at times too. never uses a syllabus.",0
"Two absences allowed and after that points are deducted. He often has information wrong, but if you memorize what he teaches you'll be okay. He also kicked a student out for sneezing one time, so watch out when he's in a mood.",0
"Professor Lombardo, is probably one of the nicest people you'll ever meet. He's super helpful with every assignment that is given and clarifies things when need be. I had issues with my project and he helped me every step of the way and made sure I understood what mistakes were made so I wouldn't make them again. He's a great professor. ",1
BORINGGGG class..basically teaches the book in class. accent is a little hard to understand sometimes. comes off as friendly and helpful but it's all a front.,0
"Professor Pearce is a nice guy, but he didn't do well transitioning online due to COVID-19. His lectures were long and boring, which was hard to deal with online. I feel like I didn't learn anything from his class. Do not take his class if you are not good at teaching yourself the lessons.",0
"Intellectual prof but says some questionable things; ""Justice is minding your own business like the Me Too movement"" Very smart, but lectures are very content heavy",1
"If I were to go back to the begining of the semester, I would take this class somewhere else. Cristina says things that are not appropriate for any educator. She has told us that few of us will ever be able to get a job in the feild we are pursuing and is not encouring. When she says something nice, it does not come off as genuine. Good luck!",0
hardest math class i've ever taken and i am good at math. that's all i'm going to say,0
"One of the best math teachers I've had. Kurt makes his classes worthwhile for all types of students, whether you are a math nerd or just need the credit. His tests are incredibly fair, but it's definitely useful to go to class (and his reviews before tests!). I've taken a few of his classes and would recommend others to do as well.",1
Professor Noimann grades very unfairly. I took her class online and she wasnt helpful at all. I turned in all her homework on time and participated and passed all her tests and assignments and overall gave me a poorly grade. I highly recommend you dont take her.,0
"One of the best profs I have ever come across.  Truly cares about what he is teaching and the well-being of his students.  He goes the extra mile to make this work for his students, is always available to meet if you just send an email, and is always willing and wanting to teach you.  Best of all, he understands that mental health is a priority.",1
"Considering that he teaches one of the most difficult subjects in college, he is an AWESOME teacher. Very well prepared for class. Tests are fair: ochem will always be a challenge but if you do the work you should be okay. Very helpful if you approach him",1
"This class is hard, but its a two-in-one gen-ed knockout, and the content is very stimulating. Unlike most classes, you have to actually participate to pass. Sections are easy and offer extra credit every week. Very funny dude. Not much more I can say.",1
"Pr. Higgins is awesome! She is by far the friendliest, most approachable professor I have ever met.  The lecture material is fascinating as well as the readings.  Tests are 90% from the lecture, so no tricks!  Best class I've ever taken by far.",1
"The most arrogant professor ever. Incredibly vague on his expectations. Avoid at all costs. MUST attend all lectures, does not post anything online.",0
"Meh. She seems very nice and Im sure shes knowledgeable but it seems like she really didnt put effort into teaching. The recorded lectures were no help and most of them didnt even cover the topics on the tests. I did like the SI meetings though, I found them really helpful.",0
"Awesome, caring, funny professor. Gives great feedback on papers that will help you pass, and he truly wants all students to succeed. Probably the most available professor I've ever had, he will always make time to sit down and help you. He is somewhat of a tough grader, in that he wants to see his students take their writing to the next level.",1
You think it is an easy class until he piles all of the stuff at the end.  An alright teacher.,0
"If you are SCM major, this is your only option for MGT 367. I suggest taking it right after 366 because you will use the same concepts. Taught at the level for the CPIM exam, which is $600+ now so I think the curriculum needs to be changed. This class is VERY hard, the hardest class in my major (about to graduate). Lecture heavy moves quickly.",1
"In class Dr. Haile can be a bit confusing.Much better in ofice hours.He works at a alower pace which is nice. Tests are pretty hard, nothing like book or practie test really, but a lot of points in the class.I would take him again because you can flunk tests and still pass.",1
"Terrible terrible professor. Took him for CS245E (online bc Covid) in Spring 2020. He was just so lazy, was always lagging behind on assignments and checking and releasing material. Really unhelpful on Piazza and inconsiderate when students were struggling with challenging assignments and were requesting for assignment deadlines.",0
Professor Bailey is a sweetheart. If you show up to class and pay attention you will easily pass. Shes personable and would help you in a heartbeat. Theres quizzes every Friday where she cares more about the work than the answers. She does a lot of group work packets which will help you understand concepts better. I recommend taking her class.,1
"One of the worst classes, he couldnt care less about his students. Most of the class had failing marks and he enjoys talking down to students infront of everyone. Take any other class than this, hes an awful person. Most of your grade is based off group work, if you have a bad group then you will struggle.",0
"Her media literacy class was very interesting. Alot of you're grade is based off papers 3 papers and 2 exams. Exams aren't too difficult, tough grader with papers though. She's very funny and can be at times very over zealous. But its very refreshing compared to alot of the boring teachers at CCSU. I strongly suggest her.",1
"Everyone should take Prof. C for Business Comm. He is the best professor I've had at Fordham. Extremely clear teaching style, funny and helpful. Will make you a great speakerpresenter. One of the friendliest professors at Fordham. You will learn so much from this class, and have a good time every day, too.",1
"The class is disorganized, assignments changed at the last minute.  Lectures aren't mandatory, but they are minimal at best.  Expect to write at least 6 papers, no tests.      If you expect an organized class that follows the syllabus this class isn't for you.  I would not recommend this class.",0
"When you stress the book is mandatory for part of your grade, it helps for the book to be helpful for that part of your grade. When a third of the class don't know when things are due, it might not be the students. Even if it is, then complaining about your students in class is not helpful. Emotional unilateral nuclear genocidal ethics rants here.",0
never,0
"Debra Stevens is the worst teacher I've ever had. I cannot imagine why ANYONE would give her any rating other than 1. Her class is incredibly poorly organized, her writing is riddled with errors, and she is almost impossible to get ahold of. Also, she uses a textbook to teach English? What? Just a bad teacher.",0
"Amazing professor! Very understanding yet strict. I respect him because he always reaches out to any email! I would recommend this class, very easy to follow the lecture and there are only 8 assignments which were all very compelling.",1
Goucher needs some new professors in the CS dpt.  Zimmerman is past her prime.,0
What can I say more about it?,0
"He is a nice guy and teaches really well, agreed. But do not take him as a professor. He grades the exams brutally. Even if you got most of your work right for problems, and messed up in the end, he won't give you many points for that question. He is a really tough grader, and doesn't even respond to his e-mails.",0
This guy is awesome. His lectures are fun because he likes to randomly blow stuff up with hydrogen or freeze things with liquid nitrogen and more. He is funny and laid back and wants to help you pass. Definitely recommend.,1
"Do not take the online Philosophy class. Quizzes/tests are remarkably and unnecessarily difficult and I'm not the first to say so. You get the impression of being punished for taking an online class as if it equates to slacking or cheating. College classes are tough but this class with this professor is, in the simplest of terms, unfair.",0
An easy course but I didn?t learn much.  I agree with the other rater who said they should not have someone without a PhD teaching the course.,0
Best prof I've had to date.,1
"I failed this course and it wasn't for lack of trying. Estrada is a very nice, intelligent guy, but I found his expectations of students to be a little high. We had to memorize all equations, where other profs gave equation sheets or note cards, and we were not allowed to use calculators. Physics is difficult enough without that added pressure.",0
"Ms. Ellen Fox, what an airhead. She doesn't explain and expects that you can read her mind and do the assignment. She doesn't have a grading site. So, the semester is pretty much in the dark and you don't know how you're doing. If you email her, she won't respond and you will have to ask her about it next class. But only two papers, easy class. ",0
"Rambles on and on and on. And be prepared to be really offended. Seriously, really pompous and rude.  He knows a lot, but doesn't know how to teach it to an intro to history crowd. Assigns too much reading from too many sources, and you end up not getting much out of any of them.",0
"Very irresponsible professor.  He chose to NOT follow any textbook (which is fine), but then proceeded to give us barely any homework problems to practice with.  He was irresponsible in that he provided homework solutions 2 days before the final exam and simply didn't prepare us (even the top students) for the difficult questions on the exam.",1
yea its easy except the tests are impossible and she LOADS on the work right during finals... i hate this class - and i actually like the material,0
"If the class is online, don't take it. Ive heard he's better in person.",0
Not good,0
Professor Davis was remarkable. She is very understanding and maintains communication throughout the entire course. Constantly sends reminders to submit assignment. Three papers and discussion forums that lead to great dialogue among the class. She truly motivates you and will provide you a incredible alternative outlook on the political society!,1
"Great Professor! Really nice and professional, show up in class, participate, read the material and you will get an A.",1
"At first I hated him.  Then I took three other classes with him.  He is the hardets teacher I ever had.  But he is by far the best. I came into his calc class thinking I was hot stuff and going to get an A.  I still got an A, but it required 5x more work.",1
"Come to class, prepare to listen to what she has to say for the whole time and you'll be set to go. Papers are realy easy if you are on time. Only complaint is that she is a little inconsistant when it comes to being on time for a private meeting between yourself and her.",1
"Horrendous Teacher. The class was impossible, the message never got across. He really cannot teach at all and should immediately be fired. Before this class I was an aspiring CS Major and after it I dropped it all together and changed my major to something else because of how horrible he made CS for me. He has to be the worst teacher ever at MTU.",0
"There are four tests, of which he will drop one. The class of 70 students averaged 61% on the final three tests. The professor is loud, and sometimes inappropriate. While it is apparent he knows the material well, he does a poor job conveying that knowledge to his students. An obstacle to overcome, not an introduction to the subject. Avoid!",0
"The material can be difficult conceptually if you're not a math person. Just make sure you actually do the homework and know how to do the equations (no Chegg). As for professor Riggs, he rambles and gets off topic so often it's hard to follow. If you have problems staying focused, this is not a good lecture for you.",0
An interesting lecturer who is fair and caring. She gave us all 10 minute individual interviews after the first test (class of 50)... not many profs do that! The course got me interested in poetry.,1
"Teaches through examples, which is not how you want this class taught.  Brutal grading on HW (wrong assumption loses you 50% of your grade).  Could be a useful class if it was taught properly.",0
"Wouldn't really recommend her as a prof, her midterms were extremely difficult. However, she does have a good marking scheme which does help you from not failing.",0
"Doesnt help students, most boring class ever. Dont take if he is teaching it.",0
"I loved this man! Even though I took his class online, I still learned a lot and was even inspired by what I learned from him! He made the class fun by giving funny examples and was always making sure that everyone understood the concepts. He commends you personally for doing well in the class. The tests are hard if you do not study a lot for them",1
"Matchett is an awesome guy. I had him for lab, and his explanations at the beginning of the class were the reason I understood what was happening in my lecture. He always answers questions in a way you can understand. I wish that I would've had him in lecture.",1
"I went to Professor Rombo for help figuring out Blackboard and she told me she ""didn't agree with my observations"" and then proceeded to talk about it during class, implying that ""the student"" just couldn't figure It out for themself.",0
great professor. tests aren't easy but you'll learn a lot from the class,1
"This class has much potential to enlighten students on the workings of migration and forced migration. Unfortunately, the presence of McIntyre makes it difficult to learn anything about said topic. The most helpful day we had was our last day, where he was too sick to come to class. If you want to learn about migration, take up an internship.",0
"Dr. Burkhart's EGEO100 course is too difficult to do well in. No powerpoints, no d2l, no organization, hard exams. In class, he rants more about climate change than teaching material. Often, his emotional rants would make me feel uncomfortable. 10/10 Recommend taking biology or physics rather than EGEO100.",0
"Great professor.  I would have thought that Phil would have been a drag, but he actually made it interesting and fun.  There are times when you are laughing at his jokes and then you leave and think back to the class and remember the content.  I cannot think of another class where this is true.",1
"Absolutely amazing! Definitely my inspiration. If there is anyone who can get you eager to create and draw, it's him! He has such a gift and he is an incredible teacher and artist. You are amazing, Prof. Mazellan!!",1
International Development No tests but the papers were hard to understand what was required. Not many points through out the semester... would not take this class for fun but if its part of your major it is bareable. Love Barrow as a person but it is difficult to have her as a professor.. especially with the lack of clear communication,0
"In Contemp. World she was a little stricter because it is a freshman class and she needed to be. However, for every other class SHE IS A GEM. TAKE HER. EASY A! dont even bother reading just bs your participation in class (so easy to do). If you are good at writing papers you will get an A. She makes class fun and has a lot of videos to show. LOVE",1
"If I could have taken this class with another professor I would have. In every encounter I had with him he was rude and disinterested in what I had to say. His answers to e-mails were vague and never in full sentences. Weird because he seems nice while lecturing, it's just one-on-one he is like this. Grading ends up fair though.",0
This is college so he will teach you but you must read the book too & use his office hrs. He is EASY with test because he gives you a pre quiz with the same EXACT problems just diff. #'s. Math is my worst subj & I got an A because he allows you to use a model problem on test to help guide you. Do the prob EXACTLY like the model. GO TO THE TUTORING!,1
This was one of my worse experience with a professor. She gave so many papers (2 per week) Plus she gave an entire 15 page research paper with only 2 weeks to complete it. Plus 2 5 page papers due that same week. On top of that her instructions were terrible and she grades so hard! I would not recommend her to anyone. Everything was too repetitive.,0
"makes anoying noises that make you want to punch him, didn't help very much",0
"His tests are extremely hard. If you must take this class, I recommend a light load, it is very time consuming. His study guides and lectures barely cover anything he asks. The test are timed and questions and very tricky. I was on youtube a lot for better understanding. Also do the extra credit even tho it cost extra, it will help in the end.",0
I loved his teaching style. Managerial Accounting could be difficult subject (especially reading the book) but his lectures made it so much more easier to understand. He leads you through subject by emphasizing essential points of Cost Accounting. He also has a deep but energetic voice so no way you will fall asleep. Highly recommend.,1
Dr. Shiba is very nice and loves what she does.,1
"He is loud, arrogant , and very into his head. you don't really learn much since you google all of his exams. he is  super narcissistic, tries many mental games on students, and not worth taking his class. I just took his class because I had to. ",0
i have no words for this professor. I walked into this class every MWF asking myself why am I here. The only point in going is for the attendance curve. I stressed everyday about this class just to pass by 5 points. Get ready to teach yourself every single concept. DONT DO IT.,0
Still has not changed three grades he put in incorrectly. Fairly bad at answering emails. The content is interesting though but he seems to be forgetful about students. He also posts assignments like hours before they are due even when it is due at 12 AM online it could be posted at 10 AM. I would still retake the class.,1
This class has been painful. Not sure if it's because of the professor or because the class is just boring overall. He makes it worse. Lectures are long and draining to get through. Lots of details. Be ready to sit through hours of PowerPoint slides.,0
Lieberman clearly knows what hes talking about but isnt great at teaching it. Sloppily hand writes lecture notes on notepad and talks at the same time. While deciphering his handwriting you must also try to understand him without a microphone. Tests were hard enough but doable with a lot of studying. One of my least favorite teachers thus far.,0
"Dr. Garrison is such a nice man and really does try his best, he just isn't the best professor. But for lab if you go to his office hours he will tell you everything you need to get an A on the labs and assignments. AGAIN, really nice guy just wouldn't recommend him",0
"Yes, Feurty is moody and somewhat crazy. However, he is truly one of the best teachers on the PSCI Dep. He´s a fast talker, but his lectures are very interesting.TIP:pretend you are smart and motivated to learn and you are set for an easy A. YAY!",1
"He is mad boring...it's like watching paint dry..hes a nice guy, but hes an accountant not a teacher so he just tells you how it works instead of teaching it to you..",0
"He is a hard teacher, but he is very nice and willing to work with students.",1
She doesnt leave any time in class for the labs to be completed.,0
"Professor Sa was a great professor. People dont like him because they may not get the best grades on the weekly lecture assignments. However, if you put in the work, you will succeed in his class. He very organized and such a nice man. I personally loved having him as a psychology professor. I recommend having him as a professor!",1
The questions he asks are somewhat unclear. Asks random students questions to see if they did their homework. Did not explain at all the Restaurant - Bank project. Take Voskuil for 204.,0
"He's a really nice professor and he usually will give you the answer to the in-class iclicker questions. If you show up to class and do the work, you'll be fine. You do have to buy the connect online textbook which is kinda spendy.",1
"Pay attention in lectures, speak up during class discussions and do extra credits. You will get an A if you do that.",1
"Easy class. 10 blackboard posts, one essay, 3 exams, and one presentation. Everything is really easy. You use the book all the time. As long as you do the work, you will pass. Attendance is mandatory. Lectures are boring unless you actually get involved. Nice guy though.",1
"Jeff acts as if he wants you not to understand the material. His grading criteria is unclear and seemingly arbitrary. When you go to him in office hours he often refuses to help you understand the material as ""That would prevent you from truly learning"". He has a nice holiday party though.",0
Thanks for the climate change fear mongering propaganda. If I didn't need this for my degree I would have walked out.,0
She is nice prof and replies to emails and questions . however her lectures r very boring and she is a hard marker. her midterms and exams r also very difficult and lenghtly questions with insufficient time,0
"She expects you to know the basic material of the class on the very first day in which she builds on each and every day after. Therefore, if you don't teach yourself what you are paying to be taught, you will not pass her class. Its obvious that she loves biology but I don't think she realizes how much she makes her students despise it.",0
"Not a fan! He was quite rude to the TA and consistently talked down to them. He has a habit of coming off quite condescending and isn't a fan of repeating himself. I did find the course itself interesting so it wasn't a complete waste, I just would avoid another class with him in the future.",0
Avoid at all costs. I do not understand how professor Pietro is getting good ratings on this. He is a terrible professor. His tests are extremely difficult. I had many mental breakdowns throughout the semester. Attend his lectures because he uses many formulas that are not in the textbook. He is not clear on what he is testing you on for tests.,0
"Good teacher.  TEST ARE MOSTLY ON CLASS MATERIAL.  If he writes it on the board, you might need to know it.  Review your notes before the exam and skim the texts being tested.  Tests are straight forward.  Nice guy and easy to work with.  Papers aren't difficult if you put a slight amount of effort into them.",1
"Great teacher, the only problem I had was that assignments didn't get graded for an extended period of time.",1
Jeanette's class has been my hardest at IU. She didn't like my style of writing so I failed two assignments. Still ended up getting a B+ in the class. Useful information taught. VERY nice lady. Grading did seem slightly arbitrary. Hardest business honors class hands down.,1
"Gerd is a brilliant man and if you get a chance to talk to him outside of class, you get to know him as a friend, not just a professor. I also experienced him as a director which gave me a even larger respect for him. Though the tests and assignments were challenging, I learned a lot. I highly respect and appreciate this man very much.",1
"Best professor i took at brooklyn college, honestly changed my view on physics. Amazing and nice",1
"I wasn't expecting the difficulty of the exams, but honestly, the class was SO informative and she grades on a decent curve so it was worth it. I got the most out of this class out of all the JMS classes I've taken in my 4 years. Attendance isn't mandatory, but she doesn't upload lectures online so def go and take notes! She is also super sweet!",1
Theresa is awful. She waits till last minute for everything. You could go above and beyond trying to get a decent grade in the class and she would not notice nor would she care. She seems off in her own world and cannot seem to handle the large classes she takes on. She grades harshly and never provides an explanation for such grades. Avoid!!!,0
Dr. Mark Haggerty may have been the best professor I have had at the University of Maine. He is an inspirational professor and a true educator. If you actually want to learn something from honors and be challenged intellectually this is the professor you need. He will not make things easy for you but that's not the purpose of a liberal education.,1
This guy is out of the boundary tough for getting a good grade. I am usually 75 in english but I just passed in this course. He is experienced and do try to put his effort in lecture. CAUTION: But only take his course if you are a 90 grade student and can afford to go downhill to 65-70.,0
Not a fair instructor.,0
"Terrible, terrible, terrible. Completely unprofessional, frazzle-brained, and delusional.",0
"Dr. BA is a wonderful professor once you get to know him. Although, he reads a lot from the slides, you just have to read the book to be able to understand everything(after all, that's what the book is for). He has a very thick accent, but if you are a very good listener you should not have any problem of understanding him :)I would recommend him.",1
"This course was a 6-day trip to New York to attend the HRW Film Festival,  Fordham Human Rights Conference, and Columbia Archives. Most of the trip was paid for and the professors were friendly, knowledgeable, and made everyone comfortable. We had planned activities but also time to choose what we wanted to do--one of my best college memories!",1
"Professor Qasmieh is by far the best professor I have ever had. He will always expect the most from his students and pushes them to succeed. He wants to set up his students for the future and he does exactly that. He is always accessible and will give up his free time to help students. If you work hard and stick with it, you will be in great shape.",1
This is one of the more difficult Psyc classes I've taken. Her slides don't give you a lot to go off of and she doesn't post them. The tests are not very easy and the average is usually in the 50's. There are 2 papers and a group presentation with no rubric so you just do what you can and get an arbitrary mark.,0
"Public speech isn't my biggest thing. I did fairly well in the class, although I think this teacher sets some of the feedback deadlines too soon as she wasn't able to give feedback out for the last speech.",1
"Harold has zero knowledge with technology! His papers are all over and gives many unorganized papers that doesn't really make any sense. The materials he teaches are so easy, but he makes everything complex and impossible to understand! Take this class with other prof if available!His midterm was quite difficult but you'll do fine if you work hard.",0
Prof. K. The worse teacher you can expect taking it. Very hard and tough grader No curving. About 30 quizes in one semester SOOOOO many papers and theres no way you can pass it with B I kept stuying every day/night and still couldnt do it im an A student in Chemistry pretty good at memorizing but this class with this prof. Pls DONT TAKE IT!,0
A wonderful class.  The lectures are full of fascinating material.  It shows that he really loves art for its beauty.  :),1
He is nice enough but (partly because of the subject matter) is confusing and not always clear. There is a good amount of tedious homework but not a bad experience.,1
"The class is very fast paced. There is an online system used for all practice, certification homework and exams. Prof. Serikova is available to help you outside of class if you need help. She will work with you and come up with a plan if needed to help you pass the class. She is aslo very encouraging .",1
He is so strict that he scares me. Don't talk in his class or else!,1
"Worst teacher, why am I even calling him a teacher. EVERYONE failed EVERY test, highest test avg for class was a 52, with a 20 point curve. ",0
"Dr. Zwier is an amazing professor who is super caring and understanding. He runs his class based on group work, which I found to be better than lecture. Everyday involves working on the daily activity with your group. Content can be difficult, but he makes it easy to understand. His tests are A LOT easier than any of the other professor's tests.",1
"Imagine having Regina George as your lab coordinator and that should give you a pretty idea of what Rashmi is like. She tries to sounds nice in her written communication, but it reeks of fakeness. The amount of work required absolutely ridiculous considering that the lab component is only worth 20%.",0
shes nice and very helpful. she teaches really good.,1
"Leprohon is the BEST prof ive ever had. He is the sweestest and most engaging professor and consistently shows the he cares for his students and their learning. He doesnt post his slides online so dont skip lectures, I always looked forward to them anyways because he makes them engaging and fun. Will srsly miss having such a great Prof",1
It's hard to take notes in his class. He doesn't have very much structure and seems to be all over the place. The class is really easy so it's not too bad though.  His accent is not bad but can be confusing at times,0
"Not sure why her ratings are so high. She really does care and seems to like what she does, but she isn't always clear on what she's teaching. There is a group project but really it's pretty much on your own, you write the intro together and then you are on your own for the rest. Tough grader, not very flexible hours to meet. tough class imo",1
Professor Dolgin was a hilarious teacher. His lectures were entertaining because they are relevant to real life issues. He likes to take you all over the place with them though. He has 4 different papers and he does one on one grading your paper. He is a down to earth type of guy. He does want you to have the book tho. It helps do the assignments.,1
"Professor Hynie is the most caring, knowledgable, and supportive people at York. Extremely clear expectations. She has so much experience too! I'm not done the course yet, but I'm loving the course with her!!",1
"Prof. Potter seems like a really smart guy who knows what he's talking about. However, his lectures are scattered and often go past the scheduled end time. He also kind of just rambles on sometimes which makes you really question why you even bothered coming to class. His instructions are vague and unclear most of the time. Really nice guy though!",0
"Cock Rock is not really all that bad, but his lectures tend to be a bit tedious.  He's an easy grader who expects you to be able to churn out the arguments covered in class - take that as you will as a positive or a negative.  He's not terrible or anything like that, but he's pretty mediocre, all things considered.",0
"For RTV 151 show up to class and take notes. Use the Study Guides and make note cards for each test. Save those note cards by test and when you get the final study guide, pull out the ones related to the topics on the Study Guide.The questions on the final come from the tests so look over those too.",0
"It's true that you either get econ or you don't, but if not you can still get a good grade. His lectures are informative, but not too dense as he cuts it up with funny, relevant tangents. He explains everything well, is very knowledgeable & welcomes questions, esp at office hours. DO THE REVIEW QUESTIONS. Don't need the textbook.",1
"Really bad professor. Theory heavy and it's her way or the highway. She flaunted a criticism written about her stating she ""indoctrinates, not educates."" 100% accurate. I found her REALLY condescending, even though she let people talk -- especially when she explained ""how to write a paper"" each time she assigned one. Interesting topics, bad prof.",0
"Jerry always makes the class significantly harder. His lectures go very quickly, if you don't pay attention for 1 second, you're lost for the rest of the class. He's good at explaining, but I feel goes too quickly in lecture and doesn't stop enough to make sure students are getting it. Explanations could be less code heavy and more visual.",0
This class was incredibly frustrating due to how vague the professor was on assignments and tests. It made it very difficult to study for. Most of the time I left class more confused than anything. Also I relied heavily on the TA because I would always have questions about assignments due to unclear instructions. I do not recommend this guy.,0
Nice guy but has the teaching ability of a dead and decomposing ferret,0
"it was a very weird class environment. he wanted everyone to talk in class but only so he could prove them wrong and show everyone how smart he was. he also said racism was non-existent in america.... hes clearly right leaning and claims to keep his opinion out of the classroom, but then chooses a biased textbook, and teaches his ideas as truth",0
"Tina is one of those teachers who is just bubbling with joy over her subject material. She LOVES anthropology, and LOVES when students get excited by it. She doesn't project her own interests onto you. Rather, she pokes and prods to make you investigate things on your own. She is super nice and very encouraging - a master of CONSTRUCTIVE criticism.",1
Very nice and chill guy. He cares about his students. Gives a lot of extensions.,1
Great Prof. I took him for an interim course and learned a ton. He's also hilarious and has super great stories about his life... 10/10 would recommend.,1
"Doesnt explain at all, just reads off slides, lectures are heavy. Tough grader, be aware or drop the course my friend",0
"Boring class, lots of reading, more reading and even more reading. She gets annoying with her uber-feministic crap.",1
Very helpful and understanding.  She will take the time to explain concepts you do not understand and will not stop until you are 100% clear.  She never speaks down to you and is interested in your ideas.  Definitely take her class,1
"I really enjoyed my time in Dr. Legg's class! I had him this semester and he fell sick so he was out for a week which resulted in us being a bit rushed at the end but overall I really enjoyed the class! You have to do the readings, there's no way around it but if you do them there is no reason you shouldn't pass the class.",1
Class is impossible and professor does not teach. Only class I did not get an A in this semester.,0
"I LOVED her, but this class was so much work, especially for a gen-ed. Lots of reading and writing due every class, but it was graded easily. Her tests were also really easy and her lectures clarified the readings. She cared about all of her students and got really sad when we had to leave on the last day... I wish she were my grandmother.",1
He seems to enjoying giving his students anxiety for no specific reason aside from outdated teaching methods. Best of luck to all premeds in this course.,0
"Professor Rikkers is a great person but probably one of the worst professors I've had at GV. Her lectures are all over the place, she gets caught on one subject and will ramble about it the whole class period and because of this she's almost always behind and trying to catch up. Her tests are ridiculously hard as well and sometimes make no sense",0
Only concentrated on early Xn era.  Nothing past that.  Bible beaters only.  Opposing viewpoints will be downgraded.,0
Was terribly unhelpful. Never answers emails/questions. Assignments were on material we never learned. The rock kit required for the class was discontinued and she did not adapt any of our content to accommodate those who couldn't get the rock kit.,0
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. she has her own agenda and makes up words and concepts as she goes.,0
He is very caring. He gives lots of extra credit. I wen in for office hours for the first 4 -5 weeks and got the map project done. DON'T wait till the end to do it. It takes some time . Overall he is a very nice guy he wants you to do well on the Exams. I would take this class again if I could.,1
"Doesn't know a thing about what goes on in his classes.  Make nice with the TA, you'll need them.  Cake for music majors, harder than quantum physics for people with no background.  Avoid this class.",0
"To start, this teacher does NOT use the textbook, don't bother buying it. He does give very good and clear notes in class, but occasionally drifts to teaching side topics for fun. He is very helpful in his office hours. The negatives: His tests are VERY hard with no curve. And his homework problems are NOTHING like notes or book. VERY VERY hard.",1
"Book doesn't help much, the notes are good. Everything is based on them.",1
Professor Johnson is amazing. I took him for basically my first drawing ever so I went into his class with ZERO knowledge about drawing and ZERO confidence. He always gave positive feedback including constructive criticism. I loved his class. I would take him for every class if I could. I left his class very confident in my ability to draw!,1
He is more boring then salt water. If you come to class you will pass because everything that is assigned in class is on Moodle and he gives you all the answers during the class.  If you want a really easy mark then he is great. However his classes take forever and half the time he does't  even talk about the subject. I learned nothing in his class,0
Professor Wu is very knowledgeable and passionate about teaching his subjects. He makes sure that every students understand the concepts. He is always there to help when you ask for it. I learnt a lot from his class. If you make an effort to read his notes and do his assignments while listening to class  you will perform well.,1
"This guy is worthless.  He can't teach.  If you had EGR 103 with him, make sure you take someone good for Stats 314",0
"as you wish, his company went down...",0
"Great Professor. Very hilarious and has amazing lectures. Graded by very few things, 3 quizzes and 2 papers. Satisfied a GE requirement and was very enjoyable",1
Boring lectures that aren't helpful and vague expectations. She'll go 20 minutes over on a conference to share personal stories while you wait on her to look over your essay. One of my worst experiences with a professor.,0
"Dr. Hrabak is an excellent teacher. She puts her heart into it, and is very enthusiastic. She cares and she is 100% there for students who want to learn. You will work hard, but is soooo worth it!",1
"Very nice, willing to help as long as you do the work, just do the work and study and you will end up doing well. English isn't my first language and she was very understanding about that. Wish I could take her again! (:",1
"Sue is an extremely boring lecturer so if you have trouble focusing normally do not take her classes. She is not very understanding either, I had my dog destroy a take home quiz she gave and asked for another one and she got extremely offended that I needed another copy.",0
"She can be fun and frustrating. She LOVES the idea of the workbooks, but for the majority of students they are useless and busy work. But she has a heart of gold, is always willing to help, and will often let you turn in an assignment a little late if you have a valid excuse. I'd take her again, but she's not my favorite professor, either.",1
After two years at Telfer this guy has been my favourite prof by far.,1
"She is the only instructor that teaches ICS 129 and ICS 270. Also she gives us a lot of assignments, test, and projects w groups. I say it too much information and work to be teach, especially only meeting up once a week. She is a tough grader, so make sure you don't miss any assignments, quizes, test, or projects or else you won't pass!",0
"An excellent mentor, extremely knowledgable person;learnt a lot during his course..",1
"If you are a Food and Nutrition major, the semester you take NHM 362 is going to be your hardest semester of your college career. Not because the material is hard, the professors pile on the work. It's busy work and group projects. You will be taking around 5-6 classes. Dr. Park's tests are super hard and tricky. She is a tough grader.",0
"Lectures were good because he has so much industry experience. My gripe with the class is for the manufacturers of the book/test. The book was so useless for studying for the exams. The only good thing was that Professor Galup let us use a cheat sheet (front and back) for every exam. The Excel and Access assignments were easy, but very long.",1
"I sat this class almost 20 years ago circa 1998. To this day, my favorite class and professor. If there was ever a professor who was so opposite as I and yet taught me how to think for myself Professor Clarke did this for me. What a hero!",1
"The material is extremely uninteresting, as are the lectures. This is worsened by Lynchs lecture style, as he drones monotonously and explains to the point where the simplest story seems incomprehensible. Were it not for the fact that his class is mandatory I would never have stuck with it.",0
"Dr Hettich is a remarkable professor and one of the best @ MDC. It was a privilege to take his class. His course load his not demanding at all and most of your grades are based on essays he gives in class. Rent the textbook he asks you to get, don't buy. Begin your research paper early, 30% of your grade depends on it!",1
Terrible criteria for the assignments and has no care for the grading system when marking items. Extremely harsh when it comes to marking in general and the assignments do not need to be that long. His claim is 'write to fill the paper'?!,0
"I thought Professor  Wood was  a decent man. He curved the tests, which really helped out. He gives you ungraded homework and the solutions  to help study for the test. He really uses the book and PowerPoint to teach. Boring class, but with studying, an ""A"" is achievable.",1
"Dennis has a very hard accent to understand. I thought I would get used to it over time, but didn't. The only grades we received were exams and a group project. The exams were very hard because of the wording and lack of information we learned.",0
"I only showed up to this class 4 times the entire semester for each exam date. There are 4 exams. All you have to do is study the end of the chapter ""key terms""- and regurgitate it onto the exam. Classes like these piss me off cause it was completely pointless. Waste of money. I learned nothing, and got an A-. Already forgotten 100% of what i memor",0
"Okay, I am currently in his class and he has to be the worst Math teacher/professor I have ever had in my life. He expects you to know the topics when he barely teaches and gives you homework on stuff you have yet to do in class. AVOID HIM!!!!",0
"Unnecessarily harsh grader, she takes one of the few GPA boosting classes for COB and makes it extremely difficult to get an A. Lectures are air filled and don't prepare you for the tests. I completely believe I put in enough effort to earn an A and I got stuck with a B. Would avoid if a better option is available.",0
"Overall, a great professor!  Sometimes the notes that he provides on the board get a little unorganized and he goes through the material quickly so listen carefully!  Notes AND lab activities are both covered on the test so don't forget to study the lab activities as well.  I made copies of labs for study in case he collected them for grading.",1
"Terrible teacher, and even worse advisor. If your a polsci major and you have her as your advisor, do yourself a favor and never talk to her. In fact, don't speak with her until you are ready to graduate. She's unhelpful and rude, oh and she tries really hard to get you to take her advanced UN class. Avoid.",0
Professor Thompson will stand in the front of the class and brag that students averages 66 on his tests. Ive never seen anybody be so proud of their own failure before. his tests have nothing to do with what he is teaching. This is like an SNL skit of an actual microbiology class. Except no one is laughing. Very sad to witness and pay for.,0
"Mr. Parente is a caring and knowledgeable professor. Class is lecture-based with accompanying powerpoints which he puts online. Honestly, you would do fine just looking at the powerpoints because his lectures tend to be a little dry. Still, he's a good professor and you will get a good grade if you put in effort.",1
"TERRIBLE professor. Has ridiculously high expectations and the course load is unbearable. His lectures are confusing and unnecessarily complicated. Assignments are also difficult to understand. He will make your life absolutely miserable. He is a nice enough guy and will try to help you, but it probably wont help.",0
"Excellent professor! She understand our situations that English (poems, literature ...) is hard with us.  She asks you to do a lot but she never hurts you by low grades.  DON'T LOSE your chance to attend her class.  Most people are always happy with her class.",1
"If you're looking to develop your writing skills and make thoughtful comments on literature this is not the class for you. I made that mistake. whenever you write a paper just remember to read over your lecture notes, and pump something out a few hours before class. He likes generic and conventional, it's an easy A if you're comfortable d",1
"She goes over so much in a short period of time. It's hard to take everything in. She also jumps back and forth on what she is teaching. All in all, I don't like her.",0
"Insists on being a tough grader, yet objectives and correct answers are not clearly defined. He's the most inconsiderate human I have met. His comments and feedback are very petty. Don't take his class",0
"This Class is a weed-out. You must, without question, know the textbook better than the back of your hand. The mid-term will be fair, but the final will be extremely difficult. Lecture is basically a waste of time. Memorize everything. It is possible to get an A, but you have to work very hard. The number one rule is not to fall behind in reading!!",0
"A very nice woman with very rigid grading. However, she is a very good teacher and if you go to her office she'll help you as much as she can. Just watch out for the homework assignments. They take up a ton of time, and she only picks 2 problems to grade so you can get unlucky and have the one problem you got wrong picked.",1
"TAKE HER CLASS!! She loves every single student in her class! We have a Discussion board, essays and a lot of homework!! Plus the TA is super chill and cool",1
he teaches nothing that is on the quizzes/tests,0
"Gives u a chapter or 2 to complete each week, 1 quiz on each chapter (timed), smart book is done on each chapter, and then 1 or 2 homework assignments which is a video and you answer 2-3 questions, you have 2 attempts on all homework Mid Term & Final are timed One project at the end of the course Awesome class and taking that Prof. again this summe",1
"participation matters, and you MUST show up to EVERY class. if you dont you better have a GOOD reason. he cares about his students and will help you if you need it. brings out the best writer possible in you. only downfall is that he lectures a lot in a monotone voice. this can be tough if you havent had coffee.",1
"Pretty easy class if you've already taken a lot of science classes like I had. He does a great job of spelling out the entire semester from day one. No need to buy the textbook; everything you need to know for the quiz is on the study guide. Lecture tends to drag, but it's only once a week. I wish he taught more classes. I would take him again.",1
"*THIS TEACHER IS HORRIBLE*DO not waste your time with this teacher unless you want to lower your GPA.I have never seen a grade less than a B in any class I have ever taken, but Pamela Keyes put a stop to this. Tests are so long no one can even finish them.Class is outstandingly boring, labs are insane and she takes points off for anything.HORRIBLE!",0
"Wish I had the experience some of these other reviewers have had, he is awful! Didnt grade a single thing until the first week of April for a class that started in January! No feedback, takes forever to respond to emails. Just does not seem like he cares at all about graduate students",0
He cares a lot about his students and is very reasonable. He puts in a lot of effort to make sure students all have their questions answered. Moderate and fair homework amount every week. Offers extra credit opportunities. Class participation is mandatory to make sure everyone has an understanding of what's going on. Overall excellent professor.,1
"It seems as if it may be boring, but if you read the works and participate in class discussion, the class will and the assignments will all fall into place",1
"Super nice guy, but is lecture heavy on the PowerPoints every class so it's hard to pay attention and actually learn something because it gets boring. Tests are all online but are super hard, he drops the lowest grade though. He rarely gives hw too",0
Great professor but gives A LOT of work. You have reading assignments and informal writings due every class period. Participation is a good chunk of the grade and picks one or a few people always to call on. You learn a lot and gives you ample opportunities to extra credit. He is very knowledgeable about the subject he teaches.,1
The sweetest woman I've ever met. I was one of the only non-english majors in my class and I loved it. Learning about literature was very enjoyable.,1
"Professor Forni was one of my favorite professors of the semester! The workload was totally reasonable, with short readings for homework and usually 2/3 question quizzes the next class. 3 papers, 2 tests, project for the final. SO sweet and caring, and genuinely wants to see her students do well. Take her class!",1
Great prof!!!,1
"It's not a very interesting class and all she does is read off of the powerpoints. Exams are a lot harder than they should consider what you actually learn in the class. Case studies and brand analysis projects are easy, but pointless",0
"I had Sander for Bio 108 lab. Extremely tough grader and not clear on material. She is not very clear on feedback. While she is a very nice person (I liked her personally but not professionally) I would not have her as a lab instructor again. On a positive note, she was very willing to help during non-test labs.",0
"Amazing Professor in the Fourth Year Studio. Brilliant and very passionate about architecture. I have never been in a Studio at Ryerson where i learned so much. Everyone works hard to achieve his high standards. We are the Studio this Semester, for sure.",1
More work than all 3 of my other classes combined. Her class is literally a full-time job.,0
SUCH A HARD CLASS. he makes the tests really difficult AND grades really hard! history is very interesting but he made it more like memorizing then learning,0
"I liked this class. He is not an easy teacher, but he is a good teacher. The lectures are interesting and he interacts with the students during them. The tests are very challenging essay's. You must learn retain a lot of info to do well on the tests. If you want to be challenged, take Luther.",1
"Most stressful and hardest class ever. She did explain the lectures but she assigned a lot of hw, a quiz every week that you didn't have time to keep up with the lessons. didn't miss one class, did all hw&the projects and she gave me a D. would never take her again",0
"Does not use canvas, does not give you a schedule of tests or lecture material that will be covered. You HAVE to go to class and write down everything or you won't pass this class, ended up withdrawling from the class last semester. You have to be flexible and love philosophy to pass this class, do not recommend if this is a gened for you.",0
I found that Mary was very nice and approachable.  She understood ones problems and would accommodate them as best as she could.  Here exams were fair and the essay was fun and interesting.  She is the best prof I had during university.,1
"If you have Pops for CS1121 and 1122 (is that still the course number?) he's not the greatest. Almost everyone will tell you the same thing. He isn't 'interested' in teaching the 1000 level course and it's pretty obvious. When (if) you have him for Comp Org (CS3421) he's a much better instructor, even if the class is harder it's as easy to pass.",1
"If you're placed in Dr. Sienerth's COR110 class, get out. He refuses to give A's, grades extremely subjectively, is unable to facilitate quality classroom discussions, & is very unclear on instructions for assignments. He frequently inserted his bias & political views into grading and discussions. His teaching style just isn't suited for Global.",0
Horrible Teacher!  Run away fast.  She doesn't teach the material required for the class.  Then when you take the final be ready to fail.,0
"Owen, the mad genius. knows how to give constructive feedback. Cares about your future, won't steer you wrong, encouraging but doesn't offer fake flattery.  Amazing intellect, accepts all types of students into his class, for the most part, but you must work and make progress, if not he'll rake you. Best if you're self directed. Genuine guy.",1
"You probably won't understand anything during the lecturess, however while you're studying for the exam you'll have to look back at his notes and make some sense from them since the textbook is so awful. Brutally difficut material but fair exam.",0
If you have the chance to take him as a teacher I would avoid him. He makes makes things WAY harder than they should be. He gives plenty of worksheets and practice problems to prepare us for tests and then makes the tests unnecessarily hard. Elementary Math should not be a hard topic to teach but he makes it more complicated than it should be.,0
"He is very hard to understand. I took AP Calc 1 and 2 in high school and got 5s on both of the exams, but took Calc 2 again with him only to get a C-. Homework is very tricky and vague.  The way he presents the material just doesn't click with me, even though it's my forte.  I later took Calc 3 with a grad student teacher at U of D and got an A.",0
"Her class is easy as long as you complete assignments and listen to her lectures. She also posts the powerpoints online if you can't attend class. Very easy, great professor",1
Good Teacher.  Explains the concepts well and applies them to real world situations.  Exams are not bad for the Accounting program,1
Changed my life,1
"Don't waste your money or time, unless you can  teach yourself or have help at home. He doesn't answer your questions when being asked. The only thing I did like is that the test were the same as the  homework.",0
"I dont know why he has such a low rating, he isnt even that bad. I was worried about taking him cuz it seemed like he was hard but that is not the case. His lectures are clear and his quizzes and test are based off of homework. I passed with an A, and it wasnt difficult to do so.",1
"Because I take this course online it is difficult to ask for help from him. He does respond quickly however his supposedly more ""in depth"" explanations (and general notes) he gives you is never clear but goes on for paragraphs. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WILL GIVE YOU EASIER HOMEWORK THAN WHATS ON THE TEST. DO NOT TAKE",0
"Ms.Kelly's First Aid class wasn't a hard class, but you do need the book if you want an A.I took one of the people's advice from on here & didn't buy the book & found on my first test there was material not covered in lect/videos on the test.I flunked the first test, got the book, barely studied, & aced the remaining tests.Thanks for the B buddy!",0
"Some of the exam questions on her test were confusing and debatable.  The final essay prompt was very confusing along with a few other assignments, plus she sometimes did not post the lecture notes until the night before.  However if you study the powerpoints and read the book you should do fine.",1
"I had the lab with this guy and it was a dope class. I highly recommend him. No homework, in class work is somewhat challenging but he allows group work and is very helpful with explaining things. It was a 3 hour class and we were often out after an hour. Good class overall.",1
"If you signed up for Pynns RS class for a challenge, you got one. He makes the course material interesting but hard to learn and keep up with. The tests are 5 strict essay questions long and the lecture itself doesnt even come close to covering enough material for them. Unless you are a Religious Studies major, your money is best spent elsewhere.",0
Prof. Tortolani is the best professor to get for Italian. She tells you exactly what are going to be on the quizzes and gives you a good study guide for the midterm and final. She is very helpful if you go to her and wants her students to pass. If you can get a professor for Italian get Prof. Tortolani.,1
"Another overpaid worthless tenured professor at USC... After 4 years at USC, this is the only one of 2 professors I throughly despise.  His class consists of his boring monotone lecutres, two essay tests (that you only have 50 mins to complete) & one paper on a movie I had to order all the way from Canada. DO NOT take this class unless you have too",0
"Really nice prof who really wants her students to do well. She's is a fun teacher and tries to get everyone involved. It does kind of feel like a High School Spanish class and she does speak in English a lot. If you put in a little effort, you'll get an A. Not the greatest prof to learn a Spanish from, but her classes are painless and pretty fun.",1
"Took this course summer 17'. All we had to worry about was reading our required chapters for the pop quizzes she would hand in class. For tests, she would let us use notes. The final paper was 6 case briefings, which were really easy to do. Her lectures were interesting. She was an awesome professor. Do what you have to do and you will pass.",1
"With any science class, it is going to be demanding of the time for studying and dedication but with Mr. Qasmieh he tries to make it able his students to do it efficiently. He is a very understanding and wants to genuinely see his students succeed! He is very accessible outside of class and will reply almost immediately. Best teacher at ECC :)",1
"Amazing professor! He made critical theory fun! So easy to understand it after he explains it in class, and the papers/exams were so easy. He really cares about his students, and he admitted at the beginning of the semester that you shouldn't contact him through email. Very enjoyable class! Just write 2 discussion questions and show up.",1
"Boring professor that can even become vulgar at times. Add in that she's a tough grader, and she's one to avoid...",0
"This class is fine if you're okay with lots and lots of assignments. Chapter quizzes, online essays, discussion homework, plus lectures and tests. But if you're fine with doing all that work, you'll get decent grades on the test because they force you to work with the material. Kate seems passionate about her job but it's a big class",1
"This professor, mark my words, is absolutely horrible.  I signed up for Intro to Macroeconomics.  I am an Econ major.  BELIEVE ME. He doesn't even teach macro.  He just rambles on about random subjects that have NOTHING to do with macro.  His jokes, while at first quite hilarious, get seriously annoying as he doesn't even do his job. DON'T TAKE",0
"Great teacher, she always challenges you.",1
"Barbiero is a very good lecturer and friendly professor, but ECN 340 is a tricky class with a lot of reading. The midterm and final are based from the textbook and the questions could be strange ones. His lectures are highly engaging and are very interesting. He knows a lot about economics and is passionate about it, but just a lot of reading.",1
"So respectful, so friendly, and he is the best teacher I have ever seen in my life",1
"She is the worst professor I have ever had! She is rude and unclear. She does not care if you do not understand. If you ask questions be prepared to be called stupid multiple times in front of the whole class. Either take a different class or keep your head down and read the book, because she will not teach you.",0
Having Susan for both accy201 and 302. She is a good lecturer and good at explaining definitions and math problems (tho she sometimes was off the track) But the only issue is that she forced you to do a random presentation during the class and you have to participate in order to get points from that.,1
"I slept through it every morn and still got an A.  She wanted to be helpful, but the class required little in the way of thought, it was rote memorization.",1
"She's definitely very kind, but I found her lectures rather dry and boring. Attendance is mandatory, as it counts towards your final grade. Pretty fine for a mom, though.",1
Dont do it,0
Very good and talent pro,1
"Mr. Freeman was an amazing teacher! He does talk fast in lectures, but he records them so you can go back and check! He lets us use notes on every assessment and gives us a lot of extra credit!! Definitely cares about his students and wants us to make the best grades!",1
"Pompous and conceited, it wasn't the most pleasant experience listening to him lecture. I must admit that he knows his stuff; the problem is, he doesn't expect the students to know it either. Midterms, finals and essays were all graded harshly.",0
"Dr. Falk is the nicest professor that I have dealt with, but I had a hard time learning in this class. Every day I was so confused and did not know what I was writing down. The homework dealt with topics that are not even covered until a few class periods after they are due and the exam grades are always really bad in regards to the class.",0
"had him for inro to lit. studies, romantic, modern british, and victorian...he's a genius, hilarious, and extremely helpful.",1
simply amazing...his class lectures blew me away...class was very interesting,1
"Dr. Feige was so much fun. Just be prepared to work hard, his class is not easy. He was amazing as we had to switch over to online because of COVID. He's super patient and he's so much fun to be around.",1
"HISTORY OF MATH. maybe it was my fault for thinking it would be an easy elective, but he def didn't make it easy for the non-math majors even though in the beginning he said you don't need to be one to do well! assignments were tough but exams were pretty fair. just study lots, and make sure he likes you! very tough marker :( why kaminski why",0
"He is passionate about what he teaches and his PowerPoints are extremely detailed and descriptive. At the start of the semester he wasn't great at getting across the information, but by the end we did a lot of in-class practice problems which helped tremendously. The key to his class is asking for help when you need it and not procrastinating.",1
"Professor Smith is by far the worst band director I've ever had the displeasure of working under. The Spanish Fantasy show bored the crowd AND the students. The fact that we were forced to learn an entire show in 1 week was ridiculous. He doesn't stick to his own rules, and I am actually embarrassed to admit to being in the marching band. FIRE HIM!",0
"Not my type of professor. Screams a lot. Very passionate but very serious in the way he presents. Says ""a B in his department is worth an A in any other"" so expect a tough marker. Goes off in tangents about history that are sometimes hard to follow. That being said; he's a good person with a large base of knowledge and others seem to like him.",0
Do not take professor Ricar. This is not about art at all it is a history class. She gives tons of assignments per week that are graded purely on word count. She cares more that you address her by name and respond to her thoughts than she does about you understanding or doing well in the course. not worth it. do not take.,0
Nice teacher but ran a terrible class. Frequent reading and absurd weekly quizzes.,1
"One of the worst classes I have ever taken, lectures do not pertain to anything useful. Class is unstructured and disorganized. None of the assignments have anything to do with what is discussed in lectures. Do not take this class if you are looking for an interesting/easy class. There are no tests, just two papers that you are not well explained.",0
I found her very hard to understand. After class I would have to reteach myself the material because I could not understand what she had taught in class. Many of my classmates and I had to get together just to try to comprehend what we were covering.,0
There is quite a bit of homework to complete out of the books. Keep up on it and you will get a good grade. She is fair and nice. I did recommend her for a class.,1
"Im leaving this review after completing 6 years of college as a marketing major at NWACC and the Poo of A and believe me he was the ABSOLUTE BEST teacher. He will teach you things that matter! I wish I had taken better notes, so I may take his class AGAIN and ask for it as a Christmas present. Take every class you can with him!! He fills up FAST.",1
Don't listen to the rest of these reviews because they are faker than a flying talking unicorned donkey wrestling a rich tax paying man who also does the dishes and his own laundry. Dr. Evan's is a sweet sweet prof. who bless his heart tries his best but.... you know he is special in a not good kinda way.,0
"Amazing and very talented lecturer. She is super clear and makes the material even more interesting than the class already is! I cant say anything bad about this teacher and she is very knowledgable about her field. Lectures can seem long, however she records EVERY lecture and makes them available ASAP. Take this class if you enjoy Bio and psy.",1
"I usually like going to class and don't mind paying attention but i have never hated a class as much as this one. like ever. I have absolutely no idea how i finessed a B in this class but I did. I never paid a lick of attention just read the book and took notes from it, got mediocre grades on exams and some how passed. would not recommend.",0
"Monika's a nice and caring prof. Every day in class is a bit meh, tho. We'd come in then she'd tell us to take out our travaux pratique then she'd literally call on us one by one to answer each response and it was a bit of a pain and boring. But she is nice and gives decent explanations. She is super willing to explain things outside of class!",1
"I hate ECN, but Smith does his best to make it interesting. I can't rate this Prof high enough b/c he's just that amazing. Thorough, quick to respond, will offer suggestions & help in any way he can. You have to ask for it though. Don't miss the opp to take him. YOU: must show up and on time, do the work.",1
"(COVID) taken pass/fail; felt like a dumbed down AP French class, i got a 5 and still had to take it for some reason. Personally not a great exp. w her, she was pretty rude and inconsiderate about absences when I was sick with COVID and other. Too many pointless grammar tests which made me feel dumb and WAYYY too much homework for an online class",0
"I've taken all of Dr. Stanton's classes except Milton and she has been such a great mentor.  The majority of the material for this class was quite interesting. All of her classes have a take-home midterm (essay), a short paper, and a final. Please take her, I guarantee that you won't regret it :)",1
"This was, hands down, my favorite class to attend. Catherine is super passionate and knowledgable about the class topic and so much more. There is a lot of reading but it is absolutely worth finding the time to do the readings. She's supah caring and made transitioning to online learning a breeze. Also, she has two really cute cats.",1
"Professor Keyes is an awful Professor. She is mean and cruel to her students if they get anything wrong, which makes students never want to speak in class. She doesn't even help them try to understand it better. She expects them to know everything. I've always loved Italian and she makes me dread going to class and hate the subject. Worst professor",0
"Didnt really learn anything at all, just book reading",0
Luc Bauwens is by far the worst professor I've ever had at UofC. His lectures are next to incoherent ramblings that attempt to describe illegible calculus formulas which are drawn out without explanation. His written slides are filled with logical gaps and inconsistencies. On top of that he plagiarizes midterm questions from textbooks too.,0
"the worst teacher, although a nice person. Cannot convey a thought, relies on a manual full of mistakes, makes errors on the board.... Very poor teacher. Makes it up a bit in personal consultations.... One of the worst professors I have had at McGill.",0
"Pretty good solid prof but can ramble a bit. Good choice if you like his teaching style, or if you can learn based on just his old tests and exams (they are all online and the questions are almost exactly the same), but if you need a really clear explanation he is maybe not the prof for you.",1
"I would completely disagree with everything that has been said. Cormack is a selfish prick with no academic merit and seeks to only confuse and berate his students whenever he can. Never take a class with this man, he is boring, monotone and incapable of teaching.He should just sit in his office and write books and papers.stay out of the classroom!",0
"His lecture is extremely boring, I wouldn't recommend taking his class with all the other GOOD professors that teach UGC111. You have to buy his textbook in order to take the online quizzes along with multiple discussion questions throughout the year. Do not take this class!",0
"This Professor is hands down the worst teacher I have ever taken. She is beyond rude and will call you out in front of everyone. My parent passed away and I messaged her to let her know that I would not be attending for a week or two and if I can have the homework emailed to me. All of my other teachers were more than understanding, she ignored me.",0
"Great Prof. The reason why cats fail him is because they think that his tests are like his class. You do NO WORK in his class, he tells stories and jokes all day, but then when the tests comes it is YOUR JOB to read the required cases, or you will fail. The man don't believe in extra credit and your grade is made up of 3 tests. THAT'S IT!",1
"Dr. Gehring is very nice but she rambles in lecture so you often zone out. Show up to class to receive power points. Quizzes and tests are very wordy and they are mostly multiple choice usually with 2 short answer questions. They can be difficult because she has an answer choices of ""A and B"". She is willing to help you if you ask.",1
"I have never been more miserable in lecture in my life. As a consequence, I almost completely stopped attending class. Still got an A-.",0
"She will even allow you to text her if you need help, but you probably won't need help.  She is very inspirational and helpful.",1
"The best professor you will have at Lehigh. Take Math 022 and 322 with him, you will not be disappointed. Remember, Sturm-Liouville always has your back.",1
"If you've never had computer programming experience (like myself), you will probably struggle. Most of what I learned was from book, but he's helpful at office hours. Day to day class is boring, quizzes are easy, programming assignments and tests are difficult. Make friends with other people in the class (can have a different prof), it helps A LOT.",0
I absolutely liked this teacher a lot. He did an incredible job with teaching the class. Although his exams were a bit tricky at times. MAKE SURE YOU STUDY THE NOTES HE HAS YOU HIGHLIGHT!!!! It's important because he practically gives you the exam. Its your job to really study what you highlight. A must take if you want to pass Management 300!!!!!!,1
"Great teachers.  Sometimes he doesn't express things very clearly, but his patience makes up for any ambiguity.",1
The class is a lot of work. His instructions are vague and it is unclear what he wants out of the paper. He states that if your paper is not long enough he won't even read it. His feedback is often condescending. Attendance is important and he does not allow students to go to the bathroom. Be prepared to read a play then discuss & quizzes weekly .,0
"By far the worst class I have ever taken. Completely ruined my GPA and I did not learn a single thing. Teacher is boring, unhelpful and I think she likes that 40% of her class fails every single exam. The study guide is completely pointless to complete because half of it is not even covered on the exam. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!",0
"Don't take this class...ridiculous amount of material that all seems irrelevant. I'm not afraid of hard work...but 50+ pages per class period is a graduate course. He's rather rude, kinda degrading, his TA for the section is just as terrible and obnoxious so that didn't help. Listen to the ratings for this professor regardless of interest level.",0
"She does not know anything but expects everything. She always remains busy working on some hopeless projects. I wish if I could rate her in negative. She does partiality and teach almost nothing. However, she gives all students grade A. Because she does not know where she can cut the grades. I recommend students take her class only for grades",0
"Great Professor, interesting and fair.",1
This teacher is not good i dont know how his reviews are high. Its a 101 class but he expects you to write like a person who majored in writing essays. He trys so hard to find things to mark you do with. ,0
Professor Papaccio is so amazing. She is super nice and helpful. And she is so adorable and funny. Deff take her ! ,1
"  dr. jim is a fantastic instructor with a wonderfully deep understanding of the arts. he respects not only students' ideas, but their creativity and emotion responses as well--overall very understanding and kind.",1
"Even though he sounds like the teach from Ferris Beuller's day off, he is very enthusiastic about the course. Definitely lecture heavy, and you have to take notes in class because he will not post them on his Moodle page ( however he will slow down or go back to a specific slide if asked.",1
If you LOVE knowing the chapter down to the punctuation take Edwards. She often pulls questions for her tests that are from a chapter that isn't supposed to be on the test. Oh yeah and she doesn't teach. Expects you to learn outside of class and ask questions in class.. Why? I'm not paying you for that Im paying for you to teach. So teach Edwards!!,0
"Wonderful Prof. You can tell he loves his work. Warm/friendly, entertaining. Exams are 95% lecture-based, so you MUST go. Marks are 100% from the exam, and it's not essay format(I hate essays). It's Short / Long Answer questions he gives you beforehand. Grammar doesn't count, so it's just blabbing everything in your brain onto the paper. I love it.",1
"the professor doesn't put much effort into her pedagogy and did not organize her class very well. the whole syllabus didn't make sense. she's not incredibly helpful and doesn't provide students with much evaluation. did not engage students but talked at us in long monologues and then expected a good discussion. overall, not a good teacher.",0
"I took her class online and she never really taught. She gave quizzes every day, which were easy, and on the topic from the chapter, her test, on the other hand, were not always over the chapter or notes. Her test are also with webcam and if you make any little movement or noise she would take points off. She is not understanding and does not help",0
"He gives good lectures, if you pay attention and take notes during lecture you will do well since most of his test questions come from what he says in class. He makes it easy to either get time or talk with him or his teachers assistant if you ever need any help. Overall, a good professor.",1
"Professor Keaney expects a lot out of her class, but is willing to work with students and help them succeed. If you show her that you are willing to put forth the effort, she will help you and make exceptions for you. Hard work is key, and will be paid off in what you learn from her class.",1
Contradicts himself throughout the semester and makes it impossible to write the 3 five page essays that count entirely as your grade aside from participation. Better options for the 100 level philosophy requirement as far as professors go.,0
super dope but he hates when you talk while he is trying to teach. and he is kinda funny.,1
"Great instructor. No textbook so you should show up to class. There is a book report, midterm, internet project and ""take home"" final. He marks really easy as he understands his class is not a requirement for anything and doesn't bog you down so that your other classes might suffer. Long classes but easy GPA boost.",1
Extremely interested in reading what he's written when his book is finished!,1
"Jung was a homie during the time I took him. He was very supportive and he allowed us to do extra credit. He provides a study guide, and he always tries to be fair. Love this guy. I would take him again.",1
So far one of the best Professors I met,1
"All of the teachers this semester were pretty much garbage and being online because of COVID didn't help. Chen will paint the whole powerpoint blue with his highlighter, he doest allow you to go back to previous questions on tests, the TAs explain things better than he does, tests are ""open note"" but good luck finding anything, lectures are a mess",0
"A seemingly fair and impartial  instructor, who takes great pride and interest in teaching students. I found his lectures and course material, appropriate for a freshman college level English comp course as well as enjoyable.",1
"very boring, hard",1
fernandez-payano made what should've been a good course full of relevant information to make us well rounded and cultured individuals into a nightmare.,0
hes to harsh for beginner photographers,0
Great teacher! I hate math but did really well in his class. Wants you to understand and succeed. Good guy!,1
"I wish he taught more classes!!! Great instructor! Really seems to enjoy teaching. Weird sense of humor, but over all a great guy.",1
"One of the worst professors i've ever had, point blank period. Don't waste your time with him, if he's your only option just wait till the next semester.",0
"My negative experience with Filippo was not within his class as a professor but rather as my program adviser; though in retrospect, he was not a very good prof in the class where he was my professor anyway. Filippo is arrogant, unhelpful, and unwilling to make any compromises even though his colleagues involved with my situation were.",0
Doesn't really teach you anything then has a test over material we haven't learned.,0
His lab is simple and easy. Just study for your test and come to class every day and you'll pass.,1
"Professor Paulet has so much history in her brain, it's astounding. She makes the material interesting during lecture, even if you're not into the subject. She's funny and engaging. Do the work, show up to class, stay off your iphones (this is college for crying out loud). I thoroughly enjoyed this class.",1
"I had a teacher say once that in math and chemistry if teachers use scantrons they are just lazy and that is so true. This gy uses all scantrons so it doesn't matter if you really know this stuff but make a minor calculation error you still get no credit for what you do know. Take from Hodge, his tests let you show what you've learned.",0
"I have had Michael a couple times in the past. Simply put, he is not a good teacher. Compared to the other CS instructors and profs in the department, I and many other students would rate him VERY low in comparison. Literally any other prof and I would have gotten a good grade here. (Helen Cameron for example). He needs to get over his huge ass ego",0
"Was boring! Taken the fact I work a graveyard shift, Ive taken morning classes after work and I was able to make it through the 3 hours! But his sense of humor was off beat and just made snooze the whole class. Very caring and passionate about his students. Open book test.",1
He's amazing!,1
"Miracle is the worst professor I have ever had. I can't believe he is still even allowed to teach at a major university like the U. Honestly I took AP Calc AB and he made me MORE confused on material I already knew. Easy material, though. Tests are straightforward and easy as expected. You learn EVERYTHING in discussion, so go to those.",0
"She does not explain how she wants our 2 projects to be well then expects everyone to do it perfectly. She isn't understanding and pretends that the class is so simple even though she doesn't know how to teach. Throughout the class she couldn't figure out how to present her power points, print things out, and didn't know when the final was.",0
"Prof Corker is a nice person, and an easy going prof but she is very unclear on what she expects in papers and she is a very harsh grader. She grades hard, and her tests are hard (there are only 2, but no matter what you study it's difficult). She is an extremely slow grader, and I didn't see what I got on several papers (past semester grader)",1
"Don't even think about taking him for Differential Equations. The first day when he said this is the first time teaching this class in 20 years I should have dropped it. Not prepaired, completely oblivious his surroundings, doesn't know what he is doing half the time, and just a bad teacher in general. Don't make the same mistake I did...",0
"Very organized prof, clear, made very new material rather easy to understand. Had no interest in CO beforehand, now find it intriguing. Pay attention in class and read up/ask for help if you're unsure to get most out of this class.",1
"This is by far my favorite Professor. She is kind, and understanding. She gave us a break on the book because the price was too high. She gets to know her students, and makes the class very easy if you apply yourself. Her tests are straight from her power point, and if you don't pass, you are doing something wrong. I loved her classes! ",1
"I loved taking sociology with Mrs. Trent. She is funny, kind and a good professor. If you put in the work the class should be an easy A. Exams are the hardest part but there are plenty of other things that you can use to bring your grade up!",1
"Freshman year of college. Absolute worst experience ever. He seems to barely know how to even use a computer, and his teaching is inexcusable. Absolutely DO NOT take this class with him unless this isn't for your major or you have previous coding experience. The only pro I can think of is that he's nice.",0
LOVE her. She is tough but it is because she wants you to learn. Follow her directions explicitly and do not deviate. She is willing to help if you reach out and you show you are truly trying to learn. She has a heart of gold and will spend ample time talking with you and helping you connect the dots. Not everyone gets to see this side of her,1
"He definitely knows his stuff and loves when the students participate. The more people participate the more interesting the class is. He gave four tests and the final was not a cumulative final. He also gave five mini projects that are very easy. Although, he does take a long time to respond to emails. I would take again",1
"I was so excited to take this course, but in the first discussion, I could tell it would be challenging because of the professor. Very tough grader, assigns multiple group projects, and her exams and quizzes feel like they are meant to confuse you. She provides little information on what both the midterm or final will focus on. Don't expect an A.",0
"The lecture portion of this class is not too bad, the midterm and final are fair. The problem with this course is the long and boring lab component. The labs bring down the class average substantially. If you can avoid this class it is recommended that you do so.",0
This professor was a tough grader and very specific in grading . She took a long time to grade assignments which made it very frustrating. When asked for help she forwarded general information to blackboard as oppose to specifically answering my question based on my work. I wish I did not buy the book as well as more of her study guides were used.,0
I have never spent so much time for one class in my life. She treats her class like it's the only course you are taking. The amount of work you have to complete for the grade you receive is not worth it. Avoid taking her at all costs. She is very passive aggressive and not helpful at all when you ask for help. Take chem at OCC!,0
Professor Lima is the best professor I have ever had by far. I had him for the Fall 2019 semester and looked forward to every lecture. Some of the material is challenging but he gives clear expectations. There is a quiz each week over that weeks material and non-cumulative exams that make up the grade. I would definitely recommend.,1
"He certainly knows the material, but he tends to over explain concepts which I struggled with. I wouldnt recommend. Tests are nothing like homework and each multiple choice test question is worth 3 points.",0
"HORRIBLE! Class was fully online, no pre-recorded lectures even though there has been ample time to complete. You have to basically teach yourself everything, which only material given is to purchase a textbook. Test are hard with no study guide. Discussion post every week but will minimally impact grade if you are doing poor on the test.",0
Very rude to students. Too many errors on exams. Avoid him if u can,0
"Rude professor. I came into office hours and opened the door and before i even came in he said ""HAVENT U HEARD OF KNOWING THE DOOR??"" I'm replied with: i didn't grow up in that type of household.... I then proceeded to ask him questions but he continually sighed/seemed annoyed like he didn't want to help me... WHY are you professor then?????????",0
He is great. I think that you have to be the right person to deal with him. He can be very tough but just let what he says go and say something to him if you have a problem. Don't give him tons of excuses about things.,1
"Although I've had my moments where I wished I took an ""easy"" global course, I really feel as though I got something more out of Kier's class. She is dedicated, funny, and open minded. All points of view are respected in her class, you will always be heard and enagegd with. Take the opportunity to learn something, it's not easy but worthwhile.",1
Prof. Punja is one of the best profs I have had so far. His exams are all based on what he teaches. The lectures are all easy to understand and require no book reading. I would definitely take his class again!!,1
Dr. Pozzi is a very tough grader and is not very helpful. The class is extremely long and boring. Attendance and extensive participation are required to pass the class. Dr. Pozzi knows her material very well and expects her students to have an understanding similar to hers.,0
"College Algebra was easy in itself because most of the work was done online. The tests were multiple choice, so most of the time you dint even have to work the problems fully to figure out the answer. Ms. Hollingsworth is very kind and is elated when you come to her office for anything. In class, so if you need it slowed down, go to her office.",1
"As long as you go to class and closely follow all direction she gives, this class will be a no brainer.  SHe is not a hard grader for speeches.",1
"He covers material incredibly fast and will very rarely, if at all, go back over anything.  He makes many mistakes on the board and is hard of hearing so he rarely hears someone speak up when they try to correct him.",0
"One of the best teachers I had in college. Taught me (mostly by example) everything I needed to know in order to succeed in technical theater which helped me in movies and television, too.",1
"He's a funny guy and I don't have anything against him as a person, but as a professor he leaves something to be desired. He can and will ramble the whole class, and he's a very confusing grader; he rarely gives a reason for the grades he gives and although attendance is mandatory, he picks and chooses what days he actually takes it. He's just eh.",0
"Ogilvie's a smart guy, but he teaches this introductory course like it's a 300 level.  No actual textbooks, and his lectures are just pictures on the board which he rambles about for an hour.  Be prepared to work a ton and not learn anything in the process.",0
"Horrible man, doesn't care about students and he's not helpful at ALL!!",0
"Very nice person BUT he doesn't know how to teach. He expects everyone to everything, and when you ask him a question he makes you feel stupid. He is so hard to understand, and his handwriting looks like chicken scratch.Doesn't use useful technology, not clear, can't convey what he's really trying to say...stay away from him! there are better profs",0
"use words like ""simply"", ""easily"",""basically"" ALOT when he talks. teaching ability is meh. lectures are pretty boring.",0
"Toni knows his stuff, and has no trouble conveying it in an interesting and concise manner. He adds his personal stories and experiences to make the subject matter more relatable. He is hilarious, and throws a lot of little jokes in with the lecture. This was my 2nd class with Toni, and hopefully won't be my last.",1
"Great class, great professor.  Good sense of humor. Only tough to sit through 2hr 45min class. People don't do well because they leave in the middle of his lecture. He tells you exactly how to do every assignment and gives generous extra credit. Lecture notes on BB help a lot for test, don't need book. Best IDS 180 teacher at State. Take him!",1
No Chill,0
"I don't understand how anyone can like this guy. I didn't learn a thing, the class hurt my GPA, and two of my friends who worked their asses off ended up with different grades. There's no telling what grade you'll get in this class. Anyways, this guy's heyday is long gone, it's time for him to retire. I didn't learn anything, waste of time & money",0
"Professor Thuan is such a sweet man! Even though this class is just an intro level course that most of us took to fulfill requirements, he tried really hard to make the lectures interesting and to inspire awe about the universe we live in. People who complain about his accent are just lazy and racist -- his lectures are extremely easy to follow.",1
"She is a super neat lady, and as long as you are willing to put the effort and time into your work you will definitely do well.",1
Loved this class!Dr. Bushway posted lectures/slide shows and then there was a 10 question or less homework assignments (just a word document with questions on it) that got turned in each week. He made you researching the topics yourself to get answers. Tests were just more in depth questions.  Love his teaching style. Great professor!,1
"My class didn't like her. Half the time I thought they gave her a bad rap and half the time I wanted to join the mob. I got great grades when I thought I did bad and bad grades when I thought I did well. Takes a while to get these grades. I've had a lot worse though; I think people need to get a grip (some criticism here is deserved, however)",1
Ms. McClung is a unique teacher. She does not force you to do your research! However she guides you to course material to gain important aspect of her author you choose to research and write about. She know the main focus before hand and will listen to all students perspectives with respect to discussion times. Don't be shy to share your opinion.,1
DO NOT take Dr. Lucas's CSC 406 (Data Structures and Algorithms) section. You will spend 80% of the course talking about the theory and discrete math and the other 20% redoing the SAME lab 5 different ways. If you want to learn something DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS,0
"Very easy going and knowledgeable about the topic. Doesn't ask too much out of students, but class discussions are still interesting. Grades tough on the take home exams, but just read the book and don't skip and you'll be fine.",1
"Avoid this professor. Bad in every way. Rude, arrogant, hard to reach, and disorganized.",0
"Dr. Waite is awesome. Took him awhile ago and I still was visiting him weekly my senior year. Tests can be tough but he cuts a lot of breaks and will always help someone who asks for help. Unless you are just plain bad at math/physics, there's no reason why you should do bad in one of his classes.",1
"Midterm: 30%, final: 40%. Most people skip lecture as it's hard to follow - read textbook instead. Quite tough on partial credit on exams. That said, he tests on less than the material covered and is clearly a very fair grader who cares about students succeeding (also has no curve, but drops lowest quiz and HW). TA is incredibly helpful.",1
"This class is incredibly difficult, and this is coming from someone who managed to do well in all other pre-med requirements. Be prepared to WORK. This professor doesn't make the class any easier or enjoyable.",0
"all the very good review are for PRECAL. For calculus, his class is a lot harder. The homework is very basic and simple, but the tests are a lot harder and the problems more complex. Try to get copies of old tests from people and practice/study",1
"This woman is remarkably unfair. Everyone(-few) fails participation, she doesn't know the answers to her own multiple choice, if you ask her a question like ""Why did I get this mark on this question when I have this answer"" and she's all like, ""oh, I see what you are saying, leave your paper with me and I'll fix it."" yeah...she never does. Useless.",0
"Imagine getting all perfect scoreS on everything but the final and one quiz and still get a bad grade, this is how this guy treat his student. He intentionally give you very bad grade if you are way too ahead of the average score to drag you down. I dont know why someone will be such mentally ill to do this. Shouldnt even be a professor at first.",0
"Really good prof and a nice person. Cares about her students. Fast paced and interesting class, lots of group work with oral presentations.  Also lots of written assignments, picky grader but fair. Would recommend any class she teaches.",1
"I did not enjoy this class at all. Miss K is a very picky grader, and she is very disrespectful to her students. When you ask her for help, she just makes you feel dumb. She makes the  class extremely stressful when it doesn't have to be.",0
She's a really nice person and she really appreciates it if you participate. Be sure to take notes though because she doesn't use any technology. And make note of the quotes that she talks about in class because they'll likely be on the exams.,1
"Schaffer is the best Biology professor to take. No matter how boring the subject is, she can make it interesting! She is very funny, also. She only has exams and a final so you will need to study. She also is very eager and understanding when you go into herboffice for help. Great professor!",1
"Horrible professor. He lulls you in at the beginning of the semester by coming off as cool and funny and saying things such as ""physics can be fun!"" but he makes his tests stupid hard, and goes super in depth for every subject covered (and thats a lot of subjects). He moves fast as hell, and all the tests had failing averages. Avoid at all costs.",0
"Dr. Weiner makes Reading 501 way more difficult than it needs to be. He does not teach, like at all. He assigns groups and has the groups teach for a class period which takes up the whole semester. I ended with a B and there is no evidence of how I got it",0
"This class is going to stop me from graduating this semester.  I have letters of recommendation from previous professors, and I  have a very high GPA. I took excessive notes for the quizzes and still have only gotten one perfect score.  He has given me a C for every paper. I went to a funeral and he still wouldn't let me make up a quiz.",0
"The class moves quickly and covers a lot of material. Her tests are very challenging but not completely unreasonable. She is extremely intelligent and has a passion for linguistics, and this really shows in her lectures (which are quite interesting).",1
"He has a speech impediment so it's hard to understand what he's saying. He expects you to not only know the material but also apply it, so get ready for random clicker questions in the middle of lecture about real life applications. I didn't take AP Bio, so this class is a real challenge. He speeds through lectures; I share a google doc w/friends.",0
"Koperski is one of the few teachers I've ever met that presents both sides of arguments to tough questions in philosophy. He is not biased like almost all other teachers I've had. Also, he is hilarious and his lectures never go the full time.",1
He is great and makes class very fun!!,1
"Started a lecture on how he does not care if you pass his class. Says he has a class Avg. of a D. Homework is ridiculous and takes 1.5-2 hours to complete just a piece of it, as it is an interactive quiz like set up. Condescending and rude when I asked for help or clarification.",0
"He's a very entertaining and smart guy, and if you listen to him you will learn a lot. Quizzes and tests are unbelievably easy. Pay attention in class and take decent notes and you'll ace them w/ no problem. He digresses and tells stories a lot but it won't hurt you or your grade. Just be respectful, listen, and participate.",1
"way too much work for such a low level requirement. Exam questions are a bit ambiguous. Easy to get a B, nearly impossible to get an A. Boring lectures. She's nice enough, but I wouldn't take that class again.",0
"One of the best profs at ryerson. Tests are easy to do well in if you come to every lecture, take good notes and read the textbook. Had him for Location, Location, Location. Loved this class, very interesting.",1
"Dr. Coil is a great Teacher! While, as mentioned, he is a bit too sympathetic to underperformers,  he goes out of his way to help students solve the bugs in their code. I have already registered for two additional programming classes with him. That's how confident I am in his abilities as an instructor,",1
"You will learn nothing in this class except how to apply the word ""Orwellian"" to everything from America to Zoo keepers. His hatred for the right could only be expressed more by the throwing of molotov cocktails in class. Lunatic",0
"Falola is a nice guy and his lectures are funny, but how you do in the class depends on your TA. I took him my freshman year and had a nice TA and got an easy A with no effort. This year I took him again and got a jerk TA who is giving me a low B. Lectures are off topic and you don't really need to pay attention to pass just read the textbook.",0
"Amy is the only reason that I ever stood a chance of passing. She could teach a rock how to do calculus. She is caring and wants to see everyone succeed, she makes a point to know the names of everyone in her 300+ person class. She makes calculus less scary. Her lectures are clear and easy to understand and she is VERY helpful in her office hours.",1
"In all honesty he is a nice guy but a horrible teacher, more than half the class failed.  He is completly disorganized and is only willing to help when it is an extremly convinent time for him.",0
"i heard gibson is better than the other professor. a couple papers which she is really just looking for your opinion, 4 exams which arent as bad if you ATTEND THE REVIEW SESSIONS!!!! They will tell you a lot of the material on it. The hardest part for me were the quizzes, you wanna take a couple days to really read and highlight the book.",1
Prof Budd is one of the most sarcastic and engaging teachers at DVC. He would always come into class a couple of minutes late and start the class with something funny to say. Most of the class time we would just spend time discussing the complex stories we had to read the previous night. Just pay attention in class and you will pass with an A!,1
"Course is difficult in general, but exams are even worse. You have to know what you are doing backwards and forwards in order to think about finishing on time. Most people don't, and the average tends to be 50-60",0
"Very helpful TA, would help you in the quizzes, generally an OK helper for this course.",1
She makes learning a foreign language fun & interesting. I learned so much from her class through her teaching & study abroad experiences. I took an extra semester of Spanish just because she was the professor. She is AWESOME!!!!!!!,1
"He seems to have ego issues, but is good at explaining proper writing techniques and helping you improve your writing.",1
"Oh man, where do I start? Thibaud Tallemfumier is without a doubt the worst teacher/professor I have ever had in a math-related subject. His lectures are bland, useless, and often extremely confusing. Homework assignments are unnecessarily long and do not accurately represent content tested on exams. Seriously, don't take him.",0
"Great Prof.  Lots of industry experience, more than willing to share his experiences with you.  Drives students to work hard, but has a fun side also.",1
"Professor Saxonhouse is great. She is understanding and supportive of all students Her courses are not easy, but if you put in the effort, then you will get the grade you truly want. Regardless of which course, make sure that you attend lecture. She makes everything crystal clear and straightforward. Students who don't do well likely skip lecture.",1
"An INSANE amount of reading, especially if you're taking English as well. His lectures are so fast and often over complicated, but I think he's honestly just too smart for a lot of kids. He uses complex language and talks about things as if we've studied the french revolution our whole lives. Tutorials  mandatory and so much preparation",0
Stoba is a very understanding professior. She gives 4 test and 2 outlines per each test. You will need to do a zoo report. She doesn't give out homework. She wants perfect format on the outlines. She does a reivew day before the test. Shes doesn't like when ppl come in late so thats the only time when shes rude. Over all you need to study and get A,1
"The WORST professor I've ever taken classes with in my life. Not only does she NOT teach the material at all, she forces you to learn the class yourself through textbooks&makes significant typos on the exams. Worse with online classes, goes to breakout rooms every 2 seconds. Won't teach you the material.I would recommend you avoid her at all costs.",0
"This class was the biggest waste of my time. She read through the online mindtap textbook every class. Graded assignments are posted a few hours after the class and are due the next day at midnight. She did not know how to answer questions, she would just restate what you asked. If you can, I would suggest choosing a different professor.",0
"If you want to actually learn to be a good writer don't take this class. If you want to write ACT style, then go ahead. Easy class, but elementary teaching, she has went against everything a good teacher would say, ""Use the same words (lots of useless repetition)"" &""I don't read the entire paper"". That's not what English is supposed to be about...",0
Professor Alexander was an extremely motivating teacher. One of the best that I had at Georgetown. He has a knack for making complex concepts fun and digestible. His passion for learning and teaching is contagious and inspiring. Take him if you have the chance.,1
"He is really nice but there are just so many readings with quizzes (one every week) and the lectures are so long. Don't even get me started on the assignments, they are just too complicated, more complicated than they should be. The first one is ok, the ones after that get harder. The group project is really confusing, so look out for that.",0
Take this course at a CC. You have quizzes twice a week and homework packets due twice a week. Unless you are trying to be a behavioral analyst then this course is not for you. You teach yourself the information from doing the packets. The TAs only review what you read before taking the quiz so you already have to know the information,0
"Actually took her for PSY125-Child Psychopathology She had health issues and allowed us to take the first exam at home and then we convinced her to let us do at home exams for the last two. If we had had the tests in class, I would have done horrid. There wouldn't have been enough time. Ask for take home, can't hurt. Other assignemtns aren't hard",1
"John Watson is the cornerstone of the AU journalism program. He's also an attorney so Legal Aspects of Communication, the course he teaches, is a STRONG AU offering. John Watson is one of the finest people I have ever met. He is a great educator.",1
"I would take anything taught by this guy. He's one of those professors who gets you interested in whatever you're reading, and somehow is able to keep class from ever getting boring. It's a lot of reading, but it's manageable, and he really wants you to do well. If you read and go to class you'll pass the exams. ",1
"Obviously a very intelligent woman who knows what she's talking about - the class is interesting but pointless. It is basically one big conversation with bad pop culture ref's. The slides are useless, don't miss a class and copy down quotes - the tests are based on them.",0
Couldn't care any less if you actually learn in his class. Is not helpful with questions or problems. Actually rude. Hasn't updated his syllabus or assignments in years...same dates from 5+ years ago on some materials. Homework assignments confusing due to his lack of interest in teaching. Really unfortunate 'cause this could have been a cool class,0
Super caring and helpful. Very clear lectures.,1
"Don't know why there are so many bad reviews. She is lenient on due dates, an advantage, because you can get feedback on your drafts until you get an A. You must be PROACTIVE and bring her your drafts. Driver is an amazing professor and will improve your writing skills. She even gives free copies of the material to students who cannot buy it.",1
"Honestly, i really regret signing up for this class. Im really struggling and i shouldn't be especially for an intro to philosophy 101.",0
"Literal Gem. Content was difficult, but go to her office hours and she is so helpful and nice. Office hours are the reason I passed, and with flying colours.",1
"Datt is not as bad as a lot of people lead on. Don't get me wrong, his class was definitely hard, but I was expecting much worse. He lays out exactly what he wants you to know from the textbook. It is a lot of information. However, I made quizlets and averaged a B on every test except the final. He did give us a lot of extra credit points :)",1
You get what you put into the class knowledge wise. You can just show up for the midterm and final and get away with an A . But i would highly encourage you to go. Mensah is one of those professors that really should not be at Howard and took major pay cuts to be here. Though it does not come across all the time he is extremely knowledgeable.,1
"He is Horrible.  I'm changing my major because of him, or maybe even changing schools.",0
"Her courses are easy, but totally unecessary. She doesn't tie things together and you will learn *nothing* during an entire semester. If you only want a high grade, this is your teacher, but for Soc/Anthro major her classes are a joke.",0
I have taken a bunch of dearings class and they are all the same. If he makes an attempt to teach he goes of topic or he starts complaining about other students in other classes and makes them sound like they are dumb. I understand why ppl don't attend class. I learned very little in his classes. I would say stay away but he's all Tarleton has.,0
"He DOES NOT TEACH. I don't know what he is getting paid to do. Seriously, GET OUT OF HIS CLASS WHILE YOU STILL CAN!",0
"His lectures are dry, but his powerpoints are great, and the tests are straight forward if you memorize material from the powerpoints. ",1
"Fantastic professor. He is great at making things understandable. The only downside is that the exams are generally quite difficult and will require some knowledge of what is in the book besides what he lectures on. Take good notes during his lectures too, as sometimes questions will pop up about little things he mentions for two seconds in class.",1
No teach basics.  Hard homework.  Hard tests.  Hard labs.  Book is horrible.,0
"I had her for online pre-calculus. She was very reliable to contact through email and provided good feedback if you didn't understand the lecture (video - by professor Burger). It was online through thinkwell, so if you have experience with that type of class then I would recommend it.",1
really tough marker!,1
"He is great professor! He has an accent but he makes concepts really understandable. I hate math and after having Mary Shepherd for Calc 1 and Russel Euler for Precalc, this is a walk in the park! He is really funny and enjoys himself when he is teaching. I would recommend taking him. His tests and quizzes all come from the (not required) homework.",1
"She was incredibly disorganized and confusing. I understand her being stressed with COVID and the transition to remote classes, but this was a college class we paid for. One good thing about her, was that she gave us a large amount of time to complete assignments... but did not grade them in a timely manor so we did not know what our grades were.",0
he is the boringest prof i have ever had ,0
"He is the best, really kind and helpful. Totally willing to meet you halfway and really understanding. A super fair grader too!",1
"Prof. Vulakh is an incredible professor. Great at lecturing, straightforward and honest. He goes through concepts and homework problems, and does a mini-review session at the beginning of each class. Exams are very fair and I would highly highly recommend taking his classes. He also has a quirky brand of humor that you will find extremely endearing",1
I have taken several classes with Prof. Pave and am registered for even more in the fall. He is very type A (So am I) so it is helpful when you receive daily instruction. He responds to any questions via student email very quickly and goes above and beyond for his students to make sure you understand the course work. I can't wait for the fall!!,1
awesome professor. take this man. made econometrics really understandable and i look forward to taking 423. gotta buy the text (try amazon) and do the homework. exams are long (6 pages) but he prepares you for them pretty well.,1
Dean is by far the worst teacher i have ever had.  I felt like i learned the material and had a grasp on the material but still got a D in the class.  Grades rediculously hard.  Does curve a little but but unless you are a math genius stay away,0
Mrs. Padgett is the worst teacher I have ever had. She is EXTREMELY scatterbrained therefore can never stay on topic. She claims to go by the syllabus but never does. She also picks favorites which get graded differently than the rest. Her grading varies by student or what mood she is in.  She is very unprofessional and inappropriate.,0
"He is just awesome, one of the best prof ever! He explains the concept super clearly and helps are always available. He made me love organic chemistry so much. His British accent made me concentrate more in class. Definitely would highly recommend this prof",1
"Goes over material pretty fast.. you can do well in the class if you read the book thoroughly and study a lot. The TA's were pretty horrible, and I'm pretty sure they made up the midterm/final...",0
"Hated his class!  He talks on and on about nothing.  If you dont write your papers they way he wants it, he will destroy it, keep them short and to the point.  Very boring class all around though, take him if you have no other option.",0
"He is better of the worse math professors. When he gives back my exams after grading, he literally writes like a kindergartener, cannot understand what he wanted me to fix on the test. Although he doesn't write that badly on the board, exams are just like the review, and homework isn't a lot, just 1-3 problems per chapter from the textbook.",1
"Dr. Diem is unresponsive to feedback, emails, and students' concerns. His readings are incredibly long and very repetitive. No videos, audio lectures. Just readings. Weekly quizzes are only allotted 5 mins for questions that are difficult to answer. Unclear on what he expects. 2 exams: midterm and cumulative final. The midterm was hard as heck.",0
Prof Byone inst a nice professor. I wouldn't recommend taking a class with her. Time for her to respect her students that pay for her salary.,0
"To be fair, Partovi is very knowledgable and many people really do like him. However, you should expect 100 pages of reading a week, an amount of rudeness, and a final that will consist of writing a 12-15 page historiographical review of the scholarship relating to the topic being taught. Keep in mind that this is a lower-division undergrad class.",0
"Great prof, explain difficult concepts with clarity. I also like the fact that he writes out the problems on the whiteboard so it's easy to follow. As someone has mentioned before, try to do the problems before coming to class, it will help you to achieve a better mark",1
"This was the most frustrating class I've taken, expects you to read absolutely everything like the previous person stated not friendly for non-native English speaker. Majority of the quiz questions are tricky and have a lot of typos. I wish he was more straightforward with his questions.",0
"Super funny, full of stories, can sometimes go on tangents but if you care about food at all this is a great class. He's not the most available in lectures because he has like... 600 students a time, but he'll make time in office hours. ",1
he lets you get to know the other students before actually teaching the stuff. the book stuff is boring but the speeches are fun. he makes it comfortable and easy to speak in front of the class,1
"Worst teacher I have ever had. I was very interested in this class until he killed my excitement. The tests are based on the textbook which we never use in class. He never lectures or talks about the material at all, he just tells stories and goes over cases. To do well on the test you have to teach yourself. If you're behind or struggling, too bad",0
"Awesome teacher! Provides every opportunity for you to succeed. No text required for 117.  Very fair, approachable and helpful -- available before and after classes & by email.  Takes time to comment on papers & provides bonus opportunities. Provides study guide and review session before EVERY exam -- use them, ask questions, and you will get an A!",1
AWESOME PROFESSOR! This class was so fun and interactive and would gladly take it again! I thought it was going to be graphic and hard to swallow but it was made very interesting to learn about,1
"Do not take her class. It's unnecessarily difficult and she gives A LOT OF WORK  to do for no reason. I like her as a person, but her lecture is really... boring for the most part...",0
She grades really hard but the tests are probably the WORST part. She only gives you 30 min for 20 questions even though in the syllabus it says 40 min. Her reviews are almost useless because taking the test there is more info that you needed than provided. 10/10 do not recommend.,0
"Papageorgiu is amazing! I highly recommend him! He will assist you with any questions you have, and he is hilarious.",1
"Awesome at teaching, and an awesome person.  He makes class easy to understand and tells you exactly what is going to be on the test.  Great professor.",1
Excellent professor. He was very helpful and provides great feedback.,1
"There are so many students want to join in the CS, and this is why she is still teaching CS 135. Boring and not helpful.",0
"He is a great teacher all around. He is a very fair grader, not easy. He assigns extensive reading however the readings are very interesting and always pertain to class discussions. Don't expect to do nothing in his class and do well but if you are interested in political science, he is the way to go!!",1
"If you are a 2D artist, do not take this class.  He expects you to know everything about what you're doing, and the chances are you won't.  Nice enough guy, just don't ask him for anything.",0
"I love the class that I took with him, it seemed daunting at first but it's super simple. He wants to challenge you to think and all you have to do is answer prompts and talk about it in class. He doesn't believe in right or wrong answers but more so how you got to where you did. I'm going to miss him since he's retiring!",1
The best professor at York!,1
Very unorganized!! She did not grade us on much 3 exams. There is a lot of reading that she expects done by the next lecture. Lecture were very vague. I found a lot of her statements to be very vulgar and offensive,0
"Ms. Wayland does not respond to email or in course messages in a timely fashion.  She neglected to post the last discussion for the semester, and she did not respond to emails or messages. After the discussion was due, she posted that we would all get credit .  I expect greater professionalism in a graduate class.",0
"Good guy, just a bit busy these days because of the new baby.",1
"The person below is right, she should not be teaching... Mean and hurtful",0
Youre hard work will reflect your grade,1
"Nelson is awesome! She gives explicit hints in class about what will be on the tests. There is stuff on the tests from the book that she won't go over, but the book is an easy read and can get answers from skimming. Do the study guides and you'll be fine. I felt very comfortable doing speeches. TAKE HER!!",1
He makes you watch hours worth of lecture videos and type up bulleted notes on the material that he grades. You have to watch the video and type every word he says otherwise you wont get full credit. He makes you trace a ridiculous map of the US that takes hours to complete. Worst online class Ive ever taken. Easy A but A LOT of time/work,0
"She is an extremely tough grader. For a 75 minute class, only 30 minutes of it is actually used in being productive. She assigns a TON of work and barely explains what she wants. Do not take her for college writing. She is a nice woman but the workload is harder than any other class I've had at Marist.",0
"So I liked the course content even though there'too much reading. Good news! Pop quizzes aren't hard at all. Professor A looked unapproachable and she was sometimes harsh with students. I don't recommend this class, the content was great! but the vibe was just not right.",0
"Tests are completely irrelevant to concepts taught, failing averages on the midterms, does not care about the students",0
"Your grade is determined solely by the 3 prelims and the final (no hw grade). Make sure you go to lectures because sometimes he'll throw in reactions he talks about in lecture but isn't talked about in the textbook. He can explain things decently well but like others have said, he wastes a lot of time in lecture telling personal stories.",1
"she just reads lecture notes to us in class. does not do a good job answering questions either by ignoring them or not answering them fully.
 the course with her was awful, assignments and tests were not fairly marked as the ta's did all the work.",0
"Dr. King is a very interesting professor & clearly knows a lot about Africana studies. His lectures are a little long, but if you pay attention & take good notes, you should be fine. 3 film reviews a semester, 1 midterm, & 1 final. Take your time & edit your film reviews & you should be fine. Shows interesting (yet intense) films.",1
She is a director and not very knowledgeable about acting and movement. She plays videos from a website and tells students to copy the moves. The vocal warm-ups are also copied from papers. Basically she doesn't have the necessary education and experience. Don't take her classes.,0
He is a good teacher as long as you pay attention and follow along. You have to show up to class and you have to participate in order to get a good grade in the class. He really does know what he is talking about and he is a very nice guy. Try hard in the class and you will do fine.,1
She's very clear and makes the content easy to understand. The exams are a bit difficult.,1
"Lectures were read off pre written slides posted on moodle. Going to class was pointless. Hand writing is brutal, hard to understand as well. Do the homework problems and study sample exams and you'll be fine.",0
"This isn't the professor to take if you're not an auditory learner (or you are easily distracted). The powerpoints are only pictures, and UDCapture is used to supplement on information he did not have time to discuss in lecture. Overall, I really liked his class and would take him again for a HIST course.",1
"Since this was a theory-based course, the structure of the course can sometimes be confusing. Prof. Lynch is extremely insightful, especially with regards to China. He does get off topic sometimes when talking about broad concepts of IR. I enjoyed the class- mainly powerpoint and discussion. He also assigns alot of readings, so it's best to keep up",1
"I would NEVER recommend him. He's extremely condescending! He has lots of lectures that can get confusing. If he doesn't think your question is hard he'll say, ""How is that hard? Im not going over that. "" He told us, ""if you think I teach in a way thats hard to understand. You're wrong! Just learn to understand."" I've never met anyone this rude.",0
Tests were out of this world hard bombed the first test. Studied night and day plus some to pull out with a decent grade. Hardest math prof that i have EVER taken. Would not suggest anyone to take her.,0
"He's a good professor,he helps the students if they ask for it. He's easy makes the class fun and he does not give that much homework. He's the best English professor I've had yet. English 1A was a really easy class and I thought it was going to be hard.",1
"If you want a class with only 3 grades here Is your chance. This professor will blast your speakers out as he doesn't know how to work a computer very well, and then ask the same question 5 times in a row regardless if someone answered. Best way to pass is skip the lectures and study for yourself with notes you take!",0
"May seem nice at first and then you realize that she only wants you to agree with her when she poses a in class discussion question, and can in fact be quite rude to students! I felt like she was a bit bias and unprofessional at times. Don't really recommend this class or prof if you don't like how profs are vague when they give a lecture.",0
"Beware of group quizzes and a group book report. The book is required for the homework assignments. Overall, the class is super easy, just show up and you'll pass. Oh, and basic math is required. If you don't know arithmetic then this class will be troublesome.",1
The worst teacher in the world!,0
"Very interesting class, keeps the subjects very stimulating and pretty much hands you the exams beforehand so you can prepare for it...TF graded the papers a little harsh though...all in all if you're an IR major, it will seem pretty boring the first part of the semester seems irrelevant but the last quarter is the ""IR"" part of the course",1
"Dr. Lacher is definitely an expert in his field. Unfortunately, he seems to think the students are experts as well. Projects are difficult but doable, and if you complete a working version it means you've learned A LOT. His tests are awful, worst I've ever experienced, drawing more from random material only mentioned in notes rather than projects.",0
Something to look forward to in your upper divisions. His midterms are long but are reasonable so know your material!,1
He gives so much homework per week yet refuses to grade it in a timely manner. He doesn't answer email questions and he is not very helpful during lectures either. I would never take him ever again. Worst class of the semester.,0
One of the most mediocre professors I have ever had. The class is boring and it does not deliver what the syllabus promises. Avoid!,0
"Easy class! Pretty boring but no attendance is required...tests are open book, attend labs and you'll pass (answers are in the back of the lab packet) 
 easy grader",0
"In all honesty he is a good lecturer. However, he is absolutely horrible to you during office hours. Rude, condescending, and incredibly patronizing. He makes you feel less of a human for asking questions. He does not care about his students. Only about maintaining his self image during lectures.",0
This professor is awful. He only focuses on the logic aspect of seminar. He doesn't know how to teach. I suggest not taking his class unless you want a D.,0
"Previous commentor missed out. While Prof. Murphy's  lectures may have been easy to skip, they were also very interesting. Fun class and learned a lot.",1
"Great, funny prof.",1
"Hall is insane; there's no way to sugarcoat it. His lectures usually start out on the topic of the day but quickly spiral into unfounded conspiracy theories, unrelated personal stories, and his insistence that heroine is completely safe. Somewhere in there will be a test question or two, but they're hard to discern from his ramblings. Do not take.",0
He's Passionate About Poetry!  I respect that.,1
Professor was super boring in my opinion. Only went to the first 2 or 3 lectures and went to every discussion and passed the class with an A+. A lot of reading for the class but I didnt read a single bit.,0
"HORRIBLE teacher, nice lady...could not teach well, made things confusing.",0
"I had him for 135 and 136, and he was a great lecturer that really focuses on the basics and makes sure they are clear. It would be great if he showed more practical examples, but that's also up to the student to put in the work and practice. Tough grader but I HIGHLY recommend looking at old exams: they don't change much and are very helpful.",1
Super nice professor. Recommend attending class as he gives tips all the time. He's really enthusiastic about the material and tells great jokes.,1
"Good lecturer...and that is about it. He is a lazy or overworked professor. Current MBA director, and doesn't even use moodle or reply to emails. His grading on papers doesn't have a real rubric. He gives the grade he wants based on how he likes you. Kohut, you are not fooling anyone. You act like you are open minded, but you are just like the rest",0
"Her tests came directly from her notes, so that is really the only thing you need to study, don't buy the book. Her lab practicals were pretty easy. She hands out a chemistry packet at the beginning of the course, make sure you complete it and get it all correct! She adds those points to your final average- they can make or break your grade.",1
Wonderful teacher! I have never been so interested and moved by a class before hers. I have always loved short stories and writing and she just added fuel to the fire! Her passion touched me and I think that is a rare gift in a teacher when they can do that.,1
"Had him for nutraceutics, majority of the class failed the first test. Test questions are so random and not based on anything taught in class",0
"This class was incredibly easy for me. I took pre-calc the year before so they may have been why it was so easy. Some people in my class were lost from time to time, but he gave great examples and was super helpful. He's also really chill and reminds me of a surfer dude. Definitely recommend him as a math teacher, he's probably the best Delta has.",1
"This professor just reads off of her slides and goes through them really fast. She rarely participates with the class. She DOES give partial credit on exams which is, I guess, a plus. If you miss a class don't worry because she posts her slides on blackboard. She gives study points that don't really help and she's terrible at explaining things.",0
"Prof. Moes is VERY knowledgeable in his field but he seemed to have difficultly ""dumbing"" down the info to suit the 101 level of this course. Absolutely ZERO professor-student engagement during class- this class is pure lecture. Lecture heavy and graded by a few things. No homework though",0
Professor Sanford is one of the best professors I have had at GVSU. His lectures are interesting and he is very clear about what will be on the exams. He gives multiple extra credit opportunities. His teaching style is very unique and it made class exciting to go to. I would recommend him to anyone who has to take BUS Law.,1
Discussions in class were enlightening.  She appreciates student input.  Easy grader.,1
"He isn't great at explaining things, he's a tough grader, yet does't give any structure to the assignment. I really hated his class, along with almost everyone who took him. His lectures are short, but they seem super long because of how boring they are. Would not recommend.",0
"Horrible teacher his test relate nothing to his lectures he will not tell you your final grade he says there is a rule preventing him from doing so, his test are painfully hard and his grading scale is even harder to understand if you can find another teacher that teaches the same classes take the other teacher instead do not take Graves ",0
"The class was very interesting but other than a paper and a couple of news article homework assignments, the only grades are tests. The tests are hard and a fourth of the questions don't relate to what's on the study guide. It is a fun class however, I just wish you got more than 1 point for attending class.",1
Anne is an awesome prof! She's great at making the content more interesting and easy to follow. Took arhi1000 with her as well and looking forward to taking more classes with her in the future!,1
"not sure why there are so many 4's. he has one specific teaching style, and if it's not for you, then you're gonna struggle. I appreciate that he's willing to meet outside of class, but he pins students against each other and makes them feel small. either his messy style works for you, or it doesn't. there's no in between.",0
Professor Allen knows what he is talking about and is pretty easy. Classes can get boring and it can be hard to pay attention. He is pretty funny and a generous grader.,1
"If you want to spend countless nights crying because all the hard work, effort and time you put into this course have gone to waste then definitely take MEC 311 with Dr. Bill. Quizzes are way more difficult compared to the practice questions he does in class (which he makes loads of mistakes on). Spends his time skimming through everything. sorry x",0
"She is a caring professor who is passionate about teaching. The homework assignments were quite easy. There were hardly any tests or quizzes, mainly essays and papers. She makes herself available outside of class and really wants to help students. If you are willing to put in a bit of work, her class is an easy A.",1
Pretty boring professor but the slides help a lot. He curves. Didn't use the text book that much. Take CLAS and you'll be fine.,0
"Attendance accounts for way too much of a grade in this class. Everything you learn in class is also in the textbook, but the textbook covers everything more extensively so you'll end up doing the same amount of reading whether you attend lectures or not.",0
Super dry and boring lectures. Must go to lectures however because she does not post slides and will test the specifics from lecture and the readings. Know all of the definitions. Tons of reading.,0
"Kind and generous professor. There are no exams in class. All you have is in-class writing and 2 major papers. As long as you show some effort, she grades paper generously.",1
"He barely looks at the stuff you turn in. I would definitely take him again. Kind of awkward, lectures are boring. Textbook ""mandatory"" (everything can be found online). All around great teacher. He makes class fun! Gives a lot of pop quizzes but he pretty much tells you on the previous class.",1
"Amazing teacher. I was taking micro and macro for the first time together (different teachers) but Jeff makes Micro so easy to understand and makes his lectures very enjoyable and funny. I never did great on the tests he gave, they were somewhat difficult. Would absolutely take again though, one of if not the best professor Ive taken at TCC.",1
"It's been a few years since I took a class with Keil and I still find myself having flashbacks of it. Interesting, engaging, funny and as charming as they come. One of the best at the school, hands down.",1
She is very personable and presents the material in an interesting way. I did not however take this course for those reasons. Her exams are only loosely  associated with her lectures and the required textbook is hardly useful in learning the material as she repeatedly states her dislike for it. Don't take this class with this prof if you need a 3.0,0
He is the worst and does not care how hard he makes a 100 level class. I hate this guy with a passion.,0
This was the most interesting class I have had so far! He is a great prof. and is funny!,1
"This teacher is the worst teacher I've had in all 130 college credits I've earned.  Perfect 4.0 GPA down the drain because this teacher fails to prepare her students to succeed on the exam.  Be prepared to write long detailed essays that better be of ""History/Literature Major"" quality, or you will likely earn a C or worse in her class.  Good Luck!",0
"Pros: Super easy class. Light workload. Easy tests. Cons: Her attitude. Condescending and mean. If you actually do want help, she'll make you feel stupid and like you're wasting her time.",0
"WWII History.  Just had long essay exams, three to be exact, plus the final. Definitely need to read and attend class. Grading criteria is iffy. It depends on the strictness of the TA.",1
Dr. Gray is so sweet and funny! Really cares about what she is teaching. I took her Environmental Conservation class and it was very chill. She posts all her power points so there is really no need to take notes in class. She likes current events and telling you where she has been so just pay attention because that could be a question on a test!,1
I would avoid taking her class.,0
I absolutly love Sara!  She really knows very much about theatre and she made it fun.  She has this great attitude and she really does love teaching.  She has great passion.  I feel like I really learned a lot and as long as you think about projects it is really pretty easy.,1
"By far the best teacher I've had. Amazing personality and is beyond competent. Study guides for exams are a must. Sometimes exam material was not covered in lectures. If you do the homework, exams are passable. Material is covered quickly.",1
Absolute worst professor I have ever had. Not only does he make you buy the book that he created but if you use even a DATE that wasnt mentioned in the book he accuses you of plagiarism and lowers your grade a whole letter. Save yourself the stress and take a different professor. Hes very rude as well and doesnt do his job right.,0
actually makes biology interesting. his labs are kinda hard but his exams for regular bio class are str8 from notes. and he also gives u his notes before exam. overall great professor,1
"Unless you really know java REALLY well I suggest you stay away from his data structures class. Hard to understand also, when you ask for help most of the time he just repeats himself and talks in circles.",0
Fantastic Teacher - anyone who says otherwise is lacking in mental constitution.  Couldn't have learned more about birds with anyone else.  Evergreen is diserviced by having him leave and losing his collections.  Shame on the head of the science faculty.,1
"I have had worse professors, but I wouldn't say he's amazing. Lectures are really boring, which makes it hard to come to class. He has a very strong accent and can make the lectures harder to understand. Overall, he wants his students to do well and curves a lot and drops one quiz. He is also willing to help. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE ONLINE QUIZZES!!",1
"Terrible teacher. Gets off topic during lecture, and highly subjective grader. By the end of the semester the teacher did not input at least half of the grades i received in the course, only the final letter grade two weeks after taking the final.",0
"Boring, boring, boring!",0
"Total Recommend anyone take this class with the Professor. She is understanding and helpful to those who do not understand the material. To those who are retaking the class like myself, this is definitely the professor to take it with.",1
"his Stat333 course is good , not very hard",1
"Terrible teacher, has no empathy for his students, clearly only has this Job so he can continue doing research at mcgill.",0
Dr. Koehler tried hard to help students learn.,1
She made me HATE literature.,0
Easiest A ever!! The study guide is basically the test but in order!! She gives you one 10 page research paper but she doesnt read it as long as its in the format she wants it.,1
I never had trouble staying awake in his class.  He kept me interested in the books of Leviticus and Numbers. He never minded when I asked questions and always answered fully and completely.,1
"c:lots of hw,shes rude (says whatever comes 2 her mind+often insults people),boring b/c her teaching style is unstructured+all she does is talk and make fun of people,refuses to go over the readings in textbook+write on the board because she says that we should have learned it  already. p:allows u 2 give hw 1 day late. overall advice:dont take her!",0
"She graded us based on our writing ability, not on our understanding of the material. This is History, not writing.",0
"Worst professor ever. I've struggled with math my whole life and she didn't make things any easier. Students were always correcting her work, she rushes through her lectures. There's 4 homework quizzes worth 8 points and 4 tests worth 100 points, no extra credit and she does assign a few random worksheets only worth 1-2 points. Wack grading system.",0
Really horrible at teaching. Pretty nice guy though. ,0
"She is a nice person,but is not recommended. She had you answer a question out of your GuidedNotebook everyday.So you had to be there to get the points,put tons of HW online. i slept through  the class nearly every day and would have skipped if i could have and still got like a 99% in there.The test are easy did not study for 1 and aced em all!!!!!",0
"WAY to slow and disrespectful, I have learned to dread math class. I used to love math.",0
"He explains problems while writing on board, then u don't have time to figure out how he gets answer. Not good with patients for others, you may somewhat understand, then he totally throws u off before u leave class. U leave with confusion and head spinning! And tutoring lab teaches differently. He knows math but not one to teach it!",0
"Teaches well, but is reluctant to give bonus marks, even for advanced math courses, and even though the calculations are (sometimes excessively) messy. And he goes way too slow at times... repeating things over and over.",1
He was one of the worst professors Ive ever taken. He's bias and doesn't grade everyone fairly. One person might get an A because he likes them in lab but another might not do so well for NO REASON. Quite unfortunate because I really liked him before I took this class and now Im leaving with one of the worst experiences of my college carrier. AVOID,0
"Taking Prof Walker's Physical Science class is rough.. She gets side tracked, or teaches us material that won't be on our quizzes. Her lessons and the study/homework material don't match up. Before our exit exam she crammed Geologic Time into one lesson, and the rest we had to ""master on our own over the weekend"". I don't pay to teach myself.",0
"I just want to start by saying James seems to be a great guy outside of the classroom! When it comes to teaching he can NOT finish a point b/ he goes off on random tangents. His punctuality is among the worst I have ever seen from a professor EVER. He has admitted to the class that ""he actually has notes today."" He is stealing money from students!",0
"Some of this stuff can be confusing or not interesting for most people.  There are a lot of readings so be prepared.  The number one mistake is not showing up to class.  His lectures and class discussions give a lot more clarity to the content.  Not bad, but kind of a demanding prof.",1
"Dr Lee is a very nice man, but bases his class off of SPSS which is SO difficult to understand! Please do not take this class if you arent good at math. This is the first class that Ive ever failed before in my life.",0
worst prof ever!!!,0
"lectures are so boring. does not speak loud enough and mumbles a lot. assignment instructions are not clear at all. I started as an English major and ended up switching majors because of this BS. probably a nice man outside of class, but did not like him as a prof at all. 5 quizzes, lowest 2 dropped. 2 lectures a week and 1 seminar. TAs aren't good",0
"i graduated awhile back, but he was my favourite prof at guelph. also, he is super cute!",1
"Professor November was amazing. He's extremely helpful and is really nice. There are some weekly worksheets and reading but it's manageable with other responsibilities that you may have. Everything he gives you is important and goes towards big assignments so you should do them. Best professor I've ever had, I'd love to take his class again.",1
"She always has some sort of joke every half a second but it was very amusing. The workload seems like plenty, but it really helps you learn a LOT. Her strict way of teaching motivated me to learning more. I enjoyed her class.",1
Automatically gives you a 50 just for putting your name on quizzes ( their not easy) quizzes have to do with the readings he assigns .. he grades really tough on essays which is 20% says u cant turn them in late but actually does let you although u shouldnt,1
"Has the knowledge, but no ability to explain it to mere mortals. Needs work as an instructor. If you're not already very strong in Econ, avoid him.",0
"great professor. Caring and light hearted. Goes at the pace of the class. I would recommend taking in class vs online. 2 exams, a final, 5 quizzes, and an oral presentation. Online HW every chapter to go online with the quiz. Drops one quiz. It's a hard class so beware, but she's a 10/10 professor. attendance is a must or else you'll fall behind!!",1
"Anyway, I got a B+ and and A on the papers.  Dale Snow rocks.  Enroll if u can, ****.",1
"Professor Khazeh is the worst professor I have had at Salisbury University by far. He does not care at all about the students he teaches. I am in his online class and asked that he open the test window up earlier due to a work conflict, and he replied with a firm no. His policy for missed tests is a comprehensive exam upon return THE NEXT semester.",0
"The assignments and schedule are all very clear from the beginning of the semester. The assignments are relatively easy if you can navigate a textbook. The assignments are also in two week blocks, so you have awhile to work on them. Dr. Weeber is a great professor. I've taken him before and will take him again.",1
"Terrible prof, does not explain things well and expects us to understand everything and work ahead and still somehow understand everything. Not a fan of him. Very boring to listen to, as well. This is an SWS class but there is way too many little assignments due at each class. Hard to keep tack of everything that is due...",0
She does not know that this is a 100 level course that people take because they have to.  The tests are hard.  And if there is an issue with anything she is not very willing to work with you at all!,0
"Dr. Schedel will not give away good grades, but his class is relatively easy. It takes an open mind (he is a bit weird) and a genuine interest in public speaking to succeed in his class. Ask a lot of questions and don't be intimidated by him; he is a really nice guy who wants to see, and help, his serious students do well.",1
"Easy A. Attendance isn't taken. Everything is on Blackboard. As long as you turn stuff in, he'll give you pretty much full credit for it. You can take quizzes twice and exams are take-home. Everything is open book. TAKE HIM if you're just fulfilling a gen ed requirement.",1
He is really bad.,0
"Overall he is a good professor. Tough grader so don't expect for a high grade in the course unless you give it your all. Attendance isn't ""mandatory"" but if you miss class, you're risking 0's on quizzes and participation grades. Great lecturer, nice guy, but difficult tests.",1
Not a good prof. Just read the slides over. Dont take him,0
All you need to do is memorize the slides (even the little details you don't think are important) and you should pass with at least a B. Her examples and methods are a little strange but she is nice lady.,1
Colleen is by far my favourite professor I have had at GBC in my two years since being there. I took him for her Heaven and Hell course. she is very animated and hilarious in her lectures and mad everything interesting .she is very understanding of students and often gives extensions. I am very glad I took her and will be looking to take her again.,1
"Those who are in CTY and CNS dont take this course as a professional option unless you are very very good with database. This course has 2 tests and a final, 3 big assignments, and 10 labs. This is a busy course. Think twice to take this course",0
She will make sure you know the material and not be able to just go through the motions. I had her for matrix algebra and got a B+ because she has a easier grading system but all the same the class was hard(though she doesn't make you do proofs so that's nice). For Diff Eq though she is the same but expects you to know your basics very well,1
"I really wish there was a tag option that says: DOES NOT CARE. I reached out to her several times throughout the semester, received a response 1 in every 5 times. She doesn't care about her students whatsoever and an all around horrible professor. The idea behind her extra papers is fine, but she gives you nothing to go on. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS",0
He is an extremely boring professor...if your a good student and want to keep good grades stay away from this guy.,0
"Worst professor to have... EVER. Labs? Good luck, the instructions given are NOT clear which also follows his unclear feedback which is also NOT accurate. For coding, your program may work but if not his way you'll be lucky with a D",0
Bad professor lectures alot about everything but what u have to learn dont waste your time or money find somebody else,0
"FRUSTRATING. Subtracts on things that don't traditionally matter, like which value I pick to be first in a mult. problem. Tan(#)* # vs  #*Tan(#) Even when I had the correct answer she subtracted 3 pts. Hw isn't too taxing, but when I had a question she replied: her answers weren't clear & she marked me off still with her format in our discussion.",0
"Great professor, Nice guy. 10 quizzes, lowest score dropped. 3 test. Tests are pretty difficult. MUST do the readings to do well in this class. Expect lots of reading every night. overall nice guy, knowledgeable and passionate about the subject",1
He's a harder marker then other profs. teaching the course. Beware essay style!,1
Mark is a great teacher and a really nice guy. He made me not hate math and actually made sure the class understood the material we needed to know before we moved on. Very fair on all tests and extremely helpful anytime you need it. Great teacher.,1
"Dr. Weatherby is an amazing women. People like her teach, because things have happened in their life and they want to help educate people. A very easy and informative class (I took Deviant Behavior) with her and she is tells you what is on the exams.",1
"Great guy, great class. Tests are extremely easy, you are allowed a piece of paper front and back to fill with information, and he tells you what will be on it. One homework assignment per week, only 150 words. He's funny and really loves what he does. Would definitely take his class again and wish he wasn't leaving Westfield :(",1
"Really great prof, she really cares about her students. Easily offended, if you want to be on your phone all of class or plan on leaving midway, don't bother coming because she'll call you out. Really good lectures, extremely informative. You won't get by without reading the novels and plays.",1
Does not clarify the work that he puts out and always goes off topic. Talks down to his students like they're dumb and expects everybody to be on the same page without putting concrete guidelines on paper or online. Do not,0
"If and only if you don't do the homework, you will not do well. The homework (i.e. sentences and assignments) is all that is needed. She's a good teacher, gives good outlines for tests, and succeeds in teaching those who want to learn.",1
"Overall good teacher, always ready to help, but his advices are not always helpful. His main problem, I think, that his methods of solving the problems are different from the book, the homework is from the book and when you ask him questions about book methods of solving he can not answer.",1
"His classes were pretty interesting. The lectures are a bit tedious but if your attention span can hold on, he gives you a lot of useful information and future references for acting and directing.",1
I took Garrigan for psych101 and I loved this class. All the information was there from power points and notes. There are no tricks on the quizzes. If you study the material it is easy. Lectures are interesting. Not boring at all. I would most definitely take him again. Getting up early for his class is not a problem. ,1
"Professor Engerer is the WORST professor I have ever had. DO NOT take him. He loves watching his students fail. Horrible, just horrible.",0
"Awful prof. He is a very rude prof that has no clear expectations from the class. I learned absolutely nothing from him ""teaching"" this course. He just rambles on nonsense during his lectures. Often likes to pick on students during his lectures. Take another prof for this course, not worth it.",0
"Professor Aoki is the most overqualified teacher at Augsburg. His classes are hard and he has high expectations - be an adult and work hard for your A. That being said, he is always available to help if you ask and will go out of his way if needed. He's got a dry sense of humor and is very blunt when grading, clearly some people can't take it.",1
"HORRIBLE during online school. Exams were lengthy, and formatted horribly. The entire structure of the online course was set up for students to fail. Caused so much unnecessary stress. Would not take again.",0
"OMG..class isn't hard, test aren't difficult IF you go to class, take notes and read lectures. No, he doesn't spoon feed you material for test, but it's all in front of you. REALLY? You have zero HW, read some, ONLY 3 exams with 25 MC questions and the course is DIFFICULT? Professor IS Hysterical and genuinely interested in the material. TAKE HIM!",1
"Jose Morcillo is one of the best professors I have ever had in my last 4 years of university. He makes sure everyone participates, answers questions, and gives some of the easiest and useful tests ever. If you want an actual professor to treat you like a human, take him.",1
One of the best professors I had at GRCC. I took Ba103 and got an okay grade. would of had a better grade if i went to class more. assignments were super easy.. 90% of them are online. and the group discussions were easy. hes very understanding. especially when you mess up on a test or homework assignment,1
"For the ridiculous amount of work I did, it was still not enough to get an A. For very timed test everyone had to use the ADS extra time just to finish. If you actually need extra time on tests for a medical reason, youre screwed. The tests were what you'd expect from a 400 level classical mechanics physics class, but with bad lecturing",0
"I can see how you might mistake this guy for nice.  If you suck up to him and pretend his self important-psuedo intellectual babble means anything he may well be nice to you.  Bottom line, this is a guy who hasn't done much in the real world and thinks he is god in academia.",0
"No textbook, just a link to papers he's written about sociologists. Multiple choice questions are really just papers written in response to his writings. A paper a week plus extra book reports. Not engaging, treats you like a child & makes comments if you don't have prep notes for his papers that are written more suitable to an upper level class.",0
"Alex's lectures tend to drag on but I think he's aware of this, and therefore hardly ever makes you stay the full time.  Anyway, the man couldn't be more nice and gives you plenty of chances to do well in this class. You do one group presentation and a few small papers. The tests were hard at first but towards the end they were good.",1
"Worst professor I have ever had! The class itself is pretty easy, but you won't learn a thing and you will leave every class feeling like your time is being wasted. The worst part of this class  is Prof Schneider herself. She is constantly making discriminatory remarks about groups of people and about students in the class! AVOID!",0
"Deb Fels utilized a series of guest lectures in lieu of presenting course materials. The guest lectures represented related content; it did not explain the concepts of the course text book. The final exam was 100% from the textbook. I know I did not Fel the exam, but I did not do as well as I could have with lectures on course material.",0
"A controversial professor  with an unconventional approach to teaching.  My survey of the class was that; you either liked her or you could not stand her. She is a great proponent self-teaching, so if any of you are thinking about a Ph.D's programs she is a great mentor.  She is someone  who is not easily defined, approach with an open mind",1
BCIS5317 was the introduction to C# programming course offered as an elective in the MSIS program. Dr. Sharp is an excellent professor and did a great job of teaching an online programming course. He even provided his own You-Tube style topical videos that were entirely appropriate for the associated programming labs. I highly recommend Dr. Sharp!,1
She is a nice teacher and well prepared but she does not go over the homework in class. ALOT of notes that weren't very helpful. I failed the class.,1
"Lectures are always all over the place. Is very unconfident. Has difficulty using her own examples, and ends up skipping half of them. TAs for that class are awful as well. assignments always marked late, and 3/4 of my assignments were marked incorrectly (later fixed but still). Hope you guys like writing in pen :)",0
He is amazing !!!,1
"Sienerth is the man. Workload isn't  that big, but his tests are difficult. Lectures can be hard to follow, but if you ask he will always clarify himself. Clearly an intelligent professor, as well as an all around genuine and funny guy. Highly recommended.",1
omg. she sucks. i hate her class. boring. i seriously feel like i am not learning a thing from this woman.,0
She goes through her presentation way too fast for students to clearly understand the material.,0
"By far the best comp professor that i've had this far into my degree! He really cares about his students and is always asking how they are doing with the work load of the course. If you ask him a question in his OH he is going to give you a really great answer and probably some sort of joke in there with it. Overall, an absolute gem!",1
Just slow and not interesting. Too many historical stuff for a geography class. She would be good teaching high school. She needs to speak louder. Geography is not her thing. Good luck! I learn mostly by myself.,0
He is a legend at UConn. To put into words the experience that I had would be impossible. No one can live up to his legacy. He gets the chili pepper rating in my opinion because he is the only man in this world who can pull of business casual and Nikes,1
"You may dissagree with him, but the fact is he knows what he's talking about. I was in Ron's class in 98' when he predicted a war with Afghanistan. I remember because I wrote a paper  on the Taliban regime after his lecture. If you're a liberal you will love his class, if he's still teaching there.",1
"This is the WORST professor and class ever. Don't take. This class twice a week, 1.5-hour lectures a day but some of his lectures for one day would range from 3-5hrs long. Final is 60% but none of the info is on the slides or in the lecture, if it wasn't online I would fail. Only good thing is the set up of mid&final. He's old and goes on tangents",0
"Class covers very practical material.  Lectures were almost always straight from the text book (which is provided for free online).  Content was interesting, but often the lectures were slow.  Sometimes you get Friday off.  Weekly projects that take 15+ hours.  Not difficult, just time consuming.  5 person recitation is a code review.",1
"Mrs. Johnson was the best professor I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. She was very organized, kind and generous. She puts her heart into her work and puts her students first!",1
She is hilarious and understand clearly with what students need to improve their English. She gives many new vocabularies to work on it  through a inspirational and mesmerizing novel that makes me interested too keep reading it. And she gave clear feedbacks,1
"The best lab teacher I've ever had. He's a cool guy and very helpful. Very thorough and makes lab interesting (which is hard to do considering I have no interest in this class, it's required.) More than willing to help you out on assignments and fast at responding to emails.",1
"Shes power trip , presumably because no one liked her growing up and now she takes it out on her students. Dropped the class after 3 days because of her attitude. Claims to have an eidetic memory that she can turn on and off ( thats not how it works) but cant remember what she did or didnt say the class before. Doesnt explain anything throughly",0
"An amazing professor that made me love marketing. He is not here to make it hard, rather give you the facts and make it relatable and fun. Engaging in the class makes class discussions fun and the quizzes as well as the midterm is open note and the final is a group project that's fun.",1
"I failed this class miserably, honestly didn't learn anything. Almost everyone in that class failed. Not to mention he skims through all the slides and doesn't really teach any of it.",0
funny and has personality. she does well with motivating you to stretch your spanish boundaries. quizzes are extremely easy. tests are not easy but not hard just study and you will do fine,1
Makes even the most boring of topics interesting. Very easy to understand and helpful,1
He's a great guy. Got him during the covid era so maybe he's easier compared to an in class session. Makes things clear and is approachable and kind. Definitely glad I swapped into his class.,1
Taking his Calc I class shatters all your preconceived notions of what college classes are like. You'll have some of the most valuable calc techniques hammered and ingrained into you. Has the notorious voice that has spawned generations of impersonators.,1
"He is a worse teacher ever! His job is crunching numbers in some company, but not in college. Very mean and sarcastic teacher!",0
"Monotone, dry, mumbles. Is constantly corrected when doing examples on the board, doesn't sound confident in what he says. You will have a rough time if you've never done calculus before. Nothing engaging about the lectures, just straight information with little examples to help understand whats being taught. Quizzes and Midterm are very punishing.",0
"Straightforward and doesn't curve.  Tests aren't easy and he grades tough.  He explains everything that is going to be on the tests so there are no surprises.  You will learn a lot from him, but you will have to work hard.",1
"Ah, the first review on 403! Know these: 1) Although he doesn't teach much of what's in the book, that's a big part of the exam so put that cheat sheet to use! 2) The ""final"" is a single-spaced 10p paper. 3) What you learn in this class is so practical that if you haven't worked in O&G, you'll be at a huge disadvantage to the rest of the class.",1
He has a very funny personality! It was actually a science class I didn't mind going to. He was very helpful if you asked for help. He is also VERY lenient with grading.,1
"This was the best online class ever. She encourages you to use the book and notes as all the quizzes, exams and final is open book. She's very laid back and gives good feedback on discussions. The deadlines are very clear and organized. Even during a pandemic, she was so kind and understanding!",1
"The worst teacher I've ever had so far. He was always late and full of himself; lectures would often turn into a statistics class, which was neither interesting nor helpful. He often got carried away and shared personal details from his past. The lectures would end up being useless and had nothing to do with test questions. Made mean comments often",0
"This man is impossible, literally you have to assume whats gonna be on the quizzes and tests, he has bad handwriting and messy in general. If you dont have to take this class, dont. The notes he wrote on the board literally make no sense.",0
"Was a pleasure! Not only was he very friendly and helpful, but I never even did my homework and still got a B.",1
"DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH THIS EVIL EVIL MAN!!!!!! The content is cool but he is the nastiest teacher Ive ever had. Hes rude, hes mean, he puts you down and makes you feel stupid. Basically laughs at you when you ask questions and thinks hes the smartest man on the planet. I would rather leave college then have him again.",0
"Stan is way easy, take really good notes on lectures and you'll ace the tests. He is very nice and willing to help if you go into his office hours, wants his students to succeed.",1
"Prof. Lewis never let you write a quiz that you missed for good reasons which I found to be unfair. However, she understood that Latin is a hard subject and never made me feel stupid. As long as you knew SOMETHING about the sentance she was pleased.",1
He is extremely difficult to contact outside of class and very rarely checks and answers his emails so don't count on him responding at all. He can be very unclear about assignments and it is very frustrating. Often time is too vague to even allow for successful assignments.,1
"I rated 1,1,1 because that's the lowest allowed. In reality I'd rate him in complex numbers-because his awesomeness is imaginary! Absolutely horrible prof. Makes mistakes on simple problems. Assumes that everyone in the lecture is the next Godel. Fatal typos in powerpoints involving python code. All round 0/10 ggwp",0
"Dr. Pizer is very knowledgeable about his subject, and is able to present the course's material in a manner that feels premeditated, organized, and effective. He's friendly and approachable, challenges his students, and tells relevant stories based on his own fieldwork experience. I'm glad I was able to take a course with him before he leaves TXST!",1
"Tricky as a clinical instructor.  Assignment instructions unclear, and clarification is lacking even if you ask questions.  Requires in-depth detail when it comes to all 3 long group projects, plus a group paper. ",0
"Probably the worst experience I've ever had online. She is a mess. She constantly changes the assignments. The syllabus is never followed. Test are hard and comprehensive with no study guides. She has online office hours, but they get nowhere. She admits she has to look at the book to figure out how to work out problems. ",0
"Such a sweet lady. She will always help you out if you need it, even if that means taking a test earlier or later. She has a very unique personality but it grows on you. Very easy class and does not require much outside work at all.",1
"She is one of the nicest professors I've ever had. The class wasn't interesting for me whatsoever, but if you go to class, there is a lot lot lot of extra credit that will boost you up. I didn't do better than a B- on her exams and I got a A in the class. she really wants her students to do well so its worth it if you're willing to go to class",1
"He sat on his computer the whole class and when you asked for help, and didnt understand the way he explained it, he just got annoyed. He told me that if I was too stupid to learn it in high school, he couldnt teach it to me now. It was a really upsetting experience.",0
Don't take her! Oh and tell her to get off of twitter,0
Such a boring class!!!  Not too hard but she is soo unclear and all you do is watch videos on dance.  She hardly ever takes attendance so no need to go to class.,0
Came into class believing if I read the book and studied often I would come out with an A. Well guess what? I was wrong! He has such a monotone voice that could put you to sleep in less than an hour. Avoid the class if you can.,0
"Lots of these reviews are outdated. I'm a science major and it was my first computer class. Sit close to the front as he is soft spoken. But overall, if you do pay attention during lecture you will do just fine. The CIS tutoring centering is very useful too if you are having trouble with the material. Work with other classmates!",1
best professor at Bradley his method of teaching is the best i have ever seen cool guy and class is fun highly recommended,1
"One of the dullest professors I have ever had. She talks at a 2 mph pace and forgets what she is talking about mid-sentence constantly. When she explains something she will say the same exact thing 4 different ways and take up time in class just talking about a topic that doesn't matter. She makes it difficult to participate, although its a big gde",0
"Professor Mauer is very passionate about the course material. He's a fair grader and if you put in at least standard effort you will get a B. Just be on top of his assignment due dates. I took this class online and he had things due Mon, Wed, and Fri. Book is required! Heavy usage! I'm selling my old one on eBay for super cheap!",1
"Dr. Rains is an awesome professor. I am going to miss him. He is detailed/clear with the work he expects and presents. Dr. Rains has a radical way of thinking and processing information. He does not think in a fixed manner which is a blessing considering some of the professors I have encountered. If you can take a class with Dr. Rains, take it!!!!!",1
Fair teacher. Funny and tries hard.,1
"HARD professor. Doesn't care about you. Office hours are helpful however, you really need to ask a lot of questions. Her teaching style sucks. But for some course you can't get out of taking her. Avoid her if possible!",1
worst prof ever. Very hard grader. Wont answer your emails. Dosent teaches well. Worst ever. I would rather die instead of choosing him again. He do not care about his student's grades. Plz do not chose him.,0
"Professor Baum is super smart and a great teacher. Hes not very strict, and his class is pretty easy. Hes perfect for students that arent science majors because his lectures can be applied to real life and he realizes that science isnt the main focus for many students.",1
He is an excellent teacher but the work load is ridiculous also his tests are extremely difficult,0
"I looove the teacher she's actually good but the class was a catfish for me because its not as easy as it seems. I wanted a simple class in english to improve my english. if youre not that comfortable in english it might be hard. Sometimes i don't even get the questions for the participation note. Overall its actually interesting, i liked it tho.",1
"Possibly one of the worst classes I have taken. The reading material was confusing and beyond the level of many second year sociology students. He assigns 7 page essays 48 hours before they are due, and over weekends. Takes a while to respond to student questions on the class forum, if he chooses to respond at all. ",0
"I took this class in the summer as a hybrid- do the readings + pay attention in class and you'll pass easily. Thomas was a really nice guy, he always made himself available to answer questions and made lectures as interesting as possible. I would take his class again.",1
Easy class and somewhat easy exams. lots of questions that are never covered and are definitely trick questions. book is needed in class. four super easy assignments.,0
She is old lady and very unclear. By careful. Before taking her class ask me about her I will give you correct recommnedation of her.,0
"Very hard. Never had a problem here so far at UD except for this class.Be prepared for mini-tests, they count in the end. As for his tests, very unfair. Random questions that were never discussed and it is VERY detailed. Content is, yes, somewhat interesting but way too much for one test.",0
Pretty easy class as long as you can keep up with your certifications and do well on tests. There are around 40 hw lessons(60%) and 2 tests (40%). Ross is always there for help and replies almost instantly to questions. Good class and professor.,1
"Has too much unneccary information on powerpoint slides, reads off of them which makes this class super boring. Unorganized and scatterbrain because she is so into what she is teaching she wants to come every single detail!",0
"He is very smart; he has a unique style of teaching. He is friendly and wants his students to learn the material in depth. However, his tests can be challenging. Especially since each test is 20% of your grade and there are about 5 questions in each. Hence, doing the textbook problems is a good preparation for the tests. There's also extra credit.",1
"Hes a good teacher, but hes not understanding. If you suffer from medical issues on mental health issues, Id stay away.",0
This course is just for learning the software. ,0
"It was an 8-week course, each week you had 2 essays, a discussion board, and activities to be done on the online book. If you are taking other classes, family, and/or a job, skip the class.",1
Likes to play favourites with students on his good list(mostly suckups) and if you not on his good list 'watch out' (snake in the grass),0
he does not care whether students understand or not. He does not know how to explain himself in a clear way.,0
"tough class, great professor",1
I wanted to learn about foreign policy instead we learned about gender and social stuff. Is a bit snarky and elitist. Not always clear. Would avoid for foreign policy.,0
This guy is ridiculous! He is so boring in his lectures and his quizzes have nothing to do with the lectures. Quizzes and tests are way hard. If you get him as a prof drop immediately.,0
"Prof Rogness is a nice guy but be careful taking this class. It is purely on YOU to do well and teach yourself everything. Zero lectures are given and everything is done as a group (except exams) so if you are the type that needs a clear lecture, take a different prof. Exams are pretty difficult.",0
"Professor Mahon is great at engaging with students, he provides a lot of historical context with an in-depth look into arts. It's really interesting ideas, it's easy to be involved in class. He does require a lot of reading & writing but I think you'll end up leaving the class feeling like it provided insight & improved your own thinking.",1
"Professor Debrot is an overall nice person but as a Professor, terrible. He really puts his all into his lectures but takes the class too seriously for a gen ed. If your test answers are not worded the way he prefers to see, the answer is automatically wrong. Class is also extremely boring. Mostly readings for homework. Seriously do not take it.",0
"Please don't give yourself a heart attack by taking her, this is not fair in pandemic putting so much pressure on students and heavy test and tough in grading. So Big NO! just run away!",0
"Melvin Hall makes you read TONS of redundant material;  over 200 boring pages a week!  His tests have obscure questions that are hard to  answer.  The reading makes you fall asleep while slogging through it.  Avoid this teacher and EPS 550, Marisa Crowley (she uses his tons of reading  material ).  This class is NOT about learning.",0
Papen**** has absolutely NO idea what is going on in the world of education. Seems to know his stuff when it comes to Industrial Ed. but is a terrible teacher. Does not treat students equally.,0
"Chrissy is one of the absolute best professors at SDSU. Her class, Human Sexuality and Disease was also the most interesting class I have taken and I am in my 3rd year here at State. Cannot recommend her enough, seriously take this class if it counts or even just as a GPA booster! You won't regret it.",1
Professor Chandler shows up to class 15 minuets late everyday. He gives little instruction when it comes to papers. On the other hand if you talk to him about a grade and explain why you deserve a better grade and he will give it to you.,0
"Not a fan. She is a nice lady, but disorganized and not clear on her points.",0
Wells is very organized.  She uses a variety of teaching ads to help you understand the material.  If you struggle in math she'll boost your confidence for 110.  Do the homework and ask for help when you need it.  She encourages group work so make a friend!  May treat you like a child but you'll feel better about the material when she's finished.,1
"DONT TAKE HER, SHE IS NOT EASY AT ALL, AND NOT HELPFUL, SHE DONT EVEN HAVE OFFICE HOURS TO EXPLAIN THE MATERIAL OK. RUN 4 UR GRADE she is boring, not fair with grading, and the exams are tricky as hell. basically you got to study on your own cuz wateva she says in class is not helpful at all",0
"Lots of notes, pop quizzes suck, memorize the notes and go to class and you will do fine on the tests.",1
"Before building my timetable I looked at the reviews on Kerri, they all seemed too be good ones so I joined her class.  Let me just say that she is not only clear in explaining things, she is also attentive to questions, understanding to situations and is willing to help.  I definitely plan on enrolling in another class she is teaching. Great prof.",1
"Loved this man! I only took the class for a group D requirement but he actually got me interested in plant pathology. His 3 exams are tough, but he gives out study guides with all the info to study before each one. He's also so willing to help with questions to make sure everyone understands the content.",1
He's actually cool once he notices you're interested in the course. Don't even think about taking out your phone in the class. You're gonna get roasted.,1
"Frost is a really great lecturer. Just listening to him talk you can tell that he really enjoys teaching the class and talking about Informatics. He does a good job of explaining the material. The class itself isn't great, I found the material pretty boring and it can be vague with difficult tests, but Frost himself is very good.",1
"The worst professor ever! I took his online class and I learned nothing, not helpful at all. Totally just wasted my money and time. If you want to learn something, don't take his class.",0
"obnoxious, condescending, and unhelpful;  but importantly, he knows his stuff",0
"Great. Easy on scoring paper esp classwork and hw ->chance to get full credits. No stress in her class even when you're in a short term or summer session. Class: very comfortable. A lot of group discussion, which really helps in writing your papers bet",1
Il est un professeur absolument merveilleux. Il traite ses élèves comme des humains. J'ai énormément appris dans son cours mais il faut prendre la peine de réfléchir et de s'investir.,1
"Pop quiz , this is the worse thing can happens in this class. Don't worry, you will be fine with getting D in this class ez.",0
"I am a true history buff (and history major) with an extensive knowledge of the time period covered in this class, and I would still not recommend taking this class with this professor. There are absolutely no clear expectations, it is way too much work, even for a 7 week course, AND you can CLEP test out of it. Take the CLEP and save yourself.",0
Very hard to understand what he is saying because most of the time he is only talking to himself . Doesn't respond well when requested to repeat what he said.,0
She was a good professor. Definitely want to pay attention and take notes. Missed two classes and bombed one of my exams. Simple math with moderate concepts.,1
"Probably my least favorite professor I've ever had.  I took Comprehending Music Performance and the class was nothing like its description.  Lectures are boring, tests include nothing that he actually taught, and his textbook is ridiculously long and self-centered.  Never at his office hours and doesn't care about his students.",0
Great Guy... Very Helpful,1
"class was interesting, tests were very very hard, took the class in the summer and got a D.",1
I love her! She's an adorable Cuban! Her laugh is the cutest thing I've ever heard and keeps the class interesting.  She does a good job of teaching the class and the expectations are clearly laid out in the syllabus on a per class basis.  Highly recommended!,1
"Corrigan rocks.  He was not only a professor but a peer.  I've been out of school for a bit of time now, and I can still pop by his house when his sitting on his front porch.  He's the coolest.",1
"THE ABSOLUTE WORST PROF I HAVE EVER HAD. Do not take this class, he has made my stfx political science experience disgustingly horrible. If you sneeze, he gets angry, if you tap your foot, he gets angry. OH and if you miss class, dont bother to expect a good grade. He will penalize you for anything he can. POWER TRIPS. All your thought are useless",0
Lovric is amazing!,1
"She really needs a marking rubric or something that the student can use to figure out what they need to include to get full marks, every assignment with her felt like a guessing game and because the course has many small 1% assignments if she felt you didn't meet what she wanted it was a 0/1, these small 0% scores can add up by the end.",0
"Teacher wise she had no idea what was going on. On the first day of class she didn't even have a syllabus or class list printed out! She will give you homework in the textbook and then say ""i don't know what pages the stories are on"". Then she'll say ""oh yeah you have a essay due next class"". She didn't even tell us what it is about or how to do it",0
"Don't take SPA 361 online. She makes it ridiculously hard; not even in content, but in the sheer amount of work she gives. I was working on an assignment, and sometimes multiple assignments, every single day that this course was in session. In every other online summer course I've taken, I've had a max of 3-4 assignments due. Just don't do it.",0
very bad class,0
"Monika was so disorganized. The course structure was all over the place and so last minute. 90% of students in French112 were taking for language requirements - we don't want to be doing presentations in French, we just want to pass the class! Terrible, UBC needs to reassess language requirements.. ",0
Loved this guy. He knows his stuff and made a boring topic interesting. Plus he's easy to talk to and cares about the students. He went out of his way to check up on me after I had a family emergency during the week. LOVE THIS GUY!,1
"Brutally boring, trys to have a conversation with 250 students. Likes to preach her personal opinions without citing contradictory studies. To top things off, she was very unclear had inadequate notes so you were forced to write down everything she said and her exams were very difficult. I did very well but would never take another class with her.",0
I love him and his class. I learned so much and I would take any class from him in the future. Highly recommended!,1
"Probably the most boring person I have ever known. His classes put me to sleep, so I used them as a nap period. He drones on and on about things no one should have any interest in and class never gets out early even when everything has been said. There's minimal work, so it is easy, but beware you are selling your soul in return!",0
Dr. Deavor obviously loved teaching this class. It was incredibly cut and dry material but he did his best to make it interesting. He posted study guide and practice tests before each exam that were extremely helpful for the exams however the entire class was unprepared for the standardized final.,1
"Professor Debbage is wonderful, very helpful",1
"Mr. Velasco is a really nice teacher. Participation counts in his class, but it just feels like everyone is discussing ideas nothing drastic. He is really understanding and just use the study guides to prepare for the tests.",1
"Dr. Fontenot has knowledge, but he doesn't share it. He easily gets distracted and rambles about unrelated content, which resulted in the class being several weeks behind. He is late to class all the time, he will not stick to the syllabus, is an incredibly harsh marker, and is rude to students. I would avoid him unless you want a hard time.",0
"Great teacher!  He's really smart and can teach you a lot!  He definitely has his own sense of humor, which I like, but I can see why some maybe wouldn't.  He's super nice and helpful, just can't take him too seriously.  Overall, great class, not too much homework but a lot of reading.  I thought the reading was interesting, too, though.",1
"This woman is the devil.she gives no help. If u ask her what u did wrong her reply will be something ""like u don't listen or NO"".. All she dose is talk about herself. And expect you to know ever line of ever poem or story. I wrote a 8 page paper for her and she gave me a 58 on it and told me that was being generous. I asked what I do wrong her reply ""what didn't you do wrong now get out of my office"".. The lady is hart less.. Take her if you want a F-.",0
"Very enthusiastic, energetic lecturer.  Doesn't provide slides but writes good notes.  Helpful and answers questions well.",1
He is a nice guy but his tests are hard... If u show up to class and do all the extra credit you can escape with a low c or high D.... lol Good luck,0
This class would have been fine if trying to turn in work wasn't so hard. She allowed everyone to redo this one assignment and I went to turn in the redo I couldn't because she somehow graded my redo when I haven't even turned it in yet. Come to find out she graded the original one I turned in already before she even let us do a redo it. Ignored,0
"Professor Koehler obviously has a lot of experience teaching 292 and knows what helps students understand difficult concepts. He uses lots of examples and the sample quizzes are invaluable study material. As long as you put in the effort, you will do well.",1
"If you go to study session you will get an A in the class, he gives you the whole test at this time.",1
"BEST TEACHER EVER. He is so caring and sweet and wants everyone to pass. First thing he said at the beginning of class: ""nobody is failing this class"". Very easy class and makes interesting relations to personal stories. He tells you exactly what is important for midterm and final. Take him!!!",1
"He had some pretty cheesy math jokes.  Also, he liked to explain the history of what we were learning.  However, that was all he explained.  He didn't explain anything that he did which was hard for someone who hadn't taken a Calc class before.  Also, his weekly quizzes were different from what we did homework on and studied in class.",0
Rick is a good guy. He means well but does very few examples in class. Assignments are very long and tests are very lengthy and a lot of the substance on midterms is much more advanced than the examples done in class and in the textbook. I would probably not choose Rick again.,0
"Really charming guy, definitely makes class interesting. Attendance isn't mandatory but he doesn't post notes online so you'll miss a lot of concepts if you don't go. It's definitely a challenging course, but if you go to class and actually put effort into it, you'll do fine!",1
"I have never felt more inclined to rate a class and a professor than I do now that I endured this class with Dr. Gitomer. I am a science major and this class required far more hours of my time than any upper level Bio course or Chem course I've taken. DO NOT take this class, he assigns so much work that it detracts from actually learning the topic.",0
"By far the best teacher I had at RCBC. There is no professor funnier than him. Has no problem explaining things to you, likes to make jokes. Anyone who can take a good joke should take his class, everyone had a nickname in my class, everyone did something funny through the semester and got called out on it! I'd sit through his class again anytime!",1
"Wow! Lesley is a total pro. I checked other photo classes at DeAnza that were too easy then came here, saw Lesley's great ratings, so I took her. She is a kind teacher and really cares about you doing your best on every project. If you need help, she is right there with expert advice. She wants everyone to do well. Take it, you will learn a lot.",1
"Class is very unorganized to the point where self-researching the quiz/test topics is where I actually learned anything. Tons of topics that are tested on and required to know yet only briefly mentioned in class, so studying for tests became looking up all the given 'key terms' on wikipedia. Lectures skip around and make no cohesive sense.",0
"Dr. Green is caring, genuine, wise, and helpful. He has high expectations for his students and works with them to improve.",1
"Very nice teacher with fun stories. Does his best to teach and goes over everything till most understand. Get old tests to study for tests!!! Many questions are repeated. If you have a borderline grade, he will usually help you out. Best organic teacher at Clemson!",1
"Took the Hybrid course fall 2019 and really enjoyed his class. It started out a little rough, but that was due to the book having missprints. If you pay attention to his lectures he gives you the answers to your lab word for word. He truly tries to help his students but you have to pay attention. Would take his class again in a heartbeat.",1
"If you want a AMAZING prof who literally gives you the answers for labs and boosts your average just for showing up to class then take this class. Also the midterm is pretty easy if you understand the content and read slides, do notes and do the labs again. Exam is only a bit difficult because he does half and another prof does the other half.",1
"I don't usually review on here because people like to complain even when there isn't a solid reason . Dr. Duplass however, is the worst professor I've ever had. His grading is arbitrary(ignores rubrics), his teaching materials and quizzes are riddled w/ errors, and he is over entitled. If you can avoid him, do yourself a favor.",0
"I suggest ignoring the other responses because I read them and thought it was a good idea to take the class and I regret it. He comes to class late all the time, never answers emails, is a horrible grader, and doesn't rely on his syllabus at all. I feel bad this is so negative but it's sadly the truth. He made this semester brutal.",0
"Test are all take home, doesn't get much better than that.  He really enjoys teaching and it makes going to class not that painful.",1
Horrible teacher. There is no reason why he should be teaching. I learned more from the online tutorial than in class. Rude and inconsiderate. DO NOT REGISTER FOR JOHNSON.,0
one of the worst prof I have ever had in my life. makes the exam super long on purpose.,0
"Professor Feng is not a bad teacher, this class is just terrible. Unless you LOVE black and white movies and their history, you will hate this class. The movies are unbelievably boring, and all you do in class is take notes from his power points. Exams are really tough so DO NOT take if you're only looking for an easy A.",1
"Don't let this 100 level course fool you! Lecture power points are VERY confusing. Test questions are very tricky and confusing. Dr. Nochera had to leave half way through the semester, and Professor house took over. TAKE PROFESSOR HOUSE! Her exams were so much easier, tests were straightfoward, her class is an easy A.",0
"Taking his online astronomy class and is the hardest thing Ive done since Ive been in college. The book doesnt do a good job and explaining the math problems, and when u get a question wrong it doesnt give u the right answer , or explain why u got it wrong.",0
"Very good professor! His lectures are a tad bit long and boring but he REALLY knows what he's talking about! He's an easy grader, and is very passionate about what he's teaching. I would totally take him again.",1
"I had a rough experience in 101 and 105 during my freshman year, so I wasn't looking forward to taking this class.  It turns out that this class was my favorite this semester!  Mr. Martin, is knowledgeable and cares about his students.  His classes are fun, and he is a great guy.  I recommend him to everyone!",1
"Doctor Olson was one of my favorite professors I've ever had. He is a real gem of a person; very genuine, kind, and unique in personality. His grading was solely based on tests, but as long as you attend most of the lectures and study what he highlights on the lecture notes, you should be good to go. Could not recommend him more.",1
"Take him if and only if you really want to get knowledge. Its not an easy A class. Instead of answering a ? directly, hell talk abt all stuffs related to that topic. The study guide n hw are useless cause theyare from the department, not for his class. Use practice problems n mock ex + pay attention on what he says to be important.",1
Great professor and really cares about her students. Lecture slides are very very long. She gave us like 4 free quiz grades. The study guides for the test were usually helpful except for one.,1
"Challenging class, great professor! Take Cole's GEO111 class in the summer if you can. Field trips were a blast! Yes, the material is hard, but prof Cole (and Mrs. Cole) are nice people and are more than willing to help you out. Prof Cole may not be the best teacher ever but is VERY knowledgeable and VERY enthused about his subject.",1
"Although this prof has been here for over 40 years, he's probably one of the best profs I have been taught by. This man is a literally a gem. He says ""grades do not define learning"" and basically passes you if he see's that you are trying. I do recommend sitting near the front as his voice is not that loud. Amazing prof, easy A if you put in work.",1
"Bill was an awesome prof, I really respect him.  His course load is pretty  light, however take these assignments seriously as they are each weighted heavily.  He gives plenty of opportunity for personal insight in his paper and is a fair marker.  Using scripture and references from the book gets you a good mark.  For exams, study the terminology!",1
"Dr. Flinn is a very nice man who genuinely wants his students to succeed. Has very good notes, and very fair tests with a lot of bonus marks everywhere. Assignments are a lot of work, but more than prepare you for tests. The only bad thing is he can be a little boring in class. Textbook is very unnecessary.",1
"Medhi is clearly passionate about teaching, but his grading style is a bit harsh and he is a bit odd. Very personal and touchy with everyone. TA grades most of our assignments and she grades very strict. I did well in the class but it took a while to get accustomed to the style of writing the TA clearly wanted.",1
Very nice and caring teacher and person. She will go out of her way to help you with personal problems or school problems. NUMBER 1.,1
Had Him for Modern Social Problems (2111). Enjoyed the class and was SUPER easy if you read the book and took notes. One of the classes where you'd need to enjoy the subject to take it and be interested; I imagine that most who gave bad ratings to him were people  who didn't enjoy Sociology and just took it for requirements,1
"Funny, knowledgable, little bit snarky, will help you.",1
His exams are super hard and gives extra credit but its not enough. Rewatch lectures multiple times to pass,0
"Dr. Deason was great! She is very quirky, funny, and a little bit awkward but is a great professor. She gives crystal clear examples in lecture, the exams area cake walk if you study the study guides, and Dr. Deason is very helpful if you need her. The class was interesting and Dr. Deason kept students' attention with videos and statistics.",1
Gives homework on stuff he was not able to cover in class. Expects you to get 100% of homework done or he'll give you F on your midterm.  Dropped class & fighting to get my money back which is a pain with Delta.,0
"Professor Sabol is a great teacher who knows what he is talking about. He assigns three papers throughout the course that he expects to be approximately 10 pages long, if not longer. In this course you will definitely have to earn your grade, it will not be handed to you. ",1
"Do NOT take this professor if you do not like harsh/uncalled for feedback, lots of assignments, very little time to do each assignment, and a bad attitude towards students. She does NOT care that you have other courses she treats you like graduate students. She is so anal about APA and every detail it'll drive you insane. BEWARE OF HER AT ALL COSTS",0
"Great Prof! By the sounds of it, people in upper years like him, and all the new f_gs in first year don't like him. It's their fault for being such jabronies. As long as you're literate in English you'll be fine, does involve A LOT of reading, but that's about it.",1
Not a good teacher at all,0
"Greatest way of teaching. He makes everything easy to understand. You just need to take notes what he said in the lectures and search online for what you confuse, don't need to read the textbook. Always care about his students and he is willing to review materials with you by all means, phone call, email, or even drop by his house.",1
Thanks Tim for a great semester!,1
"This professor was not great. She does not give good feedback, and when she does give feedback, it is vague (""Maybe you should work on this some more."") Also, she wastes a lot of class time. It takes her about 30 minutes just to get through the announcements, which should take about 5. Her lectures are redundant, but the information is useless.",0
Words cannot describe how horrible this class is.She is completly unprofessional and dedicated in a cultish way to a belief system that shapes the entire class. readings were absurd and yoga useless. ruined the entire discipline for me. i am ashamed that a university like Duke supports this kind of shoddy teaching. AVOID AT ALL COSTS,0
"take him if you hate yourself, or if you want to master organic chemistry and willing to work don't take him if you want to pass",1
"Ms. Nuneville is truly one of the most amazing people I've ever met. I'm so glad I got the opportunity to take her class this semester. If you want a teacher that cares about you, take her class. I never opened my book, so don't buy one. She provides all the information you'll need for the tests in her lectures, which she provides on blackboard.",1
"Dry personality, sounds like the Clear Eyes guy.  Put me to sleep a good portion of the time if I didn't have my coffee.  REALLY IMPORTANT READ THE BOOK OR FAIL! TAKE NOTES OR FAIL! Attendance is necessary for his extensive notes.",0
This the first programming course I ever took and the way the course was organized worked very well for me. The sessions in class were very helpful and when I got stuck the lab tutors were also able to help me out.,1
"Worst class in the MBA program! You could spend every waking minute during the semester trying to read all the material he throws at you, and you'd still run out of time. Assignments are intentionally vague because that's how the real world is in his mind. As a result you're left frustrated and confused. Painful, zero learning, AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!",0
Funny Guy,1
Really knows what he is talking about and saves you money by not making you by a textbook. If you go to class and take good notes you will do really well in his class.,1
"She's awful!!!!! I had an online class with her. Slow response, & because she wouldn't response quickly to my email. I would do homework incorrectly & endedup getting a bad grade.  She's awful!",0
My mentor and hero. No better professor do i know. He put me on this path i'm on now. Awesome.,1
"Jon is the best professor I had all semester. He gave fantastic feedback on all the essays I wrote, I earned 2-3 points of extra credit on all in-class writings, as well as all in-class work. I wrote 6 out of class essays, and no homework (except the usual discussion boards every week). He is an absolutely fantastic professor.",1
I had Bruce Mann in 2001 and to this day I still brag about him. He always knew how to capture his audience and make them interested in what was being taught. For that I am forever grateful.,1
"Overall, she knows her stuff.  You have to work for a good grade, but she's not a hard grader most of the time. Most of the weight rests on journals, and one of her exams is take-home. Reading is a must in her class, as is participation. Talk and do the assignments on time and you'll be fine (she even allows rewrites).",1
hes tests are SUPER easy... you dont even have to show up to class just do textbook questions!!,0
"He is one of the best profs ever. He made class very fun and his style of learning is out of this world. He is the best prof I have ever had and he doesn't even use any notes for teaching, which clearly proves how much he knows the subject. He is always willing to help and if you study hard, you will get exceptional results.",1
"He talks in a monotone voice, but he knows his stuff, and has a lot of ideas. You have to dress out sometimes but it is fun to play the games he has, one project which broken into parts, and only 3tests the whole semester including the final. GOOD GOOD TEACHER!!!!",1
"She is a very nice lady, shows interest in her students, and grades fairly. (Not always easy to find in the EGR department). There is a fair amount of reading but the homework does not take that long. She is very passionate about her work and is incredibly knowledgeable. Overall I enjoyed the class.",1
Lectures are boring and it is a waste of time to take this class. Very boring and he teaches us concepts that are beyond introductory course levels. Do not take this class if you want to save your GPA.,0
Will lecture you for the entire duration of the class and is extremely boring. He does not make class interesting and is extremely tough when grading papers. I do not recommend him.,0
"I didn't ever meet him. He left his class to a TA who made the class absolutely miserable. There is no professionalism whatsoever. I would have been nice to have an actual professor teaching this lab course, or at least having more of a handle on the way the TA was teaching. She was so condescending and rude people refused to ask questions.",0
"DO NOT TAKE KURT LUDKWICK!!! The class was EXTREMELY boring and he was very confusing. The only reason I did well in the class was because I took AP Calc in high school. But I had to teach myself everything that I didn't know. The homework is a lot harder than anything he actually does teach. Practically fell asleep every class, but do not take!",0
"She is the best prof. @ MU. hands down. Having graduated MU and out int he teaching field, soooo much of what she tells you is relevant!  pay attention and you will learn so much.  MU needs to hire more profs like sissy! sign up for any class she is teaching and you will benefit greatly!",1
He is incredibly disorganized. He shows up to class late 3-4 times a semester. He doesn't communicate with the people teaching recitations whatsoever. The exams are graded differently depending upon what section you're in ( F in one section  B in another section). At the end of the year no one respected him and he completely deserved it.,0
very nice teacher. i just hate french!,1
"Brian Jones is not only an excellent professor, he is an excellent person. He is so kind, understanding, and encouraging. Physics is tough especially for those who have never taken it and he breaks it down. GO TO TILT TO DO YOUR HOMEWORK. It will save you. Also practice practice practice & write down everything you possibly can on exams for points.",1
McBane is awesome! He loves chemistry and encourages me to love it even more! The best professor of my freshman year!,1
"fake. mean, no matter what she will always find a way to make u feel small",0
"Wes is wonderful. He seems a bit scattered, but that's because he's busy trying to make the school a better place for the students. He grades mostly on effort, so if you show up and turn everything in, you'll do fine. If you need structure and strict deadlines though, do not take this. He will take assignments for full credit the last day of class.",1
Useless lectures. practice a lot do the problems at least 5 times for both books,0
Take Dr. K.  I would take him again.  Read material & you will past. You need the book and the exams are sort of hard.  Take note of weekly sessions because he locks them each week.  The notes will be helpful during exam time.  Awesome professor,1
"Raph is one crazy guy, but he knows what hes talkin about. dont act like you know more then him...cause i don,t, and you'll get owned!",1
"i was surprised to see such good ratings. i have had him for several classes. everyone i have talked to can't stand him. his style of teaching is horrible. he just scribbles on an overhead and tries to be funny, but is just annoying and wastes time. everything i learned, i taught myself. he may be a ""love him or hate him"" type i guess.",0
"Nice prof, maybe he isn't good at lecturing, but he certainly is helpful.",1
"In a perfect situation Duncan would be a great teacher. He interacts with the class, seems friendly and is very intelligent.  But the reality is, he takes things personally, a very bad characteristic for someone in a position to educate.  Once he aligns himself against you, consider avoiding him at all costs and not depending on him for help.",1
"This professor is passive aggressive, rude, and is irritated quickly. His attitude shows through the emails I received asking a question. In class he doesn't teach, you have to do the textbook readings he assigns and learn from them on your own. He's also very picky on explanations in problem sets and doesnt teach you how he wants you to explain it",0
"He lectures most of the time, and his tests are based on that. It was a hard time following and he got off track way too much. Take at your own risk!",1
"Extremely arrogant, expects far too much of students. his sarcasm levels very often reach offensive levels, comparing poor programmers in the class to the engineers of the space shuttle Columbia. Seems to think that students aren't taking other courses.",0
"Nice woman, but discusses things of little relevance to the subject matter. Helps brainstorm paper topics, which is beyond valuable for the papers, but most of the discussion section consisted of awkward silences as responses to useless questions. Add feminist elements in your paper to up your grade.",0
"Pretty easy class, easy homework, and easy exams.  Nice woman, but she is technologically challenged.  Funny somtimes, but it got annoying.",1
Boring class. Simnet test can be very difficult at beginning. Double check before submitting. Easy A if you study and complete all work.,0
"Dr. Feldman is very intelligent and knows it. She expects the best you can give. Her grading is harsh, but her feedback is incredible. If you pay attention and participate, you'll pass.",1
"Horrible prof, super unhelpful. Please understand my feeling. Very hard marker",0
"He literally never shuts up, either about geology or stuff that doesn't matter. Tests are stupid long and have questions that aren't relevant to the subject matter and questions that don't seem to matter at all. He grades really heavy on the tests too. Getting one thing wrong for multiple answer questions tanks the grade.",0
Professor Thomas-Reid is one of my favorite professors yet at App State. He does not give tests and we only had to write easy 250 word reflections throughout the semester. He is accessible outside of class and really cares for your education. He is always looking for ways to improve himself which shows what type of educator he strives to be.,1
"While she is a wonderful speaker, who is really interested in her work, her essay topic leave no room for creativity and the TA's she chooses stick!!!! Janna in particular was unhelpful and horribly hard, she ruined shakespeare for me, and my one qualm with Ms. Hanson is taht she didn't help me, she supported Janna though she knew she was wrong.",0
"Went to most classes, which were extremely hard to follow. Studied very hard for both exams and did not do well on either. Asked for help in his office hours, but did not receive any direction or guidance. Was very interested in law before, but now am not confident that I can pursue the field.",0
"This guy probably changed my life. The material is super interesting, but if you read the same books (primary sources only) without the wisdom and experience of this guy, you'll miss 80% of the point. I sure did before this class. If you're motivated and genuinely interested in broadening your mind, there's no one else I can recommend more.",1
"Dr. Colbert is wonderful. Sh is responsive to students and so encouraging. While 2000 is not an easy course, she makes it enjoyable. Discussion allows you to rack up marks.",1
learned more from watching videos online. poor lectures. very disappointed that i had to pay for this class. I wouldn't recommend a fellow student take a class taught by this dude if my life depended on it. horrible experience.,0
Be on time and do your work and you will get an A,1
Best teacher ever!!! Her lectures were so fun. She was very accessible outside of class. She really wanted to help her students. She created morning meetings before our speech days to boost our confidence and help us succeed. Her feedback on our speeches was helpful. She made me a much better speaker. I wish all of my teachers were Mrs. Ferguson!,1
"nice man, excellent professor, keeps material interesting.",1
Easy class with clear expectations. Grade is made up of exams and launchpad homework which can be found in the book or Quizlet. Exams are taken out of class on lockdown browser and can be done within a week or so timeframe. there's extra credit available in each unit which is 60 points altogether. There are no papers which was nice. decent class.,1
"If highly interested in Existentialism, and willing to spend a great deal of time reading, then this is the perfect course for you.  A stellar lecturer, not only does he explain the reading, but provides real-world examples that help clarify the subject, and his passion for existentialism shines through in class.  Challenging and thought-provoking!",1
"more difficult than a 200 level class should be, but if you attend lecture and pay attention, it really isn't as difficult as everyone makes it out to be. subject matter can be boring, even though dillery is very enthusiastic.",1
"David Gray is a good professor and he is very funny. However, his content on brightspace is disorganized and his lectures are extremely difficult to understand. As someone who has never taken macroeconomics and struggles with math; his lectures and way of teaching made it hard for me to learn anything.",1
"Joe is extremely helpful and knows what he is doing.  He is easy to talk to and is happy to answer questions.  His tests are hard, though, which hurt my grade.",1
Online class due to COVID: Lecture heavy and based off her website which is not laid out properly. Not clear and very confusing terms and definitions. Tests are very hard and not just ctrl+f if doing online. Very picky marker - wrote a 23 pager with detailed sources and got a 50%. Had office hours through zoom - if you don't attend you will fail.,0
"A total jerk in no other sense of the word. In the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, Jeffrey required students to record themselves at home taking tests, stated himself he will fail students for typos made, and stated that if you solve a math problem in any way other than what is thought - which is very possible if you use some tutoring  fail",0
"Lots of assignments, tough to understand. Lectures are also tough to understand. He is available to students and will go over stuff with you if you take the time to ask him.",0
Gosh he was boring. What he went over in class was nothing what he put on the test. I fell asleep in class which i have never done before because he is so borring,0
"Often late or not in class. Most of semester was in-class activities then in last month had 2 group papers/presentations, 5 homework assignments, and 2 exams. No plan and not clear in directions or answering questions. Changed 20pt extra credit to 40pt regular assignment without telling us. Late grader, did get an A but do not recommend.",0
"Excellent lecturer and gives many good examples.  However, does not help out much if you need to talk to him outside of class.  Discourages out-of-class contact.  Also, a fluid mechanics final exam with 88% of the marks multiple choice/T,F seems extreme.  It is an indication of laziness.",0
"There is so much reading for this class.  His lectures don't really coincide with them, either.  His midterm and final are short answer and essay.  He gives the prompt a week before the test.  The term paper was annoying.  Discussions aren't exactly mandatory, but they're helpful.",0
"I dont really understand why he has a good rating here. His slides are abstract and confusing. In the midterm he put questions which were pretty much impossible to do with the material he gave us. Also he is lazy af. It feels like he rushes content so he can go home asap. Lastly, he has some attitudes which makes you not wanna ask any questions.",0
"Her method of teaching just doesn't work. She makes you do a ""case study"" for probably a third of the semester that's strictly group work. She does little to no actual teaching and expects you to come to class having already taught yourself the material. Definitely the worst prof and class I've had. I like micro but she makes it hard to like.",0
good riddens!!!!!!!!!!!,0
"I survived this class but I have many friends who did not. He does things his own way, a way that focuses less on concepts and more on formulae and notation. Be prepared to learn the course from the textbook because he can barely teach either. Smart guy though",0
"Barb is wonderful, even if this class is a little too in depth for an intro class.  You really have to be interested in the information to pay attention to lectures but she always has the slide shows up before hand.  As long as you study exactly what is on the review sheet and do the discussions/essays you'll do fine",1
"Fossett is a great guy, but his class is rough. Very lecture heavy, he usually goes over class time continuing with new topics. He will fill every last minute of class time with lecture, so prepare for topics to be started one class and finished a week later. He doesn't explain some things well, leading to a lot of confusion. Wouldn't recommend.",0
Just like to make a note to whoever said she was interesting to listen to... Pee Wee Herman was interesting to listen too!,0
"Dr. Bob is one of the best professors here! He really knows what he's talking about and is super excited to teach. Gives tons of extra credit if you show up to class. Tests are open book with a cheat sheet. He sends an email after class with the days notes. Plus he has a make up exam to replace your lowest score. Easy, interesting honors lab.",1
"I absolutely LOVED this class. Patricia is so sweet, and half of the class is just playing games from childhood. Also a bit of making up scenes and getting to know each other. Projects are not hard, it's easy to get a good grade. Minimal reading just from the coursepack, but that's just to help on the 2 exams. Great class, great professor! :)",1
"This class entails a lot of reading various poems, short stories, and a few books. Each class is typically a group discussion, lead by the teacher, and any student can participate. If you truly read all the required assignments, you will do well in the class. He is a fair grader and gives great feedback on the assignments",1
"Her class is very interesting but her tests are tricky. half class notes, half book and she includes A LOT of chapters for just one exam. one paper that's really easy, just summarize a research study. Reading is a MUST for the exams but luckily our class had google doc's for her study guides.",1
He is the best math teacher I ever had. he goes through the questions with you and he grades paper well,1
Professor Squire is an awesome guy and very knowledgeable. His classes are never the most rigorous but he's often teaching electives so they don't have to be. Exams are multiple choice and coding projects are very manageable. If you're swamped with classes and need to fit in a CS elective any Squire class will be a joy to take.,1
"Great prof. very approachable. if class weren't at 8:30 in the morning i would definately find his jokes more funny. exams are tough, although it is a stats course he really gets most people on conceptual questions.",1
Prof. Jager is a great lady and advisor/professor. She can be tough at times but shes really caring and wants her students to succeed. Most of this class was a group client project and some reading. Class schedule was pretty flexible which was a little confusing sometimes but overall not bad. Would definitely take her classes again.,1
"Midterms were decent and came straight from the class notes and examples posted online. Exam was harder. He's very unclear in his lectures, very unhelpful in his office hours and very unprofessional when emailing. Not hard to do well, but only if the textbook becomes your best friend",0
This man is a genius and really cares about his students.,1
I wish all professors be like him,1
"Dr. Jansen is an amazing prof! His lectures are super interesting and very easy to follow, he breaks big concepts down to understand them easily. I had him for Poli1000 and he inspired me to continue taking political science courses, I am currently in his Poli2610. I would recommend taking any class with him if you get the chance!",1
"i can see how this would be a great class in person but online wasn't great. It's read from the textbook then do the quiz, no notes, no lectures, no pre-recorded lectures. not impressed by this course delivery for online because of covid.",0
Super cute. Super nice. Lots of boring text book readings but if you do them you'll get an A. Saw him a lot for office hours and he was very helpful.,1
"Dr. Corcoran is by far my favorite professor I have taken at PSU. She is incredibly intelligent, caring, and absolutely hilarious. I have never been more inspired in my entire life to follow my passions, and she has motivated me to minor in Indigenous Nations Studies. I can't say enough about her-- take her classes, you won't regret it.",1
"Tests come from the HW and class examples.  The homework is sort of difficult, but he is always willing to help.  GO TO HIS OFFICE HOURS!!! He really cares about you making a good grade, and will see that you do so as long as you come to class and give your best effort!",1
"He seems like such a nice guy, it's hard not to like him as a person, but as a prof, he is really not clear and heavy ont he tricky wording for exams. No matter how hard you work, this class is frustrating and unclear at best.",0
Great professor! Definitely very knowledgable on the topics discussed in class. Tests are fair as well.,1
One of the most amazing teachers I have ever had in my college career!! I would come back to NGU just to take another class with her!,1
"Everything is pretty much automated.  Very little interaction with teacher, but she expects students in her online class to meet up with up to 6 other people to record essays.",0
"Class is lecture only, but very interesting! If you don't come to class you probably won't get an A, though you may pass. He will write down what you need to know but anything he says is fair game on a test, so pay attention! No homework; grade is based on test scores. If you have any interest in music you will ENJOY this class and instructor!",1
"As long as you do the readings, this class is a breeze, but Zelikow's lectures are some of the best at UVA",1
"SO. MUCH. WORK. She's a nice lady but she has got to relax with the assignments. I never got above and 85% on any of the reflections, which is ridiculous because it's MY takeaway from the readings. There was 3 major presentations, all of which she gave us very little time. She's not awful but avoid if you have a busy schedule",1
"Dr. Fitzpatrick is good at relaying the ""heady"" material into layman's terms, but the class is still not super easy. The reading journals are the worst! I do not like philosophy, but I would recommend the class if you need a PL class.",1
"The man is a GPA killer. Dont not take! Please.. unless you want to hear him ramble. He explains the material his way and not by the book! He gives us notes, yes, but he literally hand write them and scans them onto blackboard...",0
"The textbook is by far the best resource you can have in this course. Prof. Plett teaches out of the coursepack, which is rife with errors, typos, and general unhelpfulness in most sections. This isn't his fault, but his lectures are dry and he doesn't manage the class, ie it's very loud and he does nothing about it. Friendly and approachable.",1
I'm an A+ student and barely passed this class. He changed the weighting of our midterm to be worth more after the class average was 51%. Marking was 50M/50F. His slides focus on content that isn't tested and convolute the content you need to know. The only reason I passed is because he posted previous exams. He is unsympathetic and a harsh marker.,0
"I went into her class terrified because of all the bad reviews, but it ended up being one of my favorite classes. The class is interesting if you pay attention (which you have to because she is speaking French the entire lecture). She will call on people randomly but as long as you don't care if you have the correct answer, she won't care either.",1
"Annoying voice, messy notes, doesn't grade consistently.",0
Shimko is probably the best lecturer I've had. Lectures are well prepared and interesting. The class is graded on three non-comprehensive tests. If you show up and listen you should be able to pass the class.,1
Seems like a decent person however her lectures go by slow. She just drones on for most of the hour making it hard to pay attention. Most everyone didn't even show up to class despite her passing around an attendance sheet each day. Study before each test. You don't get many of them so every point is important.,0
"As a professor, she knew what she was talking about and made class entertaining with humor and personal stories, however, she was a very hard grader. Don't expect to get much sympathy from her either. I had a traumatic death in the family last year and I didnt get so much as a ""sorry for your loss"", let alone any help with receiving notes missed",1
"This class is VERY good and VERY time consuming.  You will have to put a lot into it but you will recieve a lot out of it.  Try and pair this class with other easy classes in your schedule.  Kimoto will help whenever you ask- make sure to ask questions.  She is energetic and at times hard to follow, but she wants her students to do well.",1
"An extremely easy professor but doesn't care about your grades. I worked my butt off and a friend of mine who didn't show up and never opened the textbook  got the same grade as me. He is definitely a little old, but non-professor-wise he's a good guy. Not sure I'd take a class of his again though.",0
"The teacher is nice, but he is a dork.  The class is easy as long as you attend class.  He is very concerned with class attendance.  An easy A...",1
"TAKEN FALL 2017 AS A PROGRAMMER AND COMP SCI MAJOR After taking this professor for one semester, I highly recommend that IF YOU ARE NOT A COMP SCI MAJOR/ EXTREMELY INTO PROGRAMMING, THIS CLASS WILL BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. His quizzes are rigorous and his projects are twice as hard. I love programming and can attest that this class is difficult",0
"There are countless negative reviews on here reporting the exact same thing for a reason, DO LISTEN to them. Linda acts extremely annoyed when asked to do any work and will attack students who do so. She rushes through her PowerPoints in about 5 minutes and that is all she is willing to do. Rude & insecure person, please avoid if possible.",0
shes terrible an boring.  reads mostly off the slides but know a lot...are tests are ridiculous and she does need to calm down when it comes to papers,0
Awesome prof!Really enjoyed the course.,1
"This was years ago (1999), but I thought he was extremely boring in Organismal Biology.  I guess they've changed all the course numbers now though.",1
"Very arrogant. He gives tests that only an electrical major would know how to do, not first-year students.  When asked for help, he treats the student as if they're stupid. Avoid at all costs.",0
This is possible the best online class I have ever had. His recorded lectures gave the in class experience.,1
"She is an awesome professor, very enthusiastic and passionate about the material.  It is a hard class but if you work for it, you can do well. She really developed my overall understanding of accounting. Absolutely the best professor I have had at Holy Cross.",1
"The podcasts are a little underwhelming - he doesn't quite explain the material that well. He does NOT respond to emails and can be quite unhelpful during office hours. I would recommend taking the campus version (CHEM 212) in the winter instead. The assignments are fair, but he takes forever to mark them - I actually still don't know what I got.",0
"He's hilarious and makes research methods fun, somehow. He's also a really great teacher. Do homework, study, and as long as you're not awful at math you'll do well.",1
"Amazing professor probably the best I've ever had, he cares about his students and if you're not doing well he will help you even more. The material sucks because it's coding so it's not just a walk in the park, but if you don't like coding then don't major or minor in MISY.",1
"Lectures are funny, I'll give him that but he really screws people over on the midterms and exams. He pulls questions from way out of the box for the tests, which is fine if only he gave enough time to figure them out and  think about them! Not enough assignments to distribute your mark and funny enough it was the only class without course eval",0
Très dur à suivre. Se perd souvent dans ses idées. Ses examens sont mal corrigés/construits. Il est dur à rejoindre/à rencontrer. Ne suit pas son plan de cours.,0
"I had him for pols 130 and 490. I guarantee you that if i had him some of my other poli sci classes I would have a really gpa by now. But, because of pricks like Old and Hora I have a mediocre gpa. I absolutely love Prof. Lin, he is very understanding, sweet, and intelligent. I would encourage all poli sci majors to take him.",1
By far the greatest math teacher ever.,1
"Be ready to read the book, the online quizzes he makes them very difficult, and you are graded from two in class exams, five online quizzes and one country essay. Lectures are long and boring.",0
Very difficult professor. If you do not always do your hw or attend class then do NOT take him. You have to be very serious about passing the class from the beginning to do well. Do EVERY hw assignment and try to ALWAYS attend class bc they count for so much more than they shld. Nice guy but very very tough.,0
Don't like this pro at all,0
"Excellent Professor! This professor can take you to the next level in your writing, so take advantage of his feedback, enjoy the class, pay attention and you will excel.",1
very boring lecture. does not teach concepts well.,0
"Never replies to emails, never clear about assignments, never clear with tests, terrible lecturer",0
Great professor! He loves what he teaches and I've always disliked statistics but I finally understood it in his class. The tests are part take and part in class. Tests aren't super easy but he tries to give you as many points as possible for your work. Fair grader. No textbook. He didn't drag out the class and was always happy!,1
This is a great class. As long as you call in for the weekly conference calls he pretty much gives you the answers. Very flexible & will work with you if you need an extension on an assignment. Very responsive to emails and questions. I would take more classes from him. I didn't like law before I took this class but now I am making law my focus.,1
I got an A but that still doesnt help the fact that I had to work my butt off to pass. Everything that was taught didn't make sense so i had to learn it myself or work with other students. Very dissapointed in my education thus far.,0
This man is a joke.,0
told me she'd fail me to my face. Nice lady,0
Awesome course. Her notes were really clear and easy to refer back to when doing the problem sets. She gave us a bunch of practice midterms and finals which made a big difference. Super busy prof but she made our class the priority if we had questions outside of the lecture,1
He would do experiments or solve problems in class &would forget everyone on zoom couldn't see. He would send us into breakout rooms to work on assignments during class which was a waste of time b/c many students didn't participate. His grading is awful & assignments are hard to understand. Exam next week not on the schedule. GA wasn't a good tutor,0
"She does not teach any of the material she requires you to know. There are quizzes almost every class and the rest of the class consists of her asking useless repetitive questions to everyone in the class. She's very hard to follow and is so incredibly disorganized. If you don't have a strong spanish background, don't take her.",0
"She is cool and hip. Don't be annoying, who doesn't hate annoying people.... She is a pretty easy grader, as long as you take your time you'll most likely get an A. Don't turn things in late she notices her students and doesn't appreciate it. She does however praise the good students. Makes you feel good. Great way to start my freshman year!!!",1
"I would not recommend taking Benevento for creative writing if you want a blowoff class. He expects his students to participate and learn how to write more effectively. Classes are largely writing workshop style, but you also discuss reading material in class. He's a great guy and pretty encouraging. Definitely good to take for English majors.",1
"Do not take this guy! Cannot speak english! Grading is messed up, he makes sure that 4 people get 99 and then makes the rest of the class fall somewhere behind. Unless you have taken some type of programming before, you will not understand him. He promised me an 82, one week before the exam. Told me not to worry about the exam. I failed the class!",0
"As an Accounting Major, i thought this class had no relevance to the curriculum. than being said, he is not extremely clear in his lectures, and his tests are tough. homework is online using MyAccountingLab (yikes). He is EXTREMELY helpful in office hours. ",1
"I love you Peter Shippy!  He offers good critique on poetry, and creates a friendly and yet honest environment that does NOT coddle, but tries to construct.  He's gentle when he says something sucks.",1
"I took his computer vision class because I was very interested in the subject, but I did not get what I expect from the class. Lectures were very disorganized, he will keep jumping between slides, project are easy to do if you are good in programing. Exams are very tough, plus he will curve down grades if too many people did good in the class.",0
"Like others have mentioned, the material itself is easy, but she made it really hard by giving a ridiculous amount of homework, with mandatory attendence of lectures, tutorials, and weekly quizzes. This is not high school, and learning should be independent at unviersity. Students should have right to decide which learning style best suits them",0
He's seems like a good teacher. He rambles a lot and its quite boring. Teaches too far ahead so it gets confusing. For EGR 199 take Dennis if you can. Dennis is much more interactive and he does half of the homework problems in class.,0
"Art is the best teacher ever!  His stories are always funny, although not always relevant.  His class is always fun and I always feel like I learn something from him.  Music was never better!  Get fired up!",1
"Boring boring boring, his voice is so monotone and makes me want to fall asleep. I feel like I am wasting my time every time I walk into his class. Highly do NOT recommend.",0
"She is so sweet! Very understanding if there is an issue going on and is willing to help work it out. All of the assignments were very easy, especially the tests. I didn't study and got 100s on all of them. Least stressful class of this semester.",1
He was really nice and is always helpful when you are confused. Definitely ask for help if you're struggling. ,1
Great Professor. Made lectures less boring because he would make you laugh. He works in the SW field so he teaches you about the real world. He's awesome!,1
"Madhav makes many mistakes when doing work for us on the big screen. The worst thing is the online homework. There are problems with the homework that he never taught us how to do, not to mention the (free) websites notation for entering answers is ridiculous. I accused him of all this, and he told me computer science is hard. Thanks, man.",0
Hoffman is really hard for biochem. I know students here are saying good things about him which I agree with. He's not a bad guy just rushes through lecture and his exams are only thing that your grade will be based on. Whole class wants extra credit but Hoffman don't care.,0
"He coerces you into doing things that take up way too much of your time. Nice guy and all, but the music program is rather stiff and too many teachers with military backgrounds. Be ready to play marches all day.",0
"He is an excellent teacher who gives his students mnemonic and analogies to memorize even the most difficult concepts. With him, anatomy and physiology was fun. He remains my best professor so far. I recommended him to many of my friends and they all attest to his good job!",1
She's a nice but this is for your own good when i tell you to not take her. You can be writing the easiest paper but she'll still manage to fail you or give you a low grade on it somehow. IMPOSSIBLE grader. I get great grades but definately not in her class. Im seriously worried i might fail a class for the first time. Get out now while you can.,1
Does not input grades so you wont ever know your grade. Changes grades constantly. Rants in class. Least specific professor I have ever had. Kind of rude. Fun to listen to in class though.,0
"He is a terrible professor. He is very knowledgeable in his field, but he can't relate it to students and his wife is at every class period and she is not useful at all.",0
"Thinks he's a bollywood star with his excessively corny humor. He tries to make a joke out of serious subjects by which he inaccurately portrays being very unorganized and making countless mistakes on the board. All the pre meds sit there and laugh as if they're getting extra credit before getting their B's and C's. Skip class, read book  A. ",0
"Had him for both comp 1 and comp 2.. he is the best english professor ever!!! if you have the chance to take him, it is DEFINITELY a must!!! Class is interesting and fun!! He is not your boring english teacher he is passionate and makes class soooo much fun!!",1
"I was NOT a fan of Helms, although he was an easy A, he went about his lectures with questionable statements... somewhat questionable statements about women and race. I stopped going to his class after the first month. All of his tests are online aka google and group test sessions are your friend. I do not recommend taking from him.",0
"The class was super easy, but also more helpful than I thought it would be. It was nice how Professor Nixon was always super bubbly and happy - it really made each class have a more social and relaxed feel. Things weren't always clear to begin with, but when you ask, she will go above and beyond to help you understand what it is you need to know.",1
"Only took this course because it's mandatory for my major. Definitely struggled communicating with this professor, she also constantly changed my marks on My Learning Space with zero explanation unless asked. I understand the material completely but her tests don't make sense. Never failed a course but this might be the first, unfortunately. ",0
"I thought that this public speaking class would be an easy A but it is in fact not. Unless you wish to dedicate your life, soul, and time to this class you won't get an A. The class average for the midterm was 68% and he said he only reserves 'A's' for those going above and beyond. Not worth the time and effort and not that helpful for life.",0
"Dr. Davis engages well with all his student but engages with special attention those students who really care about mastering the class material. Loved his lectures, always engaging, humorous, and thoughtful with plenty of practical applications. Reading heavy. Light tests.",1
"Adam Meyer is a very laid back professor. He is kind of awkward and shy, but later in the semester he opened up more.",1
"DO NOT TAKE KHAZEH. He will ridicule you when you try and ask for help and expects you to know everything before he even talks about it. He does not write his own tests or homeworks, and just uses Quizlet questions for exams. Awful professor.",0
"Professor Doane is very nice woman and extremely knowledgable about her field. She is accessible to students who seek help. Attendance is very important, and she greatly rewards student's for showing. Her tests are identification and analysis based. I recommend listening to what she says for the study guide. It will be on the test verbatim.",1
Dr. Chuckles will either put you asleep with his lectures or drive you up a wall with his guffaws after every sentence he says. Stay away!,0
"Prof Tam is very knowledgeable BUT he does not empathize with students and is quite harsh. He requires us to write a quiz every week with cameras on, gets angry with students when we email him for help and goes off on tangents every lecture. OVERALL DONT TAKE THIS PROF IF U WANT A HIGH GRADE",0
I took Hadavas for Survey of Calculus and he is by far the worst professor I have had. He is completely useless and honestly just has bad teaching skills. Make sure you are decently good at math because most of the course you have to look up youtube videos because his lectures are powerpoints and the HW program is terrible and does not help you.,0
"Lectures aren't as bad as some people make it out to be. Questions on quizzes aren't excessively difficult, but the quizzes are long. However, the assignments are insanely difficult.",0
test are hard. he takes forever to grade and emails you back after a century has passed. very irritating. doesn't have notes for the class or power points for online class. would not take him again.,0
"Prof. Doherty was great. Anatomy can be a tough subject, especially over summer but he made it less stressful and actually fun to learn! He lectures and has lab so pay equal attention to both and participate during lab by asking questions and involving yourself in the material; you'll learn and understand a lot by doing so. Would take him again.",1
"Maloy is a nice person who seems to mean well, but she cannot teach at all. Her exams are impossible. Sure, she curves, but if she was teaching properly she wouldn't need to. She doesn't update grades,ever. Still waiting on grades from 2 months ago :) she loves to give out homework but will not teach anything to help with said busy work. Enjoy :)",0
"Do not take this class if you aren't in this field. I took this for some extra units as a COMM major and spent the entire semester struggling to keep up. The class was terrible, which sucks because Professor Kleindienst is a pretty cool guy. Takes attendance, 5 HW assignments total, lecture based class, HARD tests.",1
"loves his slide presentations - moves through them pretty quick so if you don't have a copy in front of you, don't bother trying to take notes.  exams are fair enough. going to class is a must because the lecture material shows up on the midterms and final.",1
"Dr. Valenti is a really nice guy but his class is tough. If you want an A, buy the textbook test bank and study that because he gets most of the test questions from it. Don't waste your money on the textbook, you won't need it if you buy the test bank. He's also very strict about attendance, which stinks because the lectures are extremely boring.",1
"This is a sample email from this professor ""I continue to get requests for doing extra credit. I do not intend to change the evaluation procedures that I spelled out for everyone at the beginning of the semester, here in the last quarter. I realize this is being a tough time for everyone..."" Then ended with assessing the final grades, thedisrepect",0
This class is pretty easy.,1
"Too demanding for a general education class. Workload is extremely heavy. Great professor, funny, and is very passionate about his teaching.",1
the most boring class i have ever taken but its easy.. just read some of the book and be in class when he gives the essay question and you will do fine! if barely go to class and you will still pass,0
She is making students right now (during a pandemic) get a camera for the computer due to academic integrity issues. Some people have autoimmune diseases some have financial situations where they can't spend money on items like that. I think its fine enough to use lockdown browser but really a camera? I hope she realizes what she is doing is wrong.,0
"Way too many out of class assignments. Gives no time for groups to meet in class. Doesn't return any ""drafts"" in a timely manner. Feel overwhelmed and stressed out with all the homework and still having to finish all of these projects!",0
Is a hard grader and can be a d-bag sometimes.  But the class itself is interesting and you learn a lot,1
Expects you to mesmerized every little thing about ever group of organisms. and there is a lot of organisms he gives you from bacteria to mammals.,0
"He has a very thick accent to the point where he cant  pronounce the names of half the people in the class.  Many times nobody in the class understood what he was trying to say.  But he is nice, helpful and understanding. He will keep trying and trying to get across what he needs to for you to understand it. Test are hard but there is a nice curve.",1
Two words: stay away!,0
He is a very respectable man and if you put in 100% of your effort you will do fine. I bet that all of the people who criticized him are slackers and would say bad things about any teacher. Be on your a game and you will do fine,1
"I loved this course, But prof is  not easy. He takes points off. But the good part is that if you do good on final exam, he will grade you according to that.Irrespective of what you got in class pop quizzes.",0
Amazing Professor. 10/10 would suggest.,1
"Always condescending to anyone who disagrees with him. Grades are based on how much butt you kiss. In his words, if you didn't agree with him then your thoughts and logic weren't properly ""developed"". Those who agreed with his opinions passed and all others failed. Took same D papers from his class and got A's with a different professor. Ridiculous",0
"Unless you have time to devote to this class, do not take it.  Its not mandatory to attend class but his lectures are necessary for the test.  Two exams, one five page paper, two awful books.  he is very knowlegable but scattered, you will learn alot but it is not an easy A class.",0
Prof Staves is a nice guy but he is way above a basic introductory level Bio class. Every lecture he would skip many slides and we would fall behind. The exams are very different and the questions then things discussed in lecture.,0
Do not take IE 332 with Wachs. Period. He's better in IE 474,0
Haha. She's decent I guess.,0
Speach impediment. Uninventive lectures.,0
"LOVED this man! Class was enjoyable because Saas made it enjoyable! Literally follow every thing in his rubric and you will get the grade you want. NO EXAMS. Just speeches. Very laid back, makes lots of corny jokes, and tries his best to keep the class engaged. Saas is a must for CMST 2060!!!",1
"Professor Wu is not boring, rather very interesting and easy to listen to. He knows how to keep your attention and I liked his style of teaching. Every point counts in this class, so make sure to do well on the online quizzes just in case you need those points to boost your grade. Oh & try ur best to attend all classes. I would def. recommend him.",1
Hammond is a teacher that still cares about his students.,1
"One of the hardest classes I have ever taken in my life, but one of the best teachers as well. He grades on progress, so no matter your grades you stand a chance to pass. If you want a challenge this is a class for you.",0
"I honestly was lazy during this class and ended up missing 2 classes and still made an A. Do take into account though, if you are not a natural at math, you should attend class. She counts points off on tests easily but always tries to help you out before exams. Make sure to do webassign and study your written quizzes. Also offers extra credit. ",1
"Such an amzing professor. The smartest man I have ever met, changed the way I think about saying hi. So insightful, if you want to learn something and not just memorize stuff for a final his is the class to take. He just wants students to learn something new. He's in it for the right reasons.  And a great guy.",1
No Clear Enough. He seems not understand the lecture..,0
Anyone who goes to berkeley would be missing out on one of the best professors if he or she didn't go to her class. Her lectures are phenomenal performances each time and she as person is so charismatic and inspirational. I would recommend the class just because of her. And it'll truly be worth it.,1
Very few grades. Lots of reading. Long and boring lectures. Attendance isnt mandatory and he does not have homework but quizzes and test at the end of the semester and mid term. Some lectures are interesting but not all the time. Just boring majority of the time,0
We had certain readings we would have to read out of the book and then she would go through them each class. Lots of reading but I would recommend it is very interesting and helpful. Quizzes every two weeks on readings. Sometimes class got boring. 3 papers total with the final. Some in class assignments or discussion. Very easy grader.,1
Extremely hard. Tests were very specific and tedious. If I could do it over (which i will probably have to...) I'll definitely avoid him.,0
Too extra for nothing! Fitzgerald 2 million times better! There's a difference between a good teacher and a bad one!,0
Zoom class-Covid. You have to brief hard cases and answer questions weekly. In class you have to participate as he will randomly ask you questions regarding the cases and that's part of your grade for participation. Midterm and final on honorlock. Quizlet is your best bet to study. He is not that understanding of personal situations you might have.,0
"I have really mixed feelings about this professor, she talks a lot and most of the things she goes over isn't the same as her quizzes. Her quizzes are hard, no multiple choice. I wouldn't take her again.",0
Best history teacher I've ever had he helps and has vast knowledge on the subject inspires you to look for the answer instead of spoon feeding you,1
"If you did not have her for a previous class, you cannot get 100 on an assignment. Does not care about the grades of her students or how degrading it is to receive low grades despite best efforts. Most class below 70. 3 test grades below 20 on last. Is not understanding, will not help with Mathematica projects(so hard). Ruined passion for math.",0
"This guy speeds through organic chemistry material like it is simple addition in a calculus class. He does not teach well. If asked to break something down he is sometimes understandable, but plan on using him as a supplement to the textbook. I strongly advise taking anyone but him if possible.",0
"Guerra-Pujol is a great professor, he really tries to keep his lectures interesting during class. Overall, this class is an easy A. As long as you keep up with the deadlines and meet the work requirements, you'll be fine. The exam is an open book which is amazing.",1
amazing. my favorite professor at bentley,1
"GREAT TEACHER! Tests are not that hard.  Show up to class, take notes, and you will do well.  The best teacher in the School of Business.  You will learn so much from this class even if you arent interested.  Great class.  Highly recommended!",1
"Dr. Norris is very funny and cares a lot about the subject. He is very knowledgeable and goes to great lengths to make sure that his students learn the material, including extra help sessions and private student tutors. If you're on the pass/fail line, and you have made an effort, he'll let you pass. Only complaint: Picks favorites.",1
"She will teach you if you want to learn, show up ready to work for it.",1
Best teacher I've ever had. Makes boring rocks fascinating. Go to class on time and work hard in the class and you're good. No homework outside of class. Dude has some crazy stories to tell. Crazy in a good way.,1
READ THE BOOK AND YOU'LL DO FINE!,1
Online lectures. Do the work and you will pass. I recommend pass/failing so you do not have to worry about a grade.,1
At I enjoyed the things we learned in class but she is VERY unfair with her grading. Do not take her class!,0
"The only person who could make corporate accounting relatively interested.  He really cares about his students, and I loved taking his class.",1
"She doesn't email back, the tests don't make sense most of the time, and the whole ""flip the classroom"" thing is super confusing and doesn't help with actually learning.",0
"I absolutely loved Mrs. Kurtz and the way she taught. I passed this class with flying colors. If you do the homework and practice tests and there's no way you can't pass. She was always so happy! The only bad thing is I wish I would've been told to only buy the online code, instead of wasting 200 dollars on a book that I never even opened.",1
"TOOK HER ONLINE SHE IS GREAT, AND SHE DOES NOT PILE ALOT OF WORK ON YOU AT ONE TIME.",1
"For a writing intensive course we barely did any essays. She was very disorganized and would just randomly give in class responses. In class discussions were always interesting and hilarious. If you're a decent writer take her, but if you struggle with writing she's not lenient with grading. She was an easy A for me.",1
You can learn from him as long as you take crazy detailed notes because the tests are super intense. He is hard to understand because of an Asian accent but is a good guy. Just not the greatest professor.,0
Not a good professor.  He's monotonous and stutters and his redundant.  His tests are not a good reflection of what he attempts to teach.,0
"Avoid at all cost,  one of the smarter professors but likes to talk down to people and treat like they don't know anything.  Most students are there to learn.  Tough tests, tons of homework and takes forever to get graded homework back.",1
"Comparative Law, taken during Covid-19 of S20 (grade P/F). Reitz is brilliant and a wealth of information, but that can be bad at times. He can get off track and lectures can be difficult to follow. Prepare for LOTS of reading, LOTS, and it will often be random and not necessarily make sense. 2 essays and essay exam. Glad I took the class.",1
"his notes and lectures are a mess and very unorganized, but i learned so much from his class and his tests are pretty easy.",0
Awesome teacher. Do all the homeworks to completion and review for the quizzes by looking at the old ones online on tsquare and you will get an A.,1
dumb,0
"Very rude and nit picky. Can be ridiculous with test expectations. You cannot write over a given line or you will not get points for the question, so make sure you write small.",0
I found him very entertaining.,1
"His lectures are boring. He never gives back any grades until the very end, so you don't know how to improve lab write ups. The semester long paper is really important to him only after he give back the rough draft. He kills your writing. Readings are really boring and long.",0
Read the book.... I got a C in this course and it's the first C that I have received in college.,1
Don't take her! She makes you write so many notes and her tests are not easy. She is a tough grader and she expects  you to know EVERYTHING from the course.,0
"Get as much time necessary with this professor when writing your memos--midterm memorandum included.  She is not sympathetic and she is redundant as much as she is ambiguous.  The class is boring, but follow the text book to a ""T"" and you should be fine.",0
One of the best profs in uoft!!,1
He is a nice teacher but often is very confusing through his teachings. I feel prepared after the lecture but when I get to the homework I feel lost and unprepared. It did help to go in and get individual help with him because he could see directly what I was personally struggling with.,0
"Lydia is one of the worse professors I've had in Seneca. She puts you on the spot and doesn't provide any help when you try to ask her a question and don't understand something. When questioned why I didn't receive the full marks, she couldn't give me an answer. Unless you want your grades to be determined by her emotions, don't take her classes.",0
"Professor Overby is awesome! Super funny guy, and he really explains the material well in lectures. He gives review sessions before tests because they can be challenging, & beware of ""literacy points!"" Overall, a really great professor who is so knowledgeable about Chemistry. Be prepared to work hard in Honors Chem, but it will be worth it!",1
Pretty decent professor. It's not a cake walk but its better than average. He makes himself available through convenient office hours and Canvas discussions. If you know how to do the homework then you'll be ok.,1
"I really did love Cochran, however this class was hard. He really does ""make you work for it."" The readings and lectures are enjoyable, but the quizzes are over nit-picky details that don't matter and those were very hard for me. The mid term essay and final essay help balance it out though. I would recommend him, get ready to work though!",1
"Heres the truth...Class averages are consistently below a 70, tests are ridiculously hard and unfair...I had to change this to pass/fail and still am struggling to pass ..STAY AWAY, ITS NOT AS EASY AS IT SOUNDS, YOULL THANK ME",0
"One of the most difficult teacher I have ever had, but yet you learn a ton. If you want to be a good engineer take his courses, they will kick your butt, but you will be immensely prepared once you graduate.",1
"Professor Gonzalez is a god! Really cares about the class, very friendly, approachable and accommodating if you need an extension and truly learnt so much in her class. Overall a prof with incredibly positive vibes, a clear marking scheme of 3 tests, 10 weekly quizzes and an easy essay and I wish I could have her for a class again",1
"Dr. L is a solid professor. Clearly knows the material inside and out, and is always willing to answer whatever questions a student may have. Sometimes he can engage in overly technical Econ lingo that goes over most students heads though, myself included. Not much HW, just a weekly online assignment using Aplia, which contains the book.",1
"I took this class online and she is terrible with directions. She is so vague and if you ask a question it is really rare that she will actually answer,unless it is a yes or no question. Also, she grades with numbers 1-3, which no one understands. And finally, she doesn't even spell or grammar check her OWN emails. drove me crazy.",0
"I took Dr. Buck during the winter 2015 semester. This class was tough! It was only a 4 week course, with 16 weeks of work compacted into such a short time. Be prepared to spend time during the week watching films, reading chapters, and taking tests. He gives out plenty of extra credit opportunities. I got an A with hard work!",1
"Most course materials aren't difficult to understand even for those who have never taken art history before. Easy exams with take-home essays, but a bit picky about paper in terms of style and vocab. We had an enjoyable field trip to D.C. and she def knows a lot about northern arts. Mind you, she's a slow grader and better be patient with her.",1
"Take him! He was one of the best professors I have had in AU, plus class discussions were always interesting.",1
"Shes terrible. She talks in circles and barely makes any sense. She takes attendance every class so you have to go but you don't learn a single thing. She is extremely unclear about everything yet expects you to know what she is talking about, when a lot of times it seems like she doesn't know what shes talking about. Never take her classes.",0
Hardest class I have taken at Calvin. Exam format is horrible. He assumes you understand what he is understanding when only the religion majors in the class do. Avoid his class!,0
Dr. Luther pushes you towards excellence. He can bring out qualities in yourself that you never knew existed. I was his TA for a semester and learned so much from him. The principles he taught me stick with me to this day.,1
"Great Professor. She's young and relates things we learn in class to up to date scenarios that interest us. She gives you review sheets for her tests which is very useful. Her homework assignments don't take too long and are very useful when preparing for a test. Overall, one of the best professors Ive ever had. Highly recommended",1
"gives out so much useless and easy homework. explains the same obvious and simple principle 10 times in a row.  she took off points on my test for no reason at all and when i confronted her about it she just said ""oops"" and gave them back. don't take this class.",0
I took his online class it's pretty well organized and easy. The homework takes a while but you are going to get all 100s on HW if you actually take the time you have unlimited tries. The tests are kind of HARD you WILL NEED to take notes as you do your homeworks.,0
"Professor Howard is, to date, the toughest and most confusing professor I have had. His lectures are interesting and insightful, but his tests are the nail in the coffin. Not only is the large majority of the test material not discussed in class, but the review sheets are not helpful at all.",0
The only reason I even went to the lectures was that I was productive and got lots of homework done; I would still leave early. He is very soft spoken and is very hard to hear at times. Sometimes during the lecture he would just get up and leave without a word. He does give a lot of extra credit and one of them can get you up to 4%.,0
Dr. Nejat's lecture is dynamic. He is always patient to answer your questions.,1
"Very nice professor! Midterm 40%, Final 40%, Attendance 20%. He teaches everything from his PowerPoint slides and provides an example test bank. However, exams are pretty challenging (40 MC questions) and specific to the power point slides. Test bank helps with studying but most of those questions aren't on the exams. Doesn't give stdnt less than B",1
funny class.  ends up turing into a women's studies class but still funny to hear her stories.  her notes are really random so make sure you read.  its also a good idea cuz of the quizzes.,1
"Mrs. Tobin is accessible outside of class, will give extra credit, and work with you on timelines and material. However, her lectures are lackluster. In HST321 it seemed like a 100 lvl course watered down. Her tests consist of 10 questions of trivia not formally covered in class. Presentations consist of a projector &  printed pages from wikipedia.",0
Excellent teacher.  Only wears sandals and is kooky but hilarious teacher!,1
Never again he doesnt teach us anything at all your book is your best friend. #facts,0
"I hardly had any time to do anything for this class, I never read any of the assigned readings because I didn't have time and still ended up with an A. Easy GPA booster.",1
Pretty hard to understand at times and needs to keep up on the test to pass the class.  hardly any homework but online quizes.,0
"Phil/Film. Only grades in class are: quizzes/attendance/participation (1/3), midterm (1/3), and final (1/3). Pop quizzes occur to check that topics were understood and that reading was completed. Class must be attended to view films and know what to watch out for in films. Midterm/final timed for 1hr. only, need to write quickly but efficiently.",1
"Fun class, his lectures can be really enthralling. He cares about students and really wants to help. Tests weren't ridiculously hard, but def need to study for",1
"Mr. Steenkin is an ok guy, but he's not my favorite professor.  The class is 2.5 hours long and ends at 6:45, but he always manages to hand out the weekly quiz at 6:44, which is super annoying.  He will never let you out early, most days I get out 5-10 minutes late.  Do the readings and you'll be fine.  One easy 5 page paper, 2 exams. ",0
"I would not recommend his online course if you are someone that is trying to take on an online class to be flexible with your schedule, his course is consuming. His rubrics are not clear, and because he does not believe in one right answer he will not give you all possible points. When you ask him to clarify he just resends you the syllabus.",0
"THE BEST TEACHER EVER!!! so caring and devoted to her students I can't stress that enough. Truly a gem. biggest advice is to come to class, attendance is a grade and write everything but the material is so interesting and she is amazing it won't be a problem. Her energy lights up the room and she breaks down everything you need to know to pass.",1
"Here is the thing. His lectures make sense only if the previous one made sense, you get lost once and you're done. He gives a lot of assignments and is cool about drop grades and i used all of them. I gave this class a ton of effort but i would recommend anyone else because the stress is not worth it. All his lessons are self made, no outside help",0
I hate loblolly pine trees!!!!!  I thought that lab time could have been better spent.  I wanted to drop the class and he promised that there was no need to.  I was not real happy when I go a D!,0
"Paul is great! I would recommend taking his class. With this year being online, he made things a lot easier. A lot of topics are covered throughout the class, but class is not mandatory, I would 100% recommend attending class,you learn so much more when you can ask questions. It is test/quiz heavy, but nothing out of the ordinary. It's an easy A.",1
Arnold is obviously very enthusiastic about science. But the class... boring and a waste of time. I would have ditched if attendance wasn't mandatory. The 10-day unit plan we had to create - a burden that I won't ever look at again. The whole unit assignment needs to be revamped somehow.,0
"OK, I LOVE LOIS AND LOIS LOVES HER STUDENTS. But her sweetness will deceive you- she is a really hard grader. Her class is a tad chaotic but its an adventure. She is easily the sweetest and most caring professor I have ever had. I would totally recommend taking a class with her. Also- she is super lenient about due dates and revisions.",1
Very easy class. Grade consists of short weeks writing assignments and discussions. Clear grading criteria and consistent instructions for assignments. Interesting material and well rounded. Would deff recommend!,1
"Dr. Bret L. Keeling is one of the best college professors I have ever had. He genuinely cares for his students. The assignments were extremely straight forward and as long as he knew you tried, you got an A. There is literally no reason why you can't do well in his class as long as you show up and hand things in on time.",1
Tom Creahan is the worst professor at MSU. He is soft talker and you literally cannot hear his lectures. I read the chapters before the test and still scored awful. You must take a quiz repeatedly to get a decent/ at least 50% on the test. He gave me the worst grade of my life. Do not take him,0
"The class is very arbitrary and Dr. Arndt is a tough grader. You do not need the text book, but the books are crucial. You will take notes from the beginning to the end of the class. There are about four long papers assigned and six short papers based off of the books and notes in class. Participate in class!",0
"A very bad professor. Slides, examples and explanations are ripped from the book and is incredibly rude to students in her class. Does not follow schedule, no syllabus given and exams/quizzes are not like the homework. Be prepared to the course coordinator or student advocate",0
"If you don't do well on the homework, you WILL fail the tests. Test questions are sometimes verbatim from homework assignments so make sure you do well on them and understand them.",0
"It doesn't get better than Brian White! He establishes a great classroom atmosphere and day one, and enlightens students each and every day. He tells you the truth about things, not sugar coated versions of what people want you to think. It was a LOT of hard work, but you come out of this class more prepared as a profession and as a human being.:-)",1
"Don't bother going to class, it won't help. I pulled all-nighters and read the chapters from the textbook and did fine on his tests. He has a homework due every week which are simple enough, but don't study them for the test, they didn't helped me. They typically took an hour to complete. He, as a professor, is boring and vague.",0
"This teacher is really hard to understand, the way he teaches makes the subject matter harder to explain than necessary.  He adds steps that go beyond the basics of this class and goes more into higher end math like calculus",0
This was one of the first online classes Iv'e ever experienced as a freshman. The first few days I spent in the Adobe Lab were some of the most stressful I've ever had. I felt like I was floundering to understand the concepts in the book,0
"Extremely smart, but difficult to understand if you're new to the subject.  He has ""pets"" in class that can do no wrong, and others that he seems to ignore.  When asking for help outside of class, he makes you feel as though you're stupid and wasting his time.  I think he's extremely smart, but has difficulty relating to students.",0
"always available to talk, urges us to write papers of professional standard, very helpful",1
"Very disappointing to him this semester, a rough test with strict marks. And rude always, lacking a minimum of respect for the students.",0
"Instructor is worthless beyond compare.  Lectures the content by waving his hand and mumbling ""and such"" every other sentence. Mandatory class is the only reason to show up, despite him making efforts to end the class as soon as is humanly possible. Asking for elaboration results in more mumbled incoherence. Frequently can't even hear the guy talk.",0
"Excellent professor who will work to build a living picture of the time period he's teaching. The reading is difficult for sure, but very much worth it. If you put in the time and interest you can get an A reliably, since he will meet with you and discuss your draft in depth before submission. The Australian touch and suits are on point.",1
"Tough grader. Thought the class would be easy and didn't work to improve my writing as I'm not pursuing a degree in the humanities. If you're serious about becoming a better reader/writer/essayist, I would highly recommend her. Nice person and seems passionate and knowledgeable. Take your essays seriously. She is not impressed by stoned rambling.",1
I only lasted the first two classes to get an impression that her class was not for me. She reads everything WORD FOR WORD from her power point. It would be easier if she posted all the notes online for students to print and just follow along. She seems to get easily flustered when asked simple questions. I would not recommend this teacher,0
"ECO300 Lecture was online while there was an in person lab component. The class consisted of not a lot of effort from Bremer. You basically read the textbook then did a module which ended up being 4-8 pages, and they were due every Sunday. He would then give exams maybe once a month online. The exams were given without feedback from the HW",0
"She is a great teacher and knows what she is talkin about, if you go to class and read the stories, you can't fail. The tests are based on them, and they aren't hard to read. The class was interesting which always makes it easier to learn.",1
"Very judgmental, constantly snaps back at students, does not make the work clear .",0
Awful indeed.  My high school teacher had more organized lectures than this university prof.  Lectures are all of the place and his notes were useless.  Overall does not look like he enjoys teaching.  Very disappointing.,0
"Prof. Tepperman is entertaining while speaking during his lectures. However, the lectures are content-heavy, so don't skip. Lots of textbook reading and article readings. Tests are difficult because there is so much content to remember. Sociology interests me, but now I am just overwhelmed with content. Be ready to study hard and read a lot.",0
"Just give her salary she earns from this class to the textbook company because the only way to learn anything is outside of lectures. Horrible, boring teaching style and expects you to already know calculus when its not a pre requisite. Trust me do not take her class .",0
"Awesome teacher! She is very clear about what you need to know, and also gives extra credit to those who work hard and know the material.",1
"Without a doubt the worst professor I've had so far. Very poorly organized barely teaches anything and the group project is a mess. Any feedback you get back from her is confusing and unhelpful I don't think she even knows what she is looking for. Attendance is a significant part of your grade as well, which is frustrating because of how bad she is",0
Very unhelpful and does not care for the students learning. I took her summer course last year  while working a full time job and she would not arrange different times to meet for a 10 minute web cam chat thats worth 25% of your grade. Currently going through the dean to fix this. Unfair grader as well because my friend and I put in the same work.,0
"I don't know if online isn't his thing, but he really dropped the ball this semester. Everything from lectures to hw resources posted late enough to not be useful, or not at all. On top of that he doesn't let you show work on exams. Makes our lives harder to make his easy. Avoid.",0
Not a good experience at all.,0
one of the worst profs ive had at GVSU. PLEASE DO NOT MAKE MY MISTAKE AND TAKE HER. FOR ANY CLASS. she is an insanely hard grader and bombs you even when you do exactly what she wants. shes rude and insulting in her grading notes. rude in class and just a really unpleasant person to be around. youre never right. youre never correct. shes the worst.,0
The amount of homework and studying to be done for this class is exponential and he gives 7-8 hours of homework a week. Plus the homework can be difficult. Just be prepared to stress about this class.,0
"Very nice and funny man! Class grade is based off of about 7 exams and that only. You have to show up and take extensive notes to do well on exams. Be a FAST typer to get all the notes!!! Most Q's on exam from lecture, some Q's from book. Good amount of extra credit available for participating in psychology studies (SONA credits).",1
I enjoyed his class. Learned a lot. You should take this class only if you are really interested in the topic. I've seen a lot of people take the class because it's very scoring. That's honestly not the way to go. He always helped with assignments and questions. He nurtures potential.,1
"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE and MISERABLE WOMEN!!!...PURE EVIL!!!",0
My experience in this class was absolutely awful. He teaches his opinions as facts and they are often ignorant and rude/insulting to certain groups. Maybe he is trying to be funny? It didn't work. And don't get me started on his laser pointer. I left that class upset almost every time.,0
He is the best english professor that I have ever had!  He made class interesting and I never wanted to miss.  I am usually terrible at english so i was worried about this class but it was so easy!  I got an A and i have never received an A in english before!  TAKE HIM!!!,1
"I really enjoyed his class. He made things more interesting by relating it to personal stories. He has a sense of humor, although it seems like other students don't. People take things too seriously. He answers emails almost immediately. Although i do have to say that his syllabus isn't easy to follow. His final essay is very heavily marked (50%)",1
"I appreciated that he went through the week's material before the assignments. Although the exam was a little tricky, it is not that hard. ",1
She is crazy! She is not teaching at all. She is just wasting students time in class and try to arrange extra classes. If you really wanna learn AI avoid her. Try to take from others.Thus I have seen worst TA in my college life.,0
"The man thinks online shopping is a huge terrifying scam. Does not do anything online (powerpoints, study guides, etc.) Makes you memorize facts like what kind of car his dad had to take ""attendance"" on exams. Exams are designed for students to fail. He knows what he's talking about, but the class structure and his ego are both horrible.",0
I think most of these ratings are good because when he was younger he actually knew what he was talking about. This man needs to retire. He is a very harsh grader and can not be reached through email.,0
I took Intro to creative writing in the summer and she was so sweet. The reading was not heavy and the paper prompts were not hard at all. She mainly grades on the papers. She's also very flexible.,1
"wicked prof, so fun to be in her class",1
"Can't understand a word he says. But, didn't ever go to class and got a B.",0
"This was an online course, never met teacher face to face.Work was lengthy and difficult.Worked exceptionally hard on long assignments,rarely made above a ""C"" even though I complied w/ her expectations. Gave us 30 mins for 50 questions on midterm. Many students expressed frustrations in regards to her difficulty level! A waste of hardwork!",0
"I hated this class. There would sometimes be 2 quizzes a day on information that was barely covered. Dr. Williams is a prof who knows a lot about his subject and nothing about how to explain it to people who don't have his extensive background. Sometimes it seemed like his slides and tests weren't even his own, he was unprepared. I don't recommend.",0
Do all of your homework. ALL OF IT. Only way you'll survive. Study the chapter study guides. Only way you'll pass. Avoid if possible.,0
Only a few weeks into the semester and she is literally the best teacher I've ever had in college! She is understanding of us college students and our lives. She deserves an award. So far I am actually understanding and more in depth into the subject because is not a stickler about due dates. We need more professors that care like her!,1
"Firstly, dont take this course if you have not studied Operations Research.Trust me on that and you will not regret your decision. Secondly, the professor literally makes you fall asleep in the class.Thirdly, after having taught this course for so many years, she still does not have good notes  .She is the worst professor I have ever studied from.",0
"He has a tendancy to get off the topic sometimes, but more often than not, his lectures were interesting.  Translation quizzes were easy and papers weren't too long.",1
Don't take this class with him. You learn on your own plus his tests are nothing like what he talks about in class. He makes you do useless assignments. Lecture time is totally useless. You never know your grade. Don't get surprised when you see a lot of people dropping. Stay away from him,0
"Wonderful course and prof. He truly cares about his students' success, but even more so about their genuine understanding of the complex material. There is no prof I could recommend more if philosophy interests you, even as an elective.",1
"Never wanted to take a public speaking class but somehow this teacher made the class bearable enough for me to pass with and ""A"" and actually learn something for a change!",1
"Josh is really sweet.  I took this only for a language requirement, but he made the class really enjoyable.  He was a really tough grader, but he went about it in a way that made me want to work harder and do better. He was always available outside of class and went up and beyond for us.  I hope I can have him for FR611.",1
"I really disliked the class I took. I feel that the broad topic of CIS can been hard to grasp, and I felt that most of the time her lectures were useless. The group project/assignments didn't have clear requirements and felt rushed. She's nice -and knowledgeable in CIS- just not a very good teacher IMO. I struggled for the B. Thank goodness for EC.",0
"He didn't understand the material he was teaching, and would edit assignments DURING class due to contradictory grading criteria. Admitted to not preparing class material (projects, (buggy) code demos) until the night before lecture. He is rude; talks over people trying to ask questions, then doesn't answer the question being asked. Unprofessional.",0
"Prof. Wong is a very tough grader. There is SO much busy work and so many papers. A lot of the work is really redundant. The content is not hard at all she just makes you do a lot of work about easy things. This class is required, so good luck, and make sure to use a lot of details in your work.",0
I took his html class. It gets tough because html is tough. But he is so helpful! There are no texts at all! Which was really nice. I skipped class a lot and still got a B,1
"He lectures straight out of the book, so I wouldnt bother with the lectures. The tests are similar to the homework. He is a nice man, but frankly, his teaching is awful. He is getting paid to teach, not to be nice. Watching paint dry is more interesting.",0
"Stinson is a great guy that breaks up the monotony of Computer Science with snippets of sarcasm. However, projects will be tough and consume many hours of your life. Lectures are confusing especially if you're learning coding for the first time, lots of prior knowledge is already assumed. Class has been unorganized. Jumping around a lot.",0
Please don't take his class!!!!,0
"liked her as a teacher, but she needs to realize this is 105, not a 200 level class. basically from the beginning starts speaking in almost all french, because thats her first language.  for first time french students that is hard bc she doesnt translate what shes saying back to english.",1
"I was unsure about talking a writing class, but I actually really enjoyed it! It was one of my favourites so far. There is a lot of note taking, but I found the information to be interesting and eye-opening. Definitely a good class overall.",1
He can be very unbiased but he is not clear as to what is on the exams. The class average on any given exam was at least a C and we all had to challenge the questions.,0
"awesome lady.  very fun.  very nice.  lots of fun discussion and interesting videos, etc.  a very fun class.",1
"He is a great teacher! My first semester of college has been full of awful teachers and boring classes, but he has made me love college. He does have an accent but he explains things thoroughly and makes things easy to understand.",1
Dr. Holmes is the best! I loved this class and learned a lot. She's very helpful during office hours and conferences.,1
"Professor Schap's lectures are fast-paced and pretty confusing. He assigns a lot of textbook reading and practice problems that are not graded. HOWEVER, this extra work is how I actually learned and did well in the class because the lectures were confusing. If you take this class, do the extra work because it will be to your benefit in the end.",0
"Terrrriibbbllleeee. Mad horrible, tasteless jokes that were funny only to himself. Spends very little time actually addressing the material and goes off in unrelated tangents. Apparently we were lucky this semester because he decided not to give us any hard assigments/essays.",0
"Very laid back and funny, will let almost anything pass as long as you're not disruptive (even sleep!). No textbook, all PP info. Has a big heart for women's issues. Class was Domestic Violence and extra credit was movies related to DV or attending programs that donated to battered shelters. Easy A, take her if possible.",1
"She is a harsher grader on the papers written for the class, but it helps in the long run to help make your papers better for portfolio grading. You write 4 papers and choose 3 to revise and turn in for the portfolio. She offers a lot of help if you ask for it, but can be hard on you sometimes.",1
"Harold genuinely cares about his students, and that shows in his meetings with students. I've taken two or three classes from him, and he's fantastic. Classes are tough and will make you work your ass off. I've always learned a ton, though.",1
"Very sweet and helpful teacher! Show up to class and you will easily pass. Definitely tries to help everyone pass, so don't be afraid to ask questions. Lets you bring a note card for tests. Definitely do all homework and quizzes for easy A. Definitely recommend!",1
"I know how everyone keeps saying how hard this class is, but it is honestly THE most interesting class you will EVER take! I LOVED Dr.Yates, and i found her to be such an intense individual, with alot to offer as a professor. She is also extremely helpful outside class. Even though her exams are hard, they even out at the end...so don't worry!",1
"I would definitely take other classes with her and strongly recommend this class/subject! She is very helpful, understanding, and challenges you!",1
Do not take this class if you get bored just watching the most boring videos about art history. She does not teach. You just watch videos the whole semester and you have to pay attention to each and everything in the video because you have 4 video tests. A lot of people do not like her in my class and even the people that show up don't do well.,0
This professot canceled class again and she is always cancelling classes to fail you and she gets excited when she fails her students ! Avoid at all costs and she does not enter grades until the last week of classes and she will be happy when you repeat writing comp I or II . Avoid at all costs and take a different professor!,0
Great Prof! Really inspired interest in the course material. Would definitely take one of his classes again. He really cares about student learning.,1
"ABSOLUTELY WORST PROFESSOR IVE EVER HAD!!! Do not take his class, he is an extremely tough grader. He takes forever to respond to emails and gives little to no feedback. He is condescending and rude as well. I am warning you, do not take his class",0
"Prof. Vargas is a nice lady and has her funny moments, but she is fundamentally a bad teacher. While Micro of a Hurricane is an easy class, but there is an integrated project with a history class that really sucks. She'll rant about how terrible and wrong the class is as a whole, but never give you actual feedback. Take other bio professors.",0
She is a  tough grader. I  won't take any class with her in future . She really wants that student get low grades. Pre Calc is  easy but she made it too hard.,0
"I think this teacher either had enough of teaching or he's still learning how to do it. His lectures are very confusing, sometimes way out of topic. He doesn't have any method to help students understand what they're not understanding, while he has ZERO understanding of each person's capability and level. His homeworks and time in class are useless",0
Dr. Schauer pushed us to learn more while making French feel fun. Reading and writing short stories was a challenge but improved my ability to use the language. Pay attention and shout out answers here and there and you'll do fine.,1
very helpful teacher. willing to help and answers all questions. class is hard esp. his tests. really have to work hard to get an A.,1
"Her class literally made me not major in finance. She is very nice, always in a good mood but its impossible to learn anything. She speaks as if we already know the material, flies through it, and then gives you an extremely difficult test with material we never went over. I had to go home and teach myself everything online. She will help in office",0
"Good teacher, explains well, with humor. Straight to the point person. Do today then you must get it in or else.... Little hard on marking tho. Must study alot on your own to get perfect.",1
"Course consists of daily lectures from PowerPoint slides, occasional class activities based on nutrition/diet, 4 exams, and a presentation. Grading criteria is very straightforward and Dr. Ferrero is super smart. Be sure to pay attention, participate, and review the exam study guides for an A!",1
why did he have to talk about bats for 3 lectures? i thank crash course and khan academy for my success in this class. he taught me absolutely nothing. goodnight streaks,0
The fact that no absences are excused except for sporting events was a little much for me,0
"Prof Farhat is AMAZING. She's so down to earth and funny, and her class is genuinely enjoyable. I learned a lot, it ended up being my favorite class out of 5 for the whole semester. I would definitely take her again. The tests are a bit hard (the true/false can trip you up) but if you study and do all the assignments you should be fine.",1
"She is a great professor. She makes learning more enjoyable and has a sense of humor. She does not do power points, she does over head slides and a lot of writing on the board. I would taker her class again, I wish she was teaching AP2 as well.",1
"Dr. Mohr is awesome. Great lecturer, good notes, very helpful, interesting classes. He's also very challenging: hard homeworks, difficult tests, expects a lot from you. If you do the work and invest the time, you'll learn a ton, but he can tell if you're slacking off and isn't afraid to give bad grades for poor performance. Overall,one of the best.",1
Dr. Barnes is an ok teacher. She told us at the beginning that she has RBF in person and over email and let me tell you she really does. I never read the book and found everything online. She was extremely rude to me whenever I asked any question - one of the rudest professors I've ever had. I would really not take her if you can find someone else.,0
his astronomy class is amazing,1
"All of Rocklands tests were easy and the on the final we were allowed to have a cheat sheet, so I didnt study that hard, thinking the final would be like his other tests (really easy). But no! The final was worded so confusingly and was just really difficult all around. My grade ended up dropping. He is a sweet guy, but not a very good prof.",0
"If you can, change sections immediately before it's too late. his lecture are very hard to understand and he has a very heavy accent. during lecture he point at the slides and speaks indistinctly. Only time I understood anything was when someone came to supervise the lecture and coincidentally it was the only time he used the board.",0
"I thought she was a great prof, very clear voice and gives really comprehensive lectures. she is also very friendly and helpful, more approachable than jane mcmillan.",1
If you're concerned with your grades I would highly recommend taking this class from another instructor. The classwork is far more extensive than needed and the instructor is very inflexible.  You will be required to do several hours unrelated volunteer work and raise a virtual child online which is time consuming and holds little educational value,0
"Really tough prof! But a nice, accomplished man. Beware of any of his courses, risk of failure (unless you work your butt off )is real.",1
"I think Professor Kearl is an amazing teacher and is an economics genius. But his tests are way too hard for a beginning Econ class, and theyre basically your entire grade. Also some of the homeworks are unnecessarily long and tedious. Go to the TA recitations and study hard for the tests, or you will struggle in this class.",1
"The tests werent based on the content stated. Also said during class, Dont stop to think, just write when talking about the first test of the semester. You can learn the content just by doing the practice problems in the textbook, as she just reads verbatim from a PDF as her lecture slides. Assumes you know the content before she teaches it.",0
Took him for the honors seminar (propaganda & pseudoscience). Way too much work for what's supposed to be an enriching elective/learning experience. You must do the readings! But he's passionate about what he teaches and makes his expectations clear. He's also real accessible and willing to help.,1
Definitely take this course with her if you like for people to be condescending to you. Heavy workload. Assumes everyone wants to be a Pollution Manager...This course and instructor were so not worth my time. The material could be interesting if you didn't have to WASTE so much time being an English major for an Environmental Studies course.,0
"Dr. Panning isn't my cup of tea, but I know lots of people that enjoy her classes. She is a pretty fair grader, if you try, and make sure to read the books if she is giving a quiz on them or you won't pass. But, she also comes off very pretentious at times and loves to her herself talk. Sometimes her classes feel more like ""The Anne Panning Show.""",1
thinks hes the smartest person in the world and perhaps he is. he just isnt that great of a teacher and doesnt seem so interested in students opinions. grading very arbitrary,0
"He's a very kind man, but he can't lecture very well.  Don't take his class unles syou have a VERY strong physics background or are willing to teach yourself.",0
I never felt the need to write a review about a professor until taking CS 140. Prof. Malaty is quite possibly the worst teacher I've ever experienced. She comes to class unprepared and is annoyed by any question being asked even if it's crucial to the lesson. I got an A after thoroughly reading the book and collaboring w/ other students. STAY AWAY!,0
He FREAKS about texting in class!,1
"I've had Professor Romero for two semesters and have enjoyed spanish with her both times!  She is a bit scattered sometimes, but she's fair and does her best to help her students.  As long as you do the assigned readings and work, you will be okay and she really appreciates the effort you put in, and is more than willing to help.  I would take her!",1
"I have not learned anything in this class. There was no structure to the class, he never told us what chapter we were on, and never explained the grading system. He doesn't tell you what you did wrong on an assignment and then tells you to study the whole book for an exam. I would not recommend anyone take his class.",0
"He is a brilliant lecturer and scholar.  Highly recomend him if you want to learn something.  It is not a easy A, but reachable when you put in the effort.",1
"Mrs. Stephens is a good prof and very helpful as long as you are willing to do the work and are trying in her class, that's all she asks for. Don't skip classes without a good excuse. I adore her as a teacher she's creative and interesting",1
"He likes using big words during lectures. He does not post notes (very unorganized and vague). Assignments have very little instructions. Exam questions are not difficult but grading is very subjective (only his way or the highway). He reacts differently to ""good"" or ""bad"" students (lowkey discriminate). Avoid him if possible.",0
"Take SOC 102 if you're an in-class participator! 70% of grade is classwork, which are group projects that aren't difficult. Weekly reading. Optional final if you don't like your grade thus far. 1 paper. Really insightful class, you'll learn a LOT! She's a great professor, highly recommended.",1
"Unorganized. Assignments can be a moving target, meaning that requirements or expectations can and do change, without clearly setting expectations for everyone. She's knowledgeable but only somewhat helpful. Be sure to think about your question before you ask. she doesn't exactly hear the question you're really asking.",0
"He knows what he's teaching and he knows how to teach it. I recommend going to recitation because it helps a lot with the HW. His exams are NOT cumulative so you have the ability to master every topic for the midterms and final. I wish he'd run for president, but this country doesn't deserve him.",1
Art history is a dry subject but Heidi makes it pretty interesting. Heidi is very open to answering questions and is willing to help you if you need it. She is caring and predictable (scheduled and doesn't slack off). She also clearly knows what she is lecturing about. The class is very straightforward. It's only 3 tests.,1
"You have no choice if you want to be an EM major... you HAVE to have him as your teacher two times. Either switch majors or suck it up. Yeah, he gives entirely too much busy work... but it's easy. You just have to memorize slides/in class work for tests. Just do what he says & you'll be fine.",0
"I don't know what I was thinking taking his class. The class seem okay at first, but after a week it took a big turn. Essays back to back. Even going to his office hours plenty of times, there was NO improvement. He is a harsh grader and he makes it hard to pass. Don't take his class.",0
Not an easy class for those who aren't strong in math. I don't feel that the prof simplified the material enough because it was still quite complex and hard to follow. Do your best to do well on the quizzes & excel assignments throughout the semester so that you don't feel overwhelmed for the final. Ask for help or you will feel lost & fall behind.,0
"Where to begin *sigh*. I'm a solid student, I make A's. She makes it IMPOSSIBLE to make an A in this course. She does not hold lectures, only Zoom/Webex meetings once a week-which are impossible to get into if you have a life outside of school. She is snarky, she's very picky with how she grades, and you basically teach yourself everything.",0
"One of the most boring while still difficult courses I've ever taken in my life. 3 hour lecture, and Dr. Harpp has a very monotonous voice. He often goes on tangents about things that sound like they don't matter, and then those things turn up on the exams (which are much harder than I thought they'd be). Wanted a bird course, got a hard course.",0
"All over the place. He's a nice guy, his exams are hard to study for though and courses like these are tough to get ready for because they change every year. Also very dry topics.",1
"The hardest class I took this year and the reason dropped Athletic Training as my major. 2 exams and 1 final of 20, 20 and 25 open ended questions respectively. The questions are not hard but you can get 1/8 of a point off sometimes. Those lost points pile up and make it hard to get a good grade. Very hard class, dont take if you dont have to.",1
This course is extremely difficult but extremely useful and rewarding if you learn the material.  I have been hired for jobs specifically because of the data structures I learned in this course.,1
The design project was fun. Wednesday labs were long,1
Does not grade anything except quizzes throughout the year. Will not know your overall grade until the end of the semester when the gradebook closes.,0
Not very accessable and she's hard to get on with. Don't take the online version of this class as it's hard to get a clear answer and there's no leeway.,0
Amazing teacher. always help students.,1
Great class!  I have never gotten so much out of a 5 week summer class before.,1
I love this man!,1
"Does not give feedback on papers except to say wrong or nothing at all. He is easy on the eyes, but that's about it.",0
"She is a very kind professor. She knows what she is talking about and is interested in everybody's topic. She can be strict, but if you work hard and pay attention, she will make you a better writer.",1
"She's the best teacher I have had here at Northwest. You have to be willing to put in effort in her class and study for the exams. I recieved C's on all her tests and still got a B out of the class. My resume has tramendously changed and I got a 94/100 on it! She is helpful, nice, and willing to work beyond office hours for students. I recommend!!",1
"Although Steven is a little self-absorbed, he is a good professor. He wrote the textbook, which is an easy and interesting read. He gives you major hints in class regarding the test content. In addition, he gives you all the possible questions that will be on the final exam. This is an easy A+ class.",1
This is an overall OK class. The class is not too hard. There are 5 tests and he drops the lowest grade. The 4 tests are the only parts of the grade so you can't really afford more than 1 bad one. There was some opportunities for extra credit this semester. The lectures are dry and a bit boring. I recommend his class but it's nothing special.,1
She explained the concepts very well. If you ever needed help she went out of her way to clarify. Her lectures were long and if you didn't go to class you most likely wouldn't understand the material. Tests are semi-hard but not too bad if you study. ,1
"Awesome and friendly professor. She knows what she is doing and is passionate about it as well as helping her students. She is young so she understands the students. Exams are fairly easy, allowed cheat sheets and good amount of review beforehand. Labs are pretty easy too. I got an A- and do not like math at all...recommend her to everyone!",1
Excellent class. Very good teacher Explained very clearly. Difficult materials made students not happy!,1
"The textbook he made was full of readings that made no sense. I thought I was taking a German Culture class but for some reason it was mixed with Mielke's horror film class. We were expected to know all of the material from a pre-req required for Mielke's class, but not mine. Harsh grader on papers, but you can't read the notes he's written on them",0
"Father Ranieri is one of the best professors at Seton Hall. He is an expert in his field, cares deeply for his students, and is extremely fair. If you have the opportunity to take him, definitely do so.",1
"Wragg is an amazing professor! The material is definitely difficult, but he is more than willing and available to help during office hours. Physics is hard for me but after going to office hours, he helped me a ton and my test grades changed from c's to b's. Keep up with hw bc he gives random quizzes",1
"The best class I have ever taken. He made the final optional and the big end of the year paper was the single most meaningful piece of writing I have ever made. Just an amazing professor, you feel like you are in a philosophy class almost. I have never had a professor that cares for their students as much as Ralph does.",1
"This prof is horrible. Required $200+ textbook, and relies way too heavily on it. He is unreasonable, extremely boring, never engaging. On the exam, if you write a fraction as your final answer even though all the steps are correct, he gives you 0. He refuses to post practice questions or give back midterm/solutions. Boring lecture, fast pace. BAD.",0
"asked for help on 2 separate occasions in LL; both times she was excessively rude and clearly annoyed when i dared interrupt whatever she's (always) listening to with her headphones. no idea how she is still employed at ACC, let alone teaching. sour attitude with a superiority complex.",0
Prof. Ibrahim is a very nice person and knowledgeable but his teaching methods are terrible. He uses his own outdated website to teach the class and his directions are always unclear. You never receive your lab grades so you have no idea how to gauge how you've been doing on them. The class itself is not extremely difficult. The final is take home.,0
I think hes a quality professor who knows his stuff. He really tries to make sure his students understand the material. If only I could stay awake in his class...,1
"History is literally the most boring subject in my opinion, but Gordon makes it so interesting by including hilarious videos, interesting facts, and makes jokes the entire class. I wish I could take his class again.",1
Dr. McLuskie was one of the best professors I have ever had. You want to think?  Reach beyond your comfort zone?,0
"I've never had a prof that refuses to talk to students after class or during breaks, but then there's Ivor. He just absolutely refuses to accept emails, and honestly he's quite rude. An interesting, passionate, and funny lecturer, but his tests are unfair, and he never has slides. Bring laptop to take notes, and you BETTER read the textbook.",0
Peter made class incredibly fun and exciting. He it teaching a music based course in the spring of 2019. Take it.,1
"She was very distracted, could barely finish her sentences, could not finish her thoughts. She is a very nice lady and will help you out. Her tests and quizzes are super specific. This class is is kinda pointless.",0
"Great professor, always super energetic, and NEVER leaves you bored in class. He's a very fair grader, but doesn't give out A's easily, you have to earn them.",1
One of my flavorite teachers,1
Would never take a class with him again,0
This class was fun. Fun labs and kahoots for lecture. She was my clinical instructor as well. Shes great at explaining things and 1 on 1 conversation. Ask her about Terri time. Study the book and ati as much as you can.,1
"Class was not too hard. He really helps if you have any questions about the reading or assignments. Homework was a bit frustrating at times, but the tests were chill as long as you studied. Would definitely take again.",1
Professor Acosta's class was difficult because I struggle with math but she made it make sense. I learned a lot in her class. She had a lot of tips on how to get through the math software for the homework. Her lectures were straight to the point.,1
Covered a lot of different genres in Spanish cinema. He cares about students and wants them to be interested in the lectures. Only critique I have is that he doesnt give much feedback on essays and doesn't give clear prompts for the essays (which can be good because you have freedom to choose). Only a few papers and group discussion on one movie.,1
"can't speak english, can't teach, can't clarify, can't understand.  If it wasn't because I am smart I would have failed the course.",0
had her for contemporary women writers. it drove me crazy listening to her speak. she said nothing of importance. i watched the clock that entire class...books were decent though.,1
"I took this for a Summer class and it goes fast. You have to write notes from his lecture and the test is all based on his lecture. I didn't even buy the book! His review before a test is very helpful. Well organized lectures and little stories to help you remember things which also makes it more interesting. Great teacher, passionate for history!",1
"This teachers spends over half of the class lecturing and it is far from interesting. She reads off of a powerpoint and will sometimes give in class activities. She also gives a lot of homework, but at least they are only graded based on participation. Her tests are hard and impossible to study for because of the large amount of notes taken.",0
"Completely unreasonable ochem class. First midterm average was a 20% and then is frustrated at the class rather than reflecting on his teaching methods. Second midterm, slightly more reasonable. Final? Completely foreign material. Claims to have covered it during lecture but as an attendee, it was not covered nearly enough. Avoid at all costs.",0
Nothing sems to be good enough for this professor.  Very hot and cold.,0
"Ryan is funny and entertaining, and his lectures on creativity are interesting. However, in person, Ryan can be condescending and critical. Sometimes, criticism is constructive and based on facts. Other times, he just has his own opinion of how things should work. Frequently made me feel stupid in emails. Just be tougher than he is.",1
Definitely the best professor I have ever had. He is incredibly passionate about Sociological Theory and genuinely cares about each of his students. I would retake Sociological Theory over and over again just to have it with him. It has really made me think a lot.,1
"Worst class I've honestly ever taken. Majority of the students failed due to the professor being very boring, off topic constantly, and confused.  Despite the fact that he is nice older gentleman, the stress level within the class IS NOT WORTH IT. Do not take this class unless your willing to cry after seeing your test scores.",0
I did not find this class helpful.  Most of the information we learned came right from a textbook.  We learned this material in health and wellness but have to take it for majors.,0
I took this class as a freshman which was a huge mistake. It is a 1400 level Course so I did not think it would be too bad. There is a lot of reading to do everyday and the daily quizzes lack a pattern so you do not know what to study. The word for word definitions are hard to memorize and it almost seems this course lacks conceptual learning.,0
"He's a great professor who loves what he does. His class requires work, but he's always willing to help.",1
"The single best professor I had during my time at Wheaton. My entire thought and philosophical focus has been shaped by Dr. Borden's classes, and I will be pursuing post-graduate studies in the fall. I cannot recommend her enough, both for future academics and those who want a gentle introduction to philosophy.",1
"He is a very helpful teacher, however if I didn't know the material beforehand, I would have had a very difficult time. He explains things way to fast. and tends to explain unnecessary material. However, he does offer a lot of extra credit!! IF YOUR NOT A CLASS PERSON, DONT TAKE HIM. Everyday you get 10 pts for being in class and you have a hw quiz",1
can't explain anything! all over the place. hard to ask him questions.,0
His teaching style is unique and really effective if the student has an open mind. You will become a better writer in his class. Great professor!,1
-Extremely condescending and rude. -Makes lots of generalizations. -Is not will to revisit assessments even to clarify what you could improve on. -Does not seem to value creativity. -Seems to think questions about the course content or dissenting opinions are a personal attack. -Do not challenge her if you want to get a good mark.,0
"Worse 101 to take @ NYIT. Do not take this professor, she gives at least 4 pages of notes per class. Makes you write essays from a book with garbage. Her mid term and final are stupid, you won't learn anything here. You be better off in a English class than her trash class. Oh yeah btw she has a project which is stupid along with final so GL.",0
"look elsewhere. bad experience, self learned entire course load.",0
I don't recommend this professor at all. In her class all she does is scan the book and read directly from it. I can do that in my room on my own time. I have learned nothing from her class. Now I have to find someone else to help me on my work. ,0
"good material & it should have been possible to get good marks on exam but it seems no matter how much u study she comes up with a way of killing your mark. knocking off half the marks of a ques on the mid-term for using a particular method, which nearly half the class used, makes me think that she's been confusing alot of students?!",0
One of the best teachers at UNC.,1
Shon is a great person and really does care about his students however his teaching style is very hit or miss. He puts excel on the board and tells us to print it out so we can write out our own notes on it but his edits throughout the class are too much and hard to keep up with. I learned more from teaching it to myself than from class.,1
"I have had her for 2 classes now and want to take as many as possible with her. She is a great professor, really knows her topics. She is very approachable and always willing to help students. Her classes are interesting, but you must put in a good amount of effort to get  an A",1
"Professor Rita is nice and she picks really cool films (if you take the writing in the disciplines film focused class) such as Fight Club and Kill Bill. You have ONE assignment due each month, and it is a paper on the films she makes you watch and it is tied into the sections of the textbook you have to read (which can be found online free pdf).",1
"the material was hard, but i wouldn't blame professor sullivan for that.  blame newton.",1
"Bad professor, bad man",0
DO NOT TAKE HIM AT ALL COST. He is horrible!!! Everything in class was all general forms with almost no examples. His homework covers only some of what he teaches in class and none of it comes from the textbook. His test are just as bad as his homework. Hopefully this is his last semester so no one else has to suffer. ,0
Great teacher. I took his courses every chance I got.,1
I wish didn't have to take this class. I felt like I drew the same trees for most of the semester and it bored me to tears. I suck at art & I still wished we did something more challenging. Most of the projects are geared toward 3-d for 1/2 of the semester(??) He's nice but you do not leave feeling you learned anything.,0
"Her notes did nothing to clarify the very labyrinthine textbook she had chosen for us. She even apologized for the choice just before handing out our course evaluation sheets. The tutorials had little to no overlap with the lectures, and the final essay in this 100-LEVEL CLASS consisted of finding a contradiction in a Harvard graduate's thesis.",0
"Nicest professor ever. However, spent more time being lectured on how to present rather than actually presenting. Tests are based on the book you never even speak of in class, and the presentations are decently easy to bull as long as you fit in the time limit. Didnt get better at presenting. Nice women, okay teacher, weird class structure.",1
"I don't understand how he got so many good reviews. Give a lots of homeworks which is only 20%. He is not a good lecturer as well. Give 2 projects and 2nd project is too difficult, and he did not curve as well. 100% not recomemded.",0
86% of the grade is made up of 4 exams. Make sure that you watch the lectures and understand the material because 1 bad exam can destroy your grade. The homework is really easy and can help you a lot for the exams. Lectures were all pre-recorded and posted online each week.,1
"Amazing professor! Your grade is made up by 7 quizzes, 1 final, 1 group project, 1 lab project and extra credit. ,Microbiology is a tough subject but he gives you the tools you need and is fair in grading. Responds to emails and answers questions. I would absolutely recommend him!!",1
She is not a good professor and not willing to devote time to help her students. She has certain racial bias towards some students.,0
"I was Valedictorian in HS, now I'm getting a C in his intro math course. He clearly shows he doesnt respect students, he wrongly marked 1 of my test answers incorrect then when I showed it to him again he claimed I changed my answer after he handed it back to try to cheat. He cant admit when hes wrong & our grades suffer for his ego.",0
The man will type code on a screen and not explain anything in a way that someone at beginner level could ever understand. DO NOT take his class if you want to learn anything of substance.,0
His lecture is useless and seldom reply email. It is CMPT225 but 50% of the content I felt like CMPT125. It is better to just reading the book and study at home. His quizzes are very boring (one question testing induction proof) and lack of marking standard. The average of quiz is about 60%. Just go for another professor...,0
An excellent professor who is wise in her opinions. The only way for this professor to have ANY bad rating at all would be for the student to NOT follow directions- which I didn't. I can still compliment this professor on her professionalism and wonderful understanding of the world. Beautiful inside and out- she never struggles to keep it real.,1
"Felizzi is a GREAT professor. He cares deeply about his students and the SW profession. Quizzes have unlimited attempts, don't need the book(s) and gives excellent feedback on papers. Felt he was a very fair grader. He wants to see a lot of class participation and focuses quite a bit on clinical social work. Would take him again in a heartbeat!",1
"I really enjoyed Lalondes class and he makes it really fun to attend because he finds interesting videos or clips that help you understand the content better. This class was ALL tests and maybe a few other assignments, but the tests were also fair and had no surprises. He told you exactly what would be on the exam beforehand too",1
It was hard to get the important points from his lectures that were often boring. His grading was unnecessarily harsh for an introductory level course. The average for every assignment was lower than for any class. I would not recommend to anyone taking the class for fun. Made me feel uncomfortable and incompetent when I tried to get help.,0
terrible,0
"I want to preface this by saying that Reichstein is a really nice guy. But sometimes I wonder if he's not suffering the early signs of dementia. Very unclear -- everyone hates his lectures. HOWEVER, he's not responsible for the content of tests or assignments. That's Louis Nel. So don't blame him. They switched to a language he doesn't even know!",0
"He can be very rude and make you feel like you're stupid when you ask a simple question. He was in my lab throughout the whole semester and was not of much help. He is a tough grader on assignments and doesn't help much. Luckily, there are no tests in the class.",0
ok,1
The homework is about as much fun as getting your teeth pulled out. Take the class when you have the time to do over 18 hours of homework a week. Oh wait your most likely an engineer and dont have that time in the first place.,0
HILARIOUS! This is the funniest teacher I have EVER met. He made jokes all the time and was just hilarious. He had wonderful curves and did a great job giving us chances for extra credit and help. Great teacher!,1
"I thought he was very good at explaining things, and he genuinely cared about your learning.His notes were good, and his exam was fair.",1
"She favors people, so becareful. Participation is mandatory. She favors through participation.",0
"At first the class can seem like a nightmare since it is very quiz heavy in the beginning and you're forced to get out of your comfort zone. Honestly though, he's a really nice guy and an easy grader as long as you put in effort. He doesn't want to grade tough or fail anyone, just actually try and you'll get an A",1
"cannot speak spanish well, needs to go to Spain for a year. very easy, nothing bothers him, how did he get this gig? how does he keep it? take any of his classes if you have a heavy course load and just want an A with no learning spanish",0
Very disrespectful!  She told everyone to drop her class the first day.  She told students they should have nothing else going on in their lives because her class takes priority.  Then she told everyone to drop her class...again.,0
"Regret taking her pilates, very picky person. though she's dedicated it's way over the top, especially for something students are just taking as an extra curricular exercise. She comes off as rude. when I emailed her for clarification on an assignment, she told me to look at the syllabus even though I had and was the reason I had even emailed her",0
"As many have said, Dr. Vega is a great guy, but he is the most unorganized professor I have taken, junior college included. His lecture notes are a mess, direction and instruction are unclear, and his quizzes/tests are no better. Be prepared for up to a grade drop, and know it isn't your fault. Show up, ask q's, do your best .",0
"Easy, easy, easy.. I only went to class once a week and got an A.  She's a great person! You'll LOVE her!",1
Grading criteria very very unclear. Short answers on tests are really awful. She did not post past tests/resources. She only made the launch pad available. No feedback on tests. Took 2 weeks to mark a test that was online with only 3 short answers. I wish she was more caring...,0
"Not the worst class I've ever taken, but it's tough. I wouldn't take it for an elective. His French accent is tough to understand, and the exams are tough- especially the essay questions. I would use Nittany Notes to study and DEFINITELY read the book. Don't skip Friday classes because you might miss a pop quiz.",0
She is super intelligent but is a unfairly hard grader.,0
Careless . Do not check online class discussions. Ran away from him.,0
"Definitely one of the most hilarious professors at Georgia Tech along with Greco and Simpkins. Lecture was always entertaining since Leahy likes to add humor to them and the topics are actually really cool imo. Quizzes, timed labs, and the final are definitely fair if you understand the material. The only downside is that some of the homeworks were",1
Professor Zagreda is an amazing professor to have just to be more aware of the world around you. She only gave a midterm and a final. If you go to her class you'll feel inspired when you leave. She's an amazing professor - don't take her for granted at all. Don't miss any opportunity in that class! I wish I could have her again.,1
"If human anatomy is the field you're going into, this is the prof to take. She has a consistent method of teaching that she stands by, and has amazing, depersonalized rapport with her students. She will even write you a professional letter of rec if you take the sequential anatomy lab internship class! I learned everything I know from this one. GL!",1
"if you can manage to stay out of your own head, and off your phone, all while being open minded you will learn a lot.",1
"Absolute WORST teacher I've ever had as a student. Very rude, does not email back, and even if he does, he does not give an answer. Mr. Cross does not use any type of technology, he doesn't even give an outline as to what we are talking about. Attendance is mandatory because of daily quizzes. DO NOT take him unless it is absolutely necessary!!!!",0
Personable; delivers lectures well w/ a mixture of textbook knowledge/general academic consensus as well as personal opinions. Had difficulty taking notes because he reads off notes speedily w/o explanation (containing references which I don't understand/can't catch). Will answer Qs though but only if you ask. Marks fairly.,1
"Weil is a terrible professor and really is not a teacher. He's a bully and gives zero feedback on papers. Watch your word count, yes he counts words and doesn't read your content of your assignments if they don't have enough word count. He's pompous and ego driven (his ego) BEWARE of this professor and do NOT take him for a class!",0
doesn't know how to give proper instructions for the test,0
By far my least favorite professor at MU. Gives a cocky and arrogant vibe like he's the greatest thing since sliced bread. Learned a lot in his class and he makes sure you know the material though. Will help if you ASK. Don't get me wrong he is a smart man that knows his stuff. I just wouldn't take him again.,0
"She's so great!  always helpful, always clear, always ready to explain something.  Fair, too.  I mean, the material's not easy, but when you actually study it, her exams are fair.",1
"By far the weirdest professor Ive ever had, super awkward and mumbles during lectures. I had emailed him asking about extra credit as I had an 89.3 and he just responded with No. I recommend finding another processor if you actually want to feel engaged in lecture and want someone that the other students also respect.",0
"Good lecturer, knows her stuff, slides are fairly straightforward and corresponds with the textbook. Exams are fair. She's kind of got an annoying voice though - I felt like she was always yelling at us!",1
"Bus160 with Cathy is the way to go. If you miss less than 3 classes you get extra credit. The tests are super easy, even if you just show up to class. Lectures are basically what the test is. She makes you get the book but unless you plan on reading the chapters you don't really need it. Only 4 tests, final is not cumulative.",1
"When he gives criteria for essays, double every quantity and you'll get a B, guaranteed, if you ever get a grade back for it. If you can avoid him, do so. Sometimes he won't put due dates on things in canvas just so he can copy paste his format and do the least amount of work then canvas doesn't show you have anything to do. He should be fired.",0
"I wish it were mandatory for university teachers to have a degree in education because he is the perfect example of a ""teacher"" who would benefit from it. He is superficial, disorganize, lazy. You are a fool if you think he teaches economics.",0
I'd highly recommend taking her for RWS305W. You only have to write two essays (4-5 pgs each) and have one group project at the end. She starts off with the hardest essay which makes the class easier as the year goes on. Lecture can be kind of boring sometimes but it's hard to entertain at 7pm... She always let us out 15m-60m early. Really nice too,1
"He is a nice guy, but he really sucks at teaching. On the study guide, he only gives us the names of artwork and thats all. He talks a lot, and introduces the topic in a really boring way. Its very difficult to study for his exams. He thinks that everyone likes art as much as he does. Overall, not a good professor, and I dont recommend him.",0
Poor clarification in regards to assignments given.  Class is boring and down not provide many benefits to the student.  Professor often contradicted what she was teaching by how she would act in and outside of the classroom.,0
If you are not a science major you might want to choose another professor. Tests are hard!,0
I LOVED THIS CLASS! Please do yourself a favor and take her writing class! Easily my favorite teacher I've ever had at BYU. She made writing fun and was so inspirational. Her feedback on papers was incredible and she really cares to see all of her students succeed. She not only taught writing but also just makes you want to be a better person.,1
"Really great prof. He explains class material very clearly, and he is very humorous. The class loves him. And in general a very nice person.",1
"Most boring class. Long lectures, 2hr 45min. He is confusing and all over the place. Assigns three ""cumulative"" portfolios with 6 papers each, they make up one big one. Lots of extra credit opportunities.  Didn't learn much in this class. Also one group project on a communicable illness that's an hour long. 1/6 grade is attending presentations. ",0
She is a great lecture,1
do not take this class if possible,0
Math is hard to teach and hard to make super enjoyable. This man here is amazing. Exams are very fair and he goes the extra mile to make sure we understand stuff. Probably my favorite prof to date.,1
Great lectures however the tests are graded completely unfairly by his group of 4 other graders so there is no consistency.  if you can afford the high probability of a C  the material is worth it.,1
He is good at explaining things and his notes are crystal clear and covers everything you need (you don't even need to come to class as long as you read his slides). However the assignments and midterm are quite tricky and he gives quite a lot of assignments compared to other profs.,1
"wonderful teacher, one of those classes that you look foward to going to.  would take her again if i had the chance.  if you go to class at least 60% of the time and do the readings you'll do just fine.",1
Dr. Kennedy is hands down one of the best profs at SMU. She is genuinely one of the nicest people and grades fairly. She also understands how challenging the online only learning platform is and checks in with students on a regular basis. She is very clear with what she expects and I would recommend taking her to anyone! :),1
"Ken's unclear notes (which you MUST complete in class), his insufficient use of practice questions, and his round-about lectures are frustrating.  He also spends too much time talking about teaching and learning instead of effectively instructing students.   The material is easy but many have difficulty with his testing methods.",0
"Professor Adams gives very delayed feedback and is not good with responding to inquiries. There are unclear expectations for assignments, yet she grades harshly. Very critical. ",0
"One of my favorite professors! She makes the dry materials interesting, very organized and super nice!",1
"She's nice, understanding, and just wants you to participate and do your work.",1
Interesting class but the tests are HARD! Both books are super boring too.,1
She'd erase something she put on the board 2 or 3 times. Doesn't understand the problems she puts on webassign and doesn't use the textbook. She didn't know how to answer students questions,0
Took Intro to Poetry and she really is a fantastic teacher but beware of exams! They can be tough so you have to know all the material front and back. Quizzes every class. Must take detailed notes all the time to pass! Fully explains what is needed to succeed. Learned a lot and enjoyed the subject material but be prepared to work for your grade.,1
310 is a tough class but Debruine didn't make it any easier.... He excepts you to just read the chapter in the textbook before class and know how to do it. His lectures are so disorganized and confusing. My notes are just random numbers that I don't know where they came from because he goes so fast.,0
Her lectures are a regurgitation of the textbook. Instead of explaining proofs she writes duh on the board and moves very fast through material. Tests are extremely hard and she encourages people to withdraw. The only way to do well in this class is if you have seen this material before. This is my 4th math class at Duke & by far the worst.,0
"Professor Gooch leads the most boring, monotone, off topic lectures i have ever attended.  Powerpoints are loaded with text, and he jumps between slides as he talks.  If you take this course, be prepared to teach yourself the material.  This class would have been much easier as well as more interesting with a different professor.",0
"Test on the syllabus, 1 post and 2 discussion board replies gets a ""C"" grade, wasn't clear with due date when assigning the first paper. She made it sound as though it were due the 2nd week but it wasn't actually due till the 4th week. ",0
"Everyone is so weird about SMAD101. It really isn't that hard of a class. All you have to do is listen and take really good notes during the lecture, and actually READ the book and take notes on the chapters on your own. Dr. Soenksen is a great lecturer and cares about you doing well. He's always willing to help. Always do the extra credit!",1
"Is just an ok professor.  I thought he was unorganized and did not teach the class that well, but is a good person and will help you with what you need.  Classes weren't engaging.  Tests were straight forward, but watch out for the reading quizzes.",0
"the material for this class was very dry! there is no homework  and you do not need a text book either. There is a quiz EVERY week on the material but he does tell you what it will cover. take advantage of making notes on an index card and using it on the weekly quizzes.  Overall, good eye candy.",0
His lass has nothing to do with the tests. Tests were HARD. You have to teach yourself this class with the book.,0
"Worst professor I've ever taken. Doesn't teach anything. Midterms don't make sense, and grades it on clearly you've written your answer. Takes points away even if your answer is right because it's not written clearly. Don't take this guy",0
Lecture on Digital Signal Processing were very poor teaching style. The assignments were obscure and the objectives were not clear. Need change in teaching style and improvements on assignment requirements.,0
"He is very intelligent, which can make it hard for him to articulate what's going on inside his head. Definitely recommend having prior calculus knowledge, but he gives sample tests which are very similar to the real test, drops your lowest test grade, and is very fair. If he makes the test too hard, he will curve to compensate. DO NOT take Jesse!!",1
Gives 4 Essays and 1 final exam hes a very hard grader. All we talked about were poems hes mean and out of 30 students 10 were left at the end of the semester and max 5 passed the class. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS,0
sort of my mentor. It's pass/fail and he just lets you loose with a camera,1
"The most loquacious ""professor"" I ever had to work with. Never go over homework or tests/exams in class. Does not give you the right answers and methodology after all. His words do not make sense overall. We never did a review in class, not even for the final exam which we have huge amount of chapters. Highly recommended to avoid him any way possib",0
Lovric is a really great prof and genuinely cares about his students passing but he can be hard to follow during lectures so his teaching style isn't for everyone. He posts all his lecture notes but they're hard to understand if you don't go to class. Do the assignments and homework!!! A lot of the questions were repeated in the tests,1
"BORING!  I rarely skip classes but when it came to this one, you had to pay me to go...unless there was a test.  I have a friend that likes to call her the ""Puritan"" because she is soooo dull.  Also, she practically erases the notes as she writes them so you can never get them down.",0
Her Class is worth used toilet paper. Her class is entertaining but is useless in the test. The Books had nothing to do with the test. I do not understand why there is such a high ratio of people saying that she is great. only 2 students of the class really got into arguing and all that but the rest just sat there.,0
"Good teacher, tough tests. Study hard",1
"Really bad teacher, doesn't know how to teach",0
"No doubt he's very knowledgeable in the subject, but he expects way too much of his students. Each assignment takes 8-12 hours to finish and the final project is almost impossible. Also most of the final exam was on stuff we had never even seen before...",0
"Sincerely the most helpful professor I've had. He wants everyone to pass which is nice. Quizzes everyday kind of annoying but better than papers, they're quick and easy ways to boost your average. Would recommend but this does require some work and thinking.",1
"Friggin hilarious prof, great classes. Overuse of the ""cat"" ""dog"" ""aardvark"" functions, and the phrase ""spirit of calculus"". Definitely recommended.",1
"The most interesting class I've ever taken. You cover the medical field, midwives, contraception, conception, 3 trimesters of pregnancy, labor, birth, and post-partum, pregnancy in other countries. Class is non-judgemental, everyone is welcome, and acknowledges that people giving birth are not only women. I highly recommend this class even for fun",1
"Cogan is a real funny man but his lectures are kind of confusing because he teaches while he is showing videos. He requests papers that are about 3 or more pages long when the material is real short , so you would have to make up some things to occupy more space in your papers",1
"The course pack is interesting but her lectures are disorganized, she interrupts students, she doesn't clearly tie together readings+films+lectures and despite the class goal of countering eurocentrism she kinda falls into that trap sometimes.",1
"Dr. Falvo is INCREDIBLE.  He is very skilled in Alexander Technique, which means lessons are full of life advice, relaxation, and GREAT music making.  Falvo stresses that music is about opening yourself up to the art and magic of it; not nervousness and sweating and crying and ""I have to get this right.""  INCREDIBLE!  But you HAVE to put in work!",1
"She allows the possibility of getting a decent mark in her class but what has really discouraged me from her is that fact that she swears, yells/screams, and talks down on students. I know life is hard, so there is no need to make it any harder Hitay!",0
"Paul's by far one of my favorite professors; his passion for art is truly motivating and he is inspiring only if you care to decipher art and the philosophy behind it. He's vague on what is expected out of projects simply because he wants us to think for ourselves and find our own process in art. But once you get to know him, it's an easy A.",1
"He might seem intimidating the first class, but Professor Fisher is one of the nicest professors there is! I only had him for o-chem lab but his lectures in lab were interesting and he was very thorough. He is a fair grader and simply wants his students to succeed. Don't be shy, ask questions! He is willing to help you in any way he can. ",1
"I really enjoyed Tom's class! He loves the subject and it is so clear that he does. This makes it that much easier to show up and read his lectures. The class was online, and he posted about 2 lectures per week to read. There was a total of 4 writing assignments that make up the grade. If you give your responses in-depth thought, you will do well.",1
Stupid class,0
"If you are an easily-offended special flower, you may be more comfortable in another class. Tom Keville doesn't mind sharing his opinions, nor does he suffer fools gladly! However, if you are made of sterner stuff and you care about history, you are in for some excellent learning. Keville is a fine lecturer who knows his subject up & down. Love it.",1
Terrible prof! Nice guy and I think his heart is in the right place but not worth the money I spent on this course. Misses class.  He doesn't use eclass or textbooks but he will flood your email inbox with a ton of documents. He never returned our second critical analysis.  (think he lost it!) He is extremely disorganized.,0
"Show up to class on time, attendance is tracked in the beginning of class on a sheet of paper. Just pay attention and you'll pass. Follow along with the syllabus so you're prepared for the upcoming chapters, tests, quizzes. Easy A",1
u cant get a good mark on her exams even if u study,1
He is the cutest old man ever and he's so funny! He really doesn't teach the material but your homework is webassigns which he lets you do in class and if you have any questions he is always happy to answer it. The course is basic stat and algebra so honestly it shouldn't be that hard anyway. Just find a friend to study with and you'll be fine!,1
"THIS GUY. oh lord. let me sum it up by giving you a question on our final exam: ""If a square loop of wire is placed at a normal to a magnetic field, AND THE SQUARE TURNS INTO A CIRCLE AT A RATE OF..."" ... wtf, bro. that's not physics. that's magic.",1
"He gets to be confusing in class and goes fast. He will tell you to stop him if you don't understand, but if you actually do it, he'll look at you like you're the dumbest thing on earth. He calls out on students, so pay attention. Tests are the insanely hard and too long. ",0
"Terrible prof, very anal retentive about minor issues. Goes through content too fast then wastes time talking about her son. She missed a class due to personal reasons and rescheduled the class on a Friday during a time where others may have had classes. And then she refused to post the notes of that class online. Take with someone else if you can",0
There is no point in coming to class. His tests are based on the sample exam but some numbers are changed. If you know how to do the sample exam you will pass. All he does in class is long winded proofs and refuses to work out problems. He doesn't give partial credit of tests and you must to the problems exactly as he does or you won't get credit.,0
"Too many pointless, time and paper wasting assignments. Boring class which is only offered for 2 hrs and 45 min",0
"I have her now and I want out. She's nasty with her students and gives a tremendous amount of ""busy work"".",0
"Best teacher Ive had at Concordia and ever! Made me want to study even more than I had to, it was clear what he expected and there was no grey area. If you did what he asked, no reason to not get a very good grade.",1
"Excellent professor! He made everything very clear. He's clearly knowledgeable and is very helpful when you need him. He'll like you if you come to every class and participate. You can easily get an A if you do your readings and go to his office hours for help. He'll make you a better analyzer and please don't use the verb ""to be.""",1
"He's passionate & knowledgeable about what he teaches. However due to this he tends to go pretty fast over the course content (don't slack). To add to that, nothing in his class is graded except for 3 tests over the course of the semester, so you're going to have to be conscious about everything. Tests are predictable & short, graded forgivingly.",1
"Super unorganized, especially because half of this class was online. Very unclear about assignments and what he wants in your papers. Barely answers emails. I am a student that normally received a 3.5 or higher in classes but I currently have a 3.0 in this class for no reason. He takes off random points but does not give any feedback as to why. ",0
"Onderdonk is great. Comes across a bit...strange at the beginning but he loves his music and is really knowledgable. There are some things I felt he skipped over for less important things but that's just me. It's a really fun class. If you love music like me, the listening tests are easy. Chances are you'll know most of the songs anyway.",1
"She is clearly very knowledgeable and passionate about the content she teaches. However, she is an extremely hard grader and even though she tells you exactly what she wants it's almost impossible to actually please her. Her class is interesting but don't expect to get an amazing grade.",1
"If you must take this course, here's some advice: DO NOT listen to what the TA and prof say about failing the midterm-I swear they WANT students to freak out. All that is difficult is the format. If you complete the hw and understand it, the exams are simply re-worded hw probs. Do practice problems and don't depend on excel formulas to do them.",0
This lady is horrible most of the time. She definitely does not like it when you have your own opinion and will definitely make you feel dumb. Go to class ALL THE TIME or you will definitely miss out. Take advantage of doing assignments over again if you can. Think like her&you'll be fine. This class was definitely the definition of hard work.,0
"Everyone says that Dave's classes are tough but you learn so much and that makes it worth it. I disagree with the latter part. The classes are indeed very tough. However, I did not learn a significant amount from this class. I feel that I learned less from this class than other classes I took that same semester. The final project was very difficult",0
"Had review sessions for every quiz and test. Lots of work, but every genetics class is. If you have to take genetics, take him!",1
"He is a good professor.  His tests are very memorization based, but if you know what to study they aren't too bad.  He really means well and cares about the students.  The further from gen eds that you get, the better his classes get.",1
Should be a required course.  Everyone needs to know this stuff. Passionate teacher.  Great use of photos and videos.,1
Arnold is not the most efficient teacher when it comes to her class. She assigns long papers and then takes over two months just to correct them. She is also a narrow minded teacher and only accepts views that are similar to hers. I wouldn't recommend a class with her.,0
This class material is hard to grasp BUT  Michelle makes it easy. I wouldn't take this class with anyone else.,1
Very combative with students and Very unhelpful answering questions. Terrible class to take. Do not take her classes.,0
"Worst teacher I've had! the simple fact is she doesn't teach the material at all. She may be intelligent herself, but she doesn't teach at all. 95% of the time your working on the weekly labs, and essentially struggling to teach yourself. Don't even bother taking this course with her, I'd expect a ""teacher"" to actually ""teach"" in class. Time wasted",0
"Extremely&unnecessarily rude, disrespectful,& condescending.Gives no explanation for harsh grading, plays favorites, &will find something wrong with virtually any student comment regardless of its accuracy or insight.Accuses of plagiarism on a whim.Stimulates absolutely no interest in the field if one had no prior inclination towards it.Worst ever.",0
"We're not getting our BDM marks for 3 weeks (when we already know our final marks in several other commerce classes) simply because this guy is too lazy to write another final for the make-up exam. Based on the way he taught this entire course, I don't think anyone is surprised by this blatant display of apathy toward his students.",0
"Has a very hard time explaining concepts clearly. An inexcusable amount of typos and mistakes on power points and even exams. Really should not be teaching, she's more of a chemist than a professor. Very nice person to talk to though, lovely lady.",0
"A fantastic professor, however he is unable to teach or communicate. Easy midterms but BRUTAL final",0
"This man wants you to learn. He doesn't want you to suffer, he too understands that this is probably the hardest class at AC. He will go out of his way to make sure you understand a concept. Of all the professors at AC, he believes in redemption, and that a bad grade can always be redeemed through hard work and practice. Just ask him for help!",1
Made the course EXTREMELY frustrating.,0
His class was the first time I took a Bible 101 class from. I don't know where these folks get the idea this guy was easy. I think I would have enjoyed this class if it wasn't for memorizing the KJV Bible verses. I think I got 100 twice out of 20 memory verses. Epic fail! :(,1
"Worst. Teacher. I've. Ever. Had. Without a doubt one of the most condescending, narcissistic, sexist, homophobic jerks I've ever had the displeasure of meeting. He somehow always finds a way to unnecessarily include his god awful thoughts and beliefs in his lessons, which have NOTHING to do with math. I hope I never have to see him again.",0
Terrible. Had him during summer session and refused to curve the class despite more than half the class failing/getting D's. He's one of the professors that give lehigh's math department a terrible rating. Tests are ridiculously hard and not curved! DO NOT TAKE ANYTHING HE TEACHES!!!,0
worst BUAD prof.,0
"I honestly thought he was a bad teacher t first from all the previous rates, but I think hes a really good teacher and seems like he cares what hes teaching to the students. I know sometimes he might be confused about what hes doing but he always gets back on track.",1
"Easy A, but her voice is dreadful to listen to. I stopped reading the textbook and attending zoom lectures about halfway in. Just take someone else if you have the option.",0
"Overall very nice guy, unfortunately that doesn't help you in the class. He explains more of why calc works, not how to actually do it.  Have to think very hard on exams, making them hard to do good. He does curve exams though, and excludes lowest HW quiz and lab. MUST GO TO CLASS 100%! I feel he goes above and beyond what is required for Calc I.",1
He is hilarious! You can learn a lot from him.,1
"This is by far the easiest college professor Ive ever had. He explains everything very simply and you dont even need to take notes. The week before tests, he hands out a review and a take home test that are virtually identical to the exams! And you get to use them for reference on your exams! Only math professor I would ever take!",1
"Excellent professor, not afraid to speak his mind.  May come off as abrasive and may debate with you but he is not mean-spirited. I believe it is meant more to challenge you to defend your beliefs. My C+ was my fault, not his.",1
Lecture was clear but tough grader + super hard assignments that consume a lot of time to complete,0
she was supposed to help student by giving more time in exam but no she don't think this is all new for all of us and should give more time in exams every other prof give atleast 3 hours but she gave 1 and half for more than 50 question which is hard for an average students. hate this prof,0
Incredibly frustrating professor. His tests are nearly impossible to pass. He also blames you for not putting enough time studying for it despite the fact that almost the entire class fails the tests. The only thing that saves the class is the opportunity to prove your skills through projects.,0
"Craig is a great guy, but he did very poorly as a teacher. He spent most of class telling stories and trying to tie them in, often failing to use class time effectively. He somehow managed to narrow the scope of business ethics down until it was almost entirely about the environment. Do not take one of his classes unless you are interested in that.",0
"This guy is the WORST professor here at NCSU. But the bad part is, he has tenure. He doesn't teach, he just reads the notes in class. He over explains things that really don't matter. He makes you feel like an idiot and a failure when you go to his office hours. I never fell asleep in a class, but I practically fell asleep in every class.",0
I LOVE PROFESSOR CARINA!!! she's soo awesome she lets you be yourself all the time even in your essays. She only gives short assignments every week and gives some reading that ARE NOT BORING! and she gave a short report by the end of the semester and THAT' IT! participate and be yourself and do small work and that's it. She's really funny + awesome,1
I can't believe this guy is teaching 400 level. Only thing I am going to trust him to do is to hit on coeds.,0
"one of the worst prof ever.  Especially his attitude towards students who need help, he just ignore the emails and don't reply phone calls.  Students who can't keep up, he looks down at them.  I totally hate him",0
Dr Buck is a very nice man and has an open mind. He is very helpful.,1
"She is a great individual and person but has questionable teaching tactics in my eyes. 7pt scale, tough grader with no explanation when things are wrong (makes it hard to know where to improve) some goals of this class seemed unrealistic and a waste of time. Other than that is was fun. She is the only BCOMM teacher that does a group project.",1
Wonderful!,1
This class was required. The class consists of 4 tests and 2 assignments. So there isn't room for error. Difficult to comprehend and very monotone. If I had a choice I would not take this class.,0
"The worst professor I have ever had. He does not care about the online class at all, does not answer emails or messages. Do whatever you have to do to avoid taking him.",0
"Ann is awesome! She is hilarious. Our grade was based on 30 online tests through Connect, which you have access to the book and the internet for. I love her real life stories that connects the material to real life. If you're looking for a really easy-going professor, a good grade, and some new knowledge. Definitely take her!",1
"Very tough grader. Its evident how he tries to nail key Calculus concepts into your head. Workload is monumental. Hes a great person and will walk you through it, but will make you think more than anything. I thin thats his main thing is to make you think. Anyways, tons of work and deadlines will hit you in the face if behind. best of luck",1
You don't feel comfortable at all when asking him a question. There's only 3 test and a comprehensive final so there's little room for error. I don't suggest taking him unless you want your GPA to drop.,0
doesn't know what he is doing some of the time....awful public speaker.,0
"Julie gaudet is an awful teacher. She makes the minimal effort required, and I cannot even call it teaching. I had her for a research course. The course was so poorly put together, and Julie did not help. Any questions asked by students she would say ""it's in the textbook"". Her required readings for lessons did not match what she gives on exams.",0
"Cannot follow along during lectures, as he doesn't explain while he writes. Homework is awful, as MATLAB literally doesn't help you in the class and doesn't relate to anything you do in class. Pray you have a good TA to help you understand.",0
"Had her for org comm last semester, great instructor. At first I wasn't sure what the class would be about but it ended up being awesome. I learned a ton and this class really opens your eyes to organizations. Class is based HEAVY in the book, be ready to read, but you will certainly know what is expected of you.",1
"Honestly his voice makes you wanna sleep tough grader so many readings and things you dont even need , goes outside topic let his emotions show to much .",0
"He doesn't give any homework, but thats no reason to take the class. He takes points off on the tests as he pleases. He also does not give notes, but expects you to get everything he says.  If you stop paying attention for even one minute, you're going to get lost and miss a ton of notes. He does not give out study guides.",0
Jim is an awesome professor. He goes over everything you NEED to know for Social Work. No busy work or beating around the bush!,1
Brilliant guy but terrible teacher. He made students feel stupid when they asked questions and huge curve due to poor teaching ability. I would not recommend anyone having him as a teacher.,0
"I think Wills a good guy, but hes probably the most annoying grader Ive ever had in any subject. Quizzes are worth 50% which is fine but you either get 100% or a big fat 0% and the most annoying part is he doesnt even correct it, no comments, no red pen, no nothing. When something is worth 50% of my grade I expect a little feedback...",0
"Best teacher hands down! If you attend class, you will surely receive at least an A. Notes are given, all you have to do is fill in the blanks.",1
"He is rude. I asked him to answer symble questions that I was not understanding. So I asked a symple question about an exam that is coming up. I asked ""what can I study for this quiz specifically, so that I do not study the wrong thing"". Simple enough. He said ""I am not answering any other questions"" which I thought was rude.",0
really nice lady.  she started out every class with a prayer and really cared about you sometimes though she was over the top dramatic.  if you want a speech class that doesn't have many speeches this is the one for you we only had one speech but her tests are really hard you really have to study.  not an easy A like gen eds should be.,1
"One of my favorite classes I've taken. I loved how she focused it on materialism, very interesting! You have homework due by every class that's a response to an article she chooses. She isn't the easiest grader so make sure to spend time on the responses and essays. Lots of group work, about 4-5 essays and a video project.",1
"This class was really interesting and great for people who may not be interested by most history classes. Show up to every class, do the readings, and submit your work on time, and you should succeed in this class while also enjoying it! Sigal is a great professor and guy - would definitely recommend this course!",1
Best teacher I have ever had!!! Really helpful and explains material very well. I have taken 3 classes with her. Really strict about attendance but def worth it!!!!!,1
"Shes pretty nice and I understood alot of the things, but when it came to certain types of science she just wasn't very clear about it. The workload can get too heavy soemtimes.",0
"Doctor Weiner is a very tough teacher to have for such a tough class. More than half of my class dropped the class before it even hit half the semester. I had a huge issue with him and that's why I dropped. He screamed at me in front of the whole class and didn't even let me explain what happened. After that, he constantly brought it up.",0
"She grades super hard and wants you to show your work for every single step, even the painfully simple ones. She puts complicated problems on quizzes and tests and makes them longer than necessary. Nobody has enough time to finish them. She is also very absentminded during lecture and makes lots of errors, erases much of her notes and rewrites them",0
Extremely unhelpful and cancelled office hours frequently.  Tests were very difficult and had questions that weren't anything like our homework or lecture examples.  He used different notation and equations than our textbook which made following him in lecture difficult.  Doesn't post any lecture notes or solutions to homework or tests online.   ,0
"loved sauter! he makes the classroom very comfortable for giving speeches and introduces you to many fun mediums (radio, tv broadcast studio, audio editing).  very fair grader. super nice guy.",1
"Just the worst. Had her for Bio 244 lab. All she does it read off of the powerpoint and if you have a question her usual answer is, I don't know. Weekly quizzes have nothing to do with what you did in class the week before. Avoid at all costs.",0
Very opinionated and rude. Does not care what he says. Makes you feel horrible after leaving his class,0
"There is a lot of material and it is pretty difficult but he does a great job of explaining everything. I suggest reading over the textbook after the lecture.   He gave three tests, all multiple choice. He's a fair grader and he has a great sense of humor. He's probably the best stats professor at STJ.",1
Glad you enjoyed the thesis ED!!!!!!!,0
Professor Pestana was a really cool guy who is always willing to help his students. The class is all lectures and the notes can get a little crazy. There's three take home exams and a final paper. Attendance isn't mandatory but the more you show up the better. Philosophy isn't exactly easy for everyone but Professor Pestana makes it easier.,1
"Take this guy. Not too much homework, and he was my the most caring teacher I had this semester.",1
"Just because her name rhymes with hell doesn't mean that her lab is. Far from it in fact. She will respond surprisingly fast to e-mails (worryingly even, I mean come on, play hard to get at least a bit), explain the information clearly, and is very knowledgeable. Go with Rishel, and it'll all be swell.",1
"I took Dr. Burt not knowing his class was a flipped classroom, meaning all the lectures were online and done outside of class, but honestly it was a blessing since his class is an 8am. You meet only on Wednesday unless theres a test then you meet Monday and Wednesday. His test arent that bad and quizzes are super easy.",1
I really liked that he actually went to the places he was telling us about. The only complaint I have is that he would sometimes scatter through the material that would eventually be on the exam. He also added a lot of extra 'trivia' that I studied but never showed up on the exam. Other than that I totally recommend Thomas.,1
"Easy course as long as you take good lecture notes, keep up with homework and use the handouts he provides for tests. Remember calculator functions because tests will be easy A/B's if you use them. Doesn't answer emails, but answers questions in class and goes over anything you ask.",1
"In this class, we did one chapter reading each week, plus a worksheet and quiz. It isn't hard, and if you do have any questions Dr Lima is readily available by email to help. Gives great feedback, and exams are a breeze.",1
"Useless as an advisor and professor, does not believe in his students. His appearance and approach is unprofessional and not worth dealing with. Stay away from this professor as long as you can. Very poor quality, and uncooperative. I dropped my education major because of him. EDUC 271, 150,",0
"She is an amazing teacher. I looked forward to going to class each day. There are 3 question quizzes almost every day, so reading the textbook is important. She is quick to respond by email for questions and is very understanding if you have something going on. I really liked her and she truly cared about each of her students!",1
"The class itself isn't too hard, except for the last month or so. He just makes it miserable to take. I had to teach myself/get my math major friend to help me out. Typically, he writes much faster than you can. I couldn't understand much of what he said. Read the book. Legit. TA was very helpful. Graders can be harsh on tests.",0
"Literally the worst teacher I have ever had in my life. The 350 character limit prevents me from telling you anything meaningful about this guy. You have to teach yourself everything and ignore his atrocious bedside manner. His tests are unfair/incoherent and your grades will be affected by it. Prepare to be depressed, angered, and confused.",0
"Great professor, extremely professional and knowledgeable. Always willing to help!",1
I am an independent tutor who avidly helps students in English courses. I find that this class is unbearably difficult for the level. The grading criteria is incredibly specific to the point where the student will be unable to write a fulfilling paper. I have been a tutor for 10+ years and this is the first time Ive been frustrated by a paper.,0
"Professor Chen is the best professor Western has to offer for the CIS department. Personally, he is one of my favorite professors of all time. He explains everything clearly, and more than once if need be. He genuinely cares about his students and wants them to succeed. He is an entertaining speaker, and will always make sure everyone understands.",1
"He's okay. Not the best but not the worst. His class is kind of random assignment-wise and we spent a lot of time watching movies. I think he needs to retire, but that's just me.",0
"She rocks. Really cares about her students. Had high expectations but is very fair. Super helpful, just enrolled in my 3rd class with her.",1
"currently enrolled in Anatomy during spring 2020 (COVID-19). The transition from lectures to online was horrible, expecting the class to be run as normal despite no access to resources. assignments graded WEEKS later, unprofessionalism, refusing to answer emails with concerns, changed the whole format of the exams, total disregard for students.",1
"Hollis is very passionate about biology, and his passion leaks into his lectures. i wish I could've taken this class in-person because it would've made the experience better. He does have 4 tests plus the final, but he does this to balance out grades. So, if you bomb one test, it's not going to ruin your grade. He's also easy to communicate with.",1
"Not a bad class. However, I think his role in helping to get students into law school is highly overrated. If you want to go to Duquesne, he can help. Otherwise, you're on your own. Best part of the class was Charlie Wilson's War. Law school is nothing like his class.",0
"He is a nice guy... But, unfortunately he does not teach anything that you will be tested on. He claims that he is teaching to help you for a future in marketing. However, his activities and slides were irrelevant and unhelpful. I wish he brought in guest speakers and taught some of the processes from the dense textbook. ",0
"She's very nice & accommodating. However, don't like the class structure because retention is low & in the end, don't learn a whole lot. Gives little to no feedbacks / critiques on presentation & especially the paper, her grading is hazy.",1
"She is SOO nice and really cares abt her students and wants them to do well. But she is pretty disorganized, and vocab quizzes are just rough, no matter how much you study. I imagine she'd have been easier to follow if it hadn't been 8am.",1
What a joke. Do not take any class he 'teaches' because you will come out frustrated and would have learned very little. Two thumbs down.,0
"David is a nice guy, but he has trouble engaging students and discussions will drag on way longer than they should. Criteria for grading as well as due dates of assignments are also very unclear. Had to do 4 oral presentations and a bunch of papers, so lots of work, but pretty much everyone gets the same mark, so not worth putting in extra effort.",0
"He didn't give a study guide like everyone else said and his tests averaged about four questions each, making it very easy to fail. All other opinions seem accurate. I wouldn't take him, again.",0
Sure nice guy!! Is extremely good looking and easy on the eyes.. I could look at his chiseled body all day!!,1
"The only way to learn is through the lectures, which is hard to understand sometimes because of her thick accent. She gives examples that make no sense and are not relate able, and just complains about how most of the class sucks at the material and she cant wait to get rid of us. The material is not overly difficult but she is not good at it.",0
"Very sweet, older lady. The 2 midterms and final are fairly easy and super straightforward. Participation is 20%, but her lectures are usually quite interactive (volunteers coming up to do psychological activities) so it doesn't feel like a pain in the a** to show up. All in all, I feel like I learnt a lot of interesting stuff from this class.",1
"His lectures are pretty boring but there are only a few, after that it's a pretty chill class. Not many requirements for speeches, and will give you a fair grade or better. Ignores the book, has two food days and has a ""question of the day"" every class day (takes about 30 class mins ..). Recommend, if looking for an easy A. Chill guy; not too funny",1
What a great professor! The fact that she got the lowest Sofi score out of all SUNY Geneseo professors means absolutely nothing! What a doll she is! I learned so much from her.,0
Nice but tries to push his agenda on political issues.,1
"Let's face it, only teaches 102 which is an A/B course, and if you get a B you failed.",1
"Shes an amazing teacher, she knows how to answer any questions clearly for you to understand it. Shes great with explaining the concept if you get confused. She always lets you know if there is any difficulty in D2L. Please take her, if you want a GOOD grade, she is the one!!!",1
"He is really a good professor!---good at assigning homework and giving exam. You really learn a lot from this class!---learn everything by yourself, at home!!! The worst teacher I have ever encountered because  he doesn't really teach. I never blame a professor for workload or exam difficulty but I just cannot tolerate that I can't learn in class",0
"LE meilleur professeur de l'Université d'Ottawa. M. Pelletier est de par sa carrière impressionnante et son charisme une personne dont l'on a vraiment envi d'écouter. Impossible de vouloir manquer un cours, c'est sans hésitation que je reprendrais un cours avec ce professeur. Toujours prêt à aider les étudiants à comprendre.",1
"She's a really nice, caring professor who wants you to do your best. Her exams are on a lot of information but if you study all the material you should be fine and she gives study guides for each exam which help a lot.",1
"I really liked him. We had one ""paper"" and everyone got an A+. 1 test, a midterm, and final. All are multiple choice. He let's you do corrections to get 1/3 of the points back. He's funny and knows his stuff. Can talk kind of fast but is willing to repeat if you show you are paying attention. Likes participation.",1
He's my professor at Nassau for the summer session and i think he is an amazing teacher as well as amazing individual..he is so helpful and he really gets involved in the students <3,1
If i could give him a zero rating i would. He does not teach during his lectures he only babbles about things not relevant to topics. He does not answer your questions and he is the toughest grader. when we do labs he will come by and tell you that everything youre doing is correct and then you will get a 1/5 on your lab after turning it in.,0
"He is terrible, heavy lectures, doesnt write on the board, tough grader, everything is hard. If you are not that smart dont take him. Personality: nice guy",0
Great course!,1
DO NOT TAKE HER!!! She is absolutely horrible. She gives 100 question exams with only 50min and quizzes are 40 questions with 30 min. Anytime she ask for help she always says refer to the syllabus. She won't help at all!! Avoid her if you can. ,0
"Very Difficult Class. Interesting material, and he obviously has a great knowledge of literature. If you take excellent notes and can write well, a B is pretty easy to get.",1
"Easily the worst ECE professor I've had yet. If you can make it through his two classes, then you'll make through to the end. However, Schwartz will literally make you contemplate if it's even worth staying in the major anymore. May the curve ever be in your favor.",0
"GREAT CLASS! Professor Allen made Ecology VERY interesting because he related the class with things occurring locally. He's kind of nerdy. The class had some homework which was very easy to complete. One presentation which, if you practice your presentation, is easy. He made class fun by bringing in plants and insects for us. GREAT CLASS!",1
"Professor Langston's class is extremely difficult.  His lectures are very dry and boring.  His grading is extremely anal; for instance, forget what you've learned in Algebra, he does stupid calculation tracks, and if you don't do them, you get a zero.  He has an exam every other week.  The hardest class I've ever taken.  Advice: Study Nomenclature!",0
"Toughest class I have ever taken! She is very knowledgable about her subject, but she is very tough! just make sure you are attending class . overall learned a lot in this class",1
Very dry boring class. Harsh grader when it comes to papers. Pay attention to her nitpicky grammar suggestions. I had to work my butt off to get a good grade on her papers.,1
"Professor Sedo was easily the most disorganized note taker on the planet and the material covered in lecture was in no way correlated to the hw--which he frequently posted on Wed. due Friday. As for the midterm, even with a canvas crash that gave us an extra 30 minutes, I still wasn't even close to finishing. Terrible teacher, avoid his class!",0
"Classes only barely match up with the textbook, but he's a great professor. You learn by doing, so you'll actually retain information. He is EXTREMELY helpful, even during a test situation. Go to his office hours to chat, get in good with him from the beginning, and he is an incredible asset. ",1
When you take this class take it with Alex. He realizes that all of us are seniors and dosnt burden us with alot of work. Very reasonable and understanding and easy to talk to. One of the finest,1
"Nice guy and the class isnt bad if he doesnt mark your paper. The TAs are easy markers but hes super tough. Will also never answer your emails which is why I wont take one of his classes again. Spoke to him many times about going over my harshly marked essay, he said hed look over it again and get back to me but never did and ignored all my emails",0
Grading scale seems really inconsistent and he is not at all accommodating of students issues; class is super hard and the only support is super crowded TA hours.,0
"Really enjoyed this class, he is a great professor. Make sure to go to class and take detailed notes on his slides because that is what is on the test. DO NOT buy the book, I never cracked it open. Tests were slightly harder than I expected them to be, but still reasonable.",1
Worst teacher I ever had in GVSU. She doesn't like to work at all!,0
"Ross is amazing. Best biology prof ive had. He makes lectures entertaining and if you go to class, you wont need a textbook. His midterm question are sometimes the same as his unit reviews! If need bio, take his classes!!!",1
"His lectures and course is structured rlly badly. He's personally a decent guy, his jokes are good but teaching wise...GET ME SOMEONE ELSE!",0
"Be prepared to teach yourself. There's no organization, no sense of direction and she's not responsive whenever you ask a question for further clarification. You're literally trying to play guess who with the assignments/papers and she also takes FOREVER to grade. Sweet lady but I would not take her again.",0
Did not want to explain things. Showed little to no interest in really teaching. Half of the time she did something wrong in showing examples and our class would correct her. Absolutely do not recommend.,0
"He's very easy-going and approachable, however, he wasn't well organized with the material and didn't really stick to the syllabus. If you pay attention and jot down what he says during and the songs he plays, you'll get an A.",1
Chemistry isn't easy. Professor Heske is really nice & VERY helpful! He will bend over backwards to help you understand chemisty. He is very approachable & has great office hours. I had a hard time with some of the material but he was always willing to help. Take him if you really want to learn chemistry and want a teacher that will faciliate that.,1
"While she is a very kind person, who genuinely does want to help, half the the time she seems like she has no idea what she is doing or talking about. We spend a lot of class time watching her try to figure out how her computer works. She constantly second guesses herself which leaves everyone very confused.",0
"On any day other than GIS day, Sawada is generally the most approachable prof on campus, easy to find and very helpful, I've found Mike is always around to help out his GIS students, however, midterms and tests are very difficult in any of his GIS classes.  His approach for helping students gets you results, but don't expect him to do it for you",1
"Here's the deal: Very very nice guy. Kind and open to students. He's a tough grader though. Had many marks deducted for legitimately made-up reasons. His reasoning was no one can get perfect in the arts, so you're destined to rarely get an A. No Canvas, no slides, nothing, so it's a bit weird to study. Take good notes I guess.",0
"very arrogant and can't take the pressure of an exam, he yelled at me in front of the whole class because I got up when i was finished to hand in the exam, as everyone else did~if you do not like your job--QUIT!",0
"Unreasonable evaluations all around. Assignments focus on abstract stuff, useless to prepare you for exams. Very little examples done in class - useless derivations and proofs only. Had to teach myself. No effort to make the course relevant to engineering, and the majority of the class happens to be in engineering. Take it with Pierce if you can.",0
"All class this guy talks about stuff that is irrelevant to the course, and then when there's like 10 minutes left, he goes like ""where did all the time go? ok do it by yourself at home"". Your job is literally to teach this mandatory course which is key to upper year courses. You say BU283 is the best course; probably true if you dont teach it.",0
"Grabowski isn't an easy choice for Ochem 2, but he gives you all the resources you need to succeed. Do ALL of the practice exams, and use every resource that he gives you. In office hours he can be helpful, but only if you come with very specific questions to ask. For reference, I finished the course with a 76% and ended up with an A-.",1
"Biden did a fantastic job delivering APSC 3953 in a seminar style format. I can't speak to how he teaches the more technical courses, but he is a walking encyclopedia of knowledge. Better yet, he is not arrogant, and wants to hear back from his class just as he wants his class to hear him.",1
"she is incompetent, period. You learn nothing from her classes because she doesn't know anything and doesn't teach anything.  On top of that, she is not enthusiastic and is so extremely disorganized. Her wild favouritism and completely random objectiveness in marking will drive you crazy. I wouldn't waste my precious money on her class again.",0
"Dr. Morris is the best! If you have any opportunity to take her class, do it. She is very understanding and kind, and is also excellent at explaining tougher concepts. She will go out of her way to help students if asked. The best, literally!",1
"This professor is genuinely the worst. It is so clear that he does not want his students to succeed. Besides his bad intentions, he also just lacks the ability to teach this class, or probably any classes at all. If you are an incoming second year at Smith and are assigned this prof, I suggest you switch immediately, if possible.",0
"Kenny is the absolute goat, he's a great professor and you can tell he cares a lot about the class and his students",1
"Dr. Hines's lectures are very confusing, since he often gets the questions wrong. I have attended every class and done all the homework and still do not understand the material because of his lectures. His office hours are during my other classes, so I recommend going to the Study or Mathskellar because his lectures/notes online are not helpful.",0
his lectures were the worst as they were solely pictures. they were short summaries of the chapter so it just made sense to read each chapter and take notes. it was a super easy class and easy to pass but he was not accommodating at all or considerate at all. it's a level 100 class and he acted like it was a level 300 class,0
Most frustrating professor to deal with. Expects way too much out of students and hardly gives good feedback. Anything he expects you to do one week he changes the next for no reason. Most class meetings are wasted reviewing projects instead of learning new material. If I could go back in time and take another professor I would gladly do it.,0
"Pretty nice guy and doesn't mind it if you ask questions in class. But unforunately he is incredibly boring and also just bad at explaining. Had to teach myself calculus 2. Tests aren't bad as long as you do your hw. Gives you sample exams, but don't expect them to be the exact same as the real exams like the old reviews said. STUDY EVERYTHING!",0
Prof. Wood is an amazing and smart woman. She gives lots of assignments and two papers. Keep up with the assignments and reading and you will do fine. I could of done better but my grade is my fault so dont let that discourage you. She is also very understanding if you speak to her and let her know what is going on.,1
This guy is ridiculous. We are supposed to be learning how to apply our knowledge in the field of Computer Science and he's blabbing on about telephones. Completely useless professor that should have retired years ago. He often laughs at his 'non-jokes' and doesn't go anywhere with his lecture. I've already contacted the suicide hotline.,0
"I took BIO 121 lecture online with Professor Simon. The class consisted of watching 3-6 lecture videos each week, a quick and easy Mastering Biology assignment, and usually a short test over that week's material. As long as you watch all lectures and do all assignments you should be fine. The class is very test heavy. She seems nice though!",1
"Dr Lenhart is a great professor and keeps class really interesting, tests are difficult go to class.",1
"Theres lots of assignments to get a good grade. But her test questions are vague. The tests can be hard and you have to read a lot to understand the material and do okay on the tests. If you do the chapter questions, Discussion boards, and responses that are due every week, youll do fine. Just get ready to be confused on the tests",1
Make friends fast and work with them. You might as well get the textbook early and teach yourself over break because that's all you'll be doing. He will give extra credit if asked so ASK! It's a bad class but you can make it through.,0
"Only gives you three tests a semester and if you fail the first you might as well drop. Only offers a couple lectures for extra credit which you only can get a maximum of two points (one for going and one for a very detailed reflection). If you can change professors, I would.",0
"Really nice guy, terrible professor though. He reads from the book at a barely audible tone and writes random words in a disorderly fashion on the board the whole class. He loves to lecture so if you are a visual learner like I am I would not suggest him. Really nice guy though!!!",0
"He puts things in the simplest terms, no beating around the bush. He is a character and will explain things as many times it takes for you to understand. Very patient, very caring teacher. He is willing to give extra credit as long as you show interest in the class and participation. I highly recommend him. Speaks English/Spanish.",1
RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!!!,0
"Dr. Santoro is real. He treats you with respect and expects you to take responsibility. He wants you to read and hold yourself to a higher standard. He is hard but it is only because he wants you to grow. His lectures are captivating and he tells many storys to supplement them. Youll almost never be bored. If you love history, take his class!",1
Do NOT under any circumstance take this professor. His lectures are equally extremely boring and impossible to follow. His tests are way more difficult than necessary and he doesnt prepare students for them. The TAs hardly understand how to the matlab hw. I believe that currently the class scale with be everything above 60 is a C.,0
Most useless prof ever. Teaches the easiest courses but since you never understand him cause he just mumbles and has a thick accent. you never know what to do. If only i had clear instructions in this course it would have been so much easier.,0
I told hm that I was having trouble on test and he seemed to ignore me. Then when it got more later in the year it became a problem what is going to end up happening is I am going to withdraw from Chem. Although he is a good person.As a Chemistry teacher I would rather study from a book than him.,0
"Although he seems to care about his students his lecture are not great and he is heavy on the homework end. Instead of participation marks like every other Chem class, his class is required to do a very lengthy excel assignment.",1
"I'm an A student and failed his class. No matter how much I studied, I could not do well on the exams. His teaching method was just reading off of the slides. He never showed us how to do a book problem on the board. I took the class again with a different professor and got an A. So it wasn't me, it was the professor.",0
"Took Authenticity with him a few semesters back. Assigned lots of reading that might have been interesting for PHIL majors, but was at times too dense for me to find interest in. Comments and responses are sometimes harsh (in the classroom and in his administrative capacity with the Honors college.) Nice guy otherwise, just too much for an elective",0
"She offers you extra to retry for quizzes but she not helpful if you don't understand, your midterm and final is what will make the difference in whether you pass or fail her class.  If you don't pass either midterm or final, you're more like to not pass the class.",0
"She is very passionate, which makes the students follow along during lecture. I recommend!!!!",1
The online class 'Intro to Islamic Civilization' was an absolute mess; quiz questions were from material not yet covered or material that was never covered and the prof tries way too hard to be funny. I really feel that I learned almost nothing from this class and online the prof does not look as hot as some have previously posted,0
"He is a pretty good prof. He's funny and breaks the content down well. I've taken two accounting courses so far, and he was my prof for the first one. My second prof was horrible and really made me appreciate how well Haroon taught. The midterm was fair, not too hard. But the final was really difficult. Would still recommend him though.",1
adorable. very helpful during office hours,1
"I took the online psych1 class. Bernadette is one of the kindest teachers i've ever had. Her feedback is great and she even adds "":-)"" to emails which I thought was cute. That being said you will do A LOT of group work in this class. You are basically at the mercy of your group members. Her exams are also really tough too. Expect to feel anxious.",1
He is a great professor,1
"economics is not an easy class, but prof gius is a very very good professor. As long as you take notes on everything he writes on the board, you will do good on the test. Not an easy A for some, but definitely worth taking him if you have the chance. Oh and attendance is not taken ever",1
"AWFUL! Average is only based off of 4 tests. Participation, attendance, & homework doesn't count towards your average. Reads off a google doc and when you have questions she tells you to figure it out on your own. If you go for help and tell her you are struggling, she tells you you aren't trying hard enough. Rude and doesn't care if you pass.",0
Lombardo is one of my favorite bio professors at gvsu. His class is more hands on that following a lab packet and its truly interesting as well,1
"Really funny guy. Clear, simple powerpoint slides. Do all the questions assigned in the ferguson book and you'll be fine.",1
Profesor Williams is not a very good teacher. He gives no extra credit when almost every other teacher does. He gives no test review which makes studying for tests very difficult. He gave way more homework than every other teacher. He gave way harder tests than other teachers when comparing tests to my friends. OVERALL AVOID.,0
"Jacobson was great, she was entertaining and kept relaying her materials back to everyday life. I enjoyed the class and will look for classes from her again!",1
Great prof!  He genuinely cares about his students and wanted us to become better writers.  He even invited people to his house for Thanksgiving if anyone was stuck in town-great teacher.,1
"He is a great professor. I actually enjoyed his lectures. You can make a good grade if you go to the lectures, take notes, and pay attention.",1
"On his blog, he wrote this exam mark breakdown: ""There are 39 questions worth 1 mark.
 There are 5 questions worth 23 marks."" Yet there were no 23 mark questions. Either he can't write, or he can't do math. Either way, it's worrisome that he is the only biostats professor at York.",0
"Dr. Handley is a the most unreasonable professor I've ever had. Grades way too harshly and yells at students like a high school teacher would. Very disorganized and won't return lab grades back so you are left wondering how to improve. A pretty impossible class for a GenEd, wouldn't recommend taking Handley at all. Avoid at all costs, actually.",0
AMAZING prof. goes through every problem step-by-step in great detail and really knows what he's talking about. very clear diagrams,1
"Obviously a very smart man, but he showed up to lectures late more often than not and was unprepared for them the vast majority of the time. Taking this class over the summer with him was probably a bad idea, considering the pacing and that he was hardly ever available outside of class.",0
"I think he means well and isn't too strict on class participation, though he appreciates it. I often felt lost during his lectures, never quite understanding the material on hand. Be prepared to read and write a lot.",1
This class was the hardest thing I have done in my life. This class made me very sad and depressed when I thought about it. Definitely prepared me for chem 2 but not sure it was worth the stress.,0
"Gabriel Robins is a fantastic professor. He really cares about the students learning and enjoying the class, as such a lot of the grade is towards attendance and extra credit opportunities. Highly reccommend",1
"The GOOD: 
 - He uses a points system for grading, and gives you points for attendance.
 - Some of his quizzes are group quizzes, which are easier to pass.
 - Gives out a lot of extra credit work
 The BAD:
 - very unorganized
 - A lot of essay assignments
 - Made our class purchase access to an online program called MyCompLab which we used ONLY ONC",0
"good prof for sure...like some have said, likes to mess with your mind, but that's what profs do.  Really good at relating class material to real life.  Highly recommend",1
"Condescending, repetitive, and hard to follow. That's only the tip of the iceberg. I was hoping to debate, but no luck. Encourages group work on all tests except final so not much to prep there. If you have the bible for the class you can relax a bit.",0
"Flynn is the best!!! Her Drawing 3 class was one of the most enjoyable classes Ive taken at SCAD. Her grading criteria is clear and she gives good feedback. If you put effort into your projects youll get a good grade, simple as that. 10/10 would take her class again.",1
all hail the god chang,0
He's smart but he is too intense when he is in his lectures. He doesn't care that you have other classes and assignments because he only gives you mon - fri to do a long and hard assignment. I have not had one assignment that was interesting. Nice guy but makes me regret going towards my major in english since he has taught me nothing at all.,0
WELLSY MAKES ME HAPPY!,1
Professor Grenquist is incredibly knowledgeable and teaches you more than just the curriculum. He knew everyone's name the second day of class and always seemed as if he cared about our projects and our growth as a student. He's one of those professors you will always remember. His humor takes getting used to but he's hilarious once you know him...,1
"The most frustrating class I have ever taken. He has no respect for other opinions. I can understand teaching such strict catholic beliefs to a class of theology majors, but not a class that is predominantly students that are just there to cover the requirement. Take through notes because that is what you are going to have to rely on to study.",0
"You are not going to learn programming in his class. He only taught few algorithms but didn't do any coding in the class. Also, he only calls out girls names in class and make them solve the algorithms on board. He is unprofessional and his jokes are sometimes inappropriate. It's an easy A if you help him in his personal life problems.",0
"She was interested in the students, compassionate.  Material was hard, but she explained it well.",1
"Takes history of ideas approach.  Well prepared and clear, well-organized.  Non-history majors don't like the high grading standards,  but you can learn a lot.",1
He does not teach well at all.  Very hard to follow what he is teaching in class and what taught and what you are expected to know are on two different levels.  He does not prepare you at all.,0
"The most interesting class ever! Lots of videos and slides, a lot of writing. Di Bella presented it so interestingly and passionately. I learnt so much! I never liked history classes before him. TAKE HIM! if you want to learn about history and not just pass through the class with no knowledge. Not too easy class, but he gives a lot of extra credit!",1
His class is extremely hard to pass. Dont take him if math126 is your last math class.,1
"he admitted that this was the first time teaching the course, did not have a good understanding of the material, and was learning alongside us. Therefore, the course was disorganized. basically, he DID NOT teach anything. He would only request us to read the book and held tutorial that had nothing to do with the material we read. Friendly though.",0
"Zoe seems incredibly passionate about what she does, but also seems to expect that her students are masters in the subject with fully photographic memories. Tests every single week on tiny details and examples that she included in her 30K word module notes. Don't bother coming up with your own example, if it isn't her's you'll be marked wrong.",0
"I truly had a lot of fun taking this course! This professor in particular is super helpful, and asks questions on tests/assignments with the perfect level of difficulty. I hope to have him again!",1
"Prof Edwards is by far my favorite prof at GV. This class was excel heavy. As long as you followed along in class and wrote down notes, you'll do fine. The only downside to her is that she doesn't put homework grades in until the end of the semester. Other than that, I strongly recommend!",1
Awful and rude,0
"The only PhD in a department that desperately needs more. The only faculty member capable of teaching Film Theory and World Cinema. Her classes are rigorous but incredibly important in providing a foundation for seriously thinking about cinema. Prepare to read, write, watch, and work and you'll do quite well. All others need not apply.",1
"Gormley is awesome. He's funny too. Can be kind of pushy, but in a good way. He tries to push you in the right direction for the answer. If he questions a remark or response, don't take it personal, he's just trying to get you and the class to think deep. Great professor and very personable. Make a connection early and you'll do great!",1
"Much better teacher than her mother. Made the material more interesting than  thought would be possible. 100% femenist, and 75% ****, but not enough to bother any of the guys. The topics were all fairly women-related and I cant blame her for feeling like the guys have nothing useful to contribute to the discussion. Would take her class again 100%",1
"Professors can make or break a class. Dr Blake is one of those professors that ""make"" a class. Her lectures are engaging and she is passionate about the material she is presenting. As long as you show up to class and take good notes, this class will be easy. Dr. Blake is one of my favorite professors and I highly recommend taking any of her classes",1
"Fred is very nice and smart, but the hardest grader Ive ever had. You must copy write ups word for word out of his textbook and if you forget a single word its 50pts off each time you dont write it. He is not flexible with grading and anything below a 75 youre failing. I am a A student across all my classes and he failed me.",0
"While the class may have been hard, he did a great job teaching it. He tried to get the class involved in discussions all the time.",1
"His classes were the most boring 5 hours a week I have ever experience , he constantly changes his mind about what he expects from projects and turns a class that has a lot of potential into a tedious process that doesnt take you anywhere.",0
"Professor Beck is definitely not the kind of Professor you want for an intro class, but the two classes I have taken were extremely fair in terms of material and grading. She's exceptionally intelligent and her classes were far more engaging than most other high level econ classes. Be prepared to work.",1
"She doesn't follow her own syllabus. Very condescending when she speaks to you, but because she's an older lady, you somehow feel bad if you fight back. Doesn't upload Power Points but still expects you to know the answers on tests. I felt like her grading process was really cruel and extreme. I'll never take her again. She ruined my GPA.",0
"I really did not enjoy this. If I was ever struggling with my verbal skills she would call me out and make me feel stupid for getting something wrong or not understanding. I've always been an excellent Spanish student so this was disappointing. I also felt like she didn't personally like me, and so she gave me a bad grade. I would not recommend.",0
"He has a fun, sarcastic, corny sense of humor. He's a great teacher, and will answer any questions, even if he's already answered it a million times. His tests are easy if you just go over the slides, read the chapters, and practice a couple problems. Projects are ok if the people in your group aren't idiots.",1
She writes her slide-shows by hand. Her writing is illegible making notes hard to take. she also does not allow students to take notes with computers. she frequently goes off on side tangents about feminism which is completely unrelated to course content,0
"DJB is kind, welcoming to questions, and gives great examples. Beware of cold-calling. She told funny stories about her husband relating to accounting. She really knew her stuff. She recognized me outside of class despite me only going online and said hi. Tests are hard but doable. Do not underestimate them - they are much harder than homeworks.",1
Terrible subjective grading and do not try and bother trying to follow his feedback. He changes what he wants every week and nothing is good enough.,0
"This is truly a hard class and sometimes seems like your hard work will never pay off, but Mike truly cares about his students and how they are doing. He is willing to help everyone and makes the classroom setting so much fun to be in. Every class would be full of laughs and it made the difficulty of the class bearable.",1
He did not seem to care about the class. Was always late to class. Very unorganized.,0
Don't procrastinate on any assignment! As an older student I feel I pick up way more than other students in class. And having real world experience I can vouch for everything Gaston talks about. I wish his HCC classes were mandatory for all FUS students. We have lost the value of a true liberal arts degree and knowing Western Culture. Read Dawson!,1
"The guy really loves to ramble and so do his readings. That's what makes his class so hard now, none of the resources are clear. I did not enjoy this experience at all, I would say it repelled me from economics.",0
"has changed the syllabus over 4 times during the course, nothing is clear about the syllabus, no test, written review of every chapter and lecture required to pass. ",0
"I liked Professor LaMothe as a person, but not really as a teacher. This was her first time teaching and I felt like the class was everywhere. She would lecture for two hours and 30 minutes straight and only leave like 20-30 minutes to do a group project that requires way more time than that. Also her TA grades papers and it's based on her opinion.",0
"This class is super easy. Assignments are simple, tests and quizzes are open book and can be taken several times. He's not very helpful if you have a question on an assignment. Really boring, but super easy.",1
D-Mac is the man! The best Math Prof. at GCC. He made going to class something I looked forward to!,1
"Great professor but this class involves little more work than average. You have one paper that is reviewed by people in your class, and you are responsible for making either a Ted Ed like video, Ted talk, or podcast. You are also responsible for reviewing other classmates papers. Not hard assignments by any means but take some time. You also have a test that you will take 3 different times, and it's the same test every time. He's a little unorganized and changes the schedule as you go. Overall though very unique way of teaching, great teacher/person, and I would recommend this class. It's easy assignments and he' an easy grader but will take some time/effort so be prepared.",1
The king of journalism. Ask about his annual trips to Cuba.,1
"I couldn't ever get myself to like her because she seemed so involved with promoting her own lackluster teaching material. Constant self promotion between her book, podcast and even promoting her own twitter page left a bad taste in my mouth. Also the grade allocation of this class is wild having 75% come from the midterm and exam alone",0
"He does know his stuff. However, both jazz classes weren't as difficult as I thought they would be. We can learn more than one dance a semester!",0
"I struggled his class but still managed to pull a B. Go to class because at the end of the semester he bumps you up 5%. I felt very uncomfortable answering and asking questions because if did not know the exact answer he was looking for he made you feel so dumb. I learned a lot, but am so glad the class is over. Be sure to do the homework",0
"Pajer is a sweet person who cares about you. She takes attendance but if you miss class it is easy to make especially if you email her ahead she is very flexible. You write 5 Essays throughout the semester, which are doable and she is willing to help you. You are supposed to get a textbook and an online access code but you never use it.",1
"Professor Ramasesh was a mess. Taking his class was a drag and by attending his lectures, I never felt like I grasped any meaningful knowledge. He will call you out during class to answer questions that no one knows the answer to, to get someone else to talk. Does not teach the material well and will be disappointed by the poor scores on his tests.",0
"It was a May-mester class. The same amount of chapters and exams jammed into two weeks. The entire course was awful, he was not helpful, he even messed up and gave us an exam on chapters we hadn't covered yet. I would have to ask him before every exam if he could open the quizzes for review because they were locked due to the way he had it set up.",0
"Had him for S&P and Cog. I didn't find either course too hard to manage (though S&P was notable tougher.however, his teaching style isn't what Truman students might be used to. You need to read the text but it is much more essential to listen closely to lecture and think carefully about it. Very fun class if you're into a more abstract approach.",1
"She doesn't even know how to use canvas, just imagine how she was dealing with this online situation. first of all, there is no HW for her class and therefore you gotta practice by yourself. her lectures crap and you don't get much out of them. just study from the text",0
Orla is always confused when going over the slides in class. His exams are tough and he gives two assignments per week. I would recommend not taking him as a prof.,0
"Get Chegg. Very abstract, non-linear teaching. Your quiz and lab report grades rest on your group members, so hopefully they actually participate for you. Attend every class, even the shorter, non-lab days.",0
"Too much work for a Gen-Ed. Lengthy, uninteresting reading that was never discussed in depth, only to be used for the many papers we had. The majority of the class had no clue what we were learning for 10 weeks. If you plan to major in something relevant to the course, go for it with her, make a connection. Otherwise, take it with anyone else.",0
"Gateman ensures that his lectures are interesting and engaging by using examples of his addiction to Coke. For someone who has never done ECON before, I can say that his lectures really teach you the concepts and helps in understanding the difficult parts through simplification. To do well in his class, you have to do lots of practice on mylab.",1
"Get the optional book only.  MC questions are all in there.  The essay questions are given to you in the syllabus.  Pretty straightforward instructions. He will deduct grade for nonattendance. That's how I ended up with an A-.  Overall, go to class study for 2 essays and 3 MC tests and the class is a breeze.  Great lectures. Definitely recommended!",1
Great teacher and cares about his students. Does not give extra credit but gives you clear instructions on what he wants to see in the essays you must write.,1
Very knowledgeable of the subject,1
"In this class, you need to take notes. They need to be thorough and specific. If you're willing to put the effort in the class, Matlack will reciprocate that. It is an interesting class, but if you do not take diligent notes, you will not do well on tests and quizzes. Also, he does not post grades on Blackboard all semester. ",1
"The only thing that I wasn't too thrilled about was that it was a pass or no pass class, but other than that, it was super easy. She gives great feedback, and will really help you with any issues. I wish she was teaching English 100 because she was the best professor I had all semester. ",1
"She's an excellent professor, i actually had the opportunity to learn a lot of stuff in this classroom. She made lessons super interesting and gave you the grade you really deserved. She's the one who made me change my major to Spanish :)",1
I'm obsessed with this class. I can't help but move ahead in the lectures because they're so interesting! It's helped me to think outside the box. She's very understanding and good at engaging students with visuals and videos and interesting examples. It's 1 reading a week plus 3 assignments and a short final paper. The prompts are actually fun.,1
old school teacher methods that are ineffective and self righteous. a living relic from days long gone.,0
"Professor Mancini is great at what she does! She loves teaching, and will make the class enjoyable. The assignments she gives are very easy. My class was a hybrid and it was still easy to follow. She gives you credit for showing up to class, so don't skip! Overall I would recommend her!!",1
course itself isn't fun. he is available outside class but not really helpful. just give you another lecture which you didn't understand and will not understand.,0
Lynn has been one of the best professors Ive had at UK. She had been very caring and understanding during this weird online semester. Lectures can be interesting when she talks about her experiences. Weekly papers but they arent super hard and dont take long. Standard 3 exams. Youll be fine on exams/quizzes if you listen in class,1
Only took the online finance course; but my experience was a bad one. This is one of the poorest quality professors I have had a the university level. Outdated lectures/ practice problems will not help you prepare for the quizzes and tests. Quizzes and tests are given with a strict time limits and can be hard to complete. Lucky to get a C.,0
"Class is treated like a high school course. Very basic, could have learned everything from the text book.",0
"Super nice guy, he is always available to help and is nice about it. Not too much work and the assignments are explained well. Lectures can be boring but he tries to bring his instruments for entertainment so it is not all lecture.",1
"Yes, he is funny, but he takes himself and his classes/grading too seriously.  He doesn't care about individual students, and it is almost like it is a hassle for him to be there.  His liberal studies class he doesn't teach anything other than slides. Overall he takes himself too seriously and doesn't care about you or your grade",0
"I loved this class, Boni is a great teacher. I don't know what other students are talking about, I found her to be very unbiased; she doesn't bash anyone's religion. She made the class very interesting; if you read the book, it's a very easy class.",1
"Okay professor, pretty nice. Lecture is necessary, but is mostly made up of personal experience stories and supplementary information. You need to read the textbook if you want to do well on the exams. She does offer some extra credit material. The Business Plan is time consuming, but relatively easy, will get a good grade if you put in effort.",1
I love Mrs. Flucker. She would give us her number to call her if we had questions and was so caring. Shes hilarious and gives free 100s on quizzes if needed. Shes one of the best professors Ive had,1
"This semester was online so I can only say how he was through canvas. He posted weekly announcements and all the readings and notes we had to do. I wish he made lecture videos bc sometimes the power points were confusing, but overall a pretty solid professor. He grades by VERY few things: 2 midterms, 2 quizzes, 1 discussion, 1 final, and 1 essay.",1
"If you are not a feminist, do not take this class. He wrote the book you need and all the notes so the entire class is his opinion that I did not agree with. It was hard to stay focused when all I could think about was how much I did not agree with his theories. ",0
He's explains things very clearly and is always willing to answer questions in and after class. I'd definitely recommend a class with him.,1
"Her lectures are boring and makes me sleepy. She basically just reads off the powerpoint slides and relate it to her life and research. Very dependent on the TA. She doesn't make her class engaging and the final grade is solely based on 3 quizzes and online quizzes. This is a heavy reading course, but if you want med school, you have to take this.",0
"Danely was great for MATL 240, but 341 is a totally different story.  You learn a lot from this guy, but don't expext any free passes.",0
At the beginning of the semester she said there would be discussion but I assure you there is none. Every class was just one long lecture that hardly pertained to any of our tests or papers. Attendance was mandatory so bring headphones. Even after studying for 1.5 weeks before tests I got B's and I'm an A student typically. Don't take..,0
Avoid him! very boring and uninspirational. He talks about random accounting things for the entire 2 hours and does not teach the topics that show up on the exam. You will end up studying exclusively from the textbook. One of the worst professors ive had at pace.,0
"If I could describe his class with one word, ""disorganized."" His scribbling on the board was hard to read and all over, making note taking a tedious and pointless process. Difficult to follow along in class. Not much notice was given on when tests, quizzes, and worksheets were to be assigned. Unless he changes his ways, avoid him if possible.",0
Too is impossible and not helpful at all.  I asked him for help and he treated me like I was stupid.  He shouldn't be teaching anymore!,0
Really good teacher. Great at explaining things. Was not boring. Great prof ,1
Seriously this class is hard if you have not taken stats ever. You will need to go to his office hours or the learning center to get help for homework. The quizzes are mostly 10 questions unless the class finishes early he adds more questions to the next quiz. easy if you pay attention & keep up with assignments. Book doesn't help! Show up & pass.,0
"He's a great teacher. Very knowledgable and super nice. Loved his class. Quite easy. He gives out a ton of bonus. You will need the book for the exams, but  not much else.",1
Excellent teacher...you will learn ALOT!,1
"Take another section. 1) she has zero teaching experience and it shows. 2) she wants you to teach her way right down to the words that you say, and its maddening. Take another section. You'll learn way more about being a teacher. She simply isn't a good professor. Nice lady. Shouldn't teach education",0
I really don't mind Harvey as a professor. This is a hard class and I think it would be just as hard with any other prof. He allows you to do test correction for bonus points which is nice. The only annoying this is the class average was always SOOO low and he would never curve exams,1
"I look for the classes he teaches. Though, if you hate essays avoid him. He only uses essays. Other than that hes super charismatic and understanding. Tough grading but if you go to his tutorials and talk to him you're almost guaranteed a good grade!",1
A bit repetitive but he's great ! As long as you follow the essay instructions you can get a good grade on your essay. He cancels class often & his homework is super easy ! Best English teacher,1
Reg is a great prof who really cares if you understand the material. His lectures can be a bit slow as he usually reviews a lot of what you already have learned but it is very helpful towards the test!  Must show up for class as each lab is worth 3% and its not a completion grade! Reg is a great guy who is very passionate about his work!,1
"leave, leave, leave... unless you want to have the worse semester of your university career.",0
"She is a nice, but blunt and odd lady. Her classes are long and boring, but it is easy and if you pay attention to the films you can learn a little something. Attendance was mandatory, which was hard because the class isn't that fun. But it is easy, and for general ed, might as well. Waste of time anyway.",0
"His lectures will put you to sleep within five minutes. Coursework is easy but time-consuming because he's so nit picky. Disorganized and looks for ways to cut points. Penalizes heavily for insignificant mistakes, and claims that's how the real world works. Seems to think students are stupid. Overly critical and just downright awkward. AVOID.",0
"She is very biased and if your opinions do not match hers she gives a lower paper grade. She is a really nice lady and does care. This was her first year, so hopefully she improves.",1
"One of my favorite classes. Bodnar is very blunt in his lectures- he gives the facts, to the point, and you know when he wants you to remember something because he repeats it and spells it. Very easy for majors, relatively easy for non-majors. I greatly enjoyed the class.",1
Online class. Pretest. By the numbers. Lacked life.,0
Dr. Yao is a tough professor and is not always clear in her material.  She gets confused by herself a lot.  There are a lot of opportunities for extra credit.  Tests are very hard and not always what is taught in her lectures.  Did not use the book.,0
"Difficult to understand his speech at times. Students are not very well respected. His idea of review doesn't help much. Does a poor job of explaining concepts. The class is taught in an INCREDIBLY boring way (lecture every day, virtually nothing else).",0
"Literally the best professor I've ever had. Pure genius. I am in love with his brain, it's a blessing to have his class. This is not the typical English class but instead a class where I learn how to live and make meaning of life. Please take him. He really is something. ",1
Took him online. He posts the lectures and slides so you can watch at your own pace. He graded on the midterm and final. He zoomed once a week to answers any questions and offered advice on what to study and how the tests were going to be. Stick to the schedule he gave and you should be fine.,1
Basketball and Volleyball class was awesome. She is fun and interactive. Gives you an A for coming to class and paying attention to the things she coaches in class. Assessments are easy if you are at least somewhat athletic.,1
"Professor Biermann is a nice man, he is funny, and can go off topic on funny subjects. However his lectures do not really do anything, he relies mainly on you reading the book, if you are someone like me who learns more when the professor explains things and actually TEACHES you, then prof Biermann is not your man. Also his movie selection sucks!",0
"He means well but don't take this class with Ball if you don't have to. Class is unbelievable boring and obvious, yet the group projects are graded super harshly with unclear feedback.",0
"For the love of all things, don't take this class with him...",0
"Only grades Exams. She does not do quizzes, test, assignments or homework. Does not give extra credit. Excepts you to study 3 hours for every hour you are in the class.  Would not recommend.",0
Don't take his class unless you want to lower your GPA.,0
"Dr. Woodman's class is relies heavy on memorization. There are few concepts. It's like memorizing a new language to some degree. If you don't study outside of the two labs (which give you ample amounts of study time) and the lectures, don't expect to pass. Woodman's delivery is impeccable and he likes to joke as well! Great class!",1
He can be very discouraging but there is a method to his madness he tries to break you to push you to either be better or give up. good guy and very passionate about his job. if i could go back in time the only reason i would go to rye arch again would be his class.,1
"This professor is by far the worst I've encountered in my student life. He is very unorganized, very unprofessional, with horrible time management skills. These qualities are a necessity if you want to become a prof. His lectures are long and boring. He offers very little guidance when to comes to assignments which are quite tough.",0
"She is a nice lady, if you are on her favorites side. She DOES NOT explain anything to you. Even if you ask her, she does give you a clear answer. She lectures her whole class. She is very relaxed when it comes to missing tests but I could not learn anything.",0
"He will give pop quizzes if no one shows up to class, so attend every class. Make sure to do well on the first few tests because they do get more difficult towards the end! The homework for this course takes a lot of time to complete but turn in all assignments and you will be fine. Hes really nice and easy to talk to if you ever have questions.",1
"David Bush is a really nice guy, and clearly loves what he teaches, however he is sometimes hard to understand as he can go off on tangents and sometimes skips or ignores things in his own presentations. Everyday there is a little ""review"" assignment worth 5 points which are easy enough especially since they are done together.",1
awesome instructor,1
"If you came here to seek advice on picking Teitlebaum or Goto, good luck. Other than than, Teitlebaum's classes are boring and he's very monotonous. He reads his notes on a projector so you don't actually need to go to class. His office hours were a lot more helpful than the class itself. The material and tests are fair, but he's just so boring.",1
"She is an amazing teacher! One of my favorites! She makes learning fun and less tedious. She really care about her students and her passion for geography gets all of us students pumped up to learn. Shes super funny and it's just great! It is a little difficult, a lot of reading and studying, but it's only to help better yourself! ",1
"I absolutely adore him. I only took this class as a pre-requisite for photo. I have always thought I was bad at art and really disliked it, but after having him as a teacher he made is so enjoyable and was really encouraging. I would definitely recommend him.",1
"Great teacher, makes the material interesting (yes it is possible).  Is open to ideas and suggestions. I would recommend him to anyone!",1
Good prof...listens to the debate and lets you have and form opinions about the events that have taken place...and for middle eastern history that is hard to find.,1
I am jaw-dropped by these ratings. She doesnt calculate your grade throughout the semester so we went into the final NOT KNOWING what we had. We are now 2 days away from grades being finalized and I still dont know my grade is or what I got on the final. She knows econ but this class is weighted too much on tests and I dont find it very fair.,0
Doesn't actually teach the material. Just reads over her slides and expects students to get it right away. Does not seem to put a lot of time into this class. Generally nice person but it seems like she has other things to worry about other than her Soc 201 class.,0
"He expects you to know what he is talking about. Walks out of class while you do classwork, brushes you off if you have a question. Not very helpful, but he is nice.",0
"Joan was great until we got our first assignments back. After they were returned she all of a sudden had all these expectations she didn't tell us about. She doesn't look over assignments either, she directs you to the grader and takes no interest herself. Even when the discrepency was pointed out she refused to acknowledge the injustice.",0
"Drugs and the brain...do not like the debates about what everyone else thinks about drugs and society.  I feel like it is a waste of time, and I would rather learn more about drugs and the BRAIN. He is a very nice guy, though.",1
"He has a clear passion for journalism, but not for his students. He was not approachable. I didn't feel comfortable asking him questions, and his answers were very ambiguous. After every assignment we turned in, he would tell us that we didn't do what he was asking for. We never knew exactly what he wanted.",0
no comments,1
"Seems like a nice guy, just has a very monotone voice and talks, not teaches.. he is clearly very intelligent and knows his stuff, he just feels to old to be teaching a class of 300",0
"Easy-going personality. Extremely knowledgeable and passionate about Philosophy. Has very boring lectures that can be hard to follow - take detailed notes you will be fine. 33% of grade = attendance (max of 2 absences), 67% = 2 essays given w/ topics to CHOOSE FROM. I would definitely recommend.",1
"Kipp is the BEST! It's half way through the semester and we haven't had any homework. He just asks you to bring in an article from the web every now and then pertaining to the topic that is being covered that day.  You do have to show up to class, although he doesn't take attendance, he covers the test very well in class. It's HARD to NOT do well!",1
"Shes an awesome teacher. But can be very serious sometimes. Take this class serious because if you dont youll have to do what I did, withdraw and take it next semester. She grading is super simple, a lot of extra credit, but when you dont listen you can miss something super important. Please take this class serious!!",0
"He's extremely rude for no reason. He always has an attitude, and teaches horribly!! You can barely understand what he says and if you ask a question he answers sarcastically. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND HIM! HE IS HORRIBLE!!!",0
Mr. Winkler is a really good guy. He always explains things when you have a question. His tests are pretty much common sense and he also puts the answers on his website. He is very funny and I would absolutely take his 8am class if you want to make it through the rest of the day!,1
"He doesn't speak Spanish very well.  He's ultimately very enthusiastic, but doesn't speak like a native at all.  He is pretty easy as long as you can memorize vocab.  The final was an ""interview,"" which basically meant we talked to him for 5 minutes in his office. Want an easy A? Take Rapin.",1
Trim is a super good prof! He makes all concepts of linear algebra simple and fun to understand! Going to class is enjoyable and if you attend regularly its very easy to get an A+,1
I had professor Le for Statistics and pre-calculus and I think he's amazing. I am not very good at math but I could understand everything very easily. He goes step by step and makes sure you understand before he moves on. You have to make sure that you do the homework because that's how you practice. I would definitely take him again.,1
The tests were so easy and then the final was completely IMPOSSIBLE...people were actually crying. I would NEVER recommend him to anyone. EVER.,0
"Marafino is the bestttt. I would take him again in a heartbeat. He reminds me of Jack Black every time I see him. He's a super funny guy and cares about his profession and knows what he is talking about. He does tend to grade tests in an untimely manner, but other than that his class is engaging and its not the typically bio class.",1
"I was excited in the beginning of the course since she seemed to have an amazing, bright and energetic personality. However , as the course progressed, her perky personality made it very easy for her to wander off topic. tbh, for a 45 min class, roughly only 15-20 mins of class was actual course content. labs are doable and can be fun but tedious.",0
Not a very good prof. His notes are VERY confusing and all over the place. Definitely preferred the other profs. Plus his exam questions weren't straight forward at all - very tricky.,0
I hated this teacher. She got upset when I asked for help  and made my learning experience so unpleasant that I regretted ever having attended NSCC. She should be fired.,0
She is marvelous.,1
"Nice guy Mr. Zarb. He makes this horrible subject fun. Very outgoing, if you have to take accounting take it with him.",1
"He doesn't give any time in class for lab, even though there states that there is a time designated for lab. He just breezes through the lecture and expects you to be good with the coding. Doesn't teach coding at all, and expects you to do the labs on your own. There are 4 labs, and one final exam and no homework.",0
"Great teacher. I recommend you take her if you don't take politics too seriously. Unfortunately for me, she was a little to obviously leftward leaning in her personal bias. Preference isn't usually an issue as many are liberal at BBC, but the class was critical thinking and she did little to incite any critical thinking to a mostly lib class.",1
"The class in nature had poor structure. The topics taught were random excel topics. There are few assignments, most being group work. The rubrics were vague, including the final project rubric for a project worth the same amount as the exams. This caused our groups grades to tank at the end of the semester.",0
"He expects a lot out of you. The workload is a lot. Does not lecture well, be ready to teach yourself outside of class. will help during office hours, however. Will definately put you to sleep- 3 hours of nap a week!",1
"He is a nice guy, but it's hard to see that in class. He is understanding when you seek help outside of class, but he is sometimes overly vague. Little instruction is given and it seems that he expects you to read his mind. I have no doubt that he is brilliant, but I feel like you work really hard but never really succeed.",0
The best psych teacher at ELAC. Very approachable and very understanding. Great lectures and notes. She really likes group work. Makes psych fun and easy to learn. Highly recommend her class!,1
I can honestly say I liked his sense of humore but I always thought that I had a talent for writing well- untill I took this class. There is NO professor for this course that I would recommend. You will have a crapload of frustrations no matter what. It's not easy.,1
"He was awesome. Answered all my questions, gave me supplementary reading material whenever I asked. His tests were a breeze if you bothered to read the book.  I'd take another class from him anytime.",1
"BEST. PROF. EVER. The only good thing about Guelph. Super intelligent, though not easy! He keeps you on your toes, but guarantees a great educational experience. If you are lazy or a freeloader, don't expect to get anywhere.",1
"The textbook is easily found online in PDF form! It isn't too important, but helps grasp concepts better and it's a good read. Professor Bullock explains the concepts very well too. His class is very rarely boring. There are 2 essays and 2 tests, none of which are very hard. I definitely recommend any class with this professor!!",1
"Professor Maller is very knowledgeable as is evident by the manner in which he attempts to relate calculus to the real world. While he's quite a captivating lecturer, Maller teaches and explains concepts at a much higher level than we (undergrad. students) could understand. My advice: learn the material on YouTube and let the class be a review!",1
"John Fu is a great teacher. His teaching style is a little boring, but he knows a lot about graphic design and is extremely valuable to students who are serious about a career in the field. Overall, wonderful guy, very passionate, and always willing to help. He'll surprise you! Will certainly take his classes again!",1
RUN I YOU CARE FOR YOUR GPA. THIS CLASS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY L I K E PHILOSOPHY OR HUMANITIES. THIS PROFESSOR SHOULD NOT TEACH GED CLASSES!!!!!!!! HIS CLASS IS FOR A PHD STUDENT. HE THINKS HIS STUDENTS ONLY HAVE TIME TO READ FROM THE TEXTBOOK FOR HIS CLASS EVERY DAY. DO N O T TAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOULL THANK ME LATER!,0
"Dr. Black is an easy professor. He's a nice guy who is very personable. His tests are easy for the most part. And if you are going through the RTV program you will get the same questions on tests as you go up, so it's easy to remember. Some say he's boring which is kind of true. Just don't be worthless and he'll like you.",1
Its a waste of time,0
"Dr. Airhart is symbolizes what is wrong with Houghton College.  Pretentious, elitist, but with nothing to show for it.  He doesn't get what Houghton is about.  Do yourself a favor and take someone, anyone, else.  Like so many others, he ruined my freshman year.",0
"Never responds to posts or questions. Had assignments in the syllabus that I spent 4+ hours a week on and she never even opened them, later found out that she has it in there but does not grade them, of course found this out after week 5 or 6 of 8. Lazy as all get out, takes her sweet time getting grades back to you. Easy grading though.",0
"very, but very disorganized and is not there most of the time in class",0
"Sheryl is strict but as long as you do your work and go to class, you will be fine. Make sure to talk to her in advance with problems and questions. You never want to wait to the last minute with her. That's what makes her angry.",1
Good Prof.  Very interested in the text.  You must be prepared.  No slacking--he will call on you.,1
"Knows his math, but horrible at teaching it. I went to office hours frequently and only then could I get a partial understanding. Completely unorganized: papers  all over, and not surprisingly my HW got lost in that tornado. Lectures just as messy. Concepts aren't nearly as hard as he teaches them to be. Still possible to do well with a ton of work",0
"don't take this guy's courses if you're lazy or stupid, he's way ahead of his time",1
"Although this is Spanish conversation, you never have conversations. You mostly read from a textbook and memorize speeches.  It was a semi-easy A but if you are looking to improve your Spanish speaking skills, don't take this class.",0
"60% of your grade is based on class participation, 2 of which you have to sign up for. 20% based on your exams (5) and the other 20% on your final. He do however drop the lowest score. He expects you to read the materials thoroughly prior to attending class and his exams are very detailed oriented. Expect to know your stuff.",1
"This guy is great.  His lectures can get a little boring, but if you start to fall asleep, they're all posted online.  Working in the studio with him is fun.  He's cool, take him.",1
"very smart, gives good notes, class is so boring though only downside",1
Online was the only option and lectures were held twice a week. He used a different format during lectures than the homework and quizzes. He also seemed like he had an attitude when anyone asks questions. The tests were a higher level of difficulty than what was being taught with not enough time (you had about 2 1/2 minutes for each question.,0
"Chen is a terrible explainer. Majority of the class never attended his online synchronous lectures, but instead used YouTube videos and recitation to learn the material. He was lenient with changing the homework due date when needed! His homeworks, tests, and quizzes are pretty easy (thus why many ppl passed without learning through him).",0
She is a pretty good professor. You take a LOT of notes that you have to print b4 every class but she definitely tries to work a lot of examples. There are 7 quizzes and 3 tests. She offers extra credit assignments for every test. There are three math labs that should be easy A's if you do the work. HW due 3x a week. Do the work and you'll be fine.,1
"DO NOT TAKE! I am an A student that works hard for grades and I ended up with the lowest grade ever. LB is polite, but is an extremely tough when it comes to grading. Often times her grading never made sense. She does offer extra credit, but I never knew my grade because the entire semester she never once uploaded grades to BB!! DO NOT RECOMMEND",0
Worst teacher I've had in my entire life.,0
Onononn,1
"Dr. Andersh is the first person to take students beyond gen. chem. He presents organic as good as it can be done. The material is certainly hard, but it is a required course for the major. Dr. A certainly makes organic as painless as possible and is always willing to help, even outside office hours. Got a B in his class with built in curve.",1
"I want to be fair as much as I can, but she's a real tough grader she deducts a lot of marks for very simple mistakes, marks were flying out just like money on a shopping spree and she won't help you with any extra credit either. So, don't let your GPA suffer. She is a good teacher though but still Gen chem I doesn't have to be that hard.",0
"Easy class, but he is rude to students. Doesn't answer questions well, and is very short with students. If you are confused, good luck.",0
Organic Chem is supposed to be difficult but I personally did not like his lectures and his tests were too long. Be prepared for lengthy exams if you take him . He does care and is a nice guy though.,0
"Well, I cheated on the final because he left the class to go have a smoke, I never went to class. All you have to do is the assignments and memorize last year's midterms. If you want you could maybe try to understand economics, but I didn't.",0
Campbell is by far the best instructor at MHCC.  She give clear and interesting lecturers.   If you need help she is always willing to help.  He classes are some of the best I have ever taken.,1
"Write an essay that is not her opinion and your grade suffers, as she will want you to rewrite it to fit her opinion. Rewrites are an option, at least. Too many books to read, and not much time (100 pages in 2 days). Didn't read half of them due to work in other classes, still got a B. Nice prof, but it was too stressful how little time there was.",0
"Dr. Ferguson is very knowledgeable about what he's teaching and you can tell he cares for his students. He makes history interesting. However, it is impossible to take good notes unless you type down everything he says. Tests cover a lot of information and it was hard to prepare for them because the test questions are difficult to understand.",1
Ed has been one of the most difficult professors I have ever experienced. Throughout class I found myself extremely lost. Even after going to office hours I was still lost. The tests are unpredictable. Goes through topics quickly to end class early. Don't waste your time taking his course.,0
"FSE100 is an easy class on its own, as there are no tests, but Muhlian sure does make it quite unenjoyable. He is very bad at explaining what happens during lab, and oftentimes the whole class (including the TAs) are confused about what we're supposed to be doing. During lecture, he's also confusing and not very engaging .",0
"Anthony Kemp is an amazing professor. He is a genius and his lectures are amazing. He doesn't do attendance but if you go to class, you will do well on the midterm and final. If you go to his office hours, he'll really help you out with your papers.  He loves Bob Dylan and punk music. Trust me, if you're interested in learning, take him!  ",1
the class itself is tough. u need to pass both the lecture and lab. there is no curve so u need to work to do well on the exams. there is NO CURVE so beware. hes not very clear and it bad at explaining the material. the exam material is literally a copy&paste of labs and lecture slides but its a lot of material to remember so be prepared to work,0
"Hambrick was awesome for psych. I would suggest going to class and listening to the lectures and stories he tells, but if you are someone that can teach yourself the material, then he does post all of his powerpoints the week before each exam. You have to participate in a few hours of research studies but you can get EC from them if you do extra!",1
"she's nice but not very lenient. you must show up to class and do work on time or tough luck. the lectures weren't too long, there are quizzes every new topic with a few questions but they were not extremely hard. the final was about 20-25 questions as the normal test length for this class and she gives partial credit. take her class",1
"I had no idea about astronomy before this class. I have come to find that my perspective on the universe and reality was incredibly flawed. This class was great and you will learn a bunch of cool stuff from a guy who really knows his sh**, he works for NASA for God sakes! He wears the coolest(nerdiest) shirts abd hes very approachable. Take it!",1
"Said there would be 3 projects. He failed at assigning them appropriately so we ended up having 3 months for 1 and the last 2 weeks of school for 2 more. The class went through hell because he failed to do his job. If you ever feel helpless in his class  and are working hard, just know that it's not you, it's him having ridiculous expectations. ",0
"Great, easy class, full of fun.  Everyone loves prof. & this class.  Easy A.",1
"The homework software for AME204 is one of the most frustrating things I've ever dealt with. Professor Boloury is also not the best lecturer, as he lulls a lot of people to sleep.",0
"Straight-A student for a year and a half before this class. This class was so difficult for me and I'm usually good in history. His study guides were so inconsistent with the tests and lectures. He gets too distracted and doesn't focus on the materials asked on the tests. He was especially bad during the COVID-19 situation, no online experience.",0
One of my favorite math professors ever!! Kinda awkward but in a good way. He is very clear on what the tests will be on and explains everything extremely well.,1
I thought I should do a service to SDSU students and warn you about this teacher. She is the worst prof I have ever taken! She is unorganized & overall this was a ridiculous class. Tests are long do not include multiple choice.I will get an acceptable grade but she made it really hard for me because she is so nonsensical. TAKE HER AT YOUR OWN RISK!,0
This class is by far the most easiest A I received at UT. Katey is such a great and caring professor. She is always willing to help and gives clear instructions on assignments. I would recommend this class to anyone! Take her!,1
"Lectures aren't the most interesting, but he has a very forgiving exam policy. There are 3 exams, and he will drop your lowest exam grade if you went to class. You can also get a two-sided cheat sheet. The ""miniprojects"" are easy and usually has a good real life application. Homeworks slightly more difficult but manageable.",1
"STAYYYYYY AWAYYYYYYY!!!!! she wont help you out at all and if you do ask for help, you will be more confused than you were previously. Her average on her first test was below a 50%-- DONT TAKE HER CLASS WHATEVER YOU DO!!!!!  i had to drop the class she was so bad",0
"Extremely unclear as to what he wanted from our papers, would routinely give out low grades without explaining why, in class reading assignments made no sense as they were all from Victorian England. In asking us to write a research paper he made it impossible to change our topic even if we wanted to early on. ",0
"People give Ravetch a hard time because he's challenging and you have to work hard to get a good grade in his class, but he's one of the best professors I've ever had at UCLA. I'm taking all  my future accounting classes from Ravetch.",1
Incredibly hard class and hard professor. if you are taking this class get a tutor ASAP. Professor will call on you randomly if no one raises their hand. if you don't know the answer he will embarrass you infront of the whole class. online homework is really hard and theres a lot of it. Avoid this professor and DO NOT take his 6-9 class.,0
"Professor Roth is wonderful! She is a very tough teacher, though. She has been extremely helpful to me in many ways! If you want to improve your writing, grammar skills, and overall academic thinking- take her course! You won't get an easy A. If you put the time and effort into her class, you will do fine. She takes a while to warm up to also:)",1
Professor May knows his stuff. I really benefited from his knowledge. I would recommended his class.,1
"Posts long lists of articles for you to read, some of which don't work or aren't accessible, doesn't post grades throughout the quarter, ""quiz"" questions (they're essays) don't have the same material as the readings . Uses different terms than the readings & posts open-ended questions then grades on super specific rubrics you don't see until after",0
"Terribly nice guy, however, unless you have hours every day a month before each exam to study and have outstanding memorization I promise you will not get an A. I had to take this class for the nursing program. I'm mostly an A student with an occasional B and I struggled to get a C in this class. And that's even after studying my ass off. ",0
"His classes only require you to write 3 papers all semester, there are 0 other assignments, so it's not time consuming at all. A great class to take to get a gen. ed. out of the way. However, lectures are hard to follow.",0
He's very caring and He will understand but don't skip its not worth is just go to class actually do the work and you just can't be lazy. Btw He's a Cardinals fan so for any future present ideas.,1
Sports psych is an interesting class and she makes it as fun as possible.  Plus she is soooo funny!,1
Great at explaining complex ideas one step at a time so they are easy to understand! Also very helpful in labs. Beware the final exam is quite long and difficult but for some reason you only get 2 hours for it.,1
"Annoying, arrogant, and generally not fun to be around.",0
He is very unfair with the grades!,0
"While the class itself was a bit difficult and required a lot of studying, I truly enjoyed having her as a teacher. Very funny and is always willing to help outside of class if you're behind. Expect to be studying at least 1-2 hours a day. Learned quite a bit.",1
"Dr. Lessoff is great, he truly cares about his students and wants them to succeed. His lectures are not the best and he can get off topic or be confusing at times. I feel like he knows so much that he has a difficult time simplifying the material. I would not suggest this class for a non-major. If you are willing to ask for help he will help.",1
"One of the best professors I have ever had! He is very passionate about the material and will encourage everyone to speak during class. He is a very easy professor to pass because in a way, no answer is wrong as long as you can explain why you think that way. He can be goofy and hard to follow at times but overall a wonderful and insightful teacher",1
Tough grader. I personally would not recommend him if you want to genuinely understand your accounting classes and if you want to pass/get good marks. Don't let his charm fool you cause he's really though during exams. Very low class averages (around 50%).,0
"I am getting my second Masters degree through AMU & Makri is by far the worst professor I have ever come across. She is accusatory, offensive and when she does not agree with a paper she will write incredibly inappropriate, unprofessional and offensive comments on it. It got so out of hand I actually reported her to the university. Stay away!",0
Dr. Bush is my favorite teacher at Nazareth by far and I look forward to having her more in the future!  I recommend her to anyone interested in psychology! :),1
"Ridiculously ambiguous notes, lectures, assignments, etc. Have taken many of his classes and have always been forced to find other resources online to understand the material. This is fine for the easier classes like COP3330 but it stops being cute when you get to higher level courses. Makes no attempt to break down what he's teaching, loves jargon",0
"Don't bother going to the lectures. All he does is read off the slides and stare at the ceiling all class. I slept through 90% of lectures and got an A. Assignments take a very long time. As long as you go to all the labs, you should find the class isn't too hard.",0
"AVOID AT ALL COSTS! I DOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS CLASS! Mr. Krawetz is extremely rude, he is very condescending and should take some communicationsocial interactions etiquette classes. ""Will treat you like garbage and talk down to you, apparently asking for help means your stupid in his opinion"" #shavethestash",0
"Professor Benefiel is not a teacher you want. I am an all A student and received a 72 in his class that was originally supposed to be a 69. His lectures are unclear, he doesn't answer questions (rather beats around the bush), his tests are hard with 6-8 questions and he barely helps you. Do NOT get this professor. Good luck if you do. (MCC not OCC)",0
"Mark is great, the formatting of his assignments are very clear if you follow the steps and he always give you examples . I feel that he is very fair teacher. You get what you put in.",1
"Very nice lady. Class material is boring and common sense, but she can make it interesting. Make sure to know all the study terms, easy A.",1
"Best prof ever. Amazing lectures, he is the GOAT",1
"Tim is a nice guy and loves to help if asked, he will assign a lot of reading if you can stay on top of that you should do fine. He allows rewrites, & probably one the few teachers who is easy and at the same time brings out your best writing skills. he is also quite interesting and brings so many ideas to discuss, likes to incorporate Film & music",1
"What an amazing professor!! He was so prepared for class, had visual aids, tried to include the students within the lecture, communicated very clearly. I was happy that the course ended with Dr. Wright. A truly great professor.Way to go Dr. Wright! You're a great professor, you should be very happy that students think so.",1
"Terry Hoops is a great professor! He gets a bad rap for being disorganized and sometimes being off topic, but I always thought that his tangents were very interesting. I had him for his CI and his ANTH class- both were a lot of fun! There is a lot of reading you are expected to do, but if you miss it, he explains it well. I recommend his classes!",1
nice,1
I had a lot of hope for this class and this professor. I have found Dr. Saunders very condescending when you are asking questions and seems aloof despite trying to make jokes in class. He flies through the PPT and excel examples. He says attendance doesn't count but will hand out random extra credit on a whim. Class is a drag and I am disappointed.,0
"This course was a flop. The material itself was so interesting. The course outline consists of 2 mid terms worth 30% each and one final exam worth 40%. THAT IS BONKERS. He uploads his own lecture slides, in which none of the info is ever on the exam. You basically have to read and memorize the textbook front to back. Worst class ever.",0
Professor Lim or Dr. Lim was okay at teaching but she was very cocky and passive aggressive. She consistently would flaunt her Ph.D. at RPI. It was cool at first but after the 20th time it was really annoying. I wished she focused on the course. She's a really tough grader if you don't follow the criteria given. She tends to overcomplicate things.,0
"She's a really nice lady, but I don't like the way she teaches. Her lectures are hard to follow, the PowerPoint slides are disorganized, and the reading assignments are way too long (I've had to read more for her class than for Great Books this semester). The exams are pretty difficult, although she doesn't grade too hard on essays, surprisingly.",0
Very unimpressed with this teacher. Very unhelpful and uninformative. I would avoid any and all classes with this man.,0
"A really nice professor, learned a lot from her.",1
Best teacher and nicest woman ever.  She will do anything she can to help.  :),1
Nice prof but hard tests,1
He likes to zone in and have intense conversations with students in the zoom lectures. He does not take idk as an answer. He will make his students feel like crap and will embarrass them. He only teaches 3 lectures then expects you and your group to do the stimulation all on your own for the rest of semester. AVOID AT ALL COST!!!!,0
"Dr. Malpass was the hardest professor I have ever taken. She talks so slow and does not explain what she is saying. She grades super hard and you cannot read her handwriting, so you have no idea what you did wrong. Her office hours are very limited and she forgets what she tells you most of the time. Very hard class with a very hard prof.",0
"This class was a mess. I did not miss one lecture and still struggled. There are 2 midterms each worth 21% with only 20 marks available on them. The 5 assignments are only worth 10% . She said the assignments are mainly to prepare you for quizzes and the exam, but when you only get 1/5 back by the end of the term, that system doesn't help. Awful.",0
"Dr. Williams is an okay professor. She sticks to the textbook and her powerpoints, which are posted as links. She gives out T/F quizzes once a week on the chapter she asked you to read. You can have a cheat sheet on every exam. She has a strong southern accent that can be hard to understand. Easy grader on the term paper. Okay overall. not awesome.",1
BAD PROFESSOR,0
"Had him for Math in 2014, without his fast pace, i wouldn't have been prepared for the rest of the courses. Other people that complain about him are most likely just lazy. He gives marks for doing homework... .easiest marks you can get that will help you do well on the mid terms and finals. 5% for homework was the difference for me to get an A!",1
I hate this guy.  I'm sick and tired of all the work he gives us in the form of annoying long essays that go on forever.  POLITICS POLITICS POLITICS thats all his english class is about all the time it's so freakin annoying HE'S SO ANNOYING DONT TAKE THIS GUY YOUR GPA WILL DROP AND SO WILL YOUR HAPPINESS. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD GET OUT B4 ITS TOO LATE,0
He can make a boring subject interesting and is very helpful.,1
"good lectures, tricky tests!!!!!  -- better study hard",1
"Read off her slide. Come in class, sit at the front using her microsoft surface device to display slide and extremely bad handwriting when she does write something on the side or example, which is rare than diamond. Prevent taking her classes at all.",0
"read the material show up to class. she uses critical thinking with you when you have questions about the material. and exam review DO NOT TAKE your phone out ! respect her!. if you have questions she answers them and she wants students to pass. very genuine and caring person. Nursing school is hard, a lot of people look for an easy route. STUDY",1
He is EXTREMELY INTELLECTUAL and helpful!!!! BEST PSYCH TEACHER YET!!!!,1
I took Creative Writing in the 1980s with W - She was wonderfully inspirational with an incisive mind and a transparently compassionate heart.,1
"There are 5 discussion questions and 10 journals  at least 500 words, 10 quizzes throughout the semester and final project is powerpoint presentation with narrative . You have to keep up with moodle because something is due every week. Discussion questions are quite difficult. If you try hard and get your assignments done on time this is an easy A.",0
"Terrible class. Terrible teacher. I've never felt so behind or confused in a class. Projects and papers are nearly impossible- everything assigned is so vague. Do not take this class, please.",0
"Best prof to learn something from. You will be better for taking his class. But he is the hardest to get an easy A from. Class is technically non-mandatory but there are quizzes every day that cannot be made up, so take that for what you will.",1
"this is a really tough class, so i advice you to come prepared. Get read for online quizzes, discussions because they are alot, and I advice you do all the quizzes and discussions because they can help with your grade, I took the last class last semester, and came out with D, so i had to retake and thankfully, I came out with a B. Be PREPARED!",0
"An awesome professor, especially in a field with such difficult concepts! He's older and has an uncensored sense of humour, which is hilarious. Attending lectures is important, as the material in the texts you use definitely requires explanation in-class. The exam questions are given before the exam. Get TA advice before submitting each paper!",1
"The class is easy, but I expected an upper level class to actually help me learn something about my field.  I've had 100 level classes that were more intellectually challenging.  This is not a community college!  She plays favorites, and isn't very good if she doesn't like you so stay on her good side!",0
"Unlike the rest of the LBS professors, Buchanan doesn't assign much work at all. He goes through no cases during the semester and only asks for a few write-ups and the group project submission. So his class is not very challenging. That being said, he doesn't grade at all - no one knew their grades until after the semester was long over.",0
"I loved this Class! Kim's lectures and handouts are very helpful, and I would totally take her again. She does grade very hard and her tests are difficult so you have to study to succeed.",1
I would not recommend him as a professor. Avoid him. He is rude. We are tested on things we haven't gone over in class yet. Information in unclear gives us an idea of what to expect on quizzes and half of the stuff isn't even on there. Worse class ever.,0
Peterson is so funny! Definitely made MSC 111 memorable and worth understanding. The material is great but his portions of the tests are always tricky,1
"She is a horrible teacher. Not receptive to criticism at all, speeds through the presentations like a game, will have the biggest portion of the test (open response) about stuff you hadn't gotten to. If you attempt to push back on her she will talk to you passive-aggressively. I loved bio so much and she has left me hating it.",0
"He gives quizzes every week worth only 1% of your mark that let you know your weak areas. If you spend time only studying the material for the quizzes where you didn't score 100%, you'll ace this class. He doesn't care about attendanceparticipation.",1
"The worst professor I have ever had at SMU. He doesn't respond to emails, does not post grades online, and rarely gives back tests. His handwriting is at a 6th grade level and he ridicules students in front of the entire class to the point where multiple people have dropped because of it. 46 people have dropped from my class if that says anything.",0
The most boring professor I have ever taken. He is also like 70 and barely can use technology. He is also super paranoid about people using phones and laptops in class. He can be rude and annoying. Talks on and on about stuff that won't ever be on any tests.,0
This class was so interesting yet so much fun. It was my morning class and I never fell asleep in there,1
"Dr Young was an alright professor but he is very vague on assignments. There is only a few non comprehensive exams, but if you take good notes, you will do good, He adds a 10-12 curve on each exam, so that the good thing. Very vague on what he wants on the projects, but he is willing to help if asked. Very monotone, so it is hard to stay awake.",0
"I loved this class until the very end. I did really well, received feedback that I was meeting all expectations, even got a 100% on my midterm but then received a 3.8 in the class with no feedback as to how I could have done better. When I asked about it, she attempted to drag me into an email debate about whether GPA matters or not.",0
"well it seems like she's made up at least 99% of the good comments here, because none of them make sense as they are certainly not characteristic of her!",0
This class was an easy A. You basically write one paper throughout the whole semester one portion at a time. You do 5 mini presentations one each section of the paper and then have 5 quizzes on each section of the paper. Then you present the whole paper at the end and that's it. Her PPs are online but they are unclear if you do not go to class.,1
"This class is a joke. I received a C in this class, which I will take the blame for, I didn't work as hard as I should've. That being said, I am a 3.87 cumulative student, and this was the hardest class I've ever taken. The review sessions do not adequately cover the material on the exam at all. This is supposed to be a Intro class, its not. MCAT.",0
"Personal experience and friends taking the course, he tells you what will be on the exam .... he gives you the complete opposite.  He definitely knows what he is talking about but is very boring in class.",0
"Super boring, but she really means well. She is passionate about the subject and answers any questions you might have but it's just lectures and lectures. It's only midterm, final, and essay that are really graded. there is assignments and discussion posts, super easy so do them to get that bread!! but easy a (:",0
Tough grader and definitely picks favorites. Avoid taking English Classes with her if you are a Non-Major.,0
This class is easy credits. The assignments were a breeze - I usually did them in the last 15 minutes or so before class. Class was frustrating because too many people talked and she didn't do anything about it.  Exams didn't have a lot to do with lecture or the reading.  Start studying early. She's very Christian and caring.,1
"I hate typing papers and he made it so much easier.We'd watch videos and he  let us out early most of the time. I missed one class and didn't do a worksheet thus dropping my grade a bit so yeah attendance counts,though he helps you if you ask for the work on missed days.I loved this class so much I'm not going to take any other eng prof for ENG105.",1
"Harvey is amazing. It is a difficult class but she explains things great. Make sure you practice whatever she tells you to and you'll be fine. For exams, she lets you look at the past 4 semesters and tells you problems to focus on, and her exams are similar. Lecture is not mandatory but you get a grade for workshop (which is practice). Take her!!",1
"Take Antaramian/Greenlee for intro Psyc courses. Cartwright's tests consist of topics never discussed in class. She gives an outline for the exams, but even if you study/read everything it's not enough. Don't let her fool you into thinking she gives ""application"" q's. They aren't. They're subjective questions with no logical explanation.",0
"there are times when you dont understand what hes talking about because he likes to use his own variables. Read ahead. his examples sometimes help. he can be funny. Theres no point in going to wednesday classes with him because all he does is take up hmwk, unless you havent done it. The test was easy, enough mistakes found to boost up your mark.",0
"Let's start with the fact that he teaches from his own book that he wrote. His presentations were stale and boring and hard to understand, he is also very careless of job oblogations, especially law enforcement. I had to use the tutoring season and I was told by them that he doesn't teach statistics the correct way. Find a different teacher!",0
She is not a very good professor. She doesn't explain things well and doesn't help much when you are confused on homework. If you ask her a question in class she never really answers it she just kind of floats around the answer and then moves on if you understand or not.,0
"Ginger is an awesome teacher. She is sooo helpful in class, and works well with all individual class not trying to make everyone go at the same speed. She always makes class fun and I can vouch for everyone when I say we look forward to her class.",1
"It's refreshing to have a professor that cares. Class was mainly discussion-based around social justice topics, so many opinions were shared, but he never looked at you differently for having one he didn't. Always asked how we were and gave great feedback on speeches. Attendance is graded, but we liked going anyways. Would take again 100%",1
Good woman...bad course...bad teaching style,0
"Be prepared for a lot of work. The class is good to take if you have nothing else to do. If you're working 40+ hours a week; he won't care he'll tell you to drop the course because you won't pass the class. He doesn't understand that sometimes life isn't that simple. He says if you can't devote at least 8 hrs a day to his course, drop it.",0
Great Professor really funny and helpful!!,1
"Prof Fleming does talk a lot, but she is trying to relate to things everyone can understand. She likes to point out diversity and encourage conversations. Fleming is passionate about her education and always willing to stay after to work with anyone that needs help.",1
"Horrid for an online prof, no help at all. There were no lectures made, no summarizations it was literally read 12 chapters the whole term. Kept saying there would be videos explaining concepts, and yet they were never made. The study guide for the exam was literally ""it's cumulative"". Would not take again.",0
"Class structure was a nice change of pace but the content of the class felt very much like a regurgitation of other entry level business classes with an international spin. Did not feel like I learned much from this class, and HWs and tests were long and only semi-related. Ended up with a MUCH lower grade than expected based ongrades prior to final",0
"While I was not a huge fan on the class, I really liked Professor Schmidt-Cruz. She was so kind and caring. The class itself is boring, bland, and the timeline is out of touch with the students (too much in too little time). Class is important, lots of group work. Two group presentations. Hopefully a lot is changed for the class itself. She's nice.",1
Dont take this Professor. He is an absolute awful person He assigned Homework over Thanksgiving break purposefully so we couldn't enjoy time with our Families. This is by far the worst professor ever,0
"I took him during the online semester, reading his reviews for in person instruction seem much better than online! We were not allowed a cheat sheet on exams. His lectures were the worst I have ever attended. He goes over simple example during lectures and gave homework that is much harder. Avoid him at any cost.",0
"Perhaps my favorite teacher thus far. She is very helpful and has real world experience in the business world. I find the class and material beneficial for my future in the business world. If you show up to class, it should be an easy A. ",1
"He goes through material so quickly that he losses the majority of the class. Even worse, if you ask a question he makes you feel dumb while he answers it. The only thing that saved my grade was a take home final so I could work on it over 10 hours. He's hard to get in touch with and doesn't really answer your questions.",0
"Nice enough fellow, but overall not a good teacher. Difficult to follow and an extremely, unnecessarily hard marker. I worked my butt off in this class and could never get an A in anything I handed in. He also gave very little reasoning for grades. Very frustrating. Lots of confusion with the textbooks as well...I recommend not taking this class.",0
"Professor Kenney is an incredible professor, and an all around wonderful human being. You will learn so much. Work hard and you'll see results. Best class I've taken at DePauw.",1
"He is just amazing! makes difficult concepts seem so easy, but you have to practice and work for it. He is genuine and cares about his students. Solved so many problems with us and spent so much time making sure we understand fully how to solve and analyze the problems. DONT miss his lectures! He is a once in a lifetime prof.",1
"She encouraged me to calm my anxieties and assured me she had worked with students just like me in her 26 years of teaching. She was always pleasant, eager to help and further explain. She took her time and wasn't annoyed if you asked questions or needed clarification. She lets you work in groups except on exam days. She is fair. Just do the work.",1
"I took Dr. Garver's class in Fall 19 and even though anatomy was such a difficult class, I enjoyed learning about it. Her lectures are long and you really have to pay attention to understand the lessons. She will have blanks on the notes she posts online, w/c is why you have to attend class & cuts off the last few mins of lecture in video. Goodluck",1
"Professor Winogora is the best. He tries his best to make the class fun and engaging, while encouraging conversation. It's a fun time, and he doesn't penalize you for having opinions if you can back them up. He gives an assignment for every class, but they're usually short and just help you keep up to date with what's going on in class.",1
"Although going to class isn't REQUIRED, I'd recommend it - lectures are useful and Professor Davis shows you how to do problems step-by-step. Don't make the assumption that doing the problems in class is enough - go home and practice. Professor Davis loves to make cheesy jokes in class, and usually the crowd is not receptive, so try to laugh a bit",1
"Really good prof. There are no posted lectures so you have to go to class or you won't get the material. He writes all his notes on the chalkboard which make them easy to follow. There's plenty of opportunities to get a good mark. Exam was fair, it has been the same for years. There are old exams posted on the course website, use them!",1
"The absolute worst experience of my college career. Horrific teacher, lacks all communication skills. He is extremely rude and does not know how to give constructive criticism in the slightest way. The only way you will pass the class if you attend every office hour session. He does not believe in giving A's. Seriously drop the class asap!!!!!",0
"Lectures include the ""value of a liberal arts education"" and Burton's personal past in politics, but nothing on the actual subject of the course. Course objectives were only met because of the textbook. Take a different professor.",0
This was the worst instructor I have had thus far. This is an intro class and he expects you to know what to do without any instruction from him. His comments on your speech are very critical and unhelpful. He is defiantly NOT a teacher more like a dictator!,0
Shes hilarious and her stories are great. Youll know whats expected and theres no random assignments. Everything is clear and she reminds you ahead of time. Only one research paper and few assignments.,1
Don't take this dude if you can - all he does is read off PDFs and then expects great results out of students. PDF of the book is available online so you don't have to buy it. Good luck,0
"Terrible and boring teacher. The lectures are very dry and dense. Exams are hard no matter what you study. There is one paper that I thought would save my grade, but he grades that harshly too. Grading is ridiculous and curves do not make any sense. Do yourself a favor and do not take this class unless you want a C.",0
"He hasn't taught me anything, he'll just give us a chapter to read and make unreasonable word requirements for the questions he put on the assignment. I try to get as close to the minimum as possible with as little information I get from the book. But apparently he counts the words and if you're at least 5 words away, 0 points for the question.",0
"Always there for his students, he cares about them and will do everything he can to help you!!",1
"Awesome prof, makes econ truly enjoyable. Speaks quite fast, but notes are super comprehensive. Zero maths for this course = great! Read & highlight notes before lecture strongly recommended. Do all assignments by yourself before discussing in your group. Fair exam.",1
"Already have degree so I signed up for this class for my job. 2nd  week-professor dropped me from the class. I have reached out to her to ask why & she is unresponsive. I had already submitted assignments & discussions that were due ahead of time. Now, I have to explain to my employer why they paid for class that I'm not even in anymore.",0
Confusing powerpoints/prezi. Unorganized lectures and difficult to know what to take notes on. More like political theories and application rather than knowing certain things about the government. Too in depth and complex for a gen ed.,0
She is the best prof I have had at SMU! She is one of my favourites and I've already planned to take more of her other courses!,1
"Yea, shes funny alright! Hilarious Especially when your accused of cheating or doing something wrong during a practical that you NEVER DID! I received a C on my Practical when the person that went before me did terrible and got an A. She attacks beauty and will make you feel less of a person if you are beautiful with brains. Be cautious with her.",0
Fenster is the tsar bomba in the world of chemistry. Made me laugh every class. The Man.,1
"Professor Lawson is one of my absolute favorite professors. He cares about his students and understands what we are going through. He makes his class super informative yet engages everyone. Class consisted of power point lectures. He gives a variety of examples for students to truly understand and remember. Tests were open book, notes, and groups.",1
"He is late on getting the homework up, and expects you to learn ""on your own"" and to ""own your grade."" His tests are a TON of memorization and just ridiculous. He rambles in class and doesn't teach what you need to know for the test in class. You have to go to study sessions outside of class in order to TRY to get an A. Avoid him at all cost.",0
"Very smart guy, but goes very fast and makes things hard to understand. His examples are good but the theory is hard to follow.",0
"This is my first time giving a negative review. Dr. Ahmad knows her material, but she does not effectively organize her class, or give clear instruction. I personally enjoyed the material that we covered in class overall, so my complaint is strictly on her inaffective teaching.",0
"I took this for some extra credits, but I was shocked with how much I learned. The prof was always willing to help and made it easy to contact her. If you are looking to improve your writing skills it is def worth the time to take this class. ",1
"Worst professor I've had at W&M so far. Very lecture heavy, which are extremely dry and fail to have a clear organization. Her test are poorly written, and rely heavily on trick such as ""only a or b"" or ""none of the above"". Did not take a single test with her that didn't have typos (and we only had three tests the entire semester)",0
"Professor Kotman is a humble guy. He's very nice, but not a good teacher. If you need a professor who will answer your questions and help you out he is not the one. His answers will usually not answer your questions and he likes to ramble. He also brings C# example code to a Java class. Facepalm. You will be on your own for the most part.",0
She is a great prof.  I would highly recommend taking Griffin for bio 160 if you can.,1
Hes not good at teaching. He doesnt work with his students AT ALL. So dont expect to talk to him about where your grade is at and him help you succeed or do better. I wish I didnt waste my time and money in this class. In the 6 years of going to college Ive never been more frustrated with a class. Dont waste your time with this one.,0
"Way easy, and you don't really learn much from him. What you learn is what you do in your team project and how much you contribute. Costanzo is pretty useless as a teacher.",0
"He's really nice and will help if you ask, but I can't promise that it will actually benefit you. He reads right off the slides and gets lost in thought a lot. He posts the slides online along with review questions for tests. I wouldn't recommend. but if you DO take his class, teach yourself using the textbook -it's the only way I passed!",0
"Very hard to understand, poor english. Goes very fast with out explaining much. I would not recommend.",0
"Flies through powerpoints. Homework three nights a week online. Tests are 20 questions only but still worth 100 points. Would be great teacher for upper level courses, but teaches general chemistry assuming students know more than we do. Very hard to follow, but clicker questions in every lecture.",0
Professor would go on long personal stories unrelated to the subject matter about aliens being in contact with national governments and about how Steve Jobs was Galileo in a past life. When the class went online due to Covid19 I muted every lecture and passed with a B. I read none of the textbook and guessed every question until I was done with it.,0
"Taking Spanish 204 with Profesora Sánchez is like taking two classes at once. In the first class, you complete predetermined online assignments that relate to the textbook and have casual grading deadlines. In the other class, Sánchez just lectures on certain legends, history, and musical stuff that she finds interesting about Bolivia and LatinAme.",1
"One of the worst professor I have taken. Does not teach well and makes a simple topic so complex and confusing. He puts people on the spot and confuses them if they know the answer. If you're an engineering student, he will talk crap about you and say you don't understand what you're doing. Said I did a disservice to my table for a derivative trick.",0
"WOW.. I barely rate professors but this one really got to me.  First off, if you want your emails answered, you can just even forget sending her anything.  This professor has not gotten back to any of my emails.  Maybe one in the begining of the semester to look like she cares.  I have been doing all of her assignments with extra effort and I know ",0
"One of the best professors Ive had at Texas State! He does everything he can to get you the best grade possible and truly cares about every one of his students. Show up to class and test review days, follow along his lectures and youll know exactly whats on the test. Dr. Olson is a must take and i would highly recommend!",1
"Simply the best professor at Pace. Has a great sense of humor, gives crystal clear notes, and is very respectful towards his students. You'll learn plenty in his class. Midterm & final both based strictly out of his notes. Don't think twice about taking a class with him. Professor Spillane rocks, period!",1
"Dr. Leathers is the best. He's hilarious, and hates the lecture format. He tries to make all his lectures fun and interesting, making his class easy to remember and a standout. His tests are not cumulative and homeworks are easy to do well on. I loved his class and would definitely recommend to all!",1
took this class online. the lab was AMAZING (I had Nora). class not so much. your grade comes from your exams- don't fail those (easier said than done). the class can be confusing during live zoom classes. this class requires a lot of commitment.,1
"She is like the vitamins that you lack. She feeds you the extra umfff you need! (Inside joke) But no seriously, she is a great professor. She is clear on everything she does and she is there for you if you need extra help. Her assignments are not difficult and she shows that she really cares. She is very enthusiastic and is a free spirit! Love her!",1
"Lectures were easy to follow, especially when you print out the online lecture slides ahead of time.  He is eager to answer the student's questions and make sure they understand the concepts of microbiology.  The lab portion was hands-on and added to my learning.  He was very helpful and made sure we were ready to perform our own lab experiments. ",1
(Online) I would recommend if you take this class you should take Prof. Fritch. Lessons are clear and she is helpful. Sometimes you may have several assignments due at once but there is plenty of time to work ahead to get them done. The are web projects that include designing your own web pages. Good Online professor.,1
"If you got through 111 than 211 shouldn't be too hard for you.  Edo is an excellent teacher and knows his stuff.  He could do a better job with clarifying questions on tests and HW, but other than that great teacher.",1
"This is the poorest excuse for a capstone class ever. What kind of prof never replies to his school email, but then emails his students 2 minutes after class starts that it's cancelled? And constantly leaves his students wondering what the plan is for the next class session by waiting for an email an hour or less before class for the details? Wow.",0
"Rarely gives her own lectures, and when she does they rarely stay on topic. She may be knowledgeable about the course material, and if you're interested in talking about creationism or dog breeding, she's full of information. But she is one of the most disorganized professors I've ever met. Class could have been so much better if she tried harder.",0
"This prof also runs the skills lab and does not do anything for the students. She spends most of the time socializing with co-workers while she ignores students in the lab, or kicks them out for a hair appt. BTW the lab hours are always scheduled during class so you can never go. Completely useless...",0
Great guy... painfully borning. Consider bringing a pillow...,0
"Prof. Abramson is long winded and boring. He didn't cover half of what the syllabus said. He asks questions and doesn't allow for different opinions. He assigns 3 easy papers and 2 ""quizzes"" which are impossible to pass but he curves grades considerably. Choose ANY other professor!",0
"EASIEST CLASS EVER! I stopped reading the textbook and maybe did an hour of work a week. Class consists of weekly responses( easy 100%), four quizzes (get online textbook to command F it), and one paper (got 100%). Literally the class is stupid easy I stopped doing work and ended with a 100% in the class by just writing fancy for weekly discussions",1
He is a very nice teacher. He respect his students  and I wouldn't doubt to take him again. He helps you a lot if you don't understand a problem he will explain it to you 100 time till you get It. ,1
Generally easy...but hard to get an A,1
"Really surprised by his high rating and quite disappointed by the fact that many won't believe my rating because it's shrouded by more positive reviews. Extremely boring speaker. Not captivating in the least bit. Like the other reviewer, i stopped attending classes as i found them useless... don't think I learned anything from this class.",1
Terrible lecture class. Seemed like she was just putting a check in the box. Rushed through power points with no interest to go slow enough for note taking.,0
"Terrible, terrible prof.  Like an old dog, put him to sleep.   Prejudice too. Fun Fact!  10 foot pole if you can. You will regret taking any material from Tom Ray, especially if you are a minority.",0
"WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PROF. Very limited and vague illustrations and explanations of the concepts. Flies through the material, reads off a powerpoint for lecture that does not include much information, and then assigns loads of questions for homework that leaves you with one big question mark. Tax is already hard and he makes it harder!",0
"While it may be listed as a 100 level class, it's taught closer to a 300 level class.  His lectures are confusing as everything is finished with a question.  His tests are tough as you only get 30 minutes which includes a 3-5 paragraph hand written essay.  DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR GPA",0
Great at giving information and an interesting class. There aren't too many assignments besides a few essays and journals. If you keep up on the reading then you are good to go!,1
"Angela was a ridiculously difficult professor. Her exams were so long and tedious that it was very unlikely you'd even finish. She once yelled at my class for doing poorly on an exam, and would explain some topics very sparsely with few examples. I highly discourage taking Calc 1 with her.",0
"Horrible. Will never take another class with her again. However, it is noticeable that she will grade easier on you if she likes you. So get on her good side, she is a very biased grader.",0
"She is an ok Prof.. Will teach you what you need to know for test, but can be unorganized and all over the place.  Asking questions usually ends up in a ten minute scolding/discussion about what she's already taught us and how we should know it.",0
"His lectures are highly organized (he numbers every theorem and remark), the clearest prof I've ever seen. Lectures are fun. Easy homework and midterm, helpful at office hours. And the homework really helps you understand the stuff. Also he does have a funny accent, but I had no problem understanding him.",1
"smart and nice as a person, but really horrible as a professor - makes all assignments long and hard for 1.6% each; hard to follow in lectures, notes non-existent; clueless and doesn't get why more than half the class is failing; belled midterm average from 45% to 55% and average would be lower still had there not been 8 ppl that dropped the course",0
"I took his class and really enjoyed it at first. I'm used to working very hard and getting good grades.When I approachedd him he didn't care wasn't helpful and didn't care.  I was in every class did all readings and spent alot of time on work, but his exam was stupid, huge worth for abscure material. Horrible Prof, very rude to students. Skip it!!",0
"He really cares about the students success. He has great stories that connects with the course work. If you need help, he is there to clear any doubts you may have on the course work. I will definitely take him again!",1
"I took her for an 8 week class, 3 hours every Monday and Wednesday and maybe that was my mistake. Because its a lot of history to cover in that short period of time. And the problem is that she does not utilize class time wisely, SHE LOVES TO TALK ABOUT HERSELF AND SHE WILL TAKE UP THE WHOLE CLASS TO GET AN ANSWER INSTEAD OF HELPING OUT.",0
Kevin Lamb is lame!,0
"Not helpful what so ever, doesn't post grades until around the last week of class. Waste of my time.",0
"Took her class online, thankfully she recorded lectures. But if you plan on taking her, you have to be GOOD with taking notes, she can go fast and tests can be tough. No textbook needed, all lecture based. Grade is based 3 tests and one paper. Very nice and approachable, but if youre not going to be paying attention in class, do not take her.",1
"Homeworks, quiz, mid-term exam, paper reading(10 papers), paper review(10), presentation(one and a half class/person), project, final exam, project presentation. She never lose a thing right? If you choose her course, good luck!",0
"Very kind professor and a very engaging class overall. It's almost all group work, so you learn to work better with others, but there is not much homework. Clearly a professor who cares about doing a good job.",1
"He definitely knows what he's talking about, but no one else knows what the hell he's talking about. Great guy and fairly easy, but it is hard to comprehend. You'll pass.",1
"Helpful and genuine guy, great for starting off CS.",1
"Everything is very confusing and hard to follow. None of the assignments are completely clear, so you are left sort of guessing at what she is looking for in a paper.",0
He thinks the material is easy and judges students for getting bad grades meanwhile he doesn't teach it correctly. He thinks that if you fail a quiz it's because you didn't try and there's a quiz every week,0
if Webber was a piece of toast. He would be the worst piece of toast the world has ever seen,0
"He moves too fast in lecture. When he ""works out"" problems in class he just puts a previously worked out problem on the projector and has a contest with himself to see how fast he can go through it. ",0
"By far the worst professor I have ever experienced. The TAs give you the most attitude as if you're disrupting their day by asking for help. Lieberman just hides in her office the entire lab. Instructions for lab are given by three separate resources with conflicting info. Lab is pure chaos, she is the only professor offered, good luck.",0
This is not an easy gen ed. Lock down browser for EVERYTHING. The tests cover a TON of material. It is a lot of information to cram.,0
"He is a really good professor, I'm glad I tock psychology with him.",1
He teaches so bad. No knowledge about the the topics. Teaches basic level examples in the class and puts high level questions in exam about which he never makes us practice or any idea.,0
"The class was very difficult, pretty unapplicable. She made it as easy as possible, but it was still difficult. It takes a lot of outside work but she's very helpful if you pursue it.",1
Seems fine until you get your grades back. No guidance on assignments and ambiguous exxpectations. Tough cookie.,0
"She's a good teacher, knows her stuff, teaches it, but the assignments given in her class aren't related to what you're doing, and are due before you learn how to do them.  She gets irritated once in a while, but I'd recommend her over alot of the professors in the department.",1
"Some do not like Fuhrmann's Style, but he definately knows his stuff.  If your Major is History and you do well in his class your going to make it.  He challenges you. He is extremely helpful and eager in the classroom.  Read the text and you will make an ""A"" im sure of that.",1
I took Dr. Nicastro for a class about Science and Religion he was a great prof. He definitely knows whats he's talking about. He has strong beliefs but is very educated in the subject matter so has a right to have them.,1
"Best professor to date. His lectures were easy to follow, the reading was a bit tedious at times but fun to read, and his assignments were easy if you put in work for it. The research paper for the class was easier than it looks and the Professor is always ready to explain anything! Hands down a fantastic teacher!",1
"Dr. Searfoss is amazing to meet with if you need help and answers questions quickly. She is patient and understanding, but to pass the class you really have to read the textbook.",1
"Hilarious to listen to. Not 100% clear, but go to class, take notes and pay attention. Tests are hard, but quiz questions are the examples from the book. Make sure you know them! Do well on the homework, quizes, and maple work and you should pass. Study hard for the tests, strict grading on them.",1
Such a nice woman and is super passionate about her work! You don't have to submit the online homework on time but make sure it is done before each test (thats when she grades the hw). Participate and come to class because she assigns group assignments that can improve your grade.,1
"Dr. Arndt is by far one of the best and smartest professors I've ever taken. He is understanding about deadlines, but doing homework and doing it on time will boost your grade in the end. He knows his history VERY well and is super helpful with the required 20 page paper for 395. He teaches you how to research and to research in DETAIL. Take him!",1
"DON'T TAKE HIM ! Harold is a really difficult prof to deal with! Also, he does not explain anything about the materials he just writes abbreviated words on the boards and that's it! His midterm was sort of okay because his midterm questions are part of ""self quizzes"" that he gives to practise. You won't learn anything from him!! Believe me!!",0
"John Izzi is one of the most candid professors you could hope to have. He never assumes the typical teacher-student relationship; he always receives students as valid equals to challenge both the text and him. Because of that, he also holds students to a higher standard; though the fact that he is a hard grader will make you better.",1
"Oh my God...how dreadful. I thought the class would be fun and would get to see some cool movies. You watch movies but they are one's you have seen 6 million times. He reads from the textbook in class. Your notes are basically the textbook verbatum. How depressing, a big let down.",0
"Stephanie was a good professor.  Sometimes lecture on Tuesday was a bit long, but she usually made sure that the Thursday activity was engaging and helped to reinforce the lecture from the last class.",1
"She knows her info, but it's a confusing topic to begin with so you just get more confused. Typewrite everything she says! Ppts are kinda disorganized. Txtbk is not mandatory but good reference. She's the only one who teaches this class (only winter qtrs). Quizzes, midterms, final are multiple choice and short answer (need to be specific)! ",0
"Attendance isn't really mandatory but he explains things really well and his lectures follow his online quizzes closely. He's pretty funny too. The exams are tough, definitely took some extra studying but the online labs are pretty easy and you get a lot of attempts. Not gonna lie, half the time I went to class was to check him out. He's hot!",1
Scott is a great teacher and is very helpful.,1
"Dr. Mack. I want to so badly say that she wasn't super bad, because she is a nice person, however, she is NOT a good teacher. She will tell you in the beginning that she loves, and I mean LOVES fractions. This is actually code for she likes taking off fractions of points on every single thing you do. 100% is unobtainable in this class. Don't take!",0
Tests are VERY hard and not enough time to take them. Good luck.,0
Brutal teacher. Seams to have an issue with talking to females and doesn't seem to know how to reply to emails.,0
"confusing questions, unclear expectations and unavailable. awful professor stay away from any classes he teaches",0
Excellent Business woman to model in the business world as well as a professor! She is straight forward with her grading and gives extra credit. Since this class is is a pretty simple subject she makes the assignments and exams simple too. She is just awesome and precious!,1
"He is a great teacher, but he isn't organized at all. It took one of the students going to the dean just to get our grades to be put online. He always talks about how our class is in the way of his other classes hes teaching. You do homework and do the lesson the week after. I have a B in the class but its hard teaching ourselves. A&P1",0
"Very difficult to communicate with.  Didn't repsond to email. Cares about students in class, but hated our daily discussion groups.",0
"You have to work for your grade. Homeworks were relatively easy, but you had to spend time with the material. Your textbook will become your best friend. READ IT. Lectures were long and boring, but he is very knowledgeable. Willing to help students during his office hours and weekly review sessions.",1
"Okay so this class is a easy A, IF you show up every day. You can only miss 3 classes the whole sem, but if you do miss all three she will drop your grade a little. Nothing crazy. She's really nice.  Just show up and be nice and you will get respect in return. When I took this class I could only draw stick figures and now I have some great art work",1
"This guy is probably so smart, its not his fault he can't communicate what hes trying to teach in a way that his students could possibly understand.",0
"Jeff is by far, the worst professor I've ever had and nearly ruined my college experience. Extremely condescending to those who aren't on his good side / do not attend his late office hours. Publicly humiliated me on several occasions in class and before exams. I've spoken about him with other professors who have heard the same about him. Avoid.",0
VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY DRY.... That being said he's super Dry... That being said he's a decent professor. I don't fall asleep in class but I fell asleep in almost every one of his lectures. I think it was fairly graded and fair tests but its not an easy subject and he's dry.,1
"Best Calc Professor ever, post lectures videos online so if you miss the class, you can watch it online, exams are easy.",1
"Wonderful, brilliant, one of the best professors at Knox. His specialty is British lit though he knowledge on all subjects is vast. A great choice for any class, project, or independent study. I highly recommend his classes.",1
"Best professor I ever had at NC State. I am a conservative student. Dr. Solari does not penalize students for their views. If you argue your case well and use evidence, you are given a fair grade. Many professors penalize conservative students or they are made to feel uncomfortable. This was never the case here. He keeps his views to himself.",1
"worst professor15 minutes 15 question, math problem included.",0
"very informed and intelligent teacher, class was difficult to take notes in",1
"i am in LOVE with randy bartlett. he is the best professor at smith, and eco 230 is the best class i've taken at smith. awesome in every sense of the word.",1
"He can be pretty monotonous at times, but the class itself isn't bad and he's a good professor. His grading isn't too hard and he makes an effort to help you in any way he can. 2 question reading quizzes in every class, but super easy if you just glance over the readings. The readings aren't bad either, just a few poems per class. I'd recommend him",1
"Nice guy. But is very unclear in class. I basically learned everything by myself with the help of course pack, textbook and a friend from EE. The material is fairly easy.",0
"Professor Hayrapetyan is Awesome! Abstract Algebra is very difficult, but he does a great job explaining the material and the problem solving mindset required. His quizzes and tests are very difficult, but he is extremely fair. He is very approachable with questions, and patient with explaining difficult concepts if you are confused.",1
Goes off topic a lot and gets real unclear during her lessons. You won't understand half of what she's talking about even when you're paying attention. Currently writing this during class and she can't even figure out the computer. If you take her class be ready for A LOT of work,0
"Dr. Bonaccorsi is knowledgeable about the Chemistry she is lecturing on, but her explanations aren't always well received by the class, in fact, I would say my recitation leader did a better job at explaining some topics. Furthermore, her accent may be an acquired taste for some, but give it a week and you will get used to it.",1
"I love British Literature, buthe made it terrible. It's an easy class, but listening to him was not worth it. He thinks he knows everything, but he's really not that smart. He just stands up there and tells you simply what the text says and is not very open to discussion or opinion. If you're looking for an easy useless class, go for it.",0
Very unprofessional in his conduct and I'm thoroughly disappointed with how he treats students and fellow faculty members. Chem isn't easy and this professor is living proof of it.,0
Best Professor for Algorithms. Solving his assignments takes time. Tests questions are quite similar to the assignment questions but a bit tricky. Lenient in marking if you are clear in your explanation.,1
"He is a really great professor, but I doubt he'll be teaching again because he told me he was retiring and moving out of state. Anyway, he made statistics very easy for me; You show up and take notes, then you get to use the notes on the quizzes. He drops the lowest two quiz grades. Homeworks are optional, but they help.",1
"His a genius. He won't give you free marks, but go to his office hours and he'll help you out like no other professor. Ah, by the way, know your linear algebra. He likes matrices. He just assumes you know what you're supposed to know. Review what you don't remember from algebra and calculus and you'll be fine in all of his classes.",1
I loved her!,1
"INTELLIGENT, WELL SPOKEN, HELPFUL, HOT HOT MAN..course material rocked my world. approached a national cinema in entirely new way, glad we had history and political articles",1
"Extremely knowledgable, but also extremely unorganized. She jumps all over her slide presentation, and speaks as she thinks, making it very difficult to take notes!",1
"easy class if you go, gives attendence crdt and xtra crdt for going. somewhat long winded but overall okay",1
"Avoid if possible, unhelpful and beyond arrogant, very vague with everything in my opinion.",0
dido,0
"I took the class, thinking if I took it in class i'd learn better.. but the class was literally all online. He doesn't check your work to see where you went wrong and help solve equations. Everything was on Aleks and it's the worst. You put a number in the wrong spot, you get the whole equation wrong. Dana's style of teaching wasn't for me at all.",0
"this man is so lazy he think he do explain the real thing he is talking about nothing always, this little man waste the school money and waste the students time and money. I hope he stay like this until he lose it. if you wanna waste your time and money take this crazy man. he think everyone think he is hard , he just stupid. he is undeveloped man.",0
"He has a hard time staying on task and I never knew what he was trying to explain. However, once you go along with the craziness, you might enjoy it. He is very easy going and easy to get along with, but understanding his ideas and assignments is another story..",0
"By far one of the best teachers I have ever had.  She is tough, but if you do what she asks you will be just fine.  Its English your going to write.  She explains everything very clearly, and if you put in the work she will 100% support you.  She is unconventional in the way she teaches,  but is the 1st teacher that I was able to actually GET IT!",1
"Ron is a good teacher and while he tries to be serious for most of the class, he often can make good jokes and make the class fun. The outside stories can be a pain, but just do your best and even completing them can help your grade a lot. He can ramble about anything for sometime, but he is great at giving you feedback on what you should do.",1
"Horrendous. Teaches 5 minutes of material in an hour and a half, touts his questionable and often actively offensive beliefs, and is unfathomably boring. Is often literally factually incorrect. Makes it incredibly difficult to see your tests and contest grades, doesn't seem to know what's on his own tests. Grades essays completely at random.",0
This prof is totally awesome! Amazing teacher!,1
This professor was AWFUL in every aspect.,0
Professor is really sweet and caring. Homework isn't mandatory or graded but I suggest trying a few problems. She is really good at teaching effectively and looked forward to going to her class (I hate math). Gives LOTS of extra credit and chances to redeem your grade if necessary. Never had a problem with her accent.,1
"Professor Simon was an average professor. Not a bad professor by any means but not extraordinary. She feeds power points to you, but also write key details that she thinks are extra important. I would definitely recommend reading the book in order to pass because she goes into deep detail for specific questions. The final was super easy and fast.",1
I had a hard time relating to Dr Cozzens.,0
"Good teacher. She expects discussion every class, so you need to read every night. You MUST buy the textbook to pass this class. She is VERY anal about reading and paying attention in class. If you don't do either of these things, expect to get chewed out.",1
"Way too involved for an intro class - if you didn't participate every day, points were deducted. He is very condescending and rude at best, but he definitely knows his stuff. He sent me to the writing center after I turned in a paper, and I told him I worked there (lol). Said the ""tone"" was inappropriate for the in essay exam but refused to explain",0
"Very difficult to understand, Gets off topic and is hard to keep up with during lecture.",0
"Plenty of people are saying this guy is great, do not be deceived. Take this from somebody whos been around the block a few times, trust me Ive dealt with some bad professors and I took this class twice with him, none have been as vindictive and cruel. The tests are incredibly difficult and tailored to ensure that you do poorly.",0
"In lectures he goes over examples many times and is very detailed, and the assignments are really easy. If you contact him during his office hours he's very helpful. Participation is mandatory, and he will randomly call on students. But overall, this class is an easy A and if you're interested in music theory he teaches it very well!",1
Always there to help! Wants you to succeed in his class. One of my favorite teachers. You can tell he has a true passion for teaching!,1
"Brent is a really cool and nice guy. He's always willing to talk outside of class and is really understanding. The tests are pretty easy, basically straight from the notes. There is a paper and a presentation that you have to do but that's about it besides the occasional test or quiz. Pay attention to the lectures and you'll be fine.",1
Pretty average,1
I took a course that was taught by professor Sinha and two other professors and her part of the course was the most confusing and least informative. I can see her efforts but I honestly did not think it worked out in the end and a lot of people I know struggled through the course because of her.,0
"For the love of God please don't even consider taking this class with Crissinger. This might possibly be the worst professor I have ever experienced. There is no way to bring your grade up if you don't do well in the exams. Please from student to another student reading this, don't ever let this man teach you.",0
"Dr. Haghshenas is a phenomenal professor, very passionate, and invested in his work. This was the second class I took with him and I wasn't disappointed. He will change your perspective about society and how you see yourself. His tests are based on the articles, so PLEASE read them. The TA was lenient and helpful with the assignments. Great class!",1
"Professor Haas is very humorous and makes his lectures fun to listen to. However, I think he can put more effort into preparing for this course, as there were many times when he didn't know how to answer students' questions well. He definitely makes E&M more endurable though, and you can tell that he cares about the success of the students.",1
"Definitely one of my favorite professors here at NDSU, he has good lectures and takes the class relatively slow. I would say that he does use a lot of masculine models and examples, and he calls on people a lot. Otherwise make sure you take good notes and you will pass the class.",1
"Stay away from any of her classes as much as you can! I used to wish that I could get hit by a car before going to her class. I cannot urge you enough to stay away from this professor. I may have gotten a decent grade but I had to fight tooth and nail for that. Please, stay away.",0
"hes was one of those professors who knows his stuff but isnt condesending about it. Hes funny and relatable, doesnt give out crap tons of homework, and really the only thing you have to show up for is the labs because he lectures out of the book (not in the direct sense). Probably opened the book 10 times this semester and Im passing the course.",1
"I do have to say, I wish he gave us more assignments for grades. Our only grade was the final. And if you dont do well, you fail. For the amount of notes we took we shouldve had more assignments for grading. Great teacher though and will help if you ask. Take notes on everything he says!!!",1
"Dr. Ptak is an awesome but hard lecturer, That being said as long as you do well and ask for help you will do fine.",1
Horrible experience with this class. Notes made little to no sense. The attempt at study guide for the test just made everything more confusing. If you are truly dedicated to this study&are willing to put in the extra effort of making everything make sense then go for it. If you are just kinda interested&have less self-discipline then steer clear.,0
"It seemed his directions changed daily, got an A though",0
I took her class over interterm and she is the best Spanish teacher yet. Even though the class is very fast paced she does and great job and the tests and quizzes are very easy. She is also the sweetest and is willing to help with anything! Not to mention she sometimes bring food/candies to class!,1
"Worst professor I've had here. Not only rude, but also unclear and disinterested. Terrible exams, terrible labs. Wish I had not taken his class. Sucks to know that I put in SO much time and effort all to be graded stupidly.",0
"Personally I didn't like the format of his quizzes but I still learned a lot from his lectures. His presentations were cool and the videos that were shown are neat. He's too nice about people skipping quizzes... he lets you take them at a later date, which isn't fair to everyone. Overall, he's a good history professor.",1
Really kind! Respects and understand her students. Really wants to help and make students succeed. Also give reminders if there's an upcoming exam or something. Best teacher.,1
Do NOT take her class. Save yourself the extra ridiculous amount of work for an actual higher level class. If you don'd do the reading you'll be in trouble. She's very unorganized and unclear with her instructions and gave multiple papers and projects the last few weeks of the semester.,0
"yes, he gives of his time generously. but his time isn't worth anything so who cares? He is a complete joke. his ""experience"" consists of his own pathetic trading. his class is like play-time in middle school. actually, given that he stays popular by ONLY giving takehome exams, i bet a middle-schooler could pass the same was many pass: cheating!",0
"Somehow got placed in this class and I completely regret it. He is aloof most of the time, can't stick to one topic, and somehow every discussion we have turns political. His work does seems straightforward, but they do not have a significant affect on your grade.",0
"I feel bad for him. He's an extremely nice guy, but actually trying to get people interesting in a really dull subject makes him look worse than he is. Aside from being a little monotone, I think he's really smart and his tests are more than fair. Liked this a lot more than 291.",1
"Tests are based more on the plot of the stories than the philosophic aspect. The tests are pretty hard because they were unpredictable. Out of three exams, he only curved one. We had about 10 homework essays (2 pages) on upcoming sections of the book, but other than that the tests were the only things he graded. he's a very nice guy though.",0
"NB Lit is offered as a way to fill out your required hours in Canadian/American lit for a majors. I took it because American wasnt available and regret it. He is unwilling to discuss things with you over email, is unwilling to help you outside of class, and is an extremely hard marker when it comes to exams and major projects. 2/10 dont recommend",0
This guy is a terrible teacher. Makes math seem boring. Do not take him. Do NOT.,0
"Worst prof I have had hands down. He is arrogant and rude. After doing a biological drawing assignment and getting an A, he remarked the worst one in our section and the best one, giving them lower marks. He then rescaled everyone's mark accordingly and I ended up with a B+. He insists on the average being <60 even if students are capable of more",0
Absolutely LOVE this guy! He is so smiley and friendly if you ever want to have someone make your day brighter you should go talk to him. He loves what he teaches and he is just so sweet! TAKE HIS CLASS!,1
Dr. Lageson is the best professor on campus.  Easily one of the most knowledgeable and experienced science teachers.  He is an inspiration to me. ,1
He really knows his stuff. His lectures are interactive and clear to follow. He is also dead set on learning everyone's name.,1
"Professor Campagnari is brilliant but relaxed in his teaching and very approachable. I went to around 75% of his lectures, read the book, and did the hw and there were no surprises on his exams or final. He's also really reasonable with grading and curves. Wish I had him for 6B.",1
"This class was completely disorganized and unclear. She would say to do an assignment one way, then grade a  totally different way. However, she tries to be available to her students AFTER class, never during. The class is 3 hours long, so i suggest you try to find another teacher, it's hard to sit through.",0
Worst professor and class Ive ever had. Avoid this man,0
"worst prof ever, doesn't want to help students, makes everything so difficult for students, stay away",0
He's the bomb. He tries to make you figure out the answer without just telling you. However is always willing to help. Makes sure everyone is on the same pace but make sure to ask questions.,1
"All of these reviews saying he is great are beyond incorrect. He grades things way too harshly, and is super objective when grading. The way he grades things LITERALLY does not make sense. Something could be grammatically correct, and he would count it wrong and not give feedback. He is not helpful, he is very condescending, and is so annoying.",0
"Horrible Psych experience. As a PSY major, I wanted to learn from interesting reads + classmates. Instead it's ALL text book and extremely difficult gradng. Tests are 100 M.C ?'s very hard stuff. WOULD NOT REC. Not a good Psych professor at all.",0
Show up and Try. He isnt a difficult professor.,1
I was very interested in this course but I did not like her style or the lack of clarity from the teacher. I would not take a course with her again,0
He was very nice but a TOUGH GRADER and TERRIBLE PROFESSOR! Do not recommend his course.,0
1. very condescending + rude 2. doesn't believe in learning diabilities; generally ableist 3. instructions are not clear  4. claimed people on here just hated her b/c they didnt want to do work... i never payed attention or studied more than 10 minutes and i (currently) have a 95% in the class.. 5. don't take this class unless you have to,0
he will ruin your grade,0
Professor Walsh doesn't take attendance but your grade will surely show it. If you miss an online test or contemporary application your grade takes a big hit make sure you pay attention to those.   Don't bother with his office hours or emailing him; his syllabus makes it clear that he pretty much doesn't like human contact.,1
"This has been one of the hardest gen-ed classes I've taken at JMU. With everything being online, she has not been providing an adequate work schedule to understand what is going on in class. She does not respond to emails in a timely manner and does not put grades in the gradebook when expected. Definitely a high maintenance class!",0
"I do not recommend taking a class with Dr. Sun. More than half of my class withdrew because it was so difficult. I had taken a calculus class before this one and that's the only reason I got a good grade. My test grades plummeted as soon as we got into material I hadn't done before. He's very confusing, even to someone who knew the material before.",0
"I was not impressed at all. He seemed really arrogant and was a very tough grader on papers. I didn't feel like I learned much at all.  If you don't agree with him, he will not like you. Don't take this class if at all possible.",0
"The class is dumb, in my opinion. Very easy, very commonsense material. Don't usually look forward to it. Hassey is a cool guy though and an easy grader. He doesn't care about deadlines and doesn't like exams. You need an online version of the textboox for mcgraw hill access but you rarely if ever need to read anything.",1
Avoid prof Maddox if you can. His reviews on here are accurate. He has very unclear grading criteria and will tank your grade if he doesn't like you. He also takes attendance every class and you only get like two skips. His lectures don't make any sense and he is super boring.,0
"Dr Cohen is a great teacher and cares about her students. That being said, you really do have to work for your grade in her class. Her tests are not multiple choice and she really expects you to know and understand the information. Her tests consisted of material from class lectures and scientific papers covered in class. Be prepared to study.",1
"great teacher, very nice, very funny, makes class interesting- just don't be late!",1
"Dr. Lapp is a really nice guy and wants you to do well if you try, but to get a good grade you have to work your butt off to get it, by doing all the homework and going to his office hours. You MUST buy the TI Nspire CX CAS which is $140 on Amazon. This Class has a lot of physics concepts built in, as well. GO TO HIS OFFICE HOURS, IT'LL SAVE YOU!",1
Honestly this professor seems very good at first. I grew to find that your success is not her top priority.  She is very very strict with criteria and is unclear with instructions. She will kick you out of lab for very minimal things like forgetting to retype a revised procedure. Personally I would avoid this professor unless you are perfect.,0
Mr. Humphrey's class is very straightforward and the assignments are easy to follow. I personally liked this class because he was able to relate to his students and hardly gives any work. The weekly discussions are solely based on personal experiences. There are no quizzes or tests except the occasional essays (hardly any).,1
"As already stated, class is very hard for all backgrounds excluding advanced mathematics. The guy is not helpful and flies over the material. Don't get behind, study hard and work on all home-works. This guy has to be a PhD professor, not MBA's. I hated Calculus and Statistics before, I hate it even more after this class. That alone says enough.",0
Great course - he makes it all understandable! but can't catch silly putty,1
Great Professor! A needed dose of creativity amongst otherwise dry course schedule!,1
Andre was a very thorough professor. He clearly explained the data and which steps to take for SPSS. Also held office hours to go over or explain sections of the paper one might not understand. The first assignment was extremely easy. You just need to make sure you go to class to follow the instructions precisely. Or you won't do well on it.,0
"He makes extremely inappropriate jokes. Lecture is fine, but avoid him in lab. He yells for trivial things.",0
"Devoted to helping her students succeed. She would stay after lecture and help students identify and look at fungal structures during lab. Anne is always willing to stop in lecture and answer questions as long as needed, never worrying about falling behind on the material. It is clear that she wants her students to truly understand the information.",1
This class is terrible ! I never had a more rude professor. he's doesn't explain anything he does on the board and when asked he just repeats himself. He gives 2 midterms can use cheat sheets for both and the final.  I failed one of the midterms and he told me to not waste his time and drop the course. Do not understand anything he talks about.,0
"This class is not as bad as many people describe it as . Yes you will have to put in time and effort but hello it's college. Also, he requires a lot of participation but the work is not that bad . It don't take a genius to figure it out . The hardest part is figuring out what to do the first week, but after that it's the same thing every week.",1
"She may be one of the most boring humans on this planet, and her lectures reflect this. But I respected her as a prof because she was straightforward, fair, and it was evident that she was passionate about crm. I went to 2 or 3 lectures and ended with an A- because her ppt are all you really need. Very fair tests but not easy. ",0
"Professor Howson, is such an amazing professor. She is well prepared to answer any questions you ask. Connects with students , really accurate with her grading . And accessible to help at any time . Lovely conversation with students, so active and keeps a safe and positive environment. I recommend taking this class.",1
horrible horrible,0
Class was out of 1000 points. She gives a lot of extra credit points on exams and quiz's to help boost your grade. She is very nice and willing to help. Some basic physiology concept will get you through the class. Just study off lecture power points and you'll be fine. got an A and did minimal studying. Make sure you study the models though.,1
He wasnt a great teacher of the material. You will teach yourself a good portion with his provided material.,0
"Nice woman, hard marker.",0
"Lectures are very clear and organized, take notes but he posts notes online after each chapter. Tests are multiple choice and problems that need to be worked out. They are tough, but if you do the problems he suggests, the old exams, and homework...you'll be fine. Also, he has an online study session right before the test - helpful!",1
"This is a genuine review as I noticed some are filled with anger. At first the class was seemingly easy and manageable, I had no problems. But once the midterm hit us, I pretty much gave up, the average was well below 50. I hope to see a change or perhaps no exams in this course would be much better!",0
"Horrible professor with such a heavy accent. Had no idea what he was talking about, and to top it off his handwriting was pure garbage. Statistics shouldn't be hard but professor sidhom made it extremely difficult. Passed with a B but it was a real struggle, I know more than half got below C.",0
"Adams is a nice woman I suppose, however her lectures are very dry and lack relevance most of the time. She brings in food & wine for you to taste! The class consists of 2 presentations, and an essay. For each she is very particular with what she wants, but it is exceptionally easy to do well. Overall, it wasnt as easy as I expected but still easy",1
"Throughout the year she never input any grades and when reaching out, she would not respond to emails. Eventually towards the end of the year, she announced that her computer was the issue and that it somehow inhibited her ability to release grades. There's a quiz every class but the catch is she only collects 6 so if you miss class u may be SOL",0
"great prof., hard but you will make leaps in bounds in your writing. has goats and chickens - that's cool",1
"Prof Sandweiss' class was probably the hardest I've taken so far... He grades really heavily and does not allow for expression of your own political views. If you do not answer a question with his political view and do not write a paper his way, then you will not get a good grade in this class.",0
"An absolutely terrible, terrible professor. The subject of his course was secondary; glorifying his own ideology at the expense of intellectual honesty was his only objective. I wanted to learn about White Racism, and was instead subjected to relentless anecdotes about the professor's own victimization and eventual apotheosis over the rest of human",0
"Easy course due to COVID, however: (1) Unclear grading criteria that is *inconsistently* applied. It is as effective in measuring student understanding as throwing exams downstairs and observing which ones land farther. (2) It is a lottery to see who happens to have written what he subjectively deems important (and his inexperience is evident)",0
"If you are not electrical engineering, do not take him. He is a research professor, not a teaching professor. I took every AP Physics in high school, did the homework, studied for hours for the test an failed. He gave a 3 question test that was 9 parts total. The class average was a 44% and he does not curve. He does not care about your grade.",0
"I have taken a philosophy class before and I absolutely failed. Attended 99% of the classes and even got an 80 on our first quiz. HE ABSOLUTELY FAILED ME ON EVERYTHING ELSE. I actually didn't know it was possible to get a grade in THE TEENS. His lectures are awful, and his notes are disorganized and almost in another language. SAVE YOURSELF THE F!",0
"Probably knows what he is talking about, but you'll rarely get taught that. He mostly half-asses his classes so don't expect anything inspired.",0
worst professor. don't take him. not easy and boring.,0
"Class isn't hard, just do the study guides and study the day prior to the midterm or final. OPTIONAL Assignments (during Winter 2013) are not difficult, mainly just time consuming. Seems like a nice guy. Wasn't interested in subject before taking class and very rarely showed up to class and got an A.",1
"Ok so here's the thing about Arevalo:She can't speak English well but the class is so easy you can teach yourself. Show up for class because she knows when you're not there. She is a relatively nice person, and funny on some occasions. She will NOT repeat herself so you're better off getting the information from someone else. Overall she's not bad",0
"He is a complete waste of space what you learn in class does not pertain to the tests, which are based completely off the book. He spends most of his time rambling about nothing and I would have been better off taking a REAL programming class.",0
"he is a great prof, and so forth. he is not that difficult, and so forth. he is knowledgeable and has a lot of good information and so forth. he can be a little difficult to understand, so sit near the front and there will be no problems, and so forth. he definetly has a fascination with ""so forth""",1
He is actually the worst professor I've ever had. He doesn't give any extra help. On tests he takes off 20 points if you get part of a question wrong even if the answer is right. He claims he gives partial credit and to talk to him after class but when he talks to you after class yells at you and says that's the way he grades. Terrible Professor. ,0
"Terrible. Speaks in a monotone voice that nearly puts me to sleep every lecture. Reads directly off the slides with no clarification. Can't even get his own examples working half the time. Literally Googled how to use a function during a lecture, saying ""I don't bother memorizing all of this."" Avoid, or be prepared to teach yourself from the book.",0
WORST PROFESSOR and very arrogant... No student should have to deal with a professor like this! ,0
Do not take this if you do not have to . This class was awful. I put in 8+ hours a week and was barely making C's on test. He doesn't care whether you actually learn it or not.,0
"Hard to hear, but remarkably knowledgeable. The class is easy if you attend regularly and take notes--if you aren't willing to do that, maybe you shouldn't be in college.",1
"Changed an open book exam to closed book less than 48 hours before, is hard to follow during class, can be very unclear during lectures. Moves at an unreasonable pace and does not post lecture notes until after the case/unit is over, which is unhelpful for trying to study or if you have to miss class.",0
Awesome teacher!! Cares about the students(which is rare nowadays). Goes out of her way and expects nothing more than what she puts into it. Take this class if you have the chance.,1
"Easy A. 3 take home essay-tests, one paper. The prof. is a bit nosy though. Lots of students told their personal business and she probed a lot. But easy class. She's also really funny",1
"Worst prof I ever had. All he did was talk about himself and how he went to NYU - never explained anything, even when directly asked. Was confusing and infuriating, only talked about himself. I think he thinks of himself as better than other people for his educational background, but doesn't have the chops to show for it. Would never take again.",0
I am now in my 3rd or 4th week of this course and it is by far my least interesting and least engaging class. It is close to impossible to understand what he is talking about due to his accent and general lack of ability whenit comes to explaining concepts. Seems like a smart guy but not an effective teacher by any means.,0
"Worst professor I have had so far at GVSU. This class was all online due to covid. She never answers emails, and when she does, she replies with really snappy responses such as one word answers. She did not answer my emails for a month and a half. Honestly avoid her.",0
loved the class. Hated the tests. don't forget to read journal art.,1
Not textbook needed because he teaches from powerpoint slides. :(,1
The class isn't hard but I did not like the online version.  Very interested in how students are doing after class is over.  Great professor.,1
This course is a cakewalk compared to EE1713. Read the book and know the basic principles and you'll do fine. Be prepared for boring lectures and terribly organized labs though.,1
he's the best prof ever,1
"He is very knowledgeable on the Renaissance period but knows very little on any other part of history. Furthermore, he stutters while teaching which makes it difficult to take notes.",0
"Honestly, everyone should take this class. There's a lot of reading (two textbooks and four different autobiographies that have quizzes), but overall it wasn't too much work and it's one of the most interesting classes I've taken on campus. Dr. Rowley is awesome and had really interesting, eye-opening discussions and activities during each class.",1
"Professor Stevens is the best professor for 191, but he might not be the easiest A. He is an amazing teacher, he tells you exactly what to read and concepts to attempt before class. You have to be a consistent student, but he makes it easier by adding extensions to tests and drops your lowest 5 quizzes. He genuinely wants you to learn.",1
"The best professor for BUS 160! She's funny, enthusiastic & makes the class interesting. There is homework for almost every chapter but she has great examples and resources to help you & always responds to emails quickly with good feedback! Tests are pretty straightforward so if you study you'll do fine! Personal finance focus so useful material.",1
This is not a freshman level class. IF YOU CAN TAKE ANOTHER CLASS TAKE IT!! Incredibly hard only lectures and gives reading. No review for test other than names for identification. Test is all short answer and 1 essay and you're expected to know things on the test that she may not cover. Class is incredibly hard.,0
"Just lectures and labs passed out. Basically you are on your own. Sink or swim. If your lucky, your classmates will all come together, like our class did and teach each other. Don't even think about asking questions, you will be greeted with attitude and condescending non-answers. Worst. Class. Ever.",0
She was always giving us homework at 12 at night and expected us to complete it by the morning 8 30 class. Dont take her class at NJIT. Not worth the time.,0
"I took Professor McFaul for English 1C for spring 2020, and this was one of my favorite classes that I have taken by far. We first started as in class lectures, but due to COVID19, we switched to online classes. I got worried about the transition to online class, but Professor McFaul made it so understandable for us. He is the best English teacher.",1
Best computer science teacher I've had!,1
Walters is the man! He is so knowledgeable about economics. He has one test a few quizzes and a final. One of the best professors I've had at Loyola!,1
"Sit close to the front, interact with him throughout the lectures, and for goodness sake, ask him questions. Ask him to go over examples if the first example confused you. He is well-spoken and has clear examples, just not many of them. But if you ask for more, he is always happy to provide them.",1
"Definitely one of my favourite Professors. Fair marker, and also provides lots of instruction and example essays he wrote himself. Very approachable and helpful during office hours. To do well in his class, these are the rules to live by: CAREFULLY read all of the instructions and the example essays! Can't wait to take another class with him!",1
Makes writing papers almost fun,1
One of the BEST professor I ever took in my entire graduate study. Extremely helpful when you have questions; if email him in the evening and will very likely to get back to you on the very same day. He grades assignment personally and provide you feedback on it via email. Very very very prompt professor. Recommended Highly !!! Grade for him? A,1
"Prof. Machacek is very enthusiastic about his class. He is very funny and tries his best to make everything as tolerable as it could be. Get ready for a tough grader. However, if you like a challenge and like funny people, take this class.",1
Easily the worst professor I have EVER had here in my time at Temple. Completely arrogant in many regards. Sees the world in his perspective and if you do not agree with him your wrong.  Worst books I have ever had to read for a class. DO NOT TAKE!!!!!,0
"Fairly easy for a class in Assembly. HW's are a breeze, tests a bit harder. Gives a lot of handouts making lectures almost unnecessary. Friendly personality, but makes an annoyingly large amount of mistakes both at the board and in the homeworks. Expect a few minutes of class devoted to her trying to fix problems from her own lecture notes.",1
Great instructor. He speaks to students in a down to earth manner.,1
"This is a computer class, but you have to write 10-20 page papers and use a pencil on paper tests. The homework is extremely tedious and long, and is not weighed fairly at all. For example: I spend about 10 hours on a lab (which consumed my whole day), and I only got 5 points for it. The class has 500 total points. Lectures are very boring too.",0
"CPSC1620 can be a very difficult class but Chali is the man for the job. Everything you need to know for the weekly assignments is taught in class, so SHOW UP and PAY ATTENTION! He writes the whole time so make sure to take accurate notes. I found him to be very funny and he wants his students to do well, but marks hard.",1
"good teacher, course is very interesting",1
"this guy is a freaking moron, and it is a shame that you must take classes with him...he doesn't teach **** and expects you to know everything..should be fired",0
"She does have an accent but you get used to it pretty quickly and the pre-written notes are hard to read at first but once you get used to them they're easy to read. And she posts everything on moodle, she also puts practice exams very similar to actual exams overall not a bad professor I recommend her in comparison to most of other math professors",1
"Brian Watson is not for everyone. He is tough but fair. He takes his position in the college very seriously. He does not let students who don't know their stuff pass. He cares very deeply about supply chain and as long as you do the work, understand the concepts behind the terms, you'll be fine. Learn his specific wording to get the best marks.",1
Lots of busy work but isn't that hard. Lots of little assignments that if you complete you'll get full credit. LEARNED A LOT!! Definitely recommend this class even if you aren't a business major.,1
"He is fantastic! He cares about what he does, and he really works to make sure everyone is understanding the material. If you go to his office he will help you and make sure you completely understand the material. He also gives good devotions in the morning classes. Textbook is only for homework and while attendance is mandatory, he wont notice",1
I think he is one of the BEST professers around!,1
"She really cares that people actually learn, and she is understanding when it comes to not attending class, even on test days.",1
"SOC100 is decent with Prof. Brym. He responded to issues promptly and his announcements on Quercus were detailed. Little bits of news and music in the lectures made the course more interesting. Tests are straight forward and fair. However, the course readings are heavy and the final contained a lot of rote memorizations. CONSISTENT EFFORT REQUIRED.",1
"David is incredibley intelligent however not a good prof. Rambles, spends the first hour of lecture playing music videos, repetitive and monotone. The content has the potential to be so much more interesting. This course has really put me off from indigenous studies. However it's an easy A, attendance is not mandatory and marking is very lax.",0
"Professor O'Hanlon was tough and strict with grammar rules but that's how you learn! It definitely helped my writing and enhanced my communication skills. All projects except 2 are group projects (you can pick your teammates). Take home midterm (2 short essays) and final (business plan, don't wait to do it!) She works with you to get a better grade",1
"Dr. Bosak is an amazing professor! Her lectures might be a little all over the place but that is because she includes stories of her own experiences which helps you understand the situation more than class notes! I would definitely recommend taking a course with her, her stories are amazing and she's more than willing to help her students. ",1
"Took his online English comp class this summer which was super chill, one paper a week based on reading assignments for that week. He gave a lot of feedback on my papers to help improve my grade. Hes a really tough grader but its worth it! Best of all theres no boring busy work like in other online classes.",1
"If you want to learn nothing, be driven insane and eventually fail, take this course! Total nightmare.",0
Worst class I've ever taken. She's not engaging at all so the class is boring. Just reads from powerpoints. The dates on moodle aren't updated for when they're due so it's confusing. Tons of homework and group projects. Outdated videos and articles. Hardest tests I've ever taken. Avoid the class at all cost.,0
"You skip class, you won't pass. You go to class, you probably still won't pass. Lecture notes are all written by hand, so there is no power points. The lectures don't really relate to the assignment/exams. The dates/timeline is largely unimportant, like actually, don't study the dates. If you have to take this class I'm sorry, so very sorry. GL",0
"Professor Roy may be an intelligent man, but he cannot teach clearly whatsoever. First, his accent and handwriting arent understandable. Second, he gets angry at students when asking questions. Third, he makes you get HIS own textbook( other reseources dont help). Homeworks are nearly impossible without the help from TA's. Always ""agree"" with him.",0
"This class was super fascinating and Dr. Fox is very knowledgable and makes the class very interesting. He talks without bias and explains abstract concepts simply. That being said, this class is also very difficult. The exams are very difficult worth so much of your grade and he assigns so many readings. You need to put in the work to get an A.",1
Professor Gray loves what she does but in my opinion she is not the best professor even though a lot of people love her.  She just lectures and has power points that have endless slides.  She often rambles and gets off topic and her tests are extremely hard.  The tests never have anything she taught in class.  Try to avoid her for this class.,0
"Homeworks and lecture are COMPLETELY worthless. Luckily, all you need to do is go to the review sessions before the test and memorize how he works out the problems, because all he does on the test is change the numbers. There are no surprises. Easy A but I did not really learn much.",0
"Professor Moore is a nice women, and willing to help but is a bad professor. If you take her expect to teach yourself. The test are on paper even though it's a computer programming class? Her test also have a lot of writing . The bulk of your grade will come from assignments, so as long as you do good on those you'll pass.",0
"JMS 200 was a total joke. It was also extremely boring. Wulf chooses 5-10 headlines that have something to do with contemporary media and reads them at the speed of light while you take notes. 2 Tests on those articles that are open note and true/false. There are also 2 textbook exams that you're supposed to read for but are also open note, T/F",1
"Ian is a really nice guy. But he only touches the surface of each concept. When you ask for more details, he doesn't know them. That's good for those who just want to pass the course, since he teaches easy and has great lectures. He tries to avoid tougher questions and does not follow up, but expects you to read up on it yourself.",0
If the mark of a great professor is how much work they give you then Packy is one of the best professors. If it is how much you actually learn then he is the worst professor and shouldn't even be employed. Seven 200+ page word documents for homework. Have fun trying to decipher his instructions since he is illiterate. How does he still have a job?,0
"Really boring and droning and looks not like what you think for a com prof. For sure never worked in real office, needs new clothe, but you'll get a pretty good mark.",0
You have to take good notes...the things she says aren't always consistent with the book and her multiple choice questions are sometimes unclear.,0
"one of the worst teachers ever, doesnt belong at Houghton.",0
"Excellent professor for a fascinating course. I greatly enjoyed ""flipped classroom"" format. Exams and assignments very reasonable. Will make time to meet with students.",1
She is not as hard as people make her seem. Yes there are quizzes after every class but if you pay attention to the questions she asks on the quizzes then you get an idea of what is going to be on the exam. Her test are not super easy but come on it's college! All you have to do is keep up with the readings !!! Once you do you'll be fine.,1
"Chuck is a good teacher when it comes to teaching the subject matter. When it comes to answering his questions, he's the worst. A student once asked a very dumb question as they weren't understanding the information, he just stood there with a dull face at them, then he answers it acting very annoyed. You'll be too afraid to ever ask again...",0
DO NOT TAKE. The PowerPoints she uses arent hers. Doesnt give you time to write down what is on the slide. Tells you you wont havent to memorize something for the test but then it will appear on the test. Has a thick accent so hard to understand if she does try to explain something,0
He is alright. Clickers are helpful but goes too fast,0
Don't even bother with this professor... if you struggle with math don't take her.,0
she is such a ****-- SUCH a ****.  i would not take another class with her if someone paid me,0
Listens to students comments and is quickly improving after a bad start.,1
Honestly the only problem I had with the class was there was too much information and reading for an online summer A course but he is thorough and the content is imteresting. You will need to follow directions and read ahead if possible.,1
"He's honestly the worst professor at SDSU and teaches such an important subject too, please take the class at CC if you want to learn.",0
"Boring lectures but easy assignments, quizzes, exams (everything from sample questions); helpful during office hours; recommendable",1
If I could give her a 0 I would. She told me and another student that we can only ask a total of 3 questions per class period and if I asked more she would take away points from me. After the 3 hour classi would go to the Math center for another hour or so just to get it. She would take points off on things I had even asked her help on. THE WORST!!,0
"Her class is pretty hard especially the exams. There are 3 big exams during the semester, no final. She did change the grading scale of the 2nd one because everyone sucked at it. If you have to take her class without choice like I did, be fully prepared with the exams and spend as much time as you can to go over the lecture notes and exercises.",1
Such a caring prof! She is very approachable and willing to help. Lectures were clear with lots of practical examples. She speaks on the softer side so I recommend sitting near the front. Take her recommendation and practice outside of class to better understand the content. She provides A TON of extra practice material and a textbook isn't needed,1
"He is a good human being, but his tests are tough. Not too much homework, but a lot of reading. Sometimes when M.R jones talks, he uses a lot of pronouns, so you miss what he is talking about. Also, half of the class is about brain anatomy which is in my opinion, not a part of psychology.",0
He as well as his class were duller than dull.  Why did I take this class?,0
"Took Professor Whisnant for my 8-week Humanities course and despite moving at a fast pace, the workload was very simple. Professor Whisnant is very understanding and offers excellent feedback on any submission. In addition, he does require participation, which is a good thing, and his final assignment was very ingenious. I highly recommend him.",1
"So starting off, this professor is a very sweet guy, but his accent and the way he goes about teaching is definitely difficult. the Wiley math homework consisted of things that we never went over, and I just had trouble overall in the class, when I never had problems in calc before.",0
"Hardest class I've ever taken in college, I'm glad someone else is teaching it next semester.",0
"TERRIBLE!! Makes a ton of mistakes. Always looks at her notes. Can't answer a question not in her notes. Didn't finish much of the laplace section. All homework online (waste of time and money). If you can take someone else, you might actually learn something. If you take her, you'll pass, but not learn anything",0
"Morris has been my favorite CS professor at ODU. Gives all the information needed at lectures, dont miss them. He makes the classes fun with jokes as well as working through problems very simply and giving a real understanding of topics. My only concern is a very flexible schedule, assignments are given at random but distant due dates make it easy",1
I had Nadine as a TA in my stats class and for my Research Methods class. She not only knows the material very well but she conveys it well and makes it easy to understand. She's works with you and practically does the work for you.,1
"Bob is a very very smart guy, but it's unfortunate that he also expects his students to be on the same wavelength. He is caring, but he can also come off as a little passive-aggressive. His tests are super difficult and make up a large portion of your grade, but it is super useful to look over his previous tests/quizzes. Good luck regardless",0
"The lectures are very interesting, he gives motivation and ways of application to almost all concepts learned BUT the workload is ridiculous. He's probably fine if you don't have other difficult courses to worry about and want to eat, sleep and sh*t CMPT295, otherwise I'd just avoid him. 2% assignments normally take 8hrs to do, final exam 200 marks",1
Dr. Pigg's assignments are v involved with the books assigned but at the most skimming the readings & finding a few key points to talk about in class seemed to be good enough. On his syllabus his attendance policy was strict but I skipped fairly often due to work/family emergencies (and even skipped a key assignment - opps!) and still got an A.,1
"Her teaching style did not match my learning style and when I started working, I realized that I had a lot of holes in education. She would have is read articles with a class discussion that didn't always correlate with each other. Those discussions and reading weren't really reflected on the essay test questions.",0
This class is impossible. The papers are are really hard.,0
"Extremely dedicated to her students. She has review sessions, records lectures, and even came in for extra office hours the Sat. before finals! Doesn't use power point much, and lecture can be a bit hard to follow, but the book was helpful when I didn't understand the material in lecture. Exams included essay questions, so be prepared to study!",1
Professor McBane is a good guy and he means well but he is just too smart and tends to teach material that is unrelated to the course and just flat out difficult to understand,0
"The most condescending person you'll ever meet. So rude, so opinionated and he likes to hear himself talk. The tests aren't as easy as people say anymore because he asks such detailed questions sometimes. DONT take any of his classes if you can there are SO many better options out there. He is a horrible professor. He needs a new teaching method",0
This prof clearly did not understand the course material.,0
"Great guy, he talks kind of fast but the lectures are recorded, entire grade is determined by 3 tests",1
"Completely over-rated. I was told he was hilarious, smart, fun, blah blah blah but he ended up being senile to the max! expects you to know the material word for word from the text and gets mad for no reason half the time. the class is pretty boring and his quizzes are tricky. would take him again if i had no other choice.",0
"Taking a class with Kennison is like watching a one man show where he tries to intellectually challenge himself, and you die of boredom.  He is the most arbitrary grader I have ever seen using his own made up criteria. Now I know that taking a teacher who calls himself arrogant was a mistake because that is exactly what you're going to get. Easy A",0
very difficult. She can be rude when you ask a question in class. very tough grader! To pass this class you will need a tutor and to make a lot of time to study for what can be a simple math class with another instructor.,0
"The class itself was not hard. The material was pretty straight forward, especially if you read. Lab, however, was not structured well at all, it took months for assignments to be graded, and the professor flew through procedure and was concerned more about keeping up his aforementioned tough persona than actually teaching.",0
"Borich is a great teacher - very smart, but doesn't allow for too much discussion in most classes. A lot of emphasis on the readings, but if you can get your head around what he's saying the course is simple.",1
Professor Bommer is unprofessional. Some of his questions on his exams do not even make sense. I remember asked him a question and he did not even know the answer. He wrote the book that is used in class and there are so many mistakes in book. Mostly everyone in my class would get low grades on his exams. Do not take his class.,0
"Alex is probably my favorite professor here at Pitt. If you see that her rating is a 4.9 and assume it is an easy class, you're so wrong. It was probably one of the hardest classes I have taken so far (I took up to Calculus in high school). Be prepared to do a lot of work. She is super nice and absolutely loves cats and is a great teacher",1
"Notes/lectures on the website. HW and projects get progressively harder. HW eventually strays away from the notes, so it gets frustrating to find answers. Can be rude on random days. Exams are multiple choice. Just study off the past exams he gives. Curve is dependent on how smart the top 1/3 are as 1/3 gets A. No guidance on Proj after part 1.",0
Hopefully you get lucky and get a Good TA - otherwise you won't pass.,0
"Second time I've had this professor, other time was for cs136. He is great and I always learn the most from his lectures. His assignments are so structured and follow exactly from the lectures. If you have the chance take this guy.",1
Flora is the sweetest lady. I haven't taken french before but I found it to be pretty easy with her. She's a native speaker so she also fills you in on proper french culture which is really cool and her quizzes are very straight forward. You should participate in class; it'll really help you on the exams and with pronunciation.,1
"Class should be called a C++ class. The other topics were barely covered, $130 for a solidworks book that was used for 2.5 wks, use the library copy.  She loaded the last four classes with a test, final, C++ project, & lab homework. An RPI Ph.D. in compSci doesn't mean you should focus a large portion of the class on C++ for an intro to ENGR tools!",0
"He rambles- true BUT this is an easy class. If you have a decent level of English this class could be summed up in a single lecture. He repeatedly points out the parts of the essay he wants people to work on e.g. thesis, topic sentences. He respects hard work; pay attention, do the HW and improve over the semester; that is how you'll get an A.",1
"Processor Kristina Casper, wants you to choose 5 vocabularies from the particular chapter then defined them and give examples only from the article that she brought. the article that she usually gives doesn't have any connection and relation to that particular chapter at all. and she destroys your grades if you miss any word.",0
hes hilarious lol he gives out random extra credit which really helps your grade. pay attention to his lectures and do the hw and youll pass. final is optional. would take his class just to hear him roast people again lol,1
"Was great, glad I had her. Only 2 exams and 4 quizzes (a 5th one at the end to replace the worst), all of which she posts what material you need to know usually a few days before. Online homeworks weren't even that bad. Only real hard part was the essays on the exams, if you want an A you'll have to nail those. SI is extra credit too. Clickers tho",1
"Excellent professeur. Il transmet très clairement la matière et sa passion pour le droit public est contagieuse. Son expérience politique lui donne beaucoup de charisme et il sait de quoi il parle !Il donne beaucoup de lectures, il faut absolument lire la doctrine et sy référer, mais il veut que ses étudiant passent!",1
"Put notes up at the beginning of semester but stopped because students used them.  Class was disinterested because material was uninteresting and inapplicable as taught (although DBs are useful, it is better to pick up a SQL book and teach yourself).",0
HOT.,1
"Most useless, rude, and unreasonable professor I've ever had. This is not a difficult course yet he seems to think it deserves to be treated like a weed out class, bragging about his abysmal average test scores. He intentionally aims to fail students by being completely unhelpful and unavailable. DO NOT TAKE ONE OF HIS CLASSEs.",0
"This was the most disorganized course I have taken. Prof Lai did not teach the material well. He often talked about topics but did not explain the theory or solve any problems. The textbook chosen was also terrible, and did a poor job of explaining topics. He tries to make the course easy by giving lots of hints, but you end learning nothing.",0
"Best prof so far...helpfuyl and understanding.  I dont know what the person below is saying...and, he did not cancel a third of classes...only 2. I recommend very highly",1
I took her as a freshman back in 2003. At the time I didn't realize how bad she was at teaching and gave her a positive review. But i've been a full time professor for six years and reflected on my education and realized that she was one of my worst instructors. She's not a good speaker and not particularly intelligent while being condescending.,0
I took him for a class that was based on learning HTML & CSS. Do not let HTML & CSS intimidate you. I am now taking programming classes that make markup language look like child's play. His assignments are easy if you don't get behind; and he is an easy grader. I would take him again if I was still interested in Web Development.,1
Attendance/quizzes 30% Writing assignment 10% Midterm examination 30% Final examination 30% The quizzes are 1 pt each if you get them correct and -.5 if you miss one. Both the midterm and the final are free response and you will not do well unless you write exactly what he is looking for. Super nice guy and entertaining during lecture.,0
"Took his class over winter term. Fast paced, and not necessarily easy, but I found that if you do the readings and practice exams everything becomes more clear. George is a genuine guy and willing to clarify if you need more help understanding something.",1
"He's a great teacher, really entertaining and kind of spastic but you can tell he wants his students to do well.  You should expect to study a lot since he has really difficult tests, but if you review your notes for 15 minutes after you take them, you should be fine! take him!",1
"She was very helpful. There was a lot of homework but was it never too hard. If you show up to class and do all of the work, you'll pass. If you have this teacher, don't worry- all will be well!",1
"Class was easy, but only because I already had a knowledge of Photoshop coming in. The professor wouldn't respond to e-mails until after the assignments were due. The only time I interacted with her directly, she had a bit of ""technical difficulties"", which is absurd for a computer professor.",0
"Grade is based completely on four tests, so make sure to study. He posts the study guide online, but you need to go to class for the vocab, especially the class right before the test. No homework but he does offer extra credit.",1
"Hands down, the best professor at UNC. I am not alone in this opinion either - everyone I know has said nothing, but phenomenal praise, and rightly so. She will help you in any way she can and truly loves her content area and can make it so approachable and interesting! Learned more in her class, than I have in all my other UNC classes combined!",1
i loveeeee him,1
"I took Dr. Poska's Early Modern Europe Seminar, and it was one of the best classes I have ever taken. The class was totally discussion based, so readings were mandatory, but it was not unmanageable. When it came to the written assignments, she was very helpful, and her honesty was most helpful. I would highly recommend her as a professor.",1
"For an online class, this professor remained extremely involved with the class the entire semester! The material is interesting and he really cares that students both understand and enjoy material. This is definitely one of the nicest, best professors I've had! Definitely take this class :)",1
"Great notes, fair tester. Great introduction into the field of communication systems.",1
"Mr. Testa is the best professor in the University of Toronto. He is intelligent, cares about his students, and is very organized. I highly recommend taking any of his classes, you will learn a lot and have fun while learning.",1
"If you don't get an A in this class, you're doing it wrong. Incredibly easy. You will learn a LOT about Philadelphia politics and government. There's really no higher authority on Philadelphia politics than him, whether you liked him as mayor or didn't or aren't from Philly either way. Final exam is a city council budget simulation. NO PAPERS/TESTS",1
"Professor Krusko is an excellent teacher.  She is clear, helpful, and that makes the material very easy to understand. She is very learned in the Anthropology field, and it is no wonder that she is the department head.",1
Masterful educator with a consistent philosophy to make his students employable individuals. YOU WILL LEARN SOMETHING IN THIS CLASS! Listen to this man and take his advice because he genuinely cares about you,1
Not the best at all. Everything is so complicated with him,0
"Lydia was easily accessible outside of the classroom. I emailed her to schedule an appointment and it was set up for the next day. She was patient with my questions and provided detail explanations. You have to ask your questions carefully, however. Her jokes may offend some. An easy A+ if you do your work and show your effort: optics is key.",1
"only offers his class at 8:10 in the morning every quarter...so when I drag myself to class at that time I at least expect some sort of interaction, some interest. larry wright won't give it to you. he mumbles so its hard to understand him. grading scale is abnormal and he isn't much help at all!",0
"One of the worst professors at Pace. She tells you to work by the syllabus, then is inconsistent with what she assigns and what is stated. She does not read your assignments or papers, you will get the same 3 grades for all your work. All the comments she will give you are generic to the whole class. I asked for help improving and never heard back.",0
"Professor Bodnar is an awesome teacher.  His lectures can sometimes be a little boring but generally he shows films and music clips which are cool.  The grade is based on 4 quizzes and 4 tests which are not hard, just follow the directions.  Highly recommend taking this class if history is interesting to you!  ",1
"She uses overhead notes, so write everything down because thats where the tests come from, and make sure you actually read the textbook!  She enjoys students asking questions and will answer them, if she doesn't have the answer then she will look for the answer and get back to you.  Really nice person.",1
"Prof. Laxer is an incredible vessel of knowledge and first hand experience of Canadian politics. His background in Canadian history is truly impressive and with every class you will leave knowing more than you did prior. A very charismatic and personable professor, highly recommended.",1
"I will never forget Professor North's classes: had him for ENG 120 and Lit 212D.  Each time he challenged me. He makes clear on the first day of class that he has rigorous grading standards by saying ""grades must be earned!"" All he means is that he wants to read intelligent and interesting papers that were not thrown together last minute.",1
"Another terrible prof at kettering. Hardly did any points worth for micro and was all macro, wish i knew that sooner. HW is impossible w/o book, i looked up things on the internet but they still werent exactly what he wanted",0
"Professor June is by far the best professor Ive had yet. She is really laid back and makes the class incredibly fun to learn, besides that her classes are extremely interesting already. She doesn´t mind if you miss class. She only makes you do three papers in the semester.",1
Best Prof so far.,1
"If you looking for easy way to pass cmsc411,take his course. exams are 99% same if you go to the exam review. HWs are really simple if you spend some time searching through his note/google. Projects is the hardest which is not very challenging. I doubt any can fail in his course. Easy A with effort.",0
"Harvey has been the best professor throughout my time at NCF. Clear, devoted, intelligent...but sometimes a bit awkward. Despite that one flaw, great man.",1
"Well. I am in the class now and I am here to say, avoid him. Social problems is a very interesting class but not the way he does it. Hes a stickler for you being in the class but the lectures dont help with any exam. The questions on the exams are hard and even with the reading, hell ask a question but make it so your work doesnt matter.",0
"He's very knowledgeable, knows his subject well and is a real nice guy. But you have to do well on the exams to do well in the class and your grade based primarily based on 3 exams. The class is kind of boring and it's the type of class where you think you did really good on the exam but you didn't. Study up and do the study guide, you'll be okay.",1
"This professor was terrible, he would make everyone line up after writing our papers and read aloud the mistakes we would make as he circled the paper to redo. I went to his office hours quite a few times and he was no help. I made a 69 in the class, which was a fail because you have to make a C in his class to pass. DO NOT TAKE HIM!",0
"Based on my experience with Dr. Ayadi this semester, I do not understand the negative reviews. She is very knowledgeable and overall a great professor. Her class is organized and she tries her best to breakdown the  material. There are a few writing assignments but nothing over a page long. I recommend taking her.",1
"The best! Really cares for his students learning. It makes the class interesting. Slides not available online but all in the book! SUPER EASY. The grading is on the usual but also, attending other school concerts, and writing mini-reports on them. Also 1 research report on a musician and reflection on 15 pieces of music. Grades lightly.",1
Best social science prof I ever had!!!!!,1
"Reagin definitely has an attitude problem, but she is an amazing teacher. She's very knowledgeable about history and enthusiastic as well. An amazing lecturer. She explains everything very well and makes history interesting.",1
"This 100 level class is waaay too much work for a GE credit. Readings are ridiculous, spent more time on this class than most of my 300 level classes. Avoid at all costs",0
You know those times that you just spit gibberish to pass time? This is what it felt like Dr. Plummer was doing during every single online class. There are at LEAST 5 different places an assignment could be hiding. Her personal website is the most confusing website I have ever been on and that's not an exaggeration. I did fine and didn't study.,0
Terrible professor. Nothing he teaches is on the tests and your grade is all tests. He lets you use a cheat sheet on the tests but it is still hard because its so much information and you don't know what he will test you on. Take someone else if you can!,0
"Out of four years as a politica science major at UW this by FAR is the worse course I have taken. The material is interesting enough, but the prof makes lectures unbearable. It is very unclear what he expects out of assignments and exams are wildly unfair. Avoid this prof",0
"I took Aesthetics with Prof. McConnell. I loved the class, I thought he was a great teacher. He was extremely passionate about the subject that he taught and that more than made up for any eccentricities he may have had. His class opened my mind in many ways. He may be uncoventional, but he is a wonderful teacher.",1
"He does not give specific directions and then deducts a bunch of points when you don't tell him EXACTLY what he wants, even though he didn't tell you. I'm an honors student, a month into the class, and I'm getting a C already. His lectures are unnecessary and not always correct, just read the book. Unable to properly critique/grade papers.",0
"Amazing prof. Period. Hilarious. Absolutely necessary to show up to lectures (notes are never posted online). Write down everything he says - even little ""tangents"". They're hilarious and they will show up on an exam (I now know that a Sultan had 888 kids). Wonderful prof, can't recommend strongly enough. Easiest exam ever if you study.",1
He really makes your one class a week fun! There are lots of jeopardy games and his wife will bake prizes. The class has a lot of reading and Cornell Notes but he trys to break it up as best as he can. Good professor!,1
"bad idea, turn around while you still can.",0
"Doesn't understand basics of computers, simple definitions of words like peripherals and the difference between the binary system and its units. Will grade you wrong based on her incorrect logic, and when you try to correct her, she will not admit wrong-doing, no matter what proof you present. ",0
I had this guy in 1984. Best math teacher I ever had.,1
"Putnam was a decent professor, but if you don't like legal theory, pass on Just 401. Lectures were a bit dry, but it's a pretty easy class as long as you show up.  There are easy iclicker quizzes almost every class and his doesn't post powerpoints so if you don't go to class and refuse to read the book you're screwed.",1
Awful global professor. She gave us 4 papers to do and we had journals due every class. Only upside was somewhat meaningful class discussion.,0
"Miller is easily one of the best professors I have ever had. She does an amazing job at explaining all concepts, and her class was always super interesting. 10/10, would take again.",1
"Unfortunately, he is not great at teaching, gives a lot of homework, tests are very heavy, and overall would not take another class with this professor. Wish I knew how his teaching style was beforehand because then it would have saved me a lot of stress and worry.",0
"I'm at Liberty and have taken a few classes taught by Dr. Towns. I do not question his love for God or commitment to Christ. I do, however, have issue with contradictions I've caught from class to class out of his mouth. In contacting them, with the proof, I was told, he is the co-founder and what he says is what he says.",0
"Funny, awkward guy. Lectures are very boring (sorry Wes), but he's nice and very helpful. Participation isn't a big deal, but make sure to show up often... there are in-class assignments on random days. Attend the group conferences and turn in essays on time.",1
"She seems like a cool professor the first day, but don't let her kindness trick you. You have to show up to class, she uses reef pooling for attendance. Her lectures literally put me and the whole class to sleep. Her book  review is dumb hard, and the tests are very tricky. If you really don't like history STAY AWAY!!!!",0
"HOW TO TACKLE THIS CLASS: Copy his study guide for the upcoming test (EARLY), paste it into a google doc, share it with friends in the class to ensure all/correct info is recorded, type in answers as he covers them, make flashcards after every class of the questions & answers covered that day.",1
"Doesn't teach. Just regurgitates. She is very unclear at what she wants and makes last minute decisions in terms of exams and content. She leaves the student wondering what to study for, when in reality, the only way to pass is to have the ENTIRE book memorized. When the class average was 60%, she blamed us for not studying enough.",0
"Okay, so his class is VERY easy.  BUT, he's got too strong an agenda. I honestly remember nothing but him talking about how terrible we've been to natives. I've been to all the classes, and that's honestly all I remember. We learned nothing the syllabus said we would. I feel like I wasted an entire semester for what could have been one seminar.",0
"I wish I had better things to say. But the work is very tedious. He gives out weekly blackboard journals that require paying a lot of attention to the text and pushing it. He then requires heavy, abstract readings, he experiments a lot and often just does whatever he feels like in the course. You do what he does, or your grade suffers.",0
She was extremely rude and was constantly calling out students. She was also very unclear with assignments and got pissy when people messed up. She would walk around the class and stand over people's shoulders all the time as well. I did well in this class but she made me uncomfortable.,0
"Dr. Curry is one of the best professors in the HCOM department. Funny, knowledgable, approachable, and extremely enthusiastic, she genuinely cares about her students. She is an extremely tough grader (though fair) and definitely makes you work for your grade. Essays are worth 60% of the final grade, so don't slack off when it comes to those. ",1
Love this teacher!! She is awesome and makes learning fun. She explains things until you understand them! I'm horrible at Math. But having her I passed with flying colors!,1
Hes good people through and through.,1
"she was a really hard grader and often confusing. never clearly explained the assignments and if you asked questions she never gave a clear answer. crazy work load too, my other classes suffered as i tried to keep up and she takes points off your assignments for no reason and no explanation",0
"I studied and studied for this course, but could never seem to hit the nail on exams of exactly what he wanted to see.",0
"This class is insanely hard. Bill, however, is more than willing to help you no matter how overwhelmed you feel. He's very worldly, seems to know something about everything, and is one of those professors that, even if you don't do great in the course, you learn something amazing from. And hey, Bill? Here's your chili pepper! Keep on keepin' on!",1
Very boring classes that while not required are pretty much required from in class assignments.  The semester starts as a lot of review as well.  I found her grading to be very poor as well.  For the project she would not account for early errors when grading the rest.  She also wasn't clear on formatting and took off points for that.,0
lecture was pointless...the tests were hard..recitation was more useful..had a 57% in the class overall and ended up with a B..that should say enough...,0
Probably the worst math teacher there is at KU. Theres no point in going to class because you don't learn anything in class. If your taking a class with him you better be good at teaching yourself the material.,0
I have never done CSC before and when going into a entry level class I thought it would be easy at parts but difficult too. That's not how it was. Lectures didn't matter with HW. We would still be doing the same thing for 2 weeks and still watching lectures didn't help out either. TAs didn't help either. Best way to pass is the free tutoring.,0
This prof is good if you know and like history. As i did not know anything it was very hard to follow along. She is defintiely a laugh but she talks fast and is all over the place. But id say she was a fair marker. I forgot much of the dates and specifics about questions on the midterm but still recieved 4/5s. :) not bad.,0
"While Professor DeYoung does know a ton about physics, he is truly awful teacher. His lectures and homework have almost nothing to do with the material covered on the test. He's incredibly pretentious and routinely makes students feel stupid in class. I wouldn't recommend taking his class; he makes it needlessly difficult.",0
"Great teacher and person! But only gives out a few papers per semester and those are your only grades so make sure to do well on those. She can sometimes be unclear with some things, but will gladly explain them to you if you ask her for help individually. :)",1
"Charles Okigbo is by far the greatest, most insightful professor I've ever had. Is it easy? No. Do you have to work for it? Yes. But if you're a communication major and love what you do, you'll love working with him. He's encouraging and helpful, and obviously loves to teach and help us get better. He's my absolute favorite teacher, ever.",1
My God is this guy good.,1
"Extremely clear on what he expects, and what he expects is very reasonable. Half the class got A or AB on tests, only one paper. Only downside is mandatory attendance. But he's someone who genuinely wants his students to do well.",1
Best professor take her!!!!!!!,1
She was always willing to assist and acted with a  sense of urgency on behalf of all of her students. She was always on time and worked well with us as students regarding deadlines (I took her intro to language/linguistics fall session two). Most people work full time and attend school and maintain a family and she was respectful in every aspect.,1
"Dr. Artis is an awesome teacher, she's pretty easy going and understanding. She made math interesting sice she approached it from a sociological prospective. Really nice women.",1
"He gets incredibly off-task in lectures. My notes were all over the place and inadequate to study from for tests. Doesn't respond to emails. No podcasts or blackboard notes/help. You'll need to attend class every time in order to get the unclear notes. He does know his subject, but I'd take someone else if I had to take the class again.",0
"The class is extraordinarily boring. all you do is look at slides and listen to his lectures. occasionally TAs will come in and you might get out early. the tests take a lot of time to study for, you have to memorize 90 works of art and the test is mostly essay. avoid this class if you can.",0
"She's really nice.  She's outgoing, and kind of loud.  This class is extremely easy but sometimes, she can be very unclear about assignments.  Sometimes, she's hard to follow and you just don't know what she is talking about!",0
"Engaging lectures! There's a lot of group activities during each lecture so it's never boring. The class is pretty easy tbh, because she makes the expectations really clear, not that there isn't any work. Readings/assignments don't take a lot of time. Just did not enjoy the group essay. At all.",1
very hard final,1
"While her in-class assignments were not difficult, she struggled to give students feedback on papers (which take up the majority of your grade). Her grading criteria is very unclear and seems to vary. In addition, the topics for the essays seemed to be very similar for the entire semester, so I felt like I was writing the same thing over and over.",0
"She seems do not like giving lectures. half of the semester was reading papers. You may think it is OK, but actually you need even more time to understand those hard papers, you have to write paper review for each paper, you have to do a big project  based on one of the papers. The final exam was not about the lectures but about the papers. Useless",0
One of my favorite profs from 3rd year. he structured the class in a way that almost forced you to learn the material as we went and makes excellent notes. unfortunately he does not post them online but they are better then the others I've seen that I've seen so go to class and get take the notes and you will win in this class.,1
"Pretty funny guy. We watched a lot of movies. Go to class, he takes attendance and gives extra points when there's not a lot of people. 2 exams. Papers in response to articles that he does grade semi-toughly. Especially since he has a 325 word max, you can't include everything. Overall, fairly easy, but kind of boring.",0
Best professor I ever had. Politics is not my thing but at the end of the semester I feel like I have something to say and that I am better prepared for my upper level college classes. I reccomend Dr. B!,1
"Les examens sont supers faciles, mais elle est chiante sur la correction des travaux. Ses travaux sont d'ailleurs pas clairs. Elle parle très doucement et ne fait que lire des statistiques et ses powerpoints. On apprend pas grand chose, et c'est un cours super ennuyant.",0
"I recommend Professor Jung 1000%, for Math 125 Intermediate Algebra and Math 227 Intro to Statistics.",1
Banana teacher...haha She always eats banana before class start. Fun class and her study guides are very helpful. She uses easy words to explain tough knowledges. I'm totally into this class even though I'm an international student. Highly Recomment.,1
GREAT teacher really opened my eyes to sociology. If you like the material the class is easy. The final paper is rough but thats my only complaint. highly recommend,1
"he teaches ok - not too bad. its just that he's super rude. quoting a feedback he gave from a classmate asking for a regrade, ""Did you REALLY think your solution was in any way a correct solution?.... This solution doesn't even make sense as code, and i would give negative points if the rubric permitted"". ???? cant believe a prof actually said tht",0
"Matchett obviously knows his material, but in class I found the way he explained it quite confusing- his office hours helped! The readings were confusing/not helpful. Being in pre-vet, I have to juggle other tough classes, but the amount of work homework he gave us was ridiculous. It did not let me accurately utilize time for those other classes.",0
Boring boring boring. Probably can do without attending the lectures. The things that he says are often confusing. The review sessions were helpful though and he often told you things to focus on while studying at them.,0
"Dr. McConkey is really passionate about what he is teaching and you can tell he really cares about the success of his students. He will always be there for help. With that being said, DO NOT TAKE THE 8AM. The tests are surprisingly tough and you have to go to class to do well.",1
"Excellent cours et excellent prof sur le plan académique, un peu plus discutable sur le plan humain (dommage pour un prof de sciences humaines)",1
It was his first time teaching INT422. Lectures were slow and confusing. Course was scary because 4 weeks in he's taught me almost nothing. You have to self learn everything.,0
"I didnt like her. She is very superficial in how she teaches, talking/glaring at students, feigning excitement, fast, a generally uncomfortable atmosphere. Very heavy on reading primary sources and meticulous in grading essays. Does give out questions to final ahead of time though. don't take her for supposed inspiring personality (was my mistake)",1
"Interesting Class! She expects you to learn the material and know it well. Tests are long, but very fair. Attendance is important. She will go out of her way to help if you need it.",1
"Literally the most boring professor ever. Everyone falls asleep in class and the absurd amount of homework you have with the most extra essay criteria is really annoying. If you really need the class for Hub, it's good to take because the class is not hard. It's just a lot of work and wanting to cry listening to his lectures.",0
"Her teaching style is very fast and the slide is not clear! You must read the book carefully. You have no choice, only she teaches the class. There are many definitions of examination, and she is not a hotness person.",0
Best teacher I have ever had. He believes in us as students; takes our art seriously. He makes me want to put 1000% into my work and actually exhibit it. Also a great sense of humour.,1
Really old but funny. gives easy assignments and does the most random things in class.,1
"She is knowledgeable in her subject area, but is too disorganized, and gets behind in class, and then gets mad at her students. She tends to not help students who she dislikes or who haven't had as much training. She will gossip about other professors and conductors even though her conducting isn't very good. She will speed up songs twice as fast.",0
"Cooper does nothing but use his status to push objectively false world ideas like how climate change isn't real. I got an A- on all the tests but come midterm and final ended with an F because I dared use historical examples to discredit a paper called ""on being conservative"". He says ""as long as you have good ideas you'll pass"", which isn't true",0
"I think she takes everything into account attendance, homework, and the final. You can basically figure out your grade. This class is still easy, super easy, especially if you have a class that meets once a week.",1
"Every week, you turn in an assignment worth 10 points - generally one page responses to something he has you read or view. His directions are pretty clear on what he wants. You write five papers/projects and turn them in. He gives (fairly vague) feedback, then you revise two to be graded for 150 each. Follow the directions and you'll be fine.",1
She is a super tough grader. She gives no partial credit.,0
"He is terrible. DO NOT TAKE HIM. He lectures about absolutely nothing. His test are very difficult even if you study. I went to class, read to book, made notecards, and still got the worst grade of my college career. If you can avoid him, you should. If you do take him, show up every day. He gives a quiz after every dingle class.",0
"Very knowledgeable in his field, but does not provide clear notes. You have to do 6 one page papers, then 2 essay based exams. If you struggle with writing, I don't suggest you take this class with this professor",0
He's full of himself but probably one of the best teachers I've had at NSU,1
"This professor was a pain for me in this class. He expects you to write down both what's on the board and what he's saying, so buy a recorder if possible. Also, the only grades for this class are the exam parts he has everyone take throughout the semester, with the questions on them easy to frustrate. Expect showing up every class of his to pass.",0
"I did not like her at all! She speaks for 3 hours straight, doesn't ask for feedback and then wonders why students don't speak. I took a similar course before so I thought it would be easy, I was wrong. You will really work for your grade in this class.",0
Practice online tutorials and you will surely pass. Attend lectures because he explains codes very well.,1
"For PHIL 104, you have to write two essays. For both of which, you can practically write anything you want. But, oh my god, this guy is a horrible grader. Gives you practically no feedback, his comments are literally 2 words, and underlines random things and gives you a fabricated grade based on no set rubric. Terrible professor who does not help.",0
"John is by far the best prof at UNB. He cares about his students and wants them to succeed. He does not like midterms he considers them to be an unfair test of your knowledge. Labs are interesting, final project on lunar rocks is super cool, and the final exam is a piece of cake usually 4 essay questions out of 10. John rocks (no pun intended)",1
"Online hybrid class - You read 2 chapters per week, and meet up once for a quick review, then you take a quiz. It is very well coordinated. Grading is test heavy. As for the instructor, she's very attentive & sweet. She'll comment on nearly everyones post on online discussions. You'll be in good hands. Personality wise, she seems pretty neutral.",1
Hard to understand sometimes. Does not explain well. Online homework doesn't always match up with what you learn. Don't ask questions unless you want to feel stupid for asking. He does give you solutions that do help but sometimes the quizzes are above what you learned so just expect to get it wrong. The quiz doesn't always match the homework.,0
"Worst lectures ever! Extremely bland, uninformative and all over the place. He is not  very willing to help, and likes to just refer students back to their notes. On the positive side, his tests are straight forward and homework is not mandatory but recommended.",0
"I LOVE PROF POOL!!  She is by far the best prof at GV!  Her enthusiasm makes you want to do your best, and she definitely knows her stuff! She learns everyone's name, and she makes you feel important to the ensemble.  If you're thinking about auditioning...do it.  You won't reget it, I promise! :-)",1
"Does not grade fairly. Tests are essay based so she can always just take points off for missing one small detail or saying be more specific. boring class, no discussion, ruined my gpa",0
"I am not a fan of Biology, but Dr. Rutledge is easy to understand. He does a optional zoom class everyday for questions and tutoring. His tests are pretty hard and weigh 50% of your grade so make sure to study. I really enjoyed this class, and would recommend taking him for this class.",1
Doc is awesome!,1
"There are a few of discussion postings for each week, three exams, and final. There is one big interview assignment, but he gives you the instructions right away. He gives feedback on some assignments. I took the summer course for this online class. It was really hard to keep up the work. My suggestion is getting help from the tutoring center.",1
"Professor O'Hagan is very detailed, informative, and engaging. I'm pursuing French above the 102 level and I'm hoping to find a lecture he's teaching.",1
"Dr. Hays made this class interesting and fun. He helped us understand the basics of developmental psychology with interesting discussions. He does not post grades, which can be stressful.",1
"he's such a great professor. he has such great experience that he makes a boring, fire code course interesting. he relates the code to his experience in the field. would take him again and again!  DONT NEED TO HAVE A TEXTBOOK EITHER!",1
"Has thick accent, and can be hard to understand.  ""is a quarter"" means ""it equals to"", etc. Occasionally seems that she doesn't herself understand what she is teaching, especially if you ask her a question about what she's copying from her notes onto the board. Tests are based on material covered, occasionally same questions as she explained.",0
"Dr. Hrabak was a good professor and you can tell she is really passionate about genetics. The tests are pretty similar to the homework making it easier to study, and there is extra credit. Don't buy the textbook for GEN604, everything you need for the exams will be covered in her lectures which she records and posts!",1
I did not receive any help as I did expect from her.,0
"He has to be one of the worst teachers in New York state. He sent us slides that I could have put together in 8th grade and his videos were always off topic rants. He could never be clear with his assignments and when he wanted them done, but he made sure we knew every detail about his other class and that we should take it. 100% joke of a teacher.",0
"I skipped most CS courses because the profs usually simply regurgitate what you can read in a textbook. Roumani  was  one of the only profs who used the class for interaction and put some effort into teaching topics in an interesting and concise manner. You probably could pass without coming to class, but it was still definitely worth coming to.",1
"The whole class is based off of keynotes and he doesn't put them online. His tests are impossible and gives study guides but a lot of the material isn't even on the exam. The notes you take from the keynotes in class aren't on the exam most of the time either. Nice guy, but his class is ridiculous.",0
Great professor and all around great guy. It's a little like taking courses with Woody Allen and he always has interesting and poignant anecdotes. Take any class he's teaching.,1
"Dr. Noble clearly knows what she is talking about. She is very knowledgable of the subject. However, she is extremely unfriendly whenever questions are asked of her. In class, she does not answer the question without patronizing the one who asks it. I have personally emailed her multiple times with questions and she is condescending and rude.",0
"Professor Beck gives extremely boring lectures that do not involve the students at all. She did not post a single grade for our entire class before our final exam. Gave zero grades the entire semester and then hits you with a major project with little guidance, an extremely time consuming book report, and a very difficult final.",0
"Dr. Klemow is the greatest man and professor! He offers extra credit throughout the entire semester and if you do all of them and do well on them, it can bump your grade from a 3.5 to a 4.0. Take the lab notebooks seriously and they can also bump your grade up! Test questions are very specific, but go to his review sessions and youll get freebies!",1
"Assignments are ridiculous and leave the students in a craze. He expects them to understand several concepts, yet is very rude and non helpful when asked questions. He doesnt provide sources to investigate either. He's also very rude",0
"Prof doesn't provide feedback and takes forever to give grades back. His tests are so open ended. I thought his lectures were so boring, hes so monotone. His assignments weren't too hard. Try to listen to him in class even though you might be fighting the need to drift off into a deep sleep.",0
Great professor who loves what she does and is genuinely happy to be there. Must do all work to get a decent grade.,1
"Congratulation! if you are reading this comment while looking for English professor. Stop reading looking around; go register for his class before it is closed. I took his class simply based on the reviews here. Is a great teacher, unfortunately I started loving English.",1
"Horrible teacher. I spent most of my time trying to ignore his class lecture due to his confusing explanations, illegible handwriting, frequent mistakes(even on test answers), and constant tangential references. The book he chose is mediocre. His tests problems do not relate to the book or the material that he teaches in class. Find another prof.",0
His class is very dry and boring. His teachings don't align with anything learned in prior circuits classes. He teaches from power points and has grading issues.,0
Dr Gurung is a really cool cat. He really cares and gets to know his students by name.,1
"Research Methods is what it is: pretty boring.  However, I left this class with a wealth of knowledge and experience utilizing the music library and other resources in addition to advanced scholarly writing.  The assignments are tedious and she is quite particular as to how assignments are to be done/turned in. Not terrible, just kind of dry.",1
"Take this professor.  Everything we did in class was on the test, sometimes the exact problem.  Homework is optional, attendence is optional.  Everything is crystal clear, he's an easy grader with partial credit, and he goes over it so many times, it's impossible to fail his tests.",1
the worst prof. i've ever had,0
This was not a good professor. His exams were confusing and not straight forward. He is not open to questions and will treat you like you are stupid. You are unable to confront him about exam questions. I had to read every page of the textbook to score an A minus. It was not worth it. Do not take him.,0
She is the head on Information Systems in FGCU. She is lazy does not want to teach. She is unethical and uses her power to control students. She even creates conflicts in the schedule for students drop her class. She refuses to help and she gives projects with very little clarity. Out of 8 chapters she only talked about 20 minutes about 2 of them b,0
Echo a lot of the earlier comments. He was terrible in the online format.,0
This man could have had a prospurous career in the adult-entertainment industry. Such a shame he became a real Dr.,0
"He frequently uses profanity when talking to the class. If he feels the class is not ""alive enough"" he will give a pop quiz on a random topic that might not even deal with the class. He often does not stick to his course syllabus either, he makes up assignments and rules as he goes. I will make my best effort to not take one of his classes again.",0
"This is honestly the hardest class I've ever taken. I normally get A's and B's like it's no big deal, 'cause it's not. But this class is unbelievable! I study a week prior to the test, only to get a C or D! To which Mr. F says, is a ""good thing"". He must be used to having everyone fail, which says a lot about his teaching. Don't take this class.",0
Knows her stuff so you cannot BS in her class! She will call you out.  But she explains everything thoroughly and her office hours are EXTREMELY helpful!,1
"By far my favorite professor at LSU thus far. She is really understanding and super cool. This was definitely a class I looked forward to and never hesitated to skipping. She makes it go by so fast. There is a midterm and finals, and quizzes, however, they are really hard. She is a great teacher and I would recommend her to all my friends.",1
"Terrible. If you are reading the comments and assuming that people are just being overly harsh, you are wrong. He is ABSOLUTELY as bad as they say. I took college precalc in high school and got an A and decided to take it again in college for a GPA boost. But I just ended up completely trashing my GPA because Moon Kim is just the worst professor.",0
"lots of work. If you're a full time student it might be 2 much, especially IB majors. Higurashi, to me personally, was rude. She told me to stop playing with my hair (nervous tick) & how I held my pen. also said she forgot about me aftr yrs of knwing her. I even went to dinner with our class and sat right next to her. doesnt care about her students",1
Kendra's really enthusiastic!  Her love for literature shows in her teaching.,1
"Ask specific questions, and don't answer them before we get a chance to!",0
"Class is fine, homework a bit intense and exams are heavily weighted. First three tests were not difficult, fourth was more challenging, but I still managed to not take the final because I had an A average. Lectures can sometimes be a waste of time, but sometimes he explains concepts and if you miss it, it isn't always stated on the lecture slides.",1
"Professor Miller is amazing. Notes are very important, his lectures are packed with information. Grading scale is very tough: an A- in any other class is a B+ in his, but if you work hard and pay attention you can get the grade. Very fair and accessible.",1
"This class is SUPER hard. No exaggeration. He has a really thick accent so you'll never know what he's saying.  He writes TONS of notes and does not explain them unless you ask him to, even when you ask, you still won't get it. Also, he has terrible handwriting, so copying notes is even a struggle. Steer clear of this professor, please!",0
"Go to Class! All tests are based entirely on the lecture notes & the class grade entirely off of 2 prelims & a final. Overall I just showed up to class, PAID ATTENTION, studied maybe 1-2hr for each prelim, & got an A- w curve. Professor Ruttledge is super passionate & really really nice. Does his best to make the material less dense. Fav prof. LOVE",1
best professor forever,1
"Professor Hawk is the best, most laid back professor I've ever had! He doesn't assign long papers and we didn't take a midterm or final. Even if you're bad at English, you DEFINITELY want this professor.",1
"Mr.Mezik is a wonderful person with a big heart. He really cares about his students. He will do whatever he can to engage you in his daily lessons, and get you to pass. Attend your labs, take good notes, pay attention, and you will be ok. His website is very helpful, make sure you check it out for any exams before hand. Mezik, One of Herk's best!",1
"Marc has the right idea but poor method. At first, I appreciated Marc for his innovative thinking, charismatic attitude, and interest in student interaction. I quickly realized this was not his true demeanor. Marc is in fact poor at specifying grading criteria, poor at overall communication, and very disrespectful. Get a PhD, Marc. Embarrassing CU.",0
"Pretty good teacher, but she teaches straight out of the textbook. Honestly if you just read enough you'll be fine. Her lectures kind of suck, and she gets annoyed when people don't participate, but as long as you read the material the tests are a breeze.",1
bad teacher!!! she was terrible at speaking because of her strong accent and she was late to class on multiple occasions. she wasnt helpful when i was confused. expect to teach yourself because she wont!!!,0
"Outstanding Professor. Very clear, knows his subject and more importantly knows how to teach his subject.",1
"I have one phrase, ""Human nature being what it is . . ."" Heard it a thousand times! Funny guy.",1
"Prof is really nice as a person, but not really great as a professor. She still uses an overhead, her MCQ are hard and expects you to memorize all philosophers/scientists for the exams. Boring content and professor. I think she should just spend her final years in Cuba or Miami.",1
ideologically desperate,0
"Good Lord does this man love the Chuck! His tests are fair, just take notes on the details and ask him if you have questions. He knows WAY too much about this place just don't feel belittled if he comes up cocky, he's just out there to set the record straight on Charleston myths.",1
"Let me start off by saying I loved Professor Bai! You could definitely tell that he has a passion for what he teaches. But.. if you consider yourself an ""Auditory Learner"" you may want to choose a different professor because his accent is THICK and he speaks very QUIETLY. Sit near the FRONT if you do have him. Great professor in all other aspects.",1
Office hours were magical and lectures were like beautiful stories. The way to go at UW if you want to learn quantum.,1
"She's a nice person, but assigns insane amounts of reading. If you don't do it, you don't get points for journals. THEY ADD UP FAST. If you like standing up and talking you can get extra credit, otherwise you're out of luck. She'll give you a horrible grade on a paper and not provide much explanation when you approach her. Don't take this class.",0
GREAT Guy.  Really nice. Makes the material make sense.  If you must take stats at State take it from him.  He uses the calculator and does not make you show work.  Class is worth taking,1
"Fred is a GREAT professor. I went into this class just needing the credits but I learned SO MUCH! Fred gives you encouragement and only wants you to succeed! My only complaint is that he likes to hear himself talk a little too much. ;) We could have gotten through a lot more speeches if he hadn't talked quite so much. But overall, he's great!!",1
"Good writing and orgnization of the class. Be prepared to do weekly hw and spend 10+ hours on each one. This is a math course, not a finance course! Tons of math formuli show up. Exams are take home but very difficult.",1
"I had her as an online course. The overall class was simple,organized and informative.",1
"Really bad prof.  I will admit that he is a nice man,which I believe is the main reason people think he is so amazing.  Put aside his nice personality, and you have a terrible professor.  His classes are boring, useless, and much harder than they should be(since they are technically the bird courses in business).  Avoid Neil",0
"My favorite BSU professor, which is saying something because this class was online. Its 17 writing assignments but I had an absolute blast doing them. Took out all of them in 6 weeks. Its a shame hes retiring after spring 2013 :(",1
"Professor Ellman is a good person but not a great professor. Quizzes and tests are EXTREMELY hard, you would have to memorize all of the slides to get a good grade, even then its debatable. Only a few tests and quizzes with no other grades so if you don't do well on those you are screwed. Do not recommend.",0
In her SOCW 315 class you better be prepared. Her paper is the hardest paper I have ever had to write. Do not slack or wait till last minute to do this paper because you will not get a good grade on the paper. The simulation clients was the best part of the class. Other than that their are quizzes everyday at the start of class.,1
"He is incredibly rude. At first he seems so cool, but at the semester went on the entire class disliked him more and more. If it wasn't for the SI, i would not have passed.",0
Best prof I've ever had during my 4 years in Waterloo.,1
"This professor just drains you of any motivation to learn web design. It felt like he had no desire to actually teach you, and was just plain grumpy. But you could just learn off the course notes on-line right? Wrong. Half of the material on the tests is not in the notes, nor does he mention it. Not the type of person who should be a teacher. ",0
"Shaun is awesome! Lectures were entertaining even though it was math, quizzes/tests arent super diffult as long as youre prepared. Rating: 9/10",1
Good prof and very care about students. She could explain the question very clear but her test was very hard. Her few extra credit can not change the grade and some questions of the test are you never seen before.,0
"Hold grudges. Does not listen, loves the sound of his own voice, Does not help outside of class.",0
Dedicated prof.  Knows his stuff.  My favorite prof in the J-school so far. ,1
An ok teacher for this class at least,0
"Prof Tripp has very high expectations for work-sometimes excessively high, but can be funny. He expects different writing from different students and enjoys some student's styles more than others. Be prepared to write a lot of papers, and be prepared to rewrite them. He is accessible outside of class, but prepare to have your work torn apart.",0
BEST TEACHER I HAVE EVER HAD. She is the most caring teacher I have ever had. Very understanding and flexible with work--As long as you tell her why.,1
His class is very difficult and was very frustrating. He assigns no homework or review. The only graded assignments are 4 essays and the final. You almost never receive feedback on assignments so it is impossible to know what you did wrong and how to improve at writing. Class started with 32 students. By finals only 7 showed up.,0
"Brian is awesome! He really makes you feel comfortable in the class, so your never have a problem asking him about anything. Great guy who really knows his stuff.",1
"One of the worst profs I've had. Doesn't know how to manage her time. Didn't finish course material because she would only get through a ninth of the material each class. Often gave contradictory information regarding timing, grades, etc.. Didn't get through all the final presentations because of this and some people had to present during finals",0
Professor Darby is the best of men. He loves his classics and passionately throws you into his world. The class is a lot of work but the concepts are so often repeated and tied together that it's difficult to fail if you pay enough attention. Darby sounds like an American sergeant but he's super helpful and won't stop until he knows you've got it.,1
"Very nice guy. However, he is extremely hard. He moves fast and expects you to understand and remember previous information. His writing is hard to read. Do no take unless good at math and ready to teach yourself. Buy the solutions manual if possible.",0
"Bruce is a nice enough guy and he cares, however he was absolutely terrible at marking.  He had not marked ANYTHING by the last week of classes.  The class had a lot of potential, and I was very disappointed.  His TA marked our research papers and the comments were extremely unhelpful. I am sure if you write and think like Bruce, you will do okay.",0
This was the worst on-line class I have ever taken.  The professor gave no guidance on the paper due and posted items at the last minute.  Do not take this class.,0
"You can't avoid taking him, but be ready to self-teach. Lectures are confusing and meandering. Go to office hours with questions to do well. No curve so hard to get a good grade. Very old-fashioned type teacher.",0
He frequently gets to the end of problems and has gotten them wrong. He also speaks barely above a whisper and has atrocious handwriting.,0
Loved going to class everyday because of the amazing conversations.,1
"Gives very detailed and insightful lectures that really allow you to grasp the content as well as the texts. Midterm required you to recall smaller details, but it was open book and quite easy if you took good notes. Tutorials had regular pop quizzes but they are not difficult if you have read the texts.",1
Great professor! Listen in class and make an effort to understand it. Understanding with partial credit on tests.  Details from the book not necessary to read as most test information comes from class notes.,1
Good guy! Knowledgable and worldly,1
"Professor Nuneville made this class a real breeze, honestly. She knew the material well and was able to get a lot of guest speakers in who had specialties and it made the almost 3 hour class doable. You only grades are the tests and the paper but if you watch law and order and come to the lectures, youll be fine.",1
"Spends more time imagining how to do problems and flipping back and forth through the slides than teaching. Very easy to get lost in a storm of calculus gibberish, very hard to follow. Nice person though, happy to answer questions, but you'll probably be too lost to put any together.",0
"He is nice enough and discussions can be lively. However, this class shouldn't be required for anyone 25 or older.  Assignments and due dates are not clearly defined (they don't match the syllabus). ""Do a writing on metacognition"". Ok, what about it? Specifics would be nice. Too many papers to write overall, got tiresome. Also, don't buy Outliers.",0
"He is a professional, and he knows how to teach people. Great teacher to take a course with.",1
"I took this course online and it was by far the hardest course I have ever taken. The tests reflect about half of the total material he tells you to study for, which is a monumental amount of material. The test review session did not cover much of what was on the exam either.",0
"I took Intro to Human Rights with Prof Cornish, and wouldn't recommend. This class made me want to scream into a pillow and bang my head on a wall simultaneously. He's passionate about the material but doesn't know how to teach his students the material and there was waaay too much reading assigned every week. He's an easy grader though.",0
"She is a really nice teacher. Sometimes she tends to repeat and do the same activities over and over again, but she really wants to make sure you understand everything. I would recommend her for intermediate spanish!!",1
"I was so into her class, it was so much fun. I love English, I'd always go to her office hours for help to peer edit my essay and get more feedback. She was very helpful. BUT! She is not clear with assignments, hard grader, and has no sympathy. She said I was passing then gives me a NP. She's misleading. Don't take her. Just being honest!",0
"She comes off as a tough teacher, but when you step into her office in need of any sort of help she will be there for you. This professor has helped me with so much stuff related to class and unrelated to class. She is a great professor and is a very caring person as well. Course work is tough but she is always around to explain and clarify it.",1
"The guy is a nut...seriously don't pay the guy to teach you, he isn't worth your money.",0
"Class does get progressively more difficult, but he is very straightforward about what will be on the tests. Tests are highly computational and easy to make careless mistakes on. Thankfully he is a fair grader. Not many kids go to class because his lectures are more abstract and theoretical, but I found them helpful and enjoyed the class. Good prof",1
"This was an online-only class and he was on autopilot. It seems the only thing he did was grade the midterm and final. Questions sent via email took days to answer, and always referred back to his rare comments on blackboard that were vague to begin with.",0
"Very scatterbrained, lectures are confusing and useless but have to go to get participation marks.  Be ready to learn absolutely nothing . Tests are difficult, and grading unclear. She talks in circles and often contradicts herself concerning material. Seriously avoid at all costs. ",0
"This class was hard. There was a lot of reading and that was what the midterm and final were based on. I was lucky and had a good T.A.- beware of this because they are the ones who grade everything. The material wasn't that difficult, there was just a lot of it. Lectures could sometimes be very interesting, but sometimes they were really boring.",1
"Materials kind of hard but go to class , do all the homework and listen when he tells you what will be on the quizzes and you'll do fine. 4 quizzes and he drops the lowest grade",1
Its a difficult class no matter who you take it with. But Don is fantastic and really engaging,1
Kim Noel is very boring!!! i dont know how someone can make psychology boring but she managed to do it perfectly!!!! dont enroll in her lecture....,0
One of the best teachers at the slipper rock. Learnt the most in his classes. Yes they were hard but you actually learn stuff. Definitely worth my time and money would take his classes 100x over,1
"she doesn't use canvas, assignments and their due dates are extremely unclear, I wouldn't take this class again if I was paid",0
I thought Professor Arrizon was a great teacher. She brought her own perspectives to class and was interested in that of others. Participation matters in her class. Readings weren't too bad compared to other classes. Advice for the quizzes: write up a summary of each reading and use it on the quiz. Made it very easy and passed every quiz w/ an A.,1
"This was an easy class. However, it was the worst because of the teacher. He was rude through email and IS NOT ORGANIZED AT ALL!!!His lessons were all over the place: wrong lesson content. His due dates were the worst they were different every place you looked. For being a communication teacher, he is terrible at communicating!! Find another prof!!",0
"I love Tancredi. He's chill, good-looking, plays bass, teaches well, great sense of humor. Dude, sign up for his class.",1
Pretty Average Professor,1
"Look... Sure, Tifrah is a beautiful human as a person but the things she emphasizes for notes are very difficult to pinpoint. She doesn't really have clear guidelines and you never know the answers to her questions. It's a difficult course.",1
I really like his sense of humor.,1
"she means weel for her student and is pro student rights, but she has trouble relating the materal to relife examples.  also, she barely goes over how to do problems unless someone ask how to do it.  she is a nice lady and offeres extra credit.  cant recommend her or not cuz from what i hear all the 1050 profs suck",0
"Please avoid Dr. Bob at all costs. He is honestly too smart to be teaching a Calculus II course to college students. He uses MAPLE religiously, and expects you to learn how to use it for homework, quizzes, and tests. I honestly never paid attention in lectures because they weren't helpful. Good luck.",0
"This dude is garbage. He failed me for doing TOO MUCH on a quiz. He's lazy, has TERRIBLE jokes, and won't explain the assignment until AFTER you have been graded on it. One of the worst professors here by far. If you can avoid him I highly recommend it. God forbid you actually try to get some help on your work. This guy's ridiculous and not funny.",0
"Dr. Colby treats students poorly and rarely answers any questions you may have. Often I would ask for clarification, and he would respond in a condescending way every time. I would ask for help on projects, but I received none from him. It was an intro course, yet he made you feel like a moron for asking a question. Do not take his class.",0
"Absolutely loved this professor! Even though I took her English 101 class online, she emailed once a week to remind us about due dates (online teachers generally expect you to know your due dates and don't do reminders). She was super friendly and helpful when I needed to reach her via email. Her assignments aren't hard but they are time consuming.",1
"awful, just awful. i have no idea what actually happened in this class. i've taken grad-level classes with less reading. pompous @sshole. clearly brilliant man, TERRIBLE teacher.",0
Gibbons is very Smart. He knows what he is talking about. You are expected to read the book before class and there is almost always a quiz. He gives out a ton of extra credit opportunity so take advantage of it. His class can be boring and he likes to go off topic a lot. GO to his office hours but make sure your put a lot of time for it.,0
"She was terrible! She was inconsistent, and was never focused. She would tell some nonsense story for half of the class. Also, she assigned meaningless homework assignments that were subject to change the day it was due. I disliked this class immensely.",0
"Really great, engaging teacher. I like how he sometimes incorporated humour into the lectures, it helps to make the subject matter even more interesting and understandable, and also helps to keep my attention. He was enthusiastic about the material in the lecture and incorporated the real-world issues and applications every lecture.",1
He's so hot i find it hard to pay attention in class,1
made me feel stupid.. should be at a higher level and not community college,0
"Dr. Alexander is one of the worst Biology professors I have ever had. He has very poor communication skills and will take weeks to respond to emails. Grades are based on 4 exams alone, and you pretty much have to teach yourself the complicated content. Lectures are useless as he is very disorganized and does not provide clarification. Avoid!!!",0
"Lots of energy, so lectures were awesome. Not afraid to tell it like it is. Would undoubtedly go back in for a class if I needed the credits. Grades somewhat difficult, but nothing too crazy.",1
"Overall: Very poor lecture, requires time to teach yourself. Lecture: Verbally teaches math, lacks organization, a lot of side talk. Homework: will assign problems that he didnt lecture on (uses textbook). Tests: Mostly basic problems, do the study guide. He is nice, kind, and funny. If you already know math and dont need any help, take him.",0
Seriously the worst professor i have ever had. She acts like we only have her class to worry about and assigns papers that are not graded but go towards you 20 points of participation. Did not learn a single thing in any classes i have ever taken with her.,0
One of the worst professors I have ever had.,0
Use the older exams to your advantage.,0
Take at your own risk! If you want to really learn C# lang just avoid taking him and if you are good at learning from other sources you can go ahead! I personally feel that there is no need to attend his classes just be dependable on his website and term tests will be from the one's he will never teach. Good luck!,0
Horribly boring to listen to. I emailed her that I had a friend die recently and that I might need an extension on homework assignments and she didnt even respond. She is by far the toughest grader I have ever had. DO NOT take this class if you can avoid it.,0
"This class is very hard and it kinda seemed like he wanted us to fail. The unfair thing was that he taught us something 1 day before the final, which is wrong. I think he should have thoughts about the class and how would the students feel but he kind of tortured us all the way through.",0
LOTS OF WORK. SHE DOES NOT REPLY EMAILS AT ALL. DOES NOT ANSWER QUESTIONS.,0
"I had her for SCOM 123, and I couldn't ask for a better professor. Her lectures are very interactive, she's hilarious, and you'll get to know a lot about her family. I wouldn't say this class is an easy A with the research and scheduling when to work with your groups, but Nicole definitely does her job in preparing you for the midterm and final.",1
Dr. Harper's class was my favorite. It was extremely easy and I learned about business besides text book definitions. Lots of guest speakers. His sense of humor is amazing too.,1
The worst teacher I've had at UNCC. Ridiculous grading criteria. Would be better suited to teach Business Communication in 1980. Don't take him,0
"She is such an easy grader, really nice, cancels class all the time, just do the work and show a little effort and you will pass.",1
"This class was my first class at NOVA, and I was feeling very nervous at the beginning of the semester, but Professor Mancini made me feel right at home. Very funny and casual environment, but I still learned things I didn't know before. She was always happy to answer any questions, and was super chill. Course work wasn't very challenging either.",1
"He is a very slow speaker who likes to explain in the clearest possible way and always starting from the origin of the topic. I took a course called ""Database Management Systems"" and never saw any during the whole course, he recommend us to use Microsoft Outlook in 2017. He has no knowledge about NoSQL, Datawarehouse, and PL/SQL concepts.",0
"he takes the time to stop and ask how you're doing...very personable. not only is he nice, he's also pretty attractive.",1
"She's sweet, but I cannot understand her for the life of me. I've tried attending the lectures and she has online lecture recordings but her English is terrible. She's not good at explaining. To do well on the exams you HAVE to KNOW the book front and back and do the online modules and hw. No one did well on her exams, the test averages were awful",0
avoid if possible! only perk to having her is there is no final. tests are all multiple choice which sounds good but they end up being impossible. class avg on exam 2 was a 60. bad accent. calls people out and makes them look like a fool if they're wrong. take another teacher,0
"Very Nice teacher, you need help? Just ask them. Youll need to buy the My Math Lab code and just keep up on homework and youll pass.",1
"No phones or talking allowed or she will call you out. She is a very sweet lady--but super tough!!-- and one of the best profs I have ever had. Very smart and articulate, but very kind and sweet as well! You can tell she is very caring. Accessible outside of class. Overall awesome lady and best econ prof I've ever had! Legend of the faculty.",1
"This class was kind of difficult in some parts. Dr. Sheridan is an amazing professor though, he's very passionate and insightful through his lectures. He gives 2 major tests (midterm and final) and 3 quizzes based on the 3 thematic books that he assigns.",1
"Jones is a great, no-nonsense teacher. Class consists of 1/2 lecture material and 1/2 book material. Lectures are engaging, visual, and informative. Her coverage of colonialism and other world conquests came across as a matter of fact, objective, and sober rather than hysterical. She inspired me to want to travel and learn more about the world!",1
"Steve is really nice and sweet.  he stutters and mumbles a lot. really easy class!  take home midterms, can retake them if needed.",0
Love this guy! He is such a nice teacher always taking the time to make sure everyone understands before moving on and explaining everything crystal clear! I wouldn't mind taking another math class with him,1
"he is not a good teacher, not helpful at all. he always asks you 10 questions when you ask him one question. and will not help you till you answer all those useless questions. he is anfair, and always helps only those looks like him.i think you fully understood what i mean.",0
"Insanely easy course. Pay attention during lectures and you'll do fine. Really likes questions and participation. There's a lot of homework, but they take like 5min and can be completed before even attending lecture most the time. If you have complicated questions/ concerns, TA's are usually more helpful than prof.",1
"My review is similar to everyone else's: Waid is all over the place. Her class held NO structure. She would keep hinting at exams but never had any dates. She would give assignments without due dates, kept changing the syllabus, and never finished a thought. She IS very brilliant at times BUT, even with that being said, I WOULD NOT take her again.",0
Dr. Henton is not a very understanding professor. She knows her stuff but she doesn't really know her students. I definitely don't recommend her as a prof.,0
She is the hardest teacher I have ever had. I spent on average 7-8 hours a week trying to learn and complete the material.  Every question on the test and quizzes is worded terrribly which is meant to trick and confuse you.  Every little mistake such as a comma error or a wrong parenthesis will result in almost all the points marked wrong. HARD!!!!,0
She's very knowledgeable herself but her marking is extremely strict and no matter what you do you wont end with the grade you wanted in the first place.,0
took the online class. Lectures were LONG. I studied lectures thoroughly at first but didnt find the first study guide which killed me on the first test. then i stopped watching his lectures and just studied the final study guide and aced the final. could have gotten a B but didnt know there were listening assignments. Dropped me down two grades.,0
Interested in what he's teaching and tries to make it interesting. However the midterm and final were near impossible and had little to no relevance to the course content he lectured about. ,0
Her bark is worse then her bite. Shes cool as long as you stay on her good side,1
"Best Prof! Lots of examples, interesting guest speakers. Gives good feedback on projects. Would take again.",1
"Pros- Khatun is a nice person. She is down to Earth and her jokes are funny in an odd way.Her quizzes are easy and homework is not too bad. The class is fun before it starts Cons- She tries to be serious when we are ""rowdy"" before class. There is a barrier on her English, makes it hard to understand her. And her homework grading is very picky.",0
"It was a challenging class, lots of material to remember. Practice midterm and final are not very helpful. The tests are harder, questions are tricky with 5 options to pick from and I think that was unnecessary. All answer choices are very similar to each other so that makes the tests even harder.",0
"I absolutely loved Jason's lectures, but this guy is a TOUGH grader. I was lucky to get a 71% on the midterm compared to the other scores in the class. I wish I would have known how important it was to ask questions and speak up in class before the end of the semester. Takes an extremely long time to grade assignments. Pick a good group for the sim",1
"Although because of his accent, it was hard to understand him sometimes.  He always posted his PP and wrote some of the notes.  Study the notes and you will do fine.  Don't try to read the book.  Going to the comp lab helps also.  you also learn alot about E-R diagrams.  Don't worry...take the class",1
"This was a great class for those that like to think. He gets you to really notice what is going on in the world. Test are not that hard, goes over material thouroughly and gives great notes.",1
"NEVER TAKE HER... EVER! She is evil! She does not help at all. She does not make time for her students. With homework, quizzes, and projects, she will tell you how to do it one way but grade completely different. She has made me cry on several occasions. She is very unorganized and an absolutely terrible teacher. ",0
"She is a very funny professor and always cracks jokes during her lectures. Her lectures are a little hard to follow but she posts everything online and always answers questions. Very nice and approachable lady. 3 tests all online and 1 final that is optional. Typical lecture, attendance is not mandatory and she often lets class out early :)",1
"It's been a while since I've taken classes math has always been my strongest subject. This class? Impossible. He was only available T,TH and would not make any other time to meet. I had a tutor and still struggled. I had to withdrawal from the class, but need it for my degree so I have to take it again. I would not recommend. SUNY Cortland",0
"This has been my worst teacher in my time at PCC. Schubert does not teach well at all. He does all the problems and lectures with his back to the class and by the time he turns around, he's completed the whole problem and blocked it. Anytime someone asks for help he either says, you should of learned it in the last math or go to tutoring. TERRIBLE!",0
I had him twice for my freshman year psych 101 and physiological psych. He gives u 75% of the test qs on the study guide and gives hella extra credit that can boost you up 4% points. Easy A in my opinion! also great teacher,1
Awesome teacher! Sweetest lady ever!,1
"She's all over the place and can't teach.  She says one thing one minute, and the next she's contradicting herself.  Not very helpful, and really doesn't like what you have to say.  Not prepared, and probably steals students translations for her own because her own suck.",0
"The lectures are really long, and the test are tough.",1
Bob is the best professor at ESF - he loves what he does and it shows,1
"I agree whole heartedly with the comment below. Prus is the worst educator I have had in my entire academic career. If people are failing midterms and finals it reflects the professor, not the students. He is unhelpful in every possible way, and the amount of information required for memorization for tests is riducilous. He should be FIRED",0
"O'Dea is a genuinely nice man who is interested in the well being of his students. In class he is funny and sarcastic but expects everyone to speak up and participate (does call on people). However, would not recommend his course if you're not willing to handle a big mark drop. He grades excessively hard for a first year course. ",1
"she's really easy going, fun teacher, nice class. her marking is lenient too. go for it!",1
"She's an alright teacher, not great not awful. Be prepared for lots of reading as the semester goes on and you have to read chapter books. She never posted any grades online the entire semester which was annoying because you can't tell how well you're doing and if you need to do something differently.",1
"Fun, charismatic, passionate about History, continues to learn more and for you to do the same. Never dull class!",1
Avoid her at any cost,0
"AWFUL. Heap accused 40+ students of cheating on an open note final exam because they looked up one question which he reworded so it wasnt in your text book. He never specified the parameters of to which degree of open note it was but he effectively failed all of those students. He is a bully, stubborn, and will not admit hes wrong.",0
Her class was a real struggle for me. You really have to keep reviewing the textbook she gives exams that cover alot of the book and that was my downfall. Doesn't really like to help students she wants you to figure it out on your own. As long as you try hard and she sees that you put effort into it you should be fine.,0
"One of UoG notable alumni, Tim takes great passion towards political science. His classes are well taught and if you can pay attention through a lecture you pass can with no problem. He is a overall charismatic prof that will give you extensions and a satisfactory grade. Any questions you have he'll greatly answer.",1
"Lectures are useless. He quizzes extremely hard. He is honestly ridiculous and an awful professor. Never let this man teach in a institution again. He must like proving his ""smartness ""over his students.",0
"The worst teacher I've ever had.  Was on track to get a low C, dropped it, and took it again with another instructor, and ended up with an A+.  Who in 2013 thinks it's ok to use a handwritten, self-published textbook? Word to the wise, talk to your department because MTH304 is equivalent for many, and taught by a much better prof.",0
Margo is Fabulous.,1
"Changed the grading scheme on the final exam (compared to the quizzes to deflate the marks). The reviews talking about the unsurprising exam are from before the exams got marked. Also if you miss a weekly quiz for a medical condition, go to the faculty. His ""taking it into consideration at the end"" is pretty meaningless.",0
"Its not hard, just do your work.",1
"The first week of classes I thought he was really mean and strict, but he became my favourite prof. He engages the class, and knows everybody's name. I learned so much in this class. He uses english to explain thoroughly which I found very helpful. Gamble is actually very friendly and makes you want to go to class and do well.",1
Professor Baker's class is a piece of cake.  You should always go to class though otherwise you will get very lost.  You never use the textbook.  She gives a lot of handouts.  She's happy too!,1
"Her lecture outlines are great! You know excatly what she is going to talk about. Readings are important; try to read b4 she talks to it. Sweet and nice. The course itself, not to much!",1
"I found Ketchen to be relatable, funny and a fair marker. The course is definitely not an easy A, but if you stay on top of your work, study and don't procrastinate, you'll be fine.  He does tend to ramble off a lot though so make sure you're only writing out the key information that he mentions in his lectures.",1
"Dr. Chen is overall a good guy. He's older and has a slight accent, but it's easily understandable and he talks slow. You MUST do the homework to pass, as you are only graded on quizzes/exams and a couple assignments. He is very willing to help you if need be, in fact he likes when people come to office hours. He is a very picky grader, though.",0
Not a great teacher. You will be teaching yourself. People dropped like flies in his class,0
He is an okay lecturer but not nearly all the material on the prelim is covered in lecture. There is no textbook reading so it can be hard to catch up if you don't understand something. He can be harsh in peer-led - tells people to erase their entire whiteboard or that they are gonna get a C on the prelim. He does care though I think. (Chem 2070),1
"This is the worst class, she makes you write 9 papers, learn 66 muscles & bones & if you miss one letter its wrong. The final was 63 ?s & confusing. HPEA stands for activity not nutrition, English, or nursing. She doesnt know how to teach that clas, its 2 creds not 4 were suppose to work out, you dont learn that part right Horrible class dont take",0
"His lectures are very boring and stale. His voice is monotone and makes you fall asleep. You should try to avoid him if you can. He also said that they would give us longer test times so that we could think about our answers better and that they would be similar in difficulty, which was a total lie in my opinion.",0
Most amazing prof at CMU. If you are going into education she will make you consider a minor in Middle Level. Very enthusiastic. Loves her job and students.,1
"Toms a character, but knowledgeable about what he teaches.",1
very passionate and knowledgable,1
"How on earth did this woman become chair of accounting at Ryerson? She should not be allowed to teach this course anymore. She literally called our class ""a bunch of twits"" right to our faces. No courtesy in the classroom. She frequently is rude when answering questions and is overall a very mean person to talk to. No wonder nobody asks for help",0
"Dr. Stranges is a special professor, so intelligent and knowledgeable. He makes the course interesting by showing how what happened in the past is related to what's happening today. He wants you to do well in the course. His tests are very hard but he adjusts the grades so that they are more normal.",1
"If you actually go to every class and listen to her attentively, she explains material clearly and you won't have to read the textbook at all! Her slides are great and she gives hand-written class notes with sufficient time to write them down. Her slides, in class notes, and study guide were enough for all exams. Exams were fair insofar you study!",1
"Easily the worst prof I've ever had. Not sure what was going through his mind when he realized he was going to teach. He can't string a sentence together without stumbling, coughing and spitting over every word. Slides? When he's in class he's constantly shuffling between them. Mix that with his incoherent speech and you're not learning anything.",0
Extremely helpful. Unorganized at times.,1
"Not a super hard class as long as you do the work, the work is confusing as hell. His website looks like a third grader learning how to use the highlight text tool on word for the first time, and there are way to many links.",1
"Dr Costanza gives a fail-proof lecture in World Religion. You have a whole week to complete two short assignments, and some weeks there's only one assignment. A couple easy, short writing pieces, a brief anthropological study, and you're on your way to an A! A passionate teacher, but often unforgiving about missing class or work.",1
"Overall, not the best professor to teach this course. No matter how many hours youve spent on studying for each exam, she will word the questions differently, making you second guess yourself. She wont give clear answers whenever a student will ask a question or wont answer it at all. Tips: Make a study guide in advance & read the textbook.",0
"This teacher doesn't teach and is difficult to understand. I learn more by reading the textbook during class than by whatever problems he's going over on the board. His homework solutions to his assignments are never right, either. I tried to drop the class immediately after the syllabus day, and couldn't. Highly recommend taking another teacher.",0
I found Paddy Smith to be a very engaging and approachable professor. and because of his passion for the subject matter he was able to give that back to his students. He has a great sense of humor ( always wearing hightops and shorts). his textbook could use some editing however.,1
I really enjoyed the class!,1
"My first impression of Dr. Clark was that he was really hard to hear, even in a small class, which made it hard to stay awake in class and take notes. I also had a hard time figuring out what to take notes on (answer: anything he writes on the white board). He grew on me, though. Very funny and caring! Just wouldn't recommend as a professor.",1
Such a horrible class and teacher!,0
"Team business simulation was fun, but we had members who did not pull weight. Points system he uses does not fairly reflect that. Possible 575, and only 20 reflect team support. Two of us worked tirelessly, and other two got gifted 117 points for our work. Unfair system. Directions on assignments left much to be desired as well.",0
"Kim Smith is honestly one of the best math teachers I've ever had! You can tell she genuinely cares about her students and wants them to succeed and really get the material. She does review sessions before the exams, and she's always there to help whether it be email or by appointment. She's very easy to learn from, just make sure to attend class.",1
"Amazing teacher, really fun and cares about his students and what we talk about. He may change how he does things depending on how the class is going and how the students are doing. Beware he wants students to think outside of the box and will not allow you to gang up on him and blame him.",1
I hated every second of this class. I studied HOURS AND HOURS and still earned mediocre grades because the professor asked extremely specific question in exams. This made me extremely frustrated the entire semester. DO NOT take this class,0
"Very tough teacher. Awkward, but insanely smart. His class is heavily based on students producing in-depth philosophical essays that are short and straight to the point. If you can't, then this class (and professor) isn't for you. ",0
"There was so much busy work for such a stupid class. We had two major assignments for the semester, one she only gave us a week to complete it in. Her instructions were unclear and if you didn't give her exactly what she wanted, she'd give you an awful grade. Also - Don't buy the book. I haven't used it once. Waste of $80. Waste of a class.",0
He gives great lectures and knows what he is talking about but miss a class or forget your work and the class gets hard.. ,1
"Stay far far away from this teacher. She does not care about her students at all, it's almost like she wants us to fail. Her tests don't match the curriculum and she feels no remorse for the class's failing averages on these ridiculous exams and quizzes she conjures up. In her mind, she is perfect and we are all, and I quote, ""brain dead"".",0
"Uncle Bijan is knowledgeable and is truly passionate about his lectures. With that being said, he lectures for 2.5 hours straight with 0 visual aids. He allows for a small 5 minute break in between but trust me, it isnt enough. This class was unbearable and I would not recommend it.",1
"Dr. Miller's class was entertaining and really interesting.  Class is not easy, material is dense, but if you take good notes and study what he says you'll do fine.  He is great and willing to help if you go in for office hours.  If you need a refresher before the exam, he posts topics as podcasts.  Take Psych 1100 with Dr. Miller if you can!",1
One of the two best teachers I've had at Knox,1
"Honestly, this is a intro to history and she makes it complicated. There were so many people who withdrew this class, that is how bad it is. She gives you 10 chapters and says ""study."" No study guide, just 10 1-PAGE Focus Questions to study with 14 questions each. You can study, but if you do not have a photographic memory, good luck bro.",0
"Great professor! He is so nice and helpful. It's an easy A for Finance 300 compared to other professors!  There are only three exams  that are all based off  the lecture notes.  Just come to class, and make sure to sit in the front to read his writing well.",1
"Smart,yet totally humble and approachable.  Seems like a really kind, decent guy who really wants his students to learn.  If only some other profs were this into their work!",1
Hand Down one of the best Math professors at El Camino. I recommend him to anyone. He is really good at explaining Math concepts in a way that easy to understand. Most quizzes are take home and in-class quizzes he lets you rework the problems you got wrong for half credit. 2 Exams which consist of a take home and in-class portion.,1
"SOOOO BORING! class discussions have nothing to do with the tests. tests are easy to BS, but requires some reading. i fall asleep everything i'm in his class. attendence is taken 5%.",1
"I haven't taken a course by her yet, but when one comes up, I will. She knows me by name, and we've only talked a couple of times. Her office is always open, and she drops everything just to talk you through a problem. She is great! Makes University feel like someone actually cares about the individual for who they are.",1
dont take her...drop if you got her,0
"He doesn't speak clearly a majority of the time so it's difficult to understand him as he almost whispers the lectures. If you ask a question, he doesn't really answer it well. As for the class, he doesn't explain well and what he discusses in class is not what he quizzes on. I honestly, go to class for the attendance and go home and teach myself.",0
she is the sweetest! if you need psych 1 Dr. Guimberteau is the one ya'll.,1
I had him for an interim class and it was awesome! I would definitely have taken him for a semester class if i had the opportunity.,1
"This class was not on Canvas. Once given the syllabus you cannot lose it because the assigned readings are on it and not posted anywhere else. The prof does not respond to your emails. Grading criteria is not clear. Lectures are not helpful. TA's are the only helpful ones. I feel I didn't learn anything. Boring, looked up every term on google.",0
just say no.,0
I took Professor Gomez online class and he was AWFUL!! I sent so many emails to him that went completely unanswered. Not responsive to online students WHATSOEVER!!!! Stay away from this man!,0
"Best biochem professor, although I believe he's retiring soon.  The homework he gives you has unlimited attempts to get 100% and lets you go back and do it for practice before exams.  Gives you practice exams and awesome lecture notes.  This isn't an easy class, but he's your best shot at getting an A.",1
Loved this class!,1
He's very funny and awesome teacher !!!!,1
"so i dont think he even knows what hes teaching--and youll learn alot about the indian res. in south dakota. hes a nice guy, very friendly...but you will be itching to get out of class...and dont expect to really know what a liberal education is.  no tests or anything- but theres a ton of reading.  for lib, hes your best bet",1
"Do you like literature for its sterile, esoteric, and uninteresting qualities? You may very well love Bill McKelvy. He doesn't get you excited about what you're reading; he prefers to read passages a hundred times trying to, say, deconstruct the color red, or some obscure Latin quotation. Values ten cents words and pretentiousness over heart.",0
"Honestly, he's a blast to have. Even if the material was dry, I always enjoyed his lectures since he was SO kind and engaging. I hate that his classes have 4 tests, but also thankful that he drops one :') Thank you for being a fair prof who genuinely wants their students to succeed and get a good grade.",1
Very helpful if you just ask. Very interested in what she's teaching which makes it more exciting to learn about. Also involved in student groupsorganizations outside of class so she's a great one to be on the good side of! ,1
"Very nice guy, but you will have no idea what to expect each class. Hard to understand with accents. It's not hard material, but he barely teaches anything. His classes are more life lessons than actual Spanish. He stopped teaching entirely once we went online with the virus and just gave us easy assignments. Easy A if you've ever taken Spanish.",1
"Her lectures were very short and confusing, follow by time in class to work on example problems in small groups for a grade. Your small group is basically your teacher! If you land in a bad group, you will have a hard time. However, she does give many opportunities to improve the grades of your tests and quizzes, which is the only reason I passed.",1
God bless Dr. Burkhart,1
"She's a nice person but has incredibly boring lectures. The information is very spotty and oddly specific at points that it's practically useless. There are no tests and you can do the papers without the lectures. Easy to get a B+ or A-, but you have to do well on the term paper to get an A (you get a rewrite). Also, don't buy the books.",0
Insincere and rude prof,0
He is professional. But his teaching skill is the problem obviously.,0
"Do not take this professor, he has a very dry sense of humor and is EXTREMLY BORING.  There is 1 paper that is 50% of the grade and if it isn't EXACTLY how he wants it you get a bad grade.  If you can avoid taking do it.",0
Absolutely best prof I've ever had. A few weeks into the course I changed my major to communication (I'm in third year) because of how interesting she made everything seem. Attendance is necessary as participation marks is a big part of the final grade. Read the material and understand what she teaches and you'll get an A. Would 100% take again.,1
"Wasn't a difficult class. Easy to pass if you read the chapters. All exams and quizzes are multiple choice, and straight from the book. Classes are a waste, but you have to go to take the quizzes at the end. He rambles about irrelevant things, doesn't even touch topics that we're supposed to be learning. Also rude to students.",0
"Dr. Kovatcheva was the BEST French teacher to have for 101. I came into this class with five years of French experience, so it was already extremely easy. But the few times I was confused, she is SO SO SO helpful. I would highly recommend her for anyone who is new to the French language. She is so sweet and fair. TAKE HER.",1
"She knows what she is talking about. She is actually a bit of an expert in her field. But as a professor? Run. You need to put in 100% to do ok. Miss class? You're done. Dont come prepared? You're done. Very into the ""public shaming"" concept, if you aren't prepared she will call you out. This CORE course is just not worth dealing with her. Avoid.",0
"I am currently in Dinse's PSC 341 class and it sucks.  I never realized lectures could be this boring.  He is mono-tone, never makes eye contact with the students, and is just plain rood.  He is a socialist liberal, and if you are anything other than liberal, he looks down on you.  DO NOT take him!!",0
"If you want to take a self taught class this is the one for you. She posts the assignments at the beginning of the course and other than getting grades, once in a while, there is no real interaction. No group discussions. Disorganized materials. Hard to keep motivated. ",0
AVOID HIM AT ALL COST. Do not take his class you will regret it for sure.,0
Don't miss any assignments or labs and you should get a good grade.,1
"I took characteristics online. TOUGH. There's a lot due every week including a quiz. YOU HAVE TO READ THE TEXTBOOK TO PASS THE QUIZZES. The quiz questions aren't easy. I wouldn't say it's a super hard class, but it's not an easy A like a lot of Kent's online classes.",1
He was a great teacher! I loved his class and he helped everyone individually so no one got behind. Just over all a great professor.,1
"She seemed like a nice enough woman, but just not that great of a professor. No matter how many lectures I went to, and how many hours I studied, I still ended up getting a low grade on the quizzes that you have every class. All of your grade is basically tests.",0
she is a nice lady but her directions are often unclear. Her tests are all online but have a short time limit and sometimes the material on the tests is not what was covered in class. There is one speech during the semester. You can manage to get an A in this class especially since she gives a lot of extra credit but i honestly didn't learn much,0
"Great teacher, but can be confusing at times. He often makes mistakes but his test are easy as long as you go to recitation and look over the review sheet. He basically gives all the answers. Had him for bioelectronics as well. same review. easy but makes mistakes in class.",1
"There are no pop quizzes, but 2 clicker questions every class that make up 15% of your grade based on accuracy. It's hard because they're based on the reading which is over 30 pages so I ended up just guessing because it wasn't worth reading and getting the answer wrong anyway. He's very passionate about history but a 3 hour class is death.",1
"VERY BORING. class moves very slow even though material is easy. Could do the lecture in half the time but it drags. Allows one absence. Does a lot of group work during class that is pointless. Discussions, no textbook, essays, group projects. SO BORING and she is kind of confusing ",0
"Overall, Howell is a mediocre professor. Decent lecturer, but you'll have to study outside of labs to keep up with the material. That's important because his exams make up a big portion of the points in the class, and knowing the material and how it all works helps tremendously. Start homework assignments early!",1
Do not take him His class is really hard to follow One moment you are in chapter 1 next thing you know you are in chapter 7 then 12 and back to 1 He uses lots of Math that you don't even need and use His homework are crazy long and difficult You will learn nothing in his class except frustration. Books wont help neither will your math U will Fail,0
He was extremely boring. I could barely keep my eyes open. I would try to not get him as a prof if you can pick. He is super nice just not a great teacher.,0
Mr. Cage doesn't know the material he is teaching in this class.  He is disrespectful to his students.  His tests are hard and he gives no guidance on what to study for.  He is not teaching the curriculum.,0
This class was more like a honors level course. The class was completely unbearable and it didn't help that the professor was extremely not helpful. She had no idea what she was talking about. She assigns way to much hw. Way too many papers are handed out. And journals for a math class!?,0
I think that the best way to describe this professor is mediocre. I felt that he was not the best at lecturing and being clear about what we needed to know. He kind of rushes through topics and can be difficult to understand. One AWESOME thing that he does though: index card during test and good test reviews! Also he takes attendance.,0
"She messed up point values for assignments alot, and emailed us about eight times a week. The hardest part was the class time was pointless but she took attendence, and you lose 5 points everytime you miss class.",0
"Wolffe's class is tough, but you will learn.  Expect to work very hard if you want an A.  You will learn more than a lot of other classes combined.  IF you're afraid of a B, take this class C/NC",1
"Metcalf is not a good professor at all. His lectures do not clearly explain the material well. He teaches as if the students already know the material and doesn't go in depth enough. His exams are also incredibly hard for no reason. Instead of preparing us well for the exams, he spends more time telling us what to know , instead of explaining it.",0
"This class is very boring. The prof. is very scatterbrained during lecture and it is difficult to follow which topics go with which headings on the powerpoint. Tests are possible, but you must study and you need to do the readings to get an A. I wouldn't recommend this class with him.",0
"Stopped going to class midway through the semester. Got an A. Self study, learn from the TAs and online, and you'll be fine.",0
Explains everything pretty clearly. Very helpful in office hours. Doesn't look at you when he's talking. Tests and assignments are very fair and straightforward.,1
Great class and professor.  Pay attention and you will be fine.,1
"Great prof, super funny. The course itself is pretty heavy on material, but he makes it bearable and explains it pretty well. His notes aren't the best, but not too bad. Most of his test questions are repeated from years before so get your hands on some old tests. Participation doesn't matter but he gives A LOT of hints if you go to class.",1
"Listen for nonart majors, this class will kill your GPA if you think oh that's an easy A. He's rude and tough grader. I took an upper-level painting class and got an A, this is a 1000 level class and he gave me a C?? this class makes no sense like is this even art ?He's too demanding someone needs to put him in his place cause it's 1000 level class",0
"Great teacher who really cares about his students! I had him for english 101. Pretty good at sarcasm. He is a VERY difficult grades but will help you if you ask for it. Great for English majors and teachers. You NEED to attend his class. All quizzes are open book and fairly simple. There are no tests, only essays and one oral presentation.",1
I really enjoyed this class with Professor Druffel. She is very clear about what material is actually needed for exams and is very flexible with meeting students to talk about course material. Overall a very sweet person.,1
"Professor Gibson means well, but is disorganized. It's not a straight forward so focus. ",0
"I wouldn't take this class if you don't have to. I found lectures to be boring and non stimulating. Material on Islam made class hard to follow, espec. with names and Arabic words. Graded on 2 midterms (1000 c. each), a 12 page term paper, and a 1000 c. final. Didn't take notes all year, got B's on all my papers. Not the worst class but unenjoyable",0
Reviews are close to the exam material. Lectures are important. Easy A if you study all the homework and review questions,1
"Great teacher, helps his students as much as possible, and if you put effort forth, it is not hard to receive an A.",1
"There are six quizzes required, but your top five quizzes are kept and counted for your final grade. He also gives you the opportunity to better your grade at the end of the semester by having three optional extra credit essays. I wouldn't say that the work and quizzes are easy; if you don't read his lectures it will show in your grade.",1
really hard class. lectures are irrelevant to midterms and final. midterms and final contain unseen problems,0
"I absolutely hated this class and the professor.  His tests are horrible and super hard.  The fact that he does not give detailed study guides doesn't help study for his tests.  If you are the type of person who does not test well, but makes up for your grade by extra credit and homework, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.  Hated this class.",0
"CHEM 112 IS THE WORST COURSE AT QUEENS. Mombourquette seems like a nice guy but really he'd rather be anywhere than with chem 112. Be prepared to teach yourself the entire course, and make friends so you can do the lab write ups together because they arn't hard just extremely tedious and frequently unclear.",0
He consistently blames students for not doing the reading and then just lectures from the readings. He fails to follow any modern teaching techniques such as using PowerPoints or guided notes. He also gave no feedback and grades were not shown until the final exam.,0
"amazing professor with an in-depth view, i highly encourage you to take her. I learned a lot the text-book and attendance go hand in hand for getting through the class. Works with you not against you. Exams are cumulative  based on readings no trick qu's.",1
"Single-handedly ruined the first semester of the MBA program for me. Gives out tonnes of work to the point everyone got frustrated and got sick of the course within weeks. Industry assignment of 10000+ words. Is not representative of a Ryerson prof, he should be fired but he has tenure that he makes sure to rub in your face. End this hell.",0
"This is an easy class to pass, only if it is your ONLY class. She overloads you with work and in my opinion tries for force this stuff down your throat. I am sure she has good intentions but this felt more like a high school instructor than a college professor. I feel bad even saying this because I am sure she means well.",1
The man knows physics and has interesting ways to relate it to class; but he is popous and arrogant. He doesn't use enough class time teaching the material that will make you successfull. And will tell you not to take notes but it will be in the homework.,1
"Maojoudi is a really funny teacher, he has a sense of humor. His tests on the other hand, are SUPER EASY. His tests are basically the study guide so just review that, he also lets you have a cheat sheet. Homework and quizzes are a little heavy in this class. I depended on tutoring to help me pass this class. Basically a self teach class. GOOD LUCK.",1
"Dana is one of the best professors I've had so far. I took his class as a hybrid and that was a good decision. He's a really funny guy and he will try his best to make sure you pass. Hes also the type of person that if you look confused, he won't leave you out and ask you if you get the material. hybrid MA110 with Him best class i have ever taken.",1
Took him for Brit Lit. LISTEN TO THESE REVIEWS! he is pretty boring but has his own sense of humor that is sweet sometimes. for papers WRITE THEM THE WAY HE WOULD DO IT. if you don't you WILL GET A LOW GRADE. not a difficult class but you can't have your own opinion.,0
"I don't understand why people keep saying he doesn't use the textbook. He won't TELL you it's coming straight from the book, but if you have some incentive, you'll find everything there.  Cynical, but I took the class to learn, not worry about his opinions. He's a GENIUS and his lectures reflect that. If you get lost ASK. Loved him and his class.",1
He's not very accessible outside class and he's not very good with technology which was especially bad because I took his class online. He also fails to communicate clearly both in lectures and with just information like when tests are or how the class is going to work.,0
She is the most hate-inspired woman I have ever dealt with and that is not an exaggeration by any means.  I absolutely despise this woman and cannot understand how she's still got a job.,0
"I took Professor Ferrero for Biology and she was amazing. She lectures every class and there's a presentation due at the end of the semester. She's really nice and understanding and she always explains to you if you need help. Tests are okay, not too bad, I usually got a B. Study the review!",1
"STAY AWAY! This man is just plain mean. Not only is he mean though, but he doesn't teach anything in class. He mostly talks about himself, and not about course material. Tests are hard (probably because he didn't teach anything).",0
Avoid this professor. He doesn't realize that his students are not at the same intellectual level as him. Lectures are grad level physics classes and he covers stuff that doesn't exist in any textbook. He probably derived them all himself. Don't trust the textbook sections he posts for exam review he throws those together without verifying content.,0
Brian Phillips was one of my favorite professors this semester. He is very intimidating on the first day but dont let him scare you away. The way he teaches is extremely entertaining and makes you pay attention. Your grade in the class is based off 2 tests and the final. I highly recommend taking him for this class,1
I'm not sure why Prof. Bruckert's ratings aren't higher. Genuinely enjoyed the class. She made sure to keep it relevant and introduce current events into our lectures. 2 really easy midterms and a final paper that requires no outside research. Definitely would take her again!,1
"Never in my whole life have I dreaded a class more than this one. He lectures for years and puts up these power points with bullet points that make no sense. He only gives exams, no quizzes, no projects, no homework, nothing. So if you do bad on the exams then good luck!",0
The clarity with which he expresses ideas is unmatched. You will learn a ton and have a great time doing it. Honestly the best professor or teacher I have had in my life.,1
"He knows his material and he's a personable & friendly teacher. He's a lil oldschool. Do your readings, stay on top of even the small assignments. Grading system is really weird & weighed oddly, so don't come in expecting the normal kind of grading scale or that you know your grade w/o asking him.",1
One of the best professors I have had thus far. He is very kind and his lectures are extremely interesting. It is very important that you show up to class because he passes attendance sheets down the rows and the tests are solely based on lectures. Great class and never really had homework. Grade is just based on exams.,1
"Maureen is a very hard marker! This course is a lot of work and participation counts! I suggest not skipping a single class and keeping up with the large amount of readings. If you want to do well, make sure you talk about feminism.. she will talk forever about that topic! Expect over three quarters of the class to drop this course by the end.",0
I'm currently in this class and it was a big mistake. Teacher goes off topic the whole time. At first its funny but it gets uncomfortable. Have no idea how the exam is going to go and i find learning in this class is difficult to grasp because there is not much emphasis on it. Please do not take this class. Learn elsewhere.,0
"easy money for him with no effort since he doesnt teach. Each week he post a few brief videos made in 2018 showing him working on problems, with no context. we have to post in the forum if we dont get it, only to just get answers from him or student with no explanation. just the answer... u learn nothing. lots of test not enough time to finish",0
"Tests are REALLY difficult. There are 4 tests and some quizzes throughout the semester. Homework is not mandatory but definitely suggested. The teacher makes many minor mistakes while teaching and even in his final review study guide key, so watch out for those! Lectures are somewhat easy to follow but tests are difficult.",0
"It was an online class, so I'll give her the benefit of the doubt. She curved the final by 10 points, but when it's worth 50% of the class, that doesn't do much. You can find a better, more caring professor willing to work with you",0
"Very wise and helpful, dedicated to his job and widely respected by all the English majors I know.",1
He is a great lecturer. His classes are a little strange but he makes calc easy. He is super clear and fair. ,1
"Westgate uses lecture time to talk trash about her neighboring Accounting professor, her past students, her colleagues, the Dean and proudly uses what I'd assume to be private conversations as examples. although she appears to be caring, you'd really have to be one of her favorites. the grading scheme and expectations are unclear. AVOID!!!",0
She is amazing. She is so thorough in all her notes. She gets all the points across. Have to attend all her classes through. Missing a day will hurt you.,1
"Mr. Richardson is a good guy, but his lectures are extremely boring. Sometimes it's really hard to figure what is important and what is not because he will go off track in his lectures. The material he gives us for the tests is unorganized, but if you can organize your notes for exam time, the tests are a fairly easy A.",1
This professor is horrible. He doesn't respond to emails and the tests don't correspond with the material in the book. A test will say it's over Chapters 7-9 and really have questions from multiple different chapters.,0
Class assignment very disorganised but she really cares about her students and loves to interact.,1
I stopped going to lectures because she did not give any more information than the textbook and homework quizzes did. She does not make her own exams or powerpoints and gets them from the website that the textbook and homework are on. She does not show up for exam days and TAs grade everything. Easy class if you do the homework.,0
"One of the best teachers I have ever had. Doesn't make students memorize meaningless information like most teachers.  He teaches you how it is in the real world. Classes are more of a discussion than a lecture  Open book tests,  and his grading is very fair.",1
"I called the Vatican to nominate Professor Young for sainthood, sadly the pope wouldn't take my call.  That said, Professor Young is amazing.  Great stories, cares about the topics and really wants to engage you.  Do yourself a favor though and participate in class, he isn't there to hear himself speak and will call you out.",1
"1 paper, 1 midterm 1 final. gave us the questions for the final before hand. midterm was take home. Super easy class, show up and your good. Tells stories doesn't like when you come in late though. I'd recomment this class to anyone.",1
Awesome prof!,1
"I have no idea why her ratings are not very good. I was honestly pretty scared heading into the class, but it was enjoyable and if you put in effort you will get an A. 7 exams every other week, and one big film paper. If you fill out the study guide and read the textbook there is no reason you should not get an A.",1
"Great professor, no doubt. One of the best ones in the CJ Field.",1
Don't listen to any of the negative reviews. Garyen Chong is the best biology professor at Langara and he is a very fair and lenient marker. Read the textbook and you will succeed.,1
"Easily the worst professor I've had during my entire college career (I'm a senior). Avoid at all costs. Random grading procedures, boring lectures, and useless textbooks. A giant waste of 15 weeks and three credits.",0
"Boulding is very knowledgeable in her field, but just isn't great at teaching.  She assumes you already know concepts, and her lecture notes are so inconsistent and scattered.  I took this course as an elective and regretted it.  The short answer tests were hard because she looked for specific words rather than general concepts. ",1
"Professor Sauter is a truly amazing guy. I've had him for two courses now and I cannot speak more for his character or his teaching methods. Really a great person all around. If you take a class with him be sure to participate, it's to your benefit!",1
"Professor Mizell is more into current events than the actual material you need for the class. You might as well take this online before you take her because nothing you do in here is relevant to the essays you turn in. She's constantly wanting to start a debate. Also, she has never once replied to any of my emails. If possible take someone else.",0
Dr. Peck is amazing. He truly cares for students LEARNING and is willing to slow down and alter how he is teaching to accommodate that. If you have the chance to take a class with him TAKE IT you definitely won't regret it. He makes class enjoyable and interactive. I loved this class!!,1
"She is very opinionated and if your opinion isnt hers, its wrong. Make sure to do exactly as she asks, or you wont do well. No matter how bad you think your writing is, if its how she wants it, youre fine. NOT recommended",0
"An easy class to get your writing intensive requirement out of the way. Attendance is 20% of your grade and the classes are pretty boring if you're not a GEO major. Two big papers with four smaller ones in between. Try hard on them and follow the requirements, you'll get an A.",1
"-usually has over 100 students in his class -he hates students arriving late, even 5 mins late -history teacher with the most personality in the school -there are 2 classes per week with him and one with his student assistant where you read a short story and talk about it. -exams occur every 3 short stories, 50 multiple choice and 1 essay",1
"I'm sure that somewhere in his head he has a clear picture of what's going on. It never leaves his head. Prepare for unclear lectures, notes that go back and forth between unrelated topics, and assignments where you can't even be sure of what to turn in. He couldn't explain anything to save his life.",0
"This is the worst class I have ever taken. She locked down my final semester grade before she had graded everything yet. Suddenly I ended up with a C instead of a B. She never replied any emails, dont even bother to try to email her, she wont respond. Give you bunch of videos to watch. You can find them on youtube and teach yourself.",0
"Hes not a good lecturer at all. Nothing he says makes sense and when it does he makes it needlessly confusing. I didnt even bother attending lectures after the first two months and I still got an A, showing how useless it actually is. Do the readings and youll be fine. Hes just so BORING and pompous",0
"Dr. Hon is an EASY grader. Easy quizzes, essays, and exams. His lecture style is to talk about the background of books and then to lead a class discussion. If you don't read before class, you will gain less from the class. To pass, or to gain from the class, that's your optional decision.",1
"Class was taught by a host of professors but was led by Tang.  Tests were very interpretive and had many confusing questions on them with the (d) and (e) answers almost always saying, ""A and B"" and ""B and C.""  Tests seemed to be made in an attempt to trick students.  Tang is knowledgeable, but tough",1
"Unless you know everything about Jazz before taking his class, DO NOT TAKE IT. He doesn't write anything on the board. He'll say something one time under his breath and then put it on the test. He only grades you by three tests that he doesn't prepare you for. When asked for extra help, he ignores and tries hard to not be there for his students.",0
"It's ridiculous how such a professor is allowed to teach as he does at Kettering. The classwork is a joke, tests are just questions from assignments, and it's possible to get 120% in the class if you do the extra credit stuff. All you have to do is put up with about an hour's worth of babbling twice a week at worst.",0
I don't think anyone likes her. She's mean and rude. She'll cut you off during your speech to correct you instead of letting you finish. If you choose a topic for a speech there's no way she'll let you change it. She has favorites and I'm not one of them.,0
"If i knew she only graded tests i would just never took this math class. She's such a sweet lady, but the way she lectures is extremely fast with no in depth explanation. were assigned homework but never get graded for it. I wouldn't take her if you have a  hard time with math",0
Needs a sense of humor.... not the kind that insults others,0
He is extremely thorough. He makes sure that you understand every step. He is great at understanding the Philadelphia market. I appreciate his honesty. I am an adult student who wants to make a living in this area.,1
"He talks about movies. He's a cool guy, but his class is so hard as he's not clear. His study guides are so unclear, he doesn't even give out study guides actually he just says things ??? anyways a lot of homework and i dont recommend taking him :/",0
"I took his Constitutional Law class and it was slightly difficult. That being said he is an incredibly fair grader on top  of being very helpful. The class is set up like a simulation court and you will have lots of writing and cases to argue. It sounds boring, but it's a lot of fun. There aren't a lot of points so stay on top of the assignments.",1
"In my opinion this is a really challenging class. I did go to tutoring for it, which helped a lot. He is very strict about attendance and thinks that coming to class should be your top priority. There are only two test the whole year but he gives out a ton of extra credit. The extra credit is defiantly not easy but it will really help your grade.",0
"What's supposed to be maybe 3 hours of work per week turns into 10, all just to scrape the bottom of the barrel for a C. This is a 100 level class that he treats like a 400 level and teaches it with the most monotone and unhelpful tone. There is no room for error and he assigns LOTS of reading from a very difficult book to grasp. Beware.",0
"Before I start, I'd like to say I'm actually sorry to give such a bad rating. She's a nice person, very friendly, and she really does try. That being said, she is a horrible professor, mainly due to the fact that she doesn't cover the important things enough. She'll cover 1 topic for an hour, and the 10 minute topic at the end will be 95% of the ex",0
Takes a simple excel course and takes it way too seriously and gossips with the TAs during the lab. Subjective marking,0
"He is amazing, and I would recommend people to take him. Very understanding, and works great with his students. Lets you use notecards on tests.",1
Very Nice Professor. Kind and Caring,1
Benson is tough. No getting around it. But his lectures are fascinating - he makes history a story. I was never once bored in class. He grades hard. If you are terrible with punctuation and grammar you will never pass a test or paper. Not a class if you want an easy A,1
"Great teacher, she will teach in such a way that everyone understands the content. She is easy to work with, she understands ""life happens"". I will be having her for English 102 in the spring.",1
One of the hardest classes I have ever taken. Homework is expected to be done in extreme detail. He is extremely knowledgeable and knows what he's talking about but you need perfect notes and perfect worksheets to get a near decent grade. Tests are ridiculously hard as well. He expects you to spend 15-20 hours a week on this class so be aware.,0
"Every class was professor Amey talking about random stories that kind of relate to the slides. He gave random pop quizzes almost every other class which were fill-in-the-blank with no word bank on really specific details that he didn't mention in class. I asked him my grade and he said ""he didn't know"". He's nice but doesn't know what hes doing",1
"god this lady is the devil, simon cowel of the speech word. everything you do is wrong, even if its right. NEVER take this lady.",0
"I have taken this professor for ENC 1101 and 1102. I would do it again if I could. He is very interesting and clear about what he expects. If you have a problem or question, he makes himself available whether it's meeting during office hours or through email. I have a lot of respect for him and I am glad I took his class.",1
This class was super annoying I took it in the fall the software was so outdated and is required for the course it cost 100 dollars and you have to do the exercises that are graded in the software and extra credit practice work. All his questions are so specific the exams are proctored and u have to have a book of questions. This class was a pain!,0
"I have a 4.0 GPA. I am a Mathematics major. It's just my thing and I get A's in all of my Math classes. That being said, looking back at when I took this guy, he is absolutely horrible. If you want to fail or work a ridiculous amount of hours a week for a C take him. He loves to play ""who is smarter"" with the class. Really not cute.",0
"Ask a simple question, get a complicated answer to three questions you didn't ask. Avoids answering questions so he doesn't have to admit not knowing.",0
I took him years ago and went on to get my PhD. and I'll have to say that off all my professors this man was the greatest.,1
"The only way to not pass this class is if you don't do the work. The lectures are laid out and she goes through them thoroughly with opportunity for questions. She responds promptly to emails and gives feedback. There are group projects involved, but again just do the work. She is very helpful.",1
"stay away if possible, he sends 50 emails instead of using D2L and wonders why there's so much confusion. He thinks teaching the course by pointing at a screen with his notes from 2002 is good enough. Doesn't know how to use an iclicker but could probably code one. ""teach this to the family cat"" ""Its not rocket science folks"" ""thx"" ""cheers""",0
Homework every class containing about 20 questions. Each assignment takes about an hour to complete. Couldn't fully understand his demos.,0
I once had a prof come to class high and spend the whole hour roasting another student who came in late. I would rather take another class with her then sit through another one of Tremblays dull-ass lectures!,0
"I won't deny his intelligence. But he could care less about teaching. After whole semester he still does not know anyone's name (class of 20). I've been called 4 different names. If you don't agree with his view, he'll grade harsh on you. Professors like him made thinking illegal.",0
"only take this class if your hands are immune to muscle cramps....because you will be taking notes non-stop and you won't be doing anything else. she was unhelpful and boring. she knows her history well, but she has no teaching skills and isn't very understanding of different learning styles.",0
"Put in all the work, went and visited him during office hours, and had already previously taken calc and still got my only C in college. Was a nice guy but my grade did not reflect what I should have gotten in the class",0
Vogel is hilarious! He is very helpful and lets your class make your own final if its small enough. Very helpful and good at giving examples to farthur explain topics. Cares about you and how well you do!,1
"He is very personable and excited about math. However, in class, he elaborates on tangents that do not exactly assist in understanding, and by the time you have lost focus, he brings the lecture back to his point. I am good with math, but could not follow his information at all. He grades very hard on his tests. I got more information from the net.",0
Unbelievable. Left class for a dentist appointment and expected us to sit around and wait for over an hour for him to get back.,0
I absolutely HATED this class with a passion. The tests are all multiple choice but nothing that you studied for is on the exam.  I complained about him to the chairman of economics and he told me that even he agrees that he isn't the greatest.  DO NOT TAKE!!,0
DO THE PRACTICE PROBLEMS!!! make sure you understand all of the dgd material too. The course is really hard but hallett explains everything really well. Study all the time and you can succeed,1
"one of bestest profs ever, <3 muchly, TAKE HIM",1
"Kirk is kind of entertaining, but he likes to call students out a lot. He is willing to help students after class, but he does not fully teach the material in class. He also does not give a lot of homework, but that is harmful in Calc II.",1
"He seems like a nice guy but it seems as if he does not want his students to do well in his class. We just completed an assignment that gave very little instruction, and I learned a majority of what was expected by watching videos from his office hour sessions with other students. Did not give any feedback on what we did wrong for the assignment.",0
"Barcley is quite focused on experiential learning methodology. His book choices are from the Lean Start-up gurus with a focus on current epistles from Eric Ries and Steve Blank. Absolute enjoyed trip to Chicago for Hyde Park Angels seminar. However, I do not share his love of Apple technology, Android is fine.",1
"Worst prof I have had to date. Knowledge is so in-depth and concepts needed to understand what he is talking about are not taught, they are expected to already know. If you have endless amount of time to dedicate to the course you would do fine.",0
"One of the worst teachers I have ever experienced at MCC. She chooses favorites and is a beast to everyone else. Belittles less favorite students and offers privet study groups to her favorites. Assignment directions are confusing, her tests are a joke (completely off topic), she becomes angry when students ask to clarify directions. ENOUGH SAID...",0
"This guy definately knows what he is talking about when he speaks, but often times he conveys his knowledge in a way that is not so clear and easy to jot down. However, able students shouldn't have a problem as long as they show up to class.",0
This professor doesn't like late people.  I showed up to class late a few quarters ago and she docked about 20% off of my homework.  I was only 10 minutes late due to traffic.  Completely ridiculous and unfair.,0
"Best person to learn geography from because he has lived all around the world.  Very nice, and keeps you engaged during lectures.  I wouldn't recommend the front row however, because he gets up close and personal.  He has a very easy point grading system and offers extra credit often, sometimes just because his football team won!",1
"At the first class she started spontaneously yelling about how fascinating she found the texts. There isn't a lot of coursework and she's a decent marker, but her lectures are monotonous and loud. If you want a decent mark, take this class, but be prepared for 24 weeks of being rude to people in Mac Corry because her computer doesn't work.",0
"Really difficult professor, but extremely worth it.  I feel like I actually have to try my very best to do well in his class, so when I do it is extremely rewarding.  I get the feeling that he genuinely cares for his student's well being, and isn't afraid to joke around with them. He's like the cool uncle you look forward to seeing on holidays.",1
"Don't be frightened by the past ratings. Kaur is very understanding, she made it a point to my class to figure out our needs in order to teach the material well. The workload was not too bad. It was just weekly readings, 3 exams, and one presentation and paper. Lectures are long but everything she discusses is important and crucial to the exams.",1
"Really fun teacher and makes lectures interesting. There is A LOT of reading and pop quizzes every 1-2 weeks that come from the readings. PowerPoints are available, but they're the main ideas of the lecture and no detail. You have to attend the lecture to hear him elaborate on the main ideas and go into detail. But overall, really good teacher!",1
Decent professor but teaches right out of the book and off the slides. She is really frazzled and not confident in her knowledge at all. HW is all online assignments due at midnight which is really dumb.,0
"Spent a class reviewing our midterm (average 55%), she found out midway through solving a problem that she wrote it wrong. She did not do anything about it. Assigns so much work (3 quizzes + hw weekly) but rarely assigns us anything on time, leaving us scrambling to finish. Said making a practice exam is too hard. Often forgets her office hours.",0
Great prof. Teaches well and knows her topic.,1
Don't take him..it's as simple as that..He cannot explain the material and expects you to know the material and talk and write about it better than he can.  Even questions on exams are confusing.  DO NOT TAKE HIM...,0
"The class is challenging but still enjoyable. Usually there is a lot that Dr. Bibza covers in the lecture so it is better to show up to class, but it won't kill you if you don't.",1
Dewar is an amazing professor. He has an amazing knowledge on the subject and he was very clear in expressing his thoughts. I feel bad for the first years going into Hist 1101 without him. He is def one of my fave profs!!!,1
"Great person but terrible professor. Just comes to class and writes proofs on the board straight from the book, doesn't really care for developing intuition and big-picture understanding. Very fast-paced: it feels like she only teaches for the top 10% of the class. The class has no TA, no practice exams, no additional resources. Duke Math is evil.",0
Dra. Betanzos is one of my favorite teachers. She cares about her students and makes a real effort to make class fun. She also seems to really enjoy what she does and is genuinely interested in what she teaches.,1
"I don't mind his accent but he is a not a good lecturer. He tends to skip a ton of steps in his proofs , which makes you super confused. His notes come straight out of the textbook but his quizzes are not questions similar to the textbook practice problems he assigns or his examples. Overall bad experience.",0
"Waste of time! I would spend 5-6 hours a week reading, watching videos, and taking notes, to go into class and simply review what we read. Notes graded thoroughly. Teaches like HS English teacher. Cares more about authors portrayal and personal interpretation. 1/2 of test questions are about author/maps as history. Poor grading rubric. AVOID!!!!!!",0
"I took a hybrid class, and not once did I learn any information from her in class or through her lectures. She posts documents online, expects you to complete them before class, and then does not teach you the information. She's a horrible. Always has unclear directions and no guidelines for you. These other reviewers must have had a diff professor",0
"Here's another prof where I can see some may have easy criticisms, but honestly she is a great prof. She's older, but she knows what she is talking about and her lectures are very organized and easy to follow. The tests are not hard either, and I walked out of class learning something everyday. She has her quirks, but who doesn't? I recommend.",1
Dr. Vaishnava's class was hard at first.  His Accent take a few days to get used too.  My only issue with him was when you asked a specific question he would make you put your pencil down while he was answering it.,1
Class spikes sharply in difficulty  half way through. I tried to explain that I was struggling in the class because I was pouring all of my effort into calculus (another class required for business) and he really couldn't seem to care less,1
"She is by far the worst teacher I have ever encountered.My major is english and I love the subject.However, the semester I spent in her class was hell.She is rude towards students & grades unfairly.She grades to much based on her own emotion.She isn't all there.Take some one else,I am warning you!",0
"Not very helpful, hard grader on papers, however hard to fail her class. If you have a view that is not parralell to her own you are wrong. I give her a C overall",0
Betzel is extremely hard to understand so you better be ready to teach yourself all of the information. Tests are a huge part of your overall grade. She lacks good time management and tries to cram everything in the last two weeks of the semester. Does not prepare you well for any tests. Avoid at all costs. ,0
"You are expected to read almost 50 pages per night. Pretty much no one in class read though because the next day the reading was in his powerpoint lecture. The tests never seemed to relate to the lectures, and the final exam was something that no amount of studying could prepare you for. So long as you show up and he likes you, you will do fine.",1
"Manganiello isn't the most exciting professor; his teaching style is slow and quiet, and it can be hard to stay focused. However, he is very caring, patient and helpful, and will always answer your questions with detailed explanations. Also, he's a pretty easy grader (especially compared to other English professors).",1
Great professor! The class itself is difficult but he provides you with a lot of extra materials that other professors dont. Very sweet guy and tries to crack a joke every once in a while.,1
Do not take Prof Adajian if possible. Class was very hard and material didn't make sense. I read the assigned readings and showed up to class but the subject matter wasn't understandable. I somehow passed by making educated guesses on all the tests. 2 tests and 1 final. 2 discussion posts. No other assignments.,0
"Stuart is a great teacher.  I found him to be a bit eccentric, but that is what I liked about him.  He is not an easy teacher though.  You do need to study so if your lazy be prepared to work.  He is a fair teacher though.",1
"Very interesting class, definitely recommend it. The prof is very knowledgeable and clear when explaining. Thumbs up!",1
James Ketchen is an excellent teacher.  You absolutely need to be in class and following the lecture and he is always willing to clarify is necessary.  He makes his material interesting if you give it a chance.  He is very fair with grading and forthcoming with assistance regarding assignment.  My favourite teacher by far!,1
Absolutely awful and disrespectful. DO NOT TAKE HE DOES NOT CARE. Reporting him to the dean as its embarrassing hes employed by uncc. He needs another profession acts biased if you question his grading.,0
All homework and the final project are optional. Three exams throughout the semester and he reviews before each. The book may not be essential but it helped be a lot. He organizes the class in a very confusing way but overall did a good job.,1
He's a good guy,1
"Probably the most disrespectful and unforgiving professor I've ever had. Many instances of asking questions, and him interrupting midway through for him to just say ""you need to study"". No where near enough time on quizzes. Have had quizzes where I knew everything but there just wasn't enough time. Get ready for hell if you end up with him.",0
"The professor expects class participation and is fair.  The grade you deserve is the grade you receive.  The class itself is not hard, you just have to be willing to study and be prepared.",1
"the worst teacher, totally unhelpful, unfair tests,  sucks",0
Link's lectures feel so long and don't stop talking the whole time. Makes you buy a $160 textbook that you take notes in which is a waste of money. Study sessions make 10x more sense than anything he taught.,0
"He teaches from power point slides and his test are fair, the thing is do you understand what's going on? Group prodject and one case study.",1
"Do not take this class. All the lectures are pre-recorded and you are required to do all of McGraw assignments/Quizzes which take very long and honestly do not correlate with the lectures each week. His quizzes are only 5 questions, timed, AND if you don't do the first extra credit you cant do the rest. He isn't willing to help you out either.",0
"Prof. Tripp is a great person and a GREAT professor. All of the bad ratings are people who probably do not try in the slightest because I found his class to be stimulating and not that hard if you just do the work. Yes, there is a lot of reading, but he gives out work that is very interesting (HST 103) and he is always willing to help.",1
"She is terrible. She grades way to hard, her homework assignments are difficult. Tests are impossible. She tries to be nice, but really she is a fake. Worst prof in the Business school here at MU. For fall break she assigned homework. she assignes way too much for a class that could be easy. Don't take her at all.",0
Good Teacher.  Somewhat vague with assignments.  It's my personal opinion that she leaves too much of the class to be decided by her questionably competent TA.  Exam questions are straight forward and the study material is adequate.  There is a lot of reading but they are usually interesting excerpts.  Its not a book you'd sell back to SBS.,1
Yeah.... She isn't that good. Don't take this class. You will hate your life. lol,0
By far the worst class I have ever taken. He made it way harder than it needed to be. It was a 100 level class but treated like a 300 level class with unrealistic reading assignments every night. He does not go over any of the reading in class but you will be tested on it. If you are not a PLS major  DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.,0
BEST PROF EVER ��,1
Worst professor. Disorganized + provides students no resources to help understand the concepts of the class. Zero tests before the final + zero feedback on any written assignments before huge final research paper. Students have no idea if they are doing well in class. Lectures are boring. She can't speak english and directions are confusing as hell,0
"Overall she a good teacher, but she typical college professor. very boring and dull. she very nice, but the way she teach is confusing.",0
I would not be a successful journalist if it wasn't for Jon Hughes,1
"His assignments were good an insightful, but they were worth pretty much nothing. The final exam was worth a whopping 40% and had absolutely nothing to do with what he said in class. The final is only from the textbook - and it is a very tough and long exam. You pretty much have to memorize every chapter in order to do well.",0
I love this guy,1
"He's a nice guy. . . Quizzes and Assignments are pushover. His tests are not, however. P.S. You gotta get a kick out of the croc hunter likeness!",1
Dr. Warner is awesome! I try to take hum for every communications class. His taste is music rocks too!,1
"if you think ull find a better history professor, think again! Doc Hallman is/was the man",1
Forces you to go to class by not posting any of his notes. Doesnt make slides. Class is so slow going because he takes way too long on the same questions over and over. Absolute worst prof I've ever had. Grading scheme makes no sense. Do not recommend.,0
"She is an amazing professor! Would take again any day. Take very good notes and do the homework and use YouTube for help. Her notes are key, be organized and detailed and you'll get the homework done easily. She makes her own reviews and test and are very helpful! She gives no extra credit so do well! She gives quizzes almost every week no makeup.",1
"oh god what an awful experience , every single day is a snooze fest. only classes offered are morning, and i got stuck in the 8 am class. theres homework due every single class, and its all just busy work. Shaftel just rambles on for the whole period and you can barely even understand what hes saying. never again. also, ridiculous pop quizzes",0
This course is a LOT of work. Readings are extremely long and there are many tedious weekly assignments. I honestly wouldn't have minded this course if it weren't for the prof's extremely CONFUSING lectures. It's hard to follow what he's saying and almost IMPOSSIBLE to figure out the main points of the lecture.,0
"Lectures are boring and monotone, do not give specific grading boundaries and guidelines. However, she is easy to reach out and you can chat with her easily in office hours, she is willing to help you out. Overall, I would not recommend anyone to take this course unless you hate math.",1
"Just horrible. I cant even find words to describe this mans behavior specially during the covid quarter. Dude, he literally was holding a phone with his left hand while trying to solve random problems using his right hand and there was a problem with his phone where every 5 seconds, the screen would go off from camera to his home screen. go figure",0
"I was excited to take this class, she has a lot of work experience and it shows in lecture. Her lectures are very boring, dry and granular. Not a very good communicator. Too strict on time limits on exams and has ripped them out of my hands several times. Putative, obtuse and very short on empathy. Not sure what her motivations are for teaching.",0
"If you have no problem teaching yourself, this class should be fine for you. Otherwise, please do yourself a favor and don't take him unless you want to fail. He encourages students to ask questions but when they ask, he gives off the vibe of (and actually says) ""you should already know this... otherwise, you shouldn't be here.""",0
I had his CS246 lecture. He's one of the best prof I've ever met at UW. I wanted to take his CS343 at Fall term 2012 but he's temporary not in school. I will wait him till he's back.,1
His discussions are amazing and the papers were very reasonable.,1
"Awesome prof, makes a lot of hilarious remarks in class, which relieves the extreme boredom from the course material. Lecture pace is very fast for a CS student with no ECE background. However, does attempt to make things clear during his office hours. Straight-forward assignments and easy exams (they are long, but not hard, the final w",1
"I've also taken Professor Doyle's creative nonfiction class, which is pretty easy for creative writers. She is my favorite teacher I've had at East Bay. She assigns a good amount of reading (if you have work or extra classes), but her lectures are helpful. She is there for you when you need it and sincerely cares about students. I miss her classes.",1
"One of good prof I had, Need to study well to get A/B in his class, 4 lecture exams, 4 labs and 1 final and 4 essays writing, His exams are kinda tricky, labs are easy if you study, Discussions are very well explained, Hes using life examples to better understand more the lectures, Willing to talk to his students performance in/out the class",1
After reading reviews on here I was scared to take his class. Glad I took it though. He's an amazing professor. Read syllabus before asking questions. He responds quickly. 3 assignments each week. His quizzes are based off his videos. His videos are extremely helpful. He's smart and knows what he's talking about. I would take him again.,1
Worst professor I've ever had. Had him for Pentateuch and gospels in the same semester. His opinion is always right and if you disagree he will laugh at you. His assignments are ridiculous and he doesn't explain them. I am an A student and I got C's in both classes. He assigns a ridiculous amount of work and acts like his classes are the only ones,0
"Took Botkin's social problems class, it was very interesting. He is super hilarious, but only gives 4 grades total. A presentation, 2 test, and a research paper. The test come from the presentations and books, so make sure you show up for class! Overall a very fun class though. ",1
"Straker is very passionate about English and teaches very interesting lectures, but I found that he would sometimes dwell too long on a topic when there was a lot more to cover. Very approachable, although he can be a bit pompous. Fair marker and gives useful feedback!",1
"I would NOT recommend this professor. You WILL have a quiz EVERY SINGLE day you have class and they cannot be made up. It is awful and she does not teach, she expects you to learn on your own.",0
"He is a respectable professor, and his lectures are very meticulous. If you have any questions, he will answer them patiently. In short, he is a great professor.",1
"He's really funny. Tests a LOT on lectures. Takes attendance only like 3 times the semester and gives you points. He lets you know when he will be taking it ahead of time. Really hard to study for tests and does a really ODD curve. It's an okay course, unless you're looking for a GPA booster in which case... i advise otherwise.",1
It is amazing to me that some ratings here say that he has no talent.  Couldn't be further from the truth.,1
"Phil's econ class is a lot of interesting lectures and examples, but he gets the point across well. I really liked his class and definitely would recommend it. Friday tests tho, which are 5 questions and honestly not too bad just because he drops 5 of them at the end of the semester.",1
On the first day he said half the class would drop by the middle of the term.. he was right. If he knows half will drop he should make a change so that doesn't happen. Not a good teacher and wouldn't recommend!,0
"Dr. Peck is the best professor I've had at Penn State so far. He cares a lot about his students and makes sure that everyone is able to succeed, not only the class, but also in their majors and future careers. His lectures are engaging. This class is a bit of work, but put in the effort and you'll do fine.",1
"Hardee is not a terrible professor, just didn't enjoy the class. He is one of the teachers that you wont forget (not in a bad way) For Intro to Lit, there was a paper due every day for class. So be ready to read a lot of material. Hardee is very nice and accepting of all things and overall a great professor, just assigned a lot of work.",1
"Dr. Kulchyski is a brilliant man who's incredibly passionate about Indigenous studies.  Showing up to class is a must to pass as you will need the notes to pass any mid-terms or final exams. His classes can be challenging if you do not stay on top of the course work, but in the end are very rewarding. ",1
Hes not NICE at All,0
"I don't recommend her for first year students as she'll destroy your gpa with her hard tests and exams if you don't learn to adapt. If you're stuck with her, go to all her DGD's and PAY ATTENTION to all examples she does in class as it might save you during a test. Overall decent prof but expect to put in at least 20 (or more) hours a week for an A",0
"I did not like the way Dr. Daigle taught. It wasn't helpful whatsoever. She seems like a nice person, but for me, her teaching style didn't fly.",0
Very intimidating at first but she definately knows what she is talking about.  Easy B not an Easy A.. you have to work hard but it was worth it. 3 Tests plus a final- lots of vocab quizzes- you write 3 papers and have an oral presentation (group skit),1
"He turned what used to be a 2 Midterm class into a 5 Midterm + 1 Final class. I would not say he himself has bad intentions, but also adding an additional set of homework each week (so from 1 set per week to 2), I don't necessary have the time to think well of him. My conclusion? This has become a class made for students to STRUGGLE!",0
Got A's on every exam yet got a B for the final grade because I missed numerous clicker quizzes and in-class activities.. material not hard but you HAVE to go to class to get an A...,0
"Cyd is good - even though my final paper was technically not fully in line with the syllabus, I was able to ""talk my way out of it"" and she accepted my final project. The section we had was very challenging from a technological standpoint, but we made it through. Good class!",1
"Great Prof, helpful and funny. Course is so-so. 3 texts + 1 reader = mucho $. Course material is dryyyyyyyy, basically rambling off succession of kings, pol his pure. Prof: A, Course: D",1
"Class was very boring for me, but Mrs. Krafcik is very helpful and knows what she is talking about. Reading quizzes are EXTREMELY easy! You have to do an oral presentation with a powerpoint with it's very easy. Paper assignments are very easy and leave you a lot of room to work with. Just make sure you go to class everyday (she takes roll).",1
"Provides vague instructions. When asked to clarify, he said he couldn't waste time on my questions.  A few times he changed the focus/ parameters of an assignment, but the updated requirements were buried in his response to another student's DB post. His feedback is  a generic form; unhelpful, & mixed in a copy of the assignment instructions",0
"Dr. Johnson is my favorite professor of all time. I've never met someone so passionate and knowledgeable about anything. I can honestly say he is the smartest man I have ever met in my entire life. He will make you work hard for a decent grade. As long as you show up to lectures and put forth an honest effort, you'll be alright.",1
He is just... The absolute worst. He can be funny sometimes. There. One positive thing to warrant the one star. It should be zero.,0
He's an amazing art teacher that genuinely cares about what he teaches and his students. He is incredibly nice and tries to help you in any way. Would take a class by him again.,1
good teacher.,1
"this class could be aggravating at times, not because it was hard or had too much work but he gives pop quizzes very often. However, as long as you read and keep up on work you'll be able to get an easy A. As for assignments, as long as you pass something in you get full credit for them. Also be prepared to take a lot of notes.",1
"I finished her class, and I am very disappointed about her class. I can say that there is nothing, except that reading her confusing lectures,  watching videos on YouTube,  and doing her tough homeworks. Be careful to read her long assignments because she is a tough grader, and she won't help you at all.",0
"Really fun class, she explains things really well!",0
I decide to take professor choi for fall and let me just tell you she is so the most careless professor i have taken at elac... she doesn't care about her students passing not to mention she'll only provide extra opportunities until the very end of the semester and constantly has typos in her lecture notes. DON'T TAKE HER!!!!,0
"do not understand the hype. class started out interesting but throughout the semester it became boring even my TA thought so. wish i went with the other professor. thank god my TA was really fun, she saved the class for me",0
"He is a very smart professor. He does not ""dumb it down"" in class which makes it hard to follow sometimes. He is VERY organized and tells you exactly what will be on the exams which is nice but the content is difficult to understand in the terms he uses to explain them. He gives good examples/videos to help but it is still difficult to comprehend",1
"Great prof, and great guy.  I'm still laughing at his lectures.  Every class was a treat because of his amazing sense of humor and his phenomenal lecutres...THE smartest man I have ever met, on everything...great guy, EVERYONE should take a class with him!",1
"OH DEAR GOD KILL ME NOW! I DREADED this class every wk.the tests are beyond hard,& he shows the first films EVER made in EVERY country.try to take cinema 2 to avoid this.NEVER out early.nice guy tho.i just thot his exams were way too hard.BUT I HATED THIS CLASS",0
"This isn't an easy class, but he is definitely walks you through everything step-by-step. He listens to your feedback, and may adjust the class based on the needs of his students. Very approachable and kind when leaving comments. Prompt in grading. Great semester, great professor!",1
"I was not happy with Mrs. Dudleys teaching. Her lectures are pretty bland, and her grading was very hard. Her labs are rushed and take forever. I would not recommend taking this class if you're looking for an easy A...",0
firm beliefs didnt' like being forced to think what she thought..ohwell,1
"I am currently taking his class this semester and he is so rude and condescending. when you ask him questions he doesn't answer your question and is very dismissive with his students. i hate going to his class, he is just a really annoying, negative, rude person. if he hates his job so much, he shouldn't teach . STAY AWAY. He gets an F- from me.",0
"Great teacher, laughs a lot, smiles a lot and chats a lot, but in reality this subject doesn't need a teacher. That's why all you have to do is look at the online work. All the tests and stuff are open book, plus you can look up the answers anyways. Pointless dumb class, good guy.",1
"Prof Magal had a very well-structured class.  Didn't move too fast, nor too slow.  The lectures rarely helped my understanding, but I already had a lot of experience with what the course covered.  Used the book for things I didn't understand.  Online quizzes for each chapter were no problem.  Would be an easy A for anyone that can use a computer.",1
"disguisting excuse for a professor.  horrible in every sense of the word.  his exams are not that difficult but only because of the text.  should not be asked back for another term.  also, administration should at least have the brains not to assign him to teaching any first year classes.",0
Horrible class don't take u want time off and u have to play game is so boring,0
"This class was VERY HARD. I got a D on every test. I am typically an A student and was at risk of failing. He does curve the class but it is still hard. For someone who is not a science major, I would not recommend this class. I feel he lectured on unnecessary information and test questions were random. Extra credit given at end if needed.",0
"I was disappointed as I had heard great things about Professor Kenney. His class wasn't too difficult, but what others call ""sarcasm"" seemed just downright mean to me. If you miss class/miss an assignment/don't participate he will call you out and will show no mercy. I just thought his whole attitude was in poor taste, especially in a pandemic.",1
"You will never finish your project: building a compiler called ""MeggyJava"". Its not because is it hard. Its because there is no class diagrams, no easy-to-start code, no IDE for debug and no explicit hint for this compiler. All you can rely on is google resource. If you want to balance all your courses, STAY AWAY FROM CISC672.",0
"Took him for animal science, awesome instructor, very knowledgeable and funny. Kept lectures interesting.",1
Basically handed us some slideshows and we were on our own.,0
"The most boring class I have ever taken. Partially the material, but the teacher did not help at all.",0
"This was one of my favourite courses that I've taken at UVic! Dr. Beaulieu made this class so interesting and actually made me enjoy learning about history. I will say that I didn't find it to be ""super easy"" as there was a lot to study and you had to write down all the small details from all lecture videos in order to do well.",1
Did not seem willing to answer questions during lecture period and ignored students who asked multiple questions.,0
Horrible. Lectures drag on and he's nearly impossible to pay attention to. Tests are ridiculous. He doesn't prepare you very well at all. The only good thing is that there are 4 tests and the lowest grade is dropped.,0
"Had a 3 hour lecture from 6:30 to 9:30. Was very hard to sit though, not a very good speaker, very hard to listen. His questions are very concept based so you must understand the concept in order to know how to even begin answering test questions. Tests are multiple choice-but don't let that fool you, they are quite difficult. Switch out.",0
"I took Schultz for a ""D"" semester. By the 6th week of a 8 week course, she has only graded one paper out of 5. Also, she has knocked one week off the course making it 7 weeks (The final was due on the 12/6 and now is due 11/30). All of this would be fine if she gave more feed back, since she does not though, knowing your grade is a guessing game.",0
"It's very difficult to listen in class. It's very easy to get lost when he's explaining something, and many times he gets lost while explaining something. He's pretty lenient when it comes to grading tests and quizzes. Tests and quizzes are not really hard.",0
"Mrs. Barclift is one of the best teachers I have ever had.  If you are a Social Work Major, I suggest taking her because she has both real world experience, and she is a fun teacher.  She teaches Practice I, Mental Health and Crisis Intervention.  I've taken all 3, with 2 A's and 1 B.  She makes sure you definitely get it.",1
"Do not take him if you can help it, he spends most of the class with his back to the class and lectures. If he's not doing that, he's sharing his life stories that barely relate to the class. The only reason to have the book is to teach yourself, he only uses it for homework that isn't graded anyways.",0
"I know he is pretty new but needs to learn how to teach. The key to doing well is do LOTS of problems, thats the only way to build good problem solving skills. Midterm was fair but Exam was way too long and challenging. Easy content just work on problem solving skills and FBD's.On tests write down everything (yay for part marks), fair marker.",0
"Ross is a very caring professor. He wants his students to do well and gives plenty of quizzes, some of which are take home. He drops the 3 lowest quiz score which really helps. Try to be in class, tests come straight from the notes and it is hard to get behind. The first two test are easy, while the last two are much harder. Very good guy.",1
very repetitive,1
Laura is awesome. She is so knowledgeable about education and English. She is very up to date on worldly matters and you will learn a lot from her. She is also very calm and relaxed. The only thing I didn't like about her was that she doesn't post grades.,1
GREAT PROFESSOR! LECTURES COULD GET A LITTLE BORING BUT I LIKED HOW HE NEVER FAILED TO MENTION THAT THE USA IS GREAT. GRADE DEPENDS ON CHAPTER BOOK QUIZZES (3) AND 3 EXAMS.,1
"The class corrects him everyday on his arithmetic. He makes the lesson wayyy harder than it needs to be, but the webwork is quite easy. I wouldn't recommend him because of his grouchiness and his dislike of elementary ed. majors. He loves to write on the board with dead markers.",1
He tried to make the exam as hard as he could even thong most of the materials were covered by acc202 already.,0
"Professor Holztblatt is a nice guy who makes class enjoyable with a sense of humor that's dry but is still refreshing in an accounting class. There's homework due every class which can be hard to keep up with. Exams are fairly easy, most of the class finished the final within 40 minutes.  He's passionate about accounting and cares about students.",1
"Honestly, if you show up to every class, PAY ATTENTION, and do the homework you will pass. People who drop this class just don't try... it's really not hard. Dr. Morris is a pretty good professor, kinda quiet and not super personal, but she does the job. Don't be fooled by people who say this class is ""too hard"". I'm not a math person and I passed",1
"I took Dr. Godshalk expecting amazing things from these other reviews. I have always been an A student and this class was just a joke. He is unorganized, scatter brained, and more. He would constantly mess up on his quizzes and get content backwards. This class was a waste.",0
"Fairly rough grader on portfolio problems. He wrote the book so that probably didn't help any of the students. He's a smart guy, but it's hard to relate to him. He's better in office hours though.",1
"Garrison is super sweet,  but he's an awful professor and I don't know how anybody passes his class without going to office hours. He's very helpful there, but this class requires an insane amount of time studying. Don't take as a gen ed if it's not for your major. Expect this to be the heaviest class in your schedule.",1
Unfortunately when it came to quizzes/exams I felt like there were many arbitrary questions in them. Many questions required specific answers and his lectures were not clear enough. There were several assignments I submitted that he didn't even grade. He will blow up your email. He is also the creator of this course so he may be a tad particular.,0
he is so arrogant and thinks he knows everything.... take someone else if you can,0
Had Sunny for term 2 (LTC). She made the experience enjoyable and we felt very equipped going into the next term. She really focused on nursing responsibilities instead of having us worry about basic care which was awesome because long term care doesn't really facilitate that. My head to toe assessments and documentation were on point after Sunny,1
Very tough and strict prof. People are failing his class. He teaches different content for 2001 compared to the other profs content. His lectures are so confusing and the content he teaches is confusing so i only pickup about half of the stuff he teaches. Had a very bad and regretful experience with this prof.,0
"Genuinely one of the most amazing people you will ever meet. His knowledge is so vast and his life experiences are incredible. He cares for his students and the subjects he teaches. His class may not be an easy A, but it is so insanely worth it. Take his class. Youll be so glad you did.",1
"Dr. Ballard is great. She is clear about expectations and the course material. It isn't necessary to read the textbook, unless she indicates that there is something on the test that she won't go over in class. The material is difficult but worthwhile. There's a big paper but she breaks it up into small assignments that are annoying but helpful.",1
Tom is a really great guy but his 8am lecture about Family Business seems pointless to go to most of the time until he starts randomly taking attendance. There are no tests which is super nice but there are 2 pretty big projects and about 5 reading summaries which just take time.,1
"Worst professor at Concord, if not THE WORST. This man always believes his opinion is ONLY valid and disregards lack of respect for students. We never had assignments, and I attended his class every time and I still ended up with a D (which I had to argue for). Lectures are nothing but rambling on his ignorant ideologies. AVOID HIM AT ALL COSTS. ",0
Dr. Silverstone is super cool. She really knows what she's talking about and her discussions are helpful in understanding the subject material.,1
The class is just poorly structured and was made even worse by going online. Either way his lectures can be hard to follow and unhelpful and I have spent more time working on this one class than my other 9 credits total.,0
"Best prof. at Hamilton, hands down.",1
His lectures are boring but when you get him going off on a tangent its hilarious. He will talk to you about woodworking forever if you let him. Overall good teacher though.,1
"Dr. Hunt comes across as a harsh man, but if you'd been asked the same stupid questions (that are easily answered by reading the basic documents) for 20 years you'd be a little coarse too. If you try, this man will meet you there 110% and give you all the time that you need to fully grasp a concept. Ochem can be hard but if you try he will too.",1
"Dr. Perry (Or Clif as he prefers to be called) is an outstanding professor and a treasure to Auburn University. I took this class due to interest in the content (Im a STEM student) and I absolutely got what I bargained for, if not more. Clifs passion really shows in how he handles his students. Absolutely recommend him.",1
"just close your eyes God knows. what a nightmare, lord have mercy on her future students and may she be forgiven for wasting students' time.",0
"Worst professor ever! Hands down! Tries to be ""hip"" by bending the expectations of the typical classroom. The younger kids seem to like this as it's not like their high school classrooms, but ultimately it has poor execution and it's just a cop out for lack of teaching skills. No syllabus, no teaching, too much reading and convoluted grading scale.",0
I remember Dr. Jackson... What a disorganized lady.  She was always talking about how she worked with NASA in the middle of lessons.  Her NASA stories never had anything to do with the lesson.  She also never stopped talking about PSI CHI.  I was in PSI CHI it was a joke.,0
"Dr. Wang has a very confusing way of teaching, then when students ask her to explain an example she makes it even more difficult to understand. She only uses examples to teach rather than teaching the entire concept which makes it hard to apply the learning to different problems. The textbook helps some but not much. Avoid this prof if possible.",0
"Never met a professor funnier/entertaining than Gannon. Initially I had a hard time in his teaching method but after having Kuttler for substitute made me realize Gannon really made hard stuff seem simple. Gannon is honest and doesn't go like ""practise makes perfection"", it's either you get it or don't and explicitly tells 117 isn't for everyone.",1
"grade only consists of 2 big papers but he is very clear as to what he wants out of you. he wrote his own textbook, so you will need it for class. Go to lecture! he'll say ""secret"" things that he wants on the papers that he doesn't say anywhere else. you have to work for the grade but if he sees the effort he gives extra credit",1
"Honestly have never had a prof who didn't know how to answer students questions. unless you plan to do all the extra hw and tutoring, you wont pass. Horrible communication skills. Was not respectful.",0
"This was a blended learning class so we only had to be in class once a month to take the actual test, but she gives you chapters to read and maps to complete. The maps are on the test and so is the content of whatever she makes you read. BUT she does a great review right before each test, so pay attention, expect homework and you'll do fine! ",1
"Kind of a useless professor, it is possible to learn everything she has said in statistics on your own.  I had her for Child/Adolescent Psychology as well... you would do well to avoid these classes if you can!",0
This professor is extremely nice and helpful.  Always willing to help during office hours and does his best to explain.  Great Professor!!,0
"Teaches well, invites questions and then insults you for 20 minutes. He is cool. Maybe the smartest man I know",0
"Genuinely one of the sweetest, most caring profs Ive had so far. You can tell he really loves what he does and is rooting for everyone to do well. His exams are very fair and content wise, was pretty great at getting through everything. Would love to take another course with him!",1
"Very smart man. Not having tests are nice. However, he is a harsh grader and not very approachable. His seriousness makes you think twice before asking him questions or help. You need to know your material to be prepared to answer his questions. He had gotten impatient with my class since no one did and dismissed early.",1
"This is supposed to be Into to Literature. All we talk about in this class is sex and mental problems. And sex. Honestly, I didn't want to go most days because the discussion made me sick. If you have any morals, stay away.",1
"He is obviously talented regarding American politics. He comes off as a bit boorish at times, and relies far too much on ACE. Just teach the class like it is-an on campus course. Moreover, his marking is dubious i.e. inconsistent and is lower than what you can expect compared to similar work that you have done in other courses. Good luck.",1
"Would not take again. He doesn't seem to know what he's talking about as he would only explain very simple concepts. He also had answer key errors and practice midterms filled with errors. Makes it very difficult to teach yourself, which is what you have to do.",0
"In 10 weeks, I took only 2 pages of notes, while attending every class, even though only the last ten minutes of class are relevant to anything. I ended up with a C, but on the bright side, we got to watch three movies!!...Basically, only take him if you are a senior who just needs to pass. Because you probably won't get an A.",0
"This is a basic Econ class, it's a GE class. I'm not looking to major in this field; I had to take this class. There is absolutely no reason to make it as unnecessarily difficult as she did. Every single thing she said was annoying to hear.",0
"Take her if you want an easy A, i'm horrible at math and did very well in her class, also, if you like art, take her...two projects i did in art i used for her class",1
"Dr. Williams is a nice lady, but her lectures are really long and boring. She made Psychology uninteresting for me. I do not recommend if you are a psychologist major. BUT you can use a cheat sheet on the exams!!",0
"Where to begin... his lectures are incredibly monotone and seem to drag on forever. He doesn't attempt to add any excitement to the topic. Tests are the hardest I've taken yet (sophmore), and incredibly wordy. Boring and challenging, I would not reccomend this class to anyone.",0
"He was meh. Talked the whole time every class. Very boring not very encaging. HW was easy online, but his tests were pretty difficult if you did not study enough. He was nice.",1
"This class was hard and the body of work for it was at times overwhelming. However, it was easily the most enjoyable and rewarding class I have ever taken. If you don't enjoy books and heavy research, this class is not for you. Dedication is necessary, as is communication with both your instructor and classmates. You have to seek her help yourself.",1
Really great guy. He loves the Lord and he shows that in his actions and in his lectures. It just takes awhile to pick up on Zilas teaching styles... quizzes=book/tests=notes,1
STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!,0
"Reading, a discussion post, and 1-2 assignments and quizzes per week. Everything is pretty simple and Prof. Lirenso is very understanding of people's situations. I took this class along with a heavy course load, but he provides notes and a good study guide for the final which made studying easier and I passed with an A. I recommend him for GEO 001.",1
Absolutely do NOT recommend!!! I took AP Calculus in high school and passed the class but after taking his class I failed the final and now have to retake the course. His tests and quizzes were unreasonably difficult and I basically had to reteach myself calculus. He just rants about Newton and physics without actually teaching anything. Stay Away!,0
"If you want a dose of genuine academia from a professor whose intellect outshines all others in the department, and who will whip your critical thinking into shape, be brave and take his classes. Be prepared for brutal honesty that you need to improve, and praise that must be truly earned. Enjoy his dry wit & how he makes crankiness charming.",1
great prof! I learned a lot,1
Good guy.  Good Teacher,1
"Surprisingly, even though this course is hard, I ended up liking it. Dr. Zondlo is a wonderful lecturer and a nice guy. I know I'm not going to get an A, but it's my own fault for not trying harder. This is one of the best courses I've ever taken.",1
"Fire this teacher now. He is confusing, can not explain simple subjects, doesn't speak english and is ignorant of any practial applications of finance. He spends most of the class explaining the algebra used to create known formulas. He does not explain concepts at all. All formulas including annuity must be done in long hand for exams.",0
"You really need to go to class, and do the readings. if you don't then the exams will seem impossible. Also, read other peoples notes because he says tiny details that others might pick up on. Also, his lectures are tricky to follow sometimes.",1
"I'm taking her class during my last semester and I'm honestly scared that I won't graduate. She is the worst teacher I have had since I've been at UNCC. The exams are crazy hard. Also, the exams are online, but she requires the webcam on lockdown browser. I would never take another one of her classes. AVOID.",0
"She openly admits to not being good at lecturing and it shows quickly. She clearly has experience but she can't form the sentences to properly share her knowledge. Nice woman, kind of funny, but it does not make up for her flaws. We had one big group project that was near impossible. Tests suck too. Quit now.",0
"By far the worst prof i've ever had, likes to hear himself talk too much!!",0
"Read the book because that's where some of his test comes from. He can come off rude with his dry sense of humor, but he is nice. He's lectures are boring unless you ask questions or just talk to him about the subject he's lecturing about. He grades things at the last minute aka the end of the semester and his directions can be unclear.",1
Sarkis Khoury is a  bad professor who does not teach students how to understand the problems. Beware of UCR's summer school because UCR administration does not tell the truth about the fees students have to pay for summer school. Many of my friends do not know that they must pay the summer school fees like a whole academic quarter with new fees.,0
"His assignments are not clear. He does not explain his grading, he simply assigns a number or in my case a letter grade with no explanation. He can be very slow to answer emails. He also has a lot of work that is outside of class interviews, community service, etc. that makes it very difficult for an online class.",0
"He seems more concerned about doing his research than anything. ALL assignments, other than the tests and book reports, were group writing papers; this class is more like a writing class. Sadly had to be taken for major...",0
"Willing to help any student.  She'll read your papers and send you suggestions on what to fix.  Also, she is willing to meet with you even if it's not during her office hours.  The reason I picked up a history double major.",1
"Dr. Dudley is by far my favorite professor. He is great at answering emails. Is extremely understanding and kind. He does not require the textbook but it does help. Read one chapter every week, do an inquizitive which you can get 100% on if you keep trying. One discussion every week which are easy and interesting. A few writing assignments",1
Statistics with Professor Ramasesh might have been my least favorite class I have ever taken. He is not understanding NOR does he help you in the slightest bit. It is almost like he enjoys making fun of students for asking questions. He never made it clear what to study. The ONLY thing I learned from his class was what hair product not to use.,0
"Wants us to follow his thought process and figure out what we don't understand about it. Unable to understand and explain where I was making mistakes. Unable to see from my perspective. I think he might be intellectually gifted but emotionally stunted. As a teacher the goal is to improve the students, not prove to them how smart you are.",0
"Best psychology teacher I've ever had. She has great stories and she's a great teacher. Her testing method is awesome, you use your class notes and the textbook and then you take it as a group and then as a class. It may sound easy but you actually learn a lot. She's awesome!! A little cooky but it makes the class more fun",1
"I had her for chem 130 lab, and she was super friendly and helpful. id have taken her for lecture if i could have",1
"Course was composed of a single project and final. Went into final without any feedback, grades or expectation of content on final. No rubrics, expectations or standards to meet as a student. Those who ask for guidance are often met with a classic condescending response. Clearly has no interest in teaching, sucks of the life out the topic.",0
I do not recommend taking this class at all. The journal entries and quizzes are graded harshly. She gave me a D on a test because I didn't write what she wanted to hear. When I asked her what my grade in the class and she was very vague. I dropped the course because it was way too difficult and too much reading. Professor is unhelpful.,0
"Mattson is alright. The one major problem is that he doesn't do very well at explaining the things he needs to and spends a large amount of class time going over simple concepts. You'll get where you need to with him, but you may not understand all of it and will instead just focus on surviving one test at a time.",0
"he just bah bah bah and explain the question only 1/3 way, as a non-physic major student I don't understand his explaination at all. hopfully he can explain somemore for non-science major student.",0
"He's very old school; doesn't use any Powerpoints, only lectures for the full hour. He has a pleasant sense of humor that comes out sometimes during class and he outlines ideologies well, but reading is essential. Focuses on ideology, not on history, which is nice. Plan on working closely with your TA if you have questions.",1
"Fantastic Prof and very approachable. He will do everything in his power to help you. I like how he holds his office hours at the UC, and helps multiple students at once. Great guy!",1
"Her lectures had nothing to do with the assignments. The assignments, on average, took 8 hours to complete. Also, her advice for when struggling with labs and assignments is to ""look back at your notes.""",0
"She was a wonderful teacher.  I LOVED the class and don't usually like English.  I loved going to class, it was interesting, and she a lot of time in class to complete work.  Our class was in a computer lab so we had the computers to work on the entire class period.  It was awesome.",1
"Rohan has opened up a whole new world in the subject, and now I find myself studying physics as a break from other subjects. Not because it's easier, but he has made it so much more enjoyable than I could have ever imagined. It's such a privilege to have a professor like him!",1
"Dr. Babb is a great teacher, but the material can be difficult at times, and his grading is a little tough.",1
"I actually struggled with the material in this class before the final (Midterm, Quizzes, Assignments), so I was quite worried about how I would do in the class. But the final ended up being an absolute joke as Prakash had already more or less told us what would be on it and he had also prepared was really well. An absolute gem.",1
"He can be a bit intimidating at first but it's only because he expects you to put in as much effort as he does into the learning experience. He is always there to help, you just have to ask. His passion for marketing and for his students sets him apart from any other prof I have had and he has helped me achieve things I never thought I could.",1
BEST CLASS EVUR!!!! IT WAS SOOOOO GOOOD THAT I DIDNT ATTEND A SINGLE CLASS. THE TEXT BOOK IS A BETTER PROF. ,0
he gave use way to much reading you'd have to read like 50 pages for the class and another 50-100 for his tutorial hes a nice guy in person but goes of track all the time in lecture and tutorial aviod this class take it if you have too craig skipped like 500 years of history and went righ to the 16-17th century cuz thats what hes interested in,0
"Professor Parker is a very hard professor to get along with according to myself and many of the  other students I talked to.  He grades papers very hard. Very hard to stay engaged in his class because he is very boring. The lectures didn't teach anything, if it wasn't for his attendance policy there would be no point in showing up. Don't take him.",0
"Does not teach, you learn 100% from the Text Book. Unclear instructions.",0
"Great professor, very helpful and knowledgeable, clear.  Cares about folks learning what they need to know.  Expects people to work in the class -- so that turns some losers off.",1
"I liked his inclass teaching methods but the way he wrote the quizzes was foreign because he was trying to be too tricky with the wording and I loathe online assessments, quizzes, and tests. I took the physical class for a reason. Read the book! Also, if he asks if any student has a Q during lecture, he doesn't even notice your hand up!",1
This class hurts alot... Happy with a C,0
"Unless you are majoring in philosophy, it is highly suggestive to not take this course. For a gen. ed req, the work is overpowering as well as difficult. Not everyone could grasp such concepts so easily, and she is very critical with her grading. Tries too hard to seem like a good prof. when half the class is complaining that they are failing. Sad.",0
"Dr Hunter is the best math teacher I have ever had. He may move fast but he never hesitates to make sure everyone is understanding his lesson. He takes the time to give many examples as well. Just make sure after every lesson you keep up with the homework. If you struggle with math like I do, he is the teacher to take. Ps Makes math class bearable.",1
Did not like him at all!!! I never understood what our papers were supposed to be about and when you asked him he wont flat out tell you. Goes off on bad random tangents. Dread going to his class because I always feel like it is a complete waste of my time!,0
"I'm HORRIBLE at math. Thankfully, he only needed one essay! Got a solid B. Attendance doesn't matter, I skipped class plenty of times and still did well enough. He doesn't really teach so I just ran through the textbook for the final paper. Beware: he's a bit of a jerk.",0
Took it online.Takes 4-5 days to respond to any question.Told me that the final covered material learned after midterm- wrong. The final covered the whole semester.He says the questions for exams come from weekly quizzes-there were only 5 questions from them.Watch your quizzes-he marks a lot of correct answers wrong!NEVER updates grades.,0
"If you enjoy being tested on material not covered in class, go ahead and take this class.  I don't so I dropped it.  Worst teacher I've ever had, if you see this mans name, get as far away from it as possible.",0
Very unkind.  Subjectively critical.  Hated her.,0
Awful experience in the course,0
"Run is right!!! he is the most unhelpful professor i have ever had!!! If you have nothing better to do than read like 200 pages a night, then this is the class for you!The people that like him need to get their head checked..",0
did not help in anyway. talks to fast. do not take if possible.,0
"I joined the seminar class, A History of Race in America, with Professor Wayne this semester. He is quite knowledgeable in this topic, and was able to facilitate thorough and thought-provoking discussions that were always enjoyable, even if you didn't participate too much. He's very nice, although his essay topic wording can be a little confusing.",1
"1. His lecture slides are abysmal. If someone tried to use them in a corporate setting, they would be fired immediately. 2. He is disorganized and there is no clear grading criteria for anything. 3. He has legit said things in office hours that contradicted the textbook; he has no idea what he's doing. 4. He wastes class time on irrelevant stories",0
"ok don't get me wrong he is a really nice guy and is available outside of his lecture, but do yourself a favor and do not take this class!! the lecture is so so boring, and the tests are honestly tricky. he doesn't try to trick you on the test but it was always down to two answers that both seemed correct. overall don't take it, he is very nice tho",0
good lecture; sometime too fast,1
"I dropped this course with another prof.  Dr.O simple made everything 'make sense'! Her examples are useful and easy to understand. She seemed to to run out of time during the last few weeks of the course, so that chapter was more challenging, but she was happy to help me during her office hours. Do your weekly assignments - you will ace the tests.",1
"Great instructor!  He's fun to listen to, and knows his stuff.  Tests can be a little tough, but they are open book and online.",1
"very very smart lady, but CANNOT teach.... just talks about random things during class, and then you basically have to teach yourself how the brain develops and it works, etc. dont take her unless you can learn by yourself without help from a teacher. very smart funny and nice though.",0
"One of the worst teachers I've ever had. He outright refused to explain things a second time, even when nobody in the class understood. Reading the book did not help very often. He would belittle us for not understanding what he was talking about, even if he hadn't explained it yet. Three tests and maybe five assignments make your entire grade.",0
"Useless class, learned nothing. Relies very heavily on Powerpoint and tries to cram too much material into course. Easy grader, easy class, waste of time.",1
"He seems nice but honestly he is pretty cruel he'll never let you replace a 0 if its your religious holiday or for clicker questions he just keeps referring to the 80% rule, and isn't really understanding overall, doesn't  answer emails and if you want to check your midterm marks you got to go to him. Hard teacher, NOT A EASY MARKER.",0
"I loved Kate! She was very supportive and professional, as well as very realistic about what it's like to be a professional actor. She really helps you to grow and have a deeper understanding of what you're doing and how to improve. As long as you show up and participate you're going to do well. Would 100% recommend this class!",1
"I took Professor O for both Financial and Managerial Accounting, first in class and then online. Didn't make a difference because everything is online anyway, and I felt the 1 12 hours in class was wasted on irrelevant examples. It's clear what you need to do to pass, but in Man-Acc. none of our books had the last chapter. Overall don't recommend.",0
This professor was so awful. I could not even tell you what class I took it was that confusing. She was never clear about what she wanted and my class had zero themes to it. She would spend countless classes talking about nonsense and then give us quizes relating to something she mentioned once three weeks ago. She also never answers emails.,0
Had her for Workplace Communications. She is the best. I am passing her classs with flying colors! (:,1
Biased and has his favorites. If you are good go to some other school to get a job in I-Banking,0
Sometimes I wonder if he is on psychedelics or something as hes always racing during his lectures. Make yourself known in the class otherwise youll get very low participation marks which are 10%. And make sure you get as many marks on the midterms as he was absolutely destroy you on the final exam. funny how hes writing reviews about himself now,0
"If you can avoid this professor, literally do it. Her online site is beyond convoluted and she doesn't make expectations clear. If you forget to turn something in, good luck. She also responds to emails in the rudest way. Seriously don't know how she got so many good reviews. Avoid, avoid, avoid!",0
Avoid at all costs. A class with him is not worth sacrificing your emotional health.,0
"The class is not hard if you watch the lectures, do the study guides and attend the review sessions. Gives a reasonable amount of opportunities for extra credit. My only critique of the course is that there was not enough coverage of animal rights, which was disappointing for me personally. In any case, she's nice woman and a pretty good professor.",1
Terrible communicator.,0
"There's a pop quiz every class over the notes. The notes take a long time, but really help when tests come around. Make sure you do them so you pass the quizzes and don't have to rush through the material to study for tests. Lectures are sometimes irrelevant to the course. If he emails out lecture notes beforehand, there won't be a quiz!",0
"Occasionally his information is a bit out of date. His research paper guidelines are super easy to follow. There's a presentation also, but don't worry, he's a pretty easy marker. Overall, his classes are pretty easy.",1
"He's a nice guy, but he cannot lecture at all. The material isn't really that difficult but there's a lot of it and I had to learn it all on my own from the book, which made things a little harder. If you are willing to do the homework he assigns and read the book a lot, you'll be fine. If not, good luck.",0
"Bad teacher.  He has the students do group projects on media systems in other classes, in other words, the 2nd half of the semester, we're doing the teaching!  His grading scale is a joke.  Nearly impossible to get an A",0
"He was a very good prof who knew what he was talking about. At first, it was very hard to understand his accent, but you get used to it. If you take notes and study you should actually be good to do the midterm and final exam. Loved him!",1
"If you're in his class for Quantitative Methods, I have only one piece of advice for you. GET OUT NOW! How he is qualified as a teacher is beyond me. You will not LEARN anything, but you will pass his in-class tests very easily. Beware come exam time as the only thing you will only have learned how to copy off others. Ho' Boy, Enjoy... ",0
"I took two classes with Prof. Snyder so far. She is very precise, organized, funny, and always willing to help. She tests you the exact things she said in class. Just attend the class and do the prep exams and you will be fine. It's not a hard a class if you study (does not even require that much effort).",1
An absolute hottie.,1
"Rebecca is an incredible teacher. She teaches clearly, gives individual feedback, varies her teaching strategies, and allows students to participate at every level of the learning process. The workload is on the heavy side, but put in the time and you will love this class.",1
he's great!,1
"This was a good class. The video lectures were helpful and helped with the assigned readings. You have to do weekly posts and a final video project, I'd like more classes like this! And no sitting in class!",1
"Worst professor I have ever had. He has ridiculously hard assignments, which I would spend hours on and the math center tutors couldn't figure out. His accent is hard to understand Doesn't like questions; scoffs and mocks you if you dare not understand. He races through the lecture, then assigns group work and doesn't teach anymore. DO NOT TAKE",0
"The course was so difficult! She was rarely available during her office hours. The lab final exam was too long. Her midterm and the final exams were very difficult. You have to memorize all the notes, the textbook suctions, and the lab manual. It didn't feel like first year course. I will never take another course with her. Very disappointed!",0
Pretty easy class. Just goes over homework problems. Tells oyu which problems are on the test and gives you all of the formulas on the test.,1
"Khoury is very tough but worth paying attention to, if you go to class ready to learn then you can pick up alot... his tests are stupid hard though and have questions on info that he only mentions in passing... he doesn't go by the book so take decent notes and pay attention in class, i got a B- with no reading and little studying",0
Super annoying teacher. I don't see how she has a high rating. Nobody in my class liked her. She was always changing due dates for the assignments which confused everyone and made us miss assignments from time to time. She does drop 4 homework grades though which is nice. Test are very difficult. Her test have two portions; a webtest & in class,0
Not a very good prof.  Teaches the entire course as a mechanical problem solving course and then tests you on theory on the final instead with true/false and multiple choice.  The exam was not representative of what the entire term of course work actually was.  Not willing to engage with students.,0
"Professor Fischer is a good professor. This is my second time having him as a professor. I had him for PHIL001 and the format was exactly the same apart from not having quizzes. Two midterms (20pts each), Attendance (20pts) and Final (40 pts). Exams are short answer questions. As long as you do the readings and take notes, it should be easy B.",1
"He prepared us so well that when I went to Fresno State, in some of my courses, I had to wait for the rest of the class to learn what Mr. Gervasi had already taught us! Fourier series, PDEs, and contour integrals are a few examples. Sad to hear he left because he was the best at explaining complex concepts and I almost changed my major to math.",1
"Prof Wei tries, but fails at making this class interesting at all.  Tests are tricky, but not impossible.  Doesn't really give you a whole lot of time on the final project.  Not a horrible class though.",0
"I thought Elaine was a very good professor overall. She was always telling people to ask questions if they needed help. She was even willing to look over essays and labs before handing them in. People saying she is a difficult professor are just too dumb to ask for help when they need it. I am a geology-chemistry dual major, and I would recommend.",1
"He is very dry, hung up on statistics, uses too many examples but his lectures are well organized & he's very knowledgeable. He isn't very personable or approachable. He's a fair marker but you must study 10 days min beforehand (if you want to achieve a mark above 85) as the course covers a lot of material. Study questions are short answer on exams",0
"Lim is a good guy but hard to follow in his lecture. ECON is hard, but when I felt I understood it I was hit with a curveball. His tests were very difficult. 3 tests, attendance, and homework counts towards final grade. He did not curve any test grades even though the averages were failing grades. Very nice guy, but I wouldn't take him again.",0
"Worst professor I have ever had. Extremely unclear about directions, often makes mistakes on assignments and while discussing material in class. Does not teach, assigns students to watch and learn from youtube videos she doesn't even make, and expects you to know it when you get to class. Please AVOID",0
"He seemed intimidating at first but his lectures (while long) flow really well! Very knowledgeable, good at making 20th Cent fun, lots of interesting aspects about art history when I normally found it boring. He's rather stoic but occasionally cracks a joke, would take again! Make sure you take notes well though, laptops are a good idea!",1
If you are a History major at San Marcos then you must take Professor Ibrahim Al-Marashi. Taking one of his classes is like a right of passage for History major. HIST 384 was an enlightening experience that I would recommend. Al-Marashi's lectures are a transcendent fusion of knowledge and dynamic humor. Take whatever class that is offered with him,1
"An absolute gem. Very kind and genuine. You can tell she want's you to do well and sets you up so if you do the work, youre going to get an A.",1
"Terrible teacher! He made everyone in the class hate math. Worse teacher ever, if you have the chance to choose do NOT take him. He thinks he is funny, and his jokes suck.",0
Dr. Roberts has amazing and engaging lectures on Zoom and she clearly cares that students learn and do well. Biweekly quizzes are reasonable if you study. I recommend her class. I don't know why she has the dream crusher reputation because this class is very doable.,1
Always late to class doesn't teache you hands on . You can't walk out the class without him even knowing,0
"Overall, I enjoyed this class. The subject matter is weird, but not difficult. As long as you read and do the quizzes/discussions, you should get an A. Participation is graded at the end of the course, so make sure you participate throughout the semester.",1
"You're not allowed to use any technology in class & you're not even really allowed to get up and leave the room to use the restroom. She doesn't use powerpoints for her lectures, instead she just talks and writes on the board. I find that really ineffective because it can be disorganized and makes my notes messy trying to keep up. Oh & hw everday..",0
Worst instructor I have ever had. Is not clear with dates of tests.,0
"His style of teaching was alright. But I didn't like his overall attitude, he would curse and say things like 'I don't give a rats a$$' how you do in my class. It was weird, I made a B in the class, but it was TOUGH WORK! Many students failed the class.",0
Dr. Riley was one of the very few professors that made psychology interesting and learnable.,1
"He is the most intellegent man.  He deserves all our respect.  The class is boring, but how many classes are all that exciting?  Very kind man with a good sense of humor.",1
"I loved Dr. Celli! She cares so much about her students, her grading guidelines are clear, and she is very engaging during lecture. Take her class if you have the chance!",1
She arbitrarily takes points off for small things that don't even affect the final answer. Very confusing and rude when students ask her questions she thinks they should know. It's tough material but she flies through it and doesn't help that much. She was also gone for a month and we had a sub and she didn't review what we all basically failed. ,0
"Very sweet woman, and extremely there for you if you need help.  She will always make sure to have office hours and review sessions.  Tests are straightforward, straight from her lectures and powerpoints -- barely looked at book and got a good grade.  Would definitely recommend.",1
"My favorite prof of all time. An incredibly passionate speaker, engages students well. His class makes me want to study film, it makes me want to dive into the history. I can't wait to take another course by him. He is super organised.",1
Do NOT take this professor. He doesn't input any grades. He expects you to learn everything yourself and come to class with questions. He just throws up so problems on the board and solves them and goes over the powerpoint really quickly.,0
"Found her classes difficult. After taking a few with her I'm finally self-defeated and will avoid in the future. VERY discussion heavy. Worth 30% of the grade, and you have to post a minimum of three substantial posts weekly. A tough grader as well.",0
he's great he gives bonus points for perfect attendence  hes real funny (in his own way) his eccentricism will make you laugh trust me,1
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.  worst class/ teacher i have had at Marist.,0
she's a great prof. tough and fair marker. gives great feedback. really wants to help her students.,1
He's a good speaker and keeps very detailed notes. Pretty dry but shows a sense of humor every once in a while. Tests are straightforward and fairly easy.,1
"GREAT teacher!! I was an AP english student in high school, and got really tired of all of it. but she made it interesting, and easy to start thinking again, start caring again. she grades you well if she thinks you've tried, would recomend her to anyone!!!",1
"She told us she hasn't taught this class since 2003- it shows. Don't take this class with her, she makes the class extremely difficult for an introductory course. Is unclear on what is expected, and her office hours are extremely unhelpful. Very passionate about what she teaches, but she needs to learn HOW to teach first.",0
Great professor. My only complaint is he is not willing to work with you even if you have a medical reason. I was out of class for a month due to a concussion. I was only given one day to prepare for an exam on information I had never seen. He was not willing to work with me at all.,1
She is a great professor and easy to pass her class. Just stay on top of things. She also posts all the weekly assignments at once so you can do all the questions in advance if you would like. Very nice and helpful too,1
"The course work is just watching a movie weekly and discussion boards. What I don't like is how she has us post everyday in the discussion and have a ""conversation"" with other classmates. It seems ridiculous to do that because it's just about a movie, then we have to also participate in class. There is just a lot of participation involved.",0
"I really liked how he assigned some mandatory questions and some optional questions so that you knew what was the most important. That being said, it's a lot of homework if you want to do well. Caring professor, but somewhat confusing lectures - I personally found the textbook to be more helpful than his lectures and notes. Tests/exams very fair.",1
The most unlikeable person I have ever met. No one in the class could stand him. His wife is nice but he has no good qualities. Maybe the college could give him some kind of job where he never has to be around people. Avoid his classes.,0
it is near impossible to get more than a B in this class. He taught the material poor inna more complicated way then need. He gave an extraordinary amount of homework that barely pertained to class and his test problems where kinds of problems we have never seen before. He let us use our phones (yes our phones) and were all still failed. DONT take,0
"Maria is what I expect of a teacher, she is passionate about her field,  genuinely wants for you to succeed, and through her creativity and knowledge inspires excitement in you to learn! What is a bonus is that she will go above and beyond to help meet your learning needs, she is super funny, and puts all material into situations you can relate to!",1
"The most interesting and exciting course in the MKT program, but the professor doesn't do it justice. He might once have been good but he's tired of the job and sick of students. Avoids contact, gives confusing/unhelpful/aggressive feedback, but surprisingly marks fair. Will try your patience but you'll get a lot out of the course overall.",0
"Terrible explanations. Doesn't answer questions. Hard to get through a full lecture as he sounds like he would rather be anywhere else. Unsure if its because the topics he is explaining are very elementary or he does not care. I had better highschool teachers, ones that actually seemed like they cared.",0
"I have no problem taking a difficult cousre, but there is a difference from being difficult and impossible. Marv Makes the cousre a lot tougher than it should be. He is unclear when explaining and will mark you off for every little mistake. I would STRONGLY suggest taking another professor. Watts is the worst teacher I have ever had.",0
"He teaches from PowerPoint slides, extremely monotone. Gives homework but its not mandatory. If you struggle with math, I wouldn't suggest this professor his style of teaching isn't a very effective one. Unfortunately if you go to Armstrong campus he's the only professor who teaches Survey of Calc.",0
Mr. Crump is very easy going!! if you do your work and attend all his classes you can easily get a good grade!! ,1
"Very nice person, but cannot teach. Expects you to know everything from all previous math classes. Her class is not curved and the way she grades is extremely strict. Not much partial credit for calculations. She is always willing to answer questions, but that doesn't mean she will answer them clearly.",0
She is definitely not the best Spanish prof out there. She will randomly pick on people from her attendance  sheet (because she doesn't get to know her students' names). She also will go on long rants if you do not know the question; where she is literally scolding you for not knowing the material. Her lecture is scatter-brained as well. Good luck!,0
"I went into this class wanting to be an art history major and came out never wanting to look at a piece of art again.  I'm sorry but Myers doesn't seem to care about his students, and hes INCREDIBLY boring.  Take art history 2 with lynnea wren instead. myers should be avoided if at all possible.",0
"I've had Scovell for 4 classes and he is my favorite here at SU. He is extremely helpful and wants to see you succeed. He WILL NOT fail you if you try. His clicker quizzes can be tough and you will have to read, but the textbooks really aren't terrible and all of the classes I've taken with him have been worth it. I recommend him to all! ",1
"He can be very rude but YOU MUST LISTEN AND TAKE NOTES TO PASS THE CLASS! Also read the book. He puts stuff on the test from the book that he doesn't speak on in class. Lectures almost every class, for the entire class. Has a ton of knowledge on the topic he teaches so it's often worth listening to instead of tuning out. MAKE SURE YOU STUDY!!",1
"I feel Dr. Deeba cares for her students & knows a lot about A&P2 but Stay clear of her, especially if the class is online. The majority/ if not the entire class failed the 1st two exams (60% of your grade). Very little support/ guidance to help you succeed. Test are very difficult and she makes it harder than needed. 1/2 the class withdrew.",0
"Prof. Mazellan is a fabulous teacher!  If I could have him as a teacher for every class I would!  He is not only a professionaly in what he does, but also cares about helping you develope.  He also cares individualy for his students.  He is like a classroom Dad.",1
"He is so rude and scary. On the first day of class, he screamed at us for no reason. He made a joke one time and everyone was too scared to laugh. Once we switched to online learning, he literally refused to teach or post notes. GET THE PRACTICE EXAMS FROM THE TUTORING CENTER; THE ACTUAL EXAMS ARE ALMOST EXACTLY LIKE THEM",0
I hate him with a passion. Don't take him. He sucks.,0
"very oppinonated woman.  Gets on her soap box way too much and plays favorites big time.  Stay on her good side, and be sure to never question a grade she may give you, b/c she will hold it over your head.",0
"This prof was totally disorganized, and is not a filmmaker. Shoot your own film and you will learn more.",0
"Never prepared for class, could never figure out how to work things that he needed to use. VERY boring, and you only get good grades if you see eye to eye with him, not for what you see and can back up.",0
"This guy is ancient - doesn't know enough about computer's to be able to deactivate airplane mode. I'm serious, he literally said his internet wasn't working on his computer, and we had to tell him how to turn airplane mode off. If you want a Professor who knows anything, don't take this guy.",0
"Easily one of the best professor I've had at UCSC. I started convincing friends to come sit in on his lectures with me because he was so inspiring and entertaining. Very easy class. Not a traditional psych class, but valuable none the less. Chose my major based on my experience in Psych and Religion. :) 10/10 would recommend",1
"Dislikes: Talks fast through thought processes that he should really be writing down, clicker questions are not a great representation of tested material, exams are limited to only one hour so you have to race to finish. Likes: helpful one-on-one, makes practice exams available (best study material for this class), lots of grade buffers. Likable.",1
Do not take this professor. She is a tough grader and quick to give out zeros to her students. She does not respond to emails and she is not approachable and will give you attitude if you need to talk to her about something. She is not a fair professor at all.,0
A very very tough grader!,0
"My favorite prof this semester. I took Horror Lit--a lot of reading (with kind of tight time frames, but not impossible) & talking. He leads great discussions with a lot of funny and weird (in a good way) things to respond to. I've never written down so many things to look up for fun after class; he's a walking encyclopedia. No tests; two papers.",1
One word about Hasse.. LECTURES. All he does in class is talks. I would not take his class again. ,0
"I mean it's pretty hard to not pass Dialogue but Professor Oliver is cool and helpful. Become friends with him. He loves talking about his boy but it's cute. I'm sure taking a ""real"" class with him would be good.",1
Tough course.,1
No student should have to take her class. She's terrible.  Doesn't she understand that we go to school to learn and not because we already know the work?,0
"As a person, Hoffman is the best guy out there, but as a professor he is just extremely hard. Lectures are easy to understand, but his exams are no where close to his practice problems. No extra credit, no homework points. He solely grades you on your exam grades. 6 exams in total and your grade is based on total points you receive.",0
"Prof. Yates is a great teacher. Even though the texts are old, he finds ways to make them interesting. There readings are reasonable. He really wants to help you become a better writer and makes great comments on your essays to help you improve. I definitely recommend this class.",1
"Rita can be very rude if you email her and ask for clarification. She will most likely refer you back to the awful lecture videos she posted. she reposts videos from previous weeks. She expects you to remember everything from ACC 212/213, and won't clarify anything if you need it Make a group chat otherwise you won't pass. 10/10 would NOT reccomend",0
Very uninspired. Reads straight from his handwritten notes. Seems like he is just going through the motions. Unfortunately many students have to take at least one of his classes. Gives pop-quizzes? Seriously are we in grade school?,0
Professor Bakewell is one of the most positive and motivational teachers at Rhodes. His passion for teaching and the Classical Studies is contagious. He is invested in making sure absolutely everyone in the classroom is on the same page and goes the extra mile to help you feel at pace and comfortable in the class. MUST TAKE PROFESSOR AT RHODES!,1
Can be rather unclear in lectures but much more understandable if you ask him questions. Plenty of office hours and he encourages people to visit him outside those time slots. Remarkably dry sense of humour and I'm sorry to say that most people are afraid of him. Brilliant professor and very clear about what he wants in class. Beware sorting tests!,1
"Tried my hardest but still failed his class (I'm an A/B+ student too!) His class based on 3 term papers (total of 15 pgs) he grades harder than an English class, super strict. I always pass Eng with an A, but his class I fail, that's how hard he is! I pass his mid-term with a B+ and he still fail me. only offer 1 mid, no final. only term papers.",0
"I absolutely loved her. One of the best math professors I've had. She teaches at the pace of the students. She teaches the material so well though that we are usually ahead of schedule. Also, the homework she assigns are usually difficult, but the tests are easy. As long as you do the homework she assigns, you will do well!",1
"Do not take Alexander. He expects way too much out of a required 2 hour class. He is archaic and dull in his lectures, tests are extremely hard, and he doesn't even make his power point slides available to you. I absolutely regret taking him. I feel that, with another professor, I could have gotten a lot more out of the class.",0
The class doesn't allow much flexibility as the criteria consists of 3 modules where it covers 3 topics per week. . The class is practically on auto-pilot as the lectures aren't even taught by her mostly. Just having some insight from the professor herself post-lecture would be great. Read the syllabus as there is a warning for taking this class.,0
"Lazy. Never stay through entire class. Mostly movies or a short powerpoint. You just have to read 3 books and write an in-class essay. No homework, tests, quizes, or final. Attendance is mandatory but you can sleep through the class and be counted as present. Dry humor but i enjoyed her class.",1
The lectures didn't cover everything and examples are not very helpful for homework project. The final project is very difficult and requires tons of detailed work. Most of the lecture videos are reading off power points.,0
This teacher was easier to work with than some of my highschool teachers.,1
He is very partial teacher. He just gives opportunities to students who are doing research under him or whom he knows. He is very bad for others.,0
Great professor! I loved going to class. There was a massive amount of readings to analyze for exams which were moderately difficult/normal in my opinion but lectures locked my attention. Some students might not have liked the way he taught because he would jump around in ideas and hard to follow in lecture but just pay attention & read - GOLDEN,1
Dr. Woods is a great professor. Sad to see him go from St. John's. The only professor that many people took. He has a very dry sense of humor that you catch if you are listening. He wrote a book and his jokes are actually in the book. It seems like he is reciting the book word for word. I thoroughly enjoyed his class and glad I took it!,1
"Professor Pace is incredible. I took his overseas study course in Paris. He knows so much about the time period and clearly cares a lot about his students. Doable class even it's its outside your comfort zone. Class typically consists of independent research and group reports, but it's all very laid back.",1
"She doesn't try to help you when you need it.She graded an assignment I turned in 2x by mistake 2 completely different grades, A AND C!It seemed liked the more questions I tried to ask,the worse my grades were!When I told her I was going to speak to the Dean, she said she would report me 1st and it would get me no where because she was the teacher.",0
Thought class would be fun. NO WAY. WORST CLASS IVE EVER TAKEN at SDSU. MATERIAL IS SO DULL AND BORING. TESTS ARE HARD AND CONFUSING. LAYOUT OF CLASS IS TERRIBLE,0
"He has great lectures and is rated well by students, however, I find him a very irresponsible prof. Outside of lectures, he doesn't takes your questions seriously, he never looks at your questions carefully and always answers them in a rush. For the few times when I've asked questions, his answers were all wrong after discussions with other profs.",0
"Honestly not a bad person but her quality of lectures is below average, and the test questions are randomly chosen from the same test bank. If you want a good grade, be extremely prepared and read the textbook!",0
Worst professor ever. Do not take her class.,0
"Dr. F gave great feedback and was easy to get in touch with. Quizzes were straightforward, but discussions and essays required more effort.",1
"I am pretty sure he farms, he must live on a farm. He only has 8AM classes. It's crazy. He is abrasive. Sarcasm, is too much in expense of students humiliation.",0
"Great prof.  Clear, knowlegable, friendly.",1
"I absolutely love Professor Matchett. You can tell that he is extremely passionate about chemistry. He always tells us funny stories and uses amazing analogies. He gives good notes, but a lot of homework. But the homework really helps to further your understanding of everything. I did everything I could to get him for 116 and I did. Best choice!",1
"Don was pretty intimidating at first, but he's a really nice guy. He's really quick witted and he makes a concerted effort to learn about his students. I took personal finance with him. The material wasn't particularly difficult, but I found the midterms to be hard because they're very detail heavy. Tough marker but his expectations are clear.",1
"I dont get why people say shes the best. Shes very narrow minded in the sense that she thinks everyone is a bio major with a passion for biology. Quizzes are VERY HARD and VERY SPECIFIC. Exams are easier and more general. Constantly studying for quizzes, everyday for HOURS and only got a B. She is also rude to shy people, she loves attention.",0
"The worst professor ever. She only teaches the basic and expects you to understand everything that comes out of her mouth. Her lectures don't cover 95% of the things that are on the homework and online. If you want to test into the 'B' portion of Math 122, get a calculus tutor the first day of class.",0
Worst teacher I have ever had in my life. Insults your intelligence by talking to you like a child. Everything about this class is unfair. Gave my group a C on our final project even though we followed the guidelines to a T. Brought everyone in my group down an entire letter grade. Consider yourself blessed if you never cross paths with this lady,0
"Nicest guy ever.  Extremely intelligent and definitely knows his stuff.  Tends to lose track of time, but that's just because he gets so into teaching about something.  Explains things crystal clear.  Great class, really interesting!  Good choice for the social science requirement.  Soft spoken guy - hard to believe he was in a rock band for years!",1
"Sinniah is an excellent lecturer. His lectures are clear and informative. Homework and weekly quizzes are easy. His tests are an issue; questions are worth far too many points, so missing 2-3 MC and 1-2 short answer can get you a 70 on a test. Test questions do not reflect lecture and are unreasonable. Would not recommend his course for that reason",1
"His lecture style is all over the place and  I spent most of my time completely lost. He could spend 3-4 days of lecture on one example, so very difficult material. No quizzes, just 3 exams and a final.  Decent guy, funny and VERY smart, but not an effective lecturer. Even with the curved scale, expect to work very hard for a decent grade.",0
great teacher!  I took eng lit after 1750 with her and she's very involved and devoted.  New and interesting assignment ideas.  I enjoyed going to her class!,1
"Rude and not willing to help students, has walked away twice in the middle of me asking him a question about chemistry. Barely finishes lectures before we have an exams and rushes everything, take another professor!",0
"When I first started the class, the professor was so lax and understanding, but as the quarter went on, suddenly we had four or five papers in a row and about a week's time to get them done. I have never been so stressed out about a class in my entire educational career. He is a fine teacher, but terrible at maintaining a college level course.",1
Exams are way toooooo long.  Nobody finishes on time and questions are NOT fare.  Admits that he tries to keep the class average at a low C. DONT take for Gen Bio II.  Take Dr. Ingalls instead!!!  Hardest grader and is the worst bio teacher at Marist.,1
"You are basically on your own in this class. Not helpful whatsoever! Nitpicks the smallest details. I would stay away from this professor!!! Graded on a group project, group paper, midterm exam, & final. VERY tough grader!",0
Puts almost no effort into classes and no effort into supporting students,0
He's a complete weirdo and has horrible strange jokes but he cancels class like 3 times a month and the essay topics are SO EASY,0
"very interesting way of teaching, although she does need to realize that her midterms are actually final exams!!",1
"Répondu à aucun un de mes courriels ou ceux de mes collègues. J'ai eu A+ et me suis très peu présenté en classe. Fiches de lecture et questions d'exam données en avance. Cours relativement facile si l'on met l'effort. Prof tient à ne pas donner plus de précisions qu'il juge nécessaire quant aux évaluations. A part note finale, mauvaise expérience.",0
I wish I hadn't taken his class. The reading was so boring and his test long and difficult. I made a C in the class and counted myself lucky.  I think I got the best grade he gave in our class. Thank goodness he is now retired. I read the other bio's and all I can say is that he lost his zeal and interest in students his last semester at MSU.,0
"She has great stories but she forgets things she's already said and repeats herself constantly, which wastes a bit of time. not specific with things she wants to teach us and insists that we pay attention to her every move to decide for ourselves what parts of her speech are important. I liked her class but there needs to be more order. ",0
He should be fired. I don't know why he is still teaching. DO NOT TAKE this guy. He is the worst professor i have ever seen at pace.,0
"Got a B in class, completly lowered my premed average :( You will have a test everytime you have lab. Test are impossible.Only got a 100 once the whole semester. He tends to go off on a tangent. Very hard although I studied every week. He is available for the the major pratical exams :). You will take about 14 quizes for the whole semester.",0
"Excellent professor, one of the best.  Very caring and committed to her students.  Extremely intelligent and well read.",1
Miserable class. I basically had to teach myself the material. Thank god he offered extra credit or else I probably would have failed the class. If you don't know too much about statistics I would use a different professor.,0
"Amazing Spanish professor! I was always nervous to participate and speak Spanish, but she made me feel comfortable speaking. Participation is CRUCIAL and there are a decent amount of homework  assignments (can be a tough grader). You do not need an access code for her class, but you need the textbook (can get online/used textbook). Awesome teacher!",1
"Took him Spring 2020 (pre/during Covid). Very hard to rate him as he was a great lecturer but would go off the rails about things like going to the bathroom during class, or one time where he got mad at a student for trying to leave for a family emergency during class. Seemed very understanding during the transition.",1
His tests are extremely rough and long. Some questions are not related to the studied topic at all.,0
"Lots of assigned reading (with notes), incredibly tough, her feed back is often delayed and gives no direction.",0
His class was suppose to be a fun learning class to work with kids which it was but he was such an odd grader. He never posted grades or kept track of grades so you don't even know how to fight your grade. He gave me a whole two letter grades below what I originally got and I had to call his advisor. I still think I did better then what he gave me.,0
Best instructor I've ever had,1
Ross Shaw is a pretty chill teacher. He isn't overly involved though. Most of the content was textbook reading and note taking from the online lecture. His assignments are easy to understand and if you put in the work on them you'll get a good mark.,1
"I have no doubt that Professor Holmberg is very knowledgeable. That being said, in short, he's an old man. He very easily loses his train of thought, rambles on, repeats himself verbatim multiple times during a single class, laughs at length at his own jokes. The class itself is easy, but at the cost of being slow-moving and boring.",0
"Prof is knowledgeable about the books she teaches and up to date with things that relate to college students--makes the discussion based class more fun. Two big papers but really it, and she offers a re-write for the first.",1
I only took this public speaking course because the school requires it of all majors. It was an absolutely horrible experience. Will never ever take a course with him again.,0
"I took Law and Politics in the Ancient world with Professor Tulin Fall 2015. I enjoyed his class however, the title of the class is misleading. The material is all based on rhetoric which is good to study if you are in a social science discipline. He does have a class attendance policy that will effect your grade.",1
"This professor is extremely hard on his students. His assignment descriptions span tens of pages, and are very difficult to understand even after reading them multiple times through. He is very harsh on due dates, and will not accept late work, which will result in a ""0"". He expects more than is explicitly stated, and I would avoid him at all cost.",0
This guy is really really bad.  He just needs to smile and be open.  It would be painful for Harry Reis to smile.,0
"So Caldwell is a genius. There's no denying that. But, if you don't write in your papers exactly what he believes, you won't get an A. Also, he tends to go on these like weird tangents pretty often. Overall, he's smart, and teaches well, but not the best grader...",1
"Took as a hybrid winter class, so I had to get the book. It's good to have to study from. He's a great teacher and decently funny. He really tries to make sure you understand the material and actually cares. There were 8 homeworks but most of the grading came from the midterm and final. There was a curve on both. Would definitely take again.",1
Did not help when I emailed him with questions about the material. When he did give example they were nothing like what was on quizzes or exams. Exams are worth 70% of your grade so if you fail one you can fail the whole class. This professor sets you up for failure!,0
"Just awesome, period!",1
"Very good prof! He's passionate about social problems and is so informative. He's very funny and throws up peace signs a lot while saying ""know your facts"" LOL facts are a big deal in the class. He's a memorable guy, you won't regret taking him!",1
Alright Aronson is a cool guy for sure... He knows his stuff. I for one found his class to be incredibly difficult however. Make sure you speak up in class! He's a funny guy and will get on your back if you do not. He also takes the time and effort to learn everybody's name by the end of the semester. I took macro with him. DO NOT BUY THE TEXTBOOK,1
"What a joke.  Hoover is a terrible professor!!  He is NOT an educational psychologist.  His teaching style contradicts what the book taught.  He made some tests years ago and all he does he tells you which chapters the tests are over, he does not work, no notes or lecture. Impossible to get a hold of him or contact him.",0
"Took this online over the summer... It was extremely difficult without lecture, because the structure of class is to just do a ton of readings and then answer questions on Skype and write an essay about the readings (at the end of each week). It may work for some people, but I feel like I didn't learn that much or get a good grade.",0
"Corrin is a nice person. However, homeworks are much harder than anything done in class and long. Tests are full of vague questions which make answering difficult even if you know the material. Often she will rush through a lecture and you will not have time to understand. If you want to do well you must depend on the book. Quizzes are every class.",0
"Incredibly interesting, generates good discussion, very very funny.  Wish I had more time in my schedule to take her.  I've heard people complain that she'll mark down people who disagree with her politics.",1
Only three tests. He get so sidetracked that you dont know what to take notes on. Consistently gives inaccurate and unhelpful review before his tests. Only C of my college career.,0
Just dont take her. I walked out of each test thinking I got an a ONLY TO SEE I GOT A C EACH TIME! She is terrible and vague. Lectures way too fast and doesn't seem like she cares since she only teaches this one class on this time slot.,0
I am a chemical engineering major and had her for Calc II she was aweful. I readthe reviews and thought I could still make it. I was WRONG. Do not ever take this class with her you will recieve no partial credit ever and she will sometimes give you impossible questions on hw or exams. Still marks them wrong. STAY AWAY.,0
"Strom claims to be fun and upbeat, but his classes are beyond boring. You can learn everything from the slides that he uploads (which have terrible formatting), but most information is just common sense with a fancy new term to give you something to memorize. He marks very hard and weighs assignments differently than he tells you on the rubric.",0
"very nice guy, cares about his students but his teaching style is horrible. He puts you to sleep, gives you 20 million assignments. You have to read a novel and type an 8 page paper about it. You have to attend a field trip, if you don't then he gives you another 6 page report. 5 pop quizzes where you have to locate places in the world. RETIRE BRO!",0
"An exceptional Human Being, an inspiring teacher and one of the best profs I've had in my life. Intelligent, caring understanding and approachable. She creates a safe place for students to discuss and explore their critical thinking. You will not regret taking her class. No exams just assignments, this class has touched and changed my life forever.",1
"Never imagined writing my own review but this prof was SO bad I felt an obligation to warn future students. AVOID HER AT ALL COSTS. THE worst teacher I've EVER had. She contradicts herself all the time, is extremely unclear, makes easy concepts way harder than they need to be, super picky,takes so many points off for the dumbest things. SHE SUCKS!!",0
"Take this teacher! She's very easy, her tests are easy, everything is just easy...you might even just get bored because it's just too easy. She gives out 100 points of extra credit for different assignments and all you have to do is just be in class that day (no work is even needed to be completed)",1
"Complains about how difficult her job is. The majority of points lost on assignments will be from an inconsistent standard for formatting your work. The least organized professor in the entire department, liable to lose your work. Demonstrates a shocking lack of understanding concerning the use of computers. Wastes lots of time on ranting.",0
He is extremely lecture heavy and very opinionated. He often brought politics into class discussions randomly and went on tangents. The HW was easy but the exams were difficult. Our class average for the first exam was a 66% and he said he was pleased with this score (online). The prior semester mean score was a 68% (in-person). I did not like him.,0
I started on the wrong foot as a freshman and didn't do the homework right away. If you aren't already familiar with what's being taught..... be prepared to teach it to yourself because he only teaches the people that already know it perfectly. Super confusing and definitely has his own way of doing things.,0
"He is incredibly nice and generous with extensions if you ask. He's understanding of the online situation and has worked hard to make the course a little bit easier for us. However, he is a hard marker and values participation in class - so be ready to participate! He also doesn't give very in-depth feedback. Overall he's great if you work hard!",1
"His Math 170 class has made me lose all hope in finding mathematics interesting. He teaches to himself, not to the class, and when he asks a question that no one can answer, he'll get very irritated and yell.  His teaching method is all over the place, and I honestly can't understand what he's asking or trying to teach. Never take him!",0
Great professor. Really cares about the material and is passionate. He makes it interesting to learn about (as much as he can). Tests can be difficult if you dont study and take notes. Assignments are once a week and fairly straightforward and not very difficult. Overall good class and excellent professor.,1
"He is an awesome professor. He is hilarious! However, he really makes you work for a B. An A is exceedingly difficult But overall good professor.",1
"Professor Doubleday makes Russian interesting and fun. You have to go to class and put in the work, but it's worth it. She cares a lot about her students and is willing to help you outside of class. Definitely a class worth taking with her.",1
Very organized - has note guides for every lecture. He is truly passionate about what he is teaching and seems to care that his students understand the material. If you're not a geoscience major the class may seem a little geology heavy.,1
"He teaches you a new way; it will be invaluable to future healthcare workers. He expects you to eat, sleep, and breathe A&P. If you're taking over 12 credits, including one of his biology classes, consider going part-time in order to truly get everything you need from his classes. He also gives amazing context when explaining difficult topics!",1
"He isn't the worst professor. There are only two exams and no book so his presentations are kind of all over, its a pretty easy class but he grades things kind of tough. Everything is a baseline B unless you prove to be better or worse. The writings aren't difficult just broad. My problem is he goes over on time and i have to rush to my next class.",0
"In class we did not discuss the material at all, we just went over the directions for the labs.  Every test was hard considering we were given no guidance.  I like this professor's other classes but avoid physio lab at all costs!!",0
"He loves math and makes sure you like it while you learn.  He is the sweetest, and he trusts student too.  It made me feel so respected and apprecitiated.  If you can't make it in his class, you'll not make it anywhere!  He has the nicest accent and is cute for an older gentlemen!",1
"There's alot of work involved though, but if you do it, you will make a good grade. The only thing that bothered me was even though I took this online, I felt that he never really talked to us in posts or anything. He gave the assignments and you did them. No lecture notes. I wish he would have given his own opinions sometime!",1
"I found this class to be very easy, but had a problem with ONE ASSIGNMENT and my A went to a B.  Had he answered my questions that I emailed, I definitely would have gotten and A, but due to deadline ended up with a B.  You pretty much teach yourself everything.  no help from professor at all.  Book is stupid and hard to follow.  ",0
"She's got the most beautiful green eyes--can be a little distracting.  But overall, she's the best English teacher I've ever had.  I HATE English, but this was my most favorite class ever!",1
Attending lecture is not helpful. He always assumes you know something. He puts high expectation on you but does a really poor job teaching us in a understandable and organized way.,0
Love this guy. He really wants students to understand content and do well. Forever live Armitage Shanks!,1
"I found him to be a great guy but personally his teaching style wasn't for me. He loads you up with a ton of information and doesn't really tell you what you'll need for the tests. You have to connect info to get a good grade, his class is not at all about memorization. If you simply memorize then you'll get a c, maybe a b. But he was a cool guy",1
"Schiano is a great lecturer and knows how to teach what is important. His homework assignments are long, but really help you understand the material well and prepare you effectively for the exams. My biggest issue with him is that he is so busy, he often takes weeks (or even a month or so) to grade your exams.",1
"I took Human Resource Management as an online course and I learned a tremendous amount from it. There were a couple of assignments each week, as well as about 1 quiz per week, but I definitely recommend this class. The tests aren't bad at all if you just take time to learn the information that is on the study guides.",1
"knows stuff, just not how to teach it....stay on her good side and you'll be fin",0
"A really amazing professor and writer. Super sweet and understanding. The last paper assignment is tough and he has high expectations, so do your work! Week by week, a blog is due but they can be long or short. You read a book for every week and only meet once a week. The books are really interesting and worth reading.",1
"Jan is a great professor. I missed a few classes and it was kind of hard to get the notes because there are a lot of extra pieces of information that she says that aren't explicitly said in the lectures. So y go to class or you'll miss stuff. Also even though the tests are online, some of the questions come from examples she gives in class.",1
"Absolutely horrible professor. Her tests literally have incorrect law. Asked multiple attorneys her test questions after, and they confirmed. Avoid her if possible.",0
"If you can tolerate a jolly man giving 1.5 hour long proofs on the chalkboard, this is the class for you.  The course material is interesting, but I would recommend bringing a crossword puzzle to class.",1
"Easiest class I ever took. Exams are given on canvas (don't need to go to a testing center), every assignment is on chegg if you get stuck, final is a project. Most of the grades are on the assignments so just do those, and there is plenty of extra credit to make up for lost points. I got a 97 and have minimal coding experience",1
I'm class of 2020. I would not have been accepted to Public Hlth MS program at UW without taking this course and without his advice. Taking this course changed my outlook for my future. I am indebted to this professor.,1
"If you're serious about poetry or writing in general, DO NOT take this class. Facknitz is totally useless. She has no clue how to lead a discussion or critique, or how to make the classroom a comfortable environment. She may provide you with some good tips one-on-one, but expect to be very bored and frustrated in class.",0
"In this class, the only point that Stockton wants to make is that he knows more about Charleston history than you do- although I'd never expect to know as much as any professor about any subject- could my grade indicate if I learned or not?. . .",0
The worst teacher I had at GVSU. Switching to a different prof when I had her the 2nd time was one of the best decisions I made. Her check plus homework grading system is awful.,0
"Let me just say, That Gregg is probably the worst Cinema teacher I have taken. The other cinema professors are better then this clown. Last time I check having an opinion on a film that you don't agree with. Shouldn't lower your grade. Infact, I have not met any professor who takes points a way for not having the same ideas like others for filming.",0
"Dr. Nadel has very interesting insights into spy literature, its themes and wider social commentaries. If you have a chance, take the course--the reading list is excellent, especially the Conrad novels. Lecture can start to feel a little mentally overloaded at times, because Ira talks nonstop and will hit you with an unending stream of points.",1
"This courses material isn't hard for me, personally PS261 has harder concepts yet i'm doing worse in this course. At the start I went to most of the lectures but as the year went on I found it useless. She has 3 midterms plus a cumulative exam, and each one is impressively difficult even if you studied a lot for it. Good luck and read the textbook.",0
Barry Cooper is a twisted individual masquerading as a professor. The man has clearly never listened to a single lecture concerning the connection of greenhouse gasses and climate change. He should have been booted out of the University a long time ago if they have any respect for scientific practice.,0
"Professor Rowe is the one you want for ECON 1000. Clear with his expectations, a VERY effective presenter/lecturer, and funny. His presentation style is not terribly math-heavy, which is good for an introductory course. Very much want to have him as a prof again.",1
"This semester has been rough, it is all online and he has not been good at teaching or helping students. There are lectures he puts up, but if you do not understand it, he will not help you. Also, the final is FORTY PERCENT of your grade. Definitely would not take him again.",0
"The lectures appear to be put together on the spot and provide nothing useful. The class centres around assigned readings from a book that she wrote, which are long and boring. Tests involve taking one of the sides on issues discussed in the book.. Basically to do well in this class.. learn nothing and read her own book back to her. Brutal.",0
Burkes class was awesome!,1
"She's big on class participation so talk at least once in class and you'll be fine. Do her weekly readings and you'll know what's going on. Fair grader on papers (2 total) if you put in effort and work for a good grade. 1 midterm and final that are fair (2 essays on each). Somewhat interesting subject, good class for an AOK.",1
so glad she isn't teaching statistics anymore...,0
"Caught student's ""cheating"" when they listed other students that helped them",0
"I took the online class intro to programming class. Teacher had clear expectations. Teacher is very well organized and makes learning the material easier. Super helpful when you didn't understand something. Overall, this teacher was great!",1
"Attendance is mandatory if youre not a suck up, she gave me a C+ and I never got below an A on any of the assignments.  Have to attend 1 concert-and write a report.  She spends way too much time on youtube, and loses track of documents often.  Tests are done over periods of days with different sections, keep track of them cause she won't.  Good luc",0
"I ended up having to use notes from other Canadian lit. classes just to understand what was going on in lecture. Disorganized, uninteresting lectures and a prof who won't listen to constructive criticism from students is a bad combo. AVOID AVOID AVOID.",0
"This is not an easy class, you do have to work for it. Take advantage of extra credit opportunities and meet with her one on one and your grade will reflect the effort you put forth. Overall enjoyed class -- mock trials were really fun",1
Nice guy that talks way too much about random crap. He cant stay on topic no matter what and judges you when you ever say something logical. Daydreams often and mumbles to himself when students are working on a case studies. The man must have voted for Hillary Clinton. He overall just doesnt click with society and makes many feel uncomfortable.,1
Barcley is by far one of my favorite professors from WMU. He still gave me an BA-A in the course even though I would pull practical jokes on him. Like sending his snap chat name to his former students and telling them to send him photos of puppies. On the serious note Barcley has helped me to develop as a entrepreneur and a great mentor. -AW,1
Dr. Hansen is a great teacher. I have taken two of his classes and he made both of them very enjoyable. He is passionate about what he teaches which helps make the material more interesting. He is a very reasonable grader and it is not hard to succeed in his class. He is a very friendly person as well and willing to help students outside of class.,1
"Dr. Baker is super helpful, happy, and clear. Her study guides were amazingly clear. I studied those and got 95%+ on the tests. Also, she's very willing to help you if you have questions and she's very patient. Loved her as a teacher. Plus, she gives you candy randomly through the semester. :)",1
"Vet Tech majors, beware. Dr. Woodard, while intelligent, has not a clue on how to teach. Consistently changes his mind about the material. Write down everything. He often veers off topic and rants about how students are not doing the work rather than teaching so that we can complete it. Will make you want to change majors. Just stick it out.",0
DO NOT take her class.. unless you would study on your own.. the material is pretty easy though.,0
sometimes she doesnt regulate class discussions well which can be frustrating.,1
"Fair grader, sweet disposition, and expectations are pretty clear but beware, he's disorganized. Get familiar with where his office is because you're going to be visiting it a lot.",0
Very frustrating to have as a Professor. Not a clear communicator at all. The readings and lectures are occasionally interesting but usually are just tedious and leave you feeling dead inside. Get ready to dedicating precious hours of your life writing long papers about applying vaguely defined political ideologies to a modern day film.,0
"When I first took cell bio with her, it was tough. After finishing A&P, I think she's one of the best teachers. She teaches what you need to know, and really makes you work to understand it, which is essential! She's also always there to clarifyanswer anything you need!",1
"Professor Pfaelzer assigns way too much reading and is super hard to listen to during class. She is way too tough with grading essays. Rewrites helped a little but she was still hard on these. Her grading is awful and the ""optional extra credit"" final tanked some peoples grades and she didn't include it in others. I would avoid her if possible.",0
This class by far the worst class that I have ever taken at this college. Be prepared to stay up till 4 am 4 nights in a row studying for her quizzes and tests. I have seeked help from her and a tutor multiple times and neither were help at all. I feel she sets us up for failure. She takes forever at the beginning then goes physco at the end. awful,0
"Yue laoshi was excellent, showing a great wealth of knowledge way beyond what was expected. She know the entire history and origin of every single character and had great background and cultural information for many of the topics covered. She was also very aware of the difficulties in learning a new language and was very patient and understanding.",1
"Mike while vague at times does not hold your hand through anything. He will push you to do your best offering guidance along the way, that is only if you ask for it.  Mike typically does not teach a lot in class but gives assignments that will require you to learn something on your own. He spends class time helping those who need it.",1
"Great teacher, really knows his stuff. Easy to approach and ask questions to and is really helpful. Willing to work one on one with you. All around nice guy. Definitely the best teacher I have ever had regarding education.",1
"very bad at explaining the material that he presents in the slides and on the board.  Very monotone, and even sitting in the front row, you can almost fall asleep and the class seems like eternity.  If you can do the homeworks 100% then you will do very well on the exam.",0
"I had Dr. Mahar for FYSM Americans and she made this class very engaging and interesting. There are assignments due almost every class, but she tells you exactly what she expects. Overall, Dr. Mahar is an amazing professor!",1
"lectures are 3 hours and most of the lecture is examples of examples without examples lecture are an hour He is a harsh grader he does make a study guide for quizzes He makes his test straight from the N+ textbook He has ridiculous turn in times, sometimes 2 weeks others 3 days He doesn't give you any lab time, you have to go to the lab on your own",0
"I will admit that I really did not find Richard useful. I did not attend lecture because I could not understand him much. He is also grouchy and he doesn't like ""stupid"" questions. But no matter which teacher you get, getting a good grade depends only on you (and youtube!)",0
He is not understanding. He expects you to be pretty good at programming even though the class is designed for beginners.,0
"Nice teacher, tests weren't to hard and he was very helpful if you go to him and ask.  This class is meant to prepare you for PLSI380, so the final is to write the introduction to a research paper at the very end of the quarter, which is finished in 380",1
"I had her for Psych 291 and did not like her very much, but this upper-level seminar changed my opinion of her. She is friendly and genuinely cares about her students. It's not hard to get a good mark in the class, but it will still make you think. I def recommend that you take it with Wood if you can!",1
Very good professor. She knows her stuff. I learned a lot.,1
I had him during winter quarter and I have him again spring quarter. If you love politics and you identify as a democrat and hate trump this is the class for you. he throws SHADE at the president at least x50 a class. If you are in support of Trump he will do everything to sway into being a Democrat.,0
winter2021. The class was unorganized and schedule was messy and hard to read. Barely taught while giving a bunch of hw everyday. heavy accent. not tech savvy. felt as if the class wasn't prepared in advanced. spent half the class trying to reschedule the test and quizzes.,0
she is totally not organized. she never sticks to the material and is always side tracking. she focuses more on general ideas than specific facts. i never knew what her tests/papers were actually asking.,0
Best English teacher! I would definitely take again,1
"He was great, but I still don't understand why we couldn 't keep our quizzes or at least photocopy them.",1
"Her course is relevant, engaging and unnerving. She demands that you step outside pure critical analysis and question why you are writing said essay to begin with. Her course is an applied narrative study of the rhetorical discourses in a text with emphasis on the real world implications of the text/its interpretations. She offers creative options.",1
"Obscurantist in speech, very clear in publication.  Deliberately confuses pupils.",0
"While he is a VERY tough grader, his class (Pensee politique) was the most pertinent class I have had yet. His lectures are coherent and clear. He explains in the beginning that his lectures are like climbing stairs, one step at a time. That is exactly how he walks you though the course. I enjoyed that his reading were straight to the point. ",1
"To be frank, I found him to be fairly boring and useless when it comes to being clear in his discussions. He focuses on one subject and applies it for the whole quarter... If you are interested in Shakespeare, I advise you all to take him. If not, avoid the class and take a different subject.",0
"He's a good guy, does prepare for his classes somewhat.  He just PILES on the work though.  Only 3 classes this semester where something WASN'T due.  He also passes stuff back late, if at all.  Even if another assignment is based on a previous one, his reponse is ""assume you did it right"".  Twice I had to redo stuff....",1
VERY nice teacher. She was quick to grade assignments and always had positive feedback to offer. She was fair and pleasant to have as a teacher. Had her for 2 classes and wish there were more that I could take from her. Received 4.0 in both of the classes. Thanks for all the help and for being there to answer any questions in a very timely manner.,1
"I asked the professor to extend some assignments due to me getting sick with the virus, and he did not extend all assignments which cost me my grade. The exams were not multiple choice at all and the class average for most was 50%-60%",0
"Not only is Professor Dattolo an excellent professor,but if you need extra help he is always willing to meet you outside of class and spend the time to help you. He is a very special professor and I highly recommend him.",1
"An amazingly hardworking professor that really cares that the students understand the material.  Do not expect the tests to be like anything you've seen before, and he only tests critical thinking, not memorization.  You get to use all notesbooks on the exams so organize all your notes early on so you don't waste time on the test.",1
"For this class there was no real code taught, only theoretical application of different types of searches/search algorithms, etc. You will not learn from the lectures so google is the only way to complete the projects. There was also no feedback on the project scores and the rubrics were as bare-bone as possible, not indicating how he scored them.",0
he rocks.,1
Very passionate about geography. The class is something you definitely need to work for. There are 4 tests throughout the semester that are over 100 questions long and very specific. If you are not a good test taker this could be difficult for you. Ms. Casey is a genuine person and enjoys getting to know the students but takes no nonsense. ,1
"A breakdown of the midterm grades my class got this semester (after curving) A- : 1 B : 1 C : 1 C- : 1 D: 9 D- : 3 F : 9 we were expected to teach the class ourselves, each class a group presented a section from 1 of the 4 books we had to read Each student had to present twice. This, our midterm and final were are only grades",0
"I LOVED THIS CLASS! It's the class I looked forward to every week. You don't need the book, just take detailed notes, you also get to watch a broadway clip before every class! It's a very fun class especially if you like Theatre, it's also an EASY A.",1
"She was very nice, gave a couple days off, as long as you do the assignment with proper instruction you will be fine!",1
"Lectures can be monotonous, but if you do the OWL homework things will become more clear.  He gives practice tests before the actual tests which are basically the same questions just changed around a little.  Curves the tests quite a bit, I would feel unsure about how I did and end up getting at A+.",1
"Professor Schaffer was a very difficult teacher. He lacked in the teaching part and was unclear when assigning homework, DB, and case studies. Even though he was caring, I feel like he didn't have a balance in his teaching. I agree that this is college and studying is part of what you need to do, but he was excessive.",0
"I don't know there wasn't anything special from this prof, he was kind of all over the place and when you would ask him questions he would never give a clear answer and leave you more confused. No extra practice is available so it's hard what to expect is examined.",0
Very frustrating class which was badly organized and maybe understaffed. We finished our last test and had not had only 2 marks back from the entire term which makes it hard to gauge whether or not you're studying the right way. Very strict and alienating to her students. Course material was very interesting though.,0
Idg her bad reviews. I took her in the winter and it was the easiest class. all of mindtap is online and there's one final at the end. Would I say I learned a lot? No Was it an easy A? YES. TAKE HER. GOOD FOR WINTER CLASS,1
"Rosi is really good at explaining the material. If you go to class, you'll learn everything there. The homework is optional, and I didn't do any of it. I studied only before tests. Pop quizzes will get ya. You're grade isn't completely determined by math knowledge, for example, she'll give extra credit for showing up to class.",1
"Has extremely high standards of students and begins the semester showing off awful reviews like prizes. I really dont recommend him for non-psyc majors. You can attend class, review sessions, and study for HOURS and still not manage to get a decent grade. Has to give tons of extra credit to compensate for it.",0
"Very CONFUSING!  Rambles on and tests make no sense and are full of errors.  Don't dare bring this to his attention or ask questions, he will berate you in front of the class.",0
"Terrible Teacher, doesn't teach, has trouble staying on track.",0
"Def my fav prof at Pace. So friendly and will help you out with ANYTHING. I highly recommend her for University 101. Her class was my favorite and so enjoyable! She is an absolute joy and a devoted professor who truly cares about her students and understands them and their transition to college life. IF YOU HAVE THE CHANCE TO TAKE HER, TAKE HER!",1
"Professor Trivedi is one of the best professors at Hamilton. She really cares about you and loves what she teaches. She gives the most passionate lectures. Yes, she can grade harshly, but that will push you to do well. Highly recommended.",1
"i dont think this class was easy. like someone said, u cant come into this class without prior knowledge. and hw assignments were very unclear and difficult, tests were hard! i dont like this class!",0
"If you have never taken Calculus and aren't very good at teaching yourself math, PLEASE do yourself a favor and avoid taking Helmreich. He grades VERY tough on Tests but the material is on what he says its going to be on. He drops a test grade, but again... if you haven't taken Calculus before do NOT take him.",1
"Skerpan-Wheeler is by far the WORST professor I've had at TXST.  She always goes on tangents when she lectures and gives direction only in class when it comes to assignments. She says she'll put directions on TRACS but what she uploads is basically a word document saying ""follow instructions given in class."" I wish I was warned before I took her.",0
The homework level is excessive. Lectures are insanely confusing and fast paced. Avoid at all costs.,0
"She really isn't entirely awful in terms of Phonetics... If you're really interested in the subject, you may want to check out the other option 1st since I feel as though I didn't necessarily learn much. All you need to do is become a frequenter of her office hours. She can be slightly nitpicky at times, but with office hours, it is easy to do well",1
its like he grades to see how many marks he can take off,0
"Best teacher ever. This class is hard, but explains the material well and presents it in an organized way. She is funny, so the class is never boring. The tests are hard, but no trick questions, so study hard. I have never said this, but you really don't need the book. She lectures & tests directly from her lab book. No extra credit this term.",1
"The worst professor I've had so far. He speaks so fast & erratically that it's almost impossible to take notes. For the 3 exams we have to be prepared for multiple possible essay topics. No notes allowed during the essay exam. Super essay-heavy, only 5 multiple choice questions on exams. Save your GPA & skip taking him.",0
"His lecture notes are excellent. During lecture, he just goes through the notes. Only reason to go to lectures is when he teaches the software for the design project. If you go through the notes and practice questions from the textbook, you'll be allright.",1
"very inteligent man, and very willing to help students. Lots of reading and work and tough grader HOWEVER you will learn a lot! recomended to those who are intrested in Poly Sci.",1
"This is by far the worst class I have ever taken. He is not clear with what he is trying to teach and when you ask him questions he answers with ""What do you think?"" If you don't understand politics or have any interest in being a politician, do not take this class.",0
"I agree with the person below:  this guy is the man.  Not easy and a lot of reading (he actually discusses the readings in class, so be prepared), but his lectures are clear, to the point, and interesting.  And he's got a great sense of humor.  Lots of laughs.  If you're going to law school, take this guy.",1
"Katz is an interesting man, love his orange jacket but his teaching style...not so much. Tests didn't reflect the material, got by on my high school physics knowledge. Tests are open book though, which kinda helps.",0
"Professor Athanas is the most confusing Calculus teacher you could ever take. Her tests are hard and a huge time-crunch. I took AP Calculus AB my senior year of high school, as well as getting a 3 on the AP exam, and still failed this class somehow, even after doing all my homework.",0
"Very unaccommodating and not caring. I was registered with SAS while at Mac, and I met with her during her office hours to discuss my accommodations and an upcoming assignment that I required an accommodation for. Her response was that I should just do it and that business is probably not the profession that I should be in due to my disabilities.",0
outstanding teacher,1
easy A for music people-didnt go to his lectures-TA session is FAR more valuable,1
Very knowledgable and very kind.,1
Dr. Addo is always willing to help. You should attend all of the lectures as the class is comprehensive. He is someone you do not want to disappoint and cares a lot about his students. The subject is pretty dry but he does his best to keep the class lively. ,1
"Moira is one of the best professors at STU. She is so sweet and honestly such an inspirational human being (all around awesome). If you take any of the classes within the forensic minor, you will definetely be working for your grade as most things are lab based (takes time). Helps you really take in and understand/apply your knowledge though! (:",1
"She is awsome! I wish she taught pre calc. She comes off a lil strictl in the begin but she opens up. If you are looking to do good in this class, Take her !!!!! ",1
"The content was interesting and Prof. Gentry is so funny. Assignment-wise, there is so much reading that you HAVE to take notes on, 5 speeches, and in-class discussions. You need to put in the work to pass and pay attention. The homework takes a while but stay ahead and you'll be fine. TYPICALLY REQUIRED FOR NURSING!",1
"HORRIBLE TEACHER DO NOT TAKE! I took Anatomy prior to this class for another college and aced it. He barely speaks English!! You can't understand a word he says, mispronunciates every other word. The whole class is lecture...how can they give a lecture class w/a prof you cant understand?!?!",0
"I liked Lecker. His lectures were very interesting and depending on your TA, the conferences can really help clarify things if need. He has really insightful things to say about what we read, he's very knowledgeable about the content&the authors and encourages people to give their own ideas in class. Have the readings done before class, its a must!",1
"His exams are really hard, you MUST read the book and understand it.  Go to class pay attention and take notes.  But in the end I've learned more in this class then many other classes since I had to work so hard, now my Psych 470 class is almost easy since I know so much already",0
"The workload felt like a six credit course and I was not prepared for all the reading. You have to read the very difficult textbook to do the weekly quizzes but don't need it for the final, which is annoying. Studied an hour every day for the whole summer while working full-time and got an A so it's not impossible, it just won't be easy.",0
It was her first time teaching here in Queens College. Avoid her by all means. In the beginning there were almost 30 people in the class and then after a few weeks there were about half left. Get ready to read a lot. Heavy heavy stuff. Honestly doesn't know how to teach well.,0
"Do NOT take! I got an A in the class, but only by intense outside studying. He throws info at you too fast, & lectures PURELY P.P. Print those & bring to class to take notes on. 2 tests (midterm & final), these are VERY hard!!! Must study far in advance- the curve does help a little, but not much. Avoid him at all costs! Take only if necessary!",0
"Pete was an awesome professor! however his slides were SO CONFUSING and extremely ILLEGIBLE, and exams were HARD! I received a B+ or higher in ALL of the pre-reqs to this class and had to drop it.... not good.",0
"One of the more charismatic professors I have had so far, but he can be kind of rude at times. You need to be on your toes in this class. You need to make sure you know the material or he will definitely embarrass you in front of the class. Sometimes his instructions are very unclear. Not many chances to save your grade. Doesn't give extra credit.",0
"NOw this guy is awesome. He's the most intelligent and helpful prof. i've come across so far at McMaster. The only problem is that he is so smart that his mind processes things way faster than the students, so obviously by the time we comprehend what he has just said he has already moved on.",1
"This was one of the most boring classes I have ever taken at GV. He is extremely passionate about the subject and seems like a nice guy, but not a good professor. He just blabbed on for 50 minutes when we could have read the slides ourselves. I would avoid this class at all cost.",0
"He's a beacon of support and wants to see people genuinely succeed in the plastics world. Very knowledgeable guy, ask him a million questions and you will get a million un rude answers. hes the man to sum it up",1
I love Katie Pingle,1
"She gives more work than I've ever had in any class and only ever gives negative feedback, basically everything you do is wrong unless its exactly what she asked for. Prepare to spend 8 hours per homework assignment and its all repetitive. Theres no book, but articles to read for every class on top of huge assignments.",0
"Insall is the worst teacher I've ever had. He didn't teach, he just rambled about unrelated topics. The test were way beyond the scope of the class and the textbook. The class was a giant mess. Very sure he made up our final grades bc I got a C when I scored better on every hw/exam than my pal that got a B. Only non-A I've ever got in a stem class.",0
"She is EXTREMELY EASY. Although, she isnt very clear about assignements. She doesnt come out and tell you about upcoming assignments or when they are due. You kinda have to figure them out for yourself and turn them in whenever you are done. They are very easy though. She is very carefree and as long as you do the work you get an A!!!!",1
fair helpful good overall,1
"Lets get right to the stuff you need to know, shall we? 1) Moves very fast 2) No review before exams (including the Final), he expects you to come in with questions for him, not the other way around. 3) Not much required hw, but there is a lot of ""optional hw""; Exams are almost straight from required and optional hw 4) REVIEW ALGEBRA, please",1
Great teacher. Really funny and talks to you outside of class. Really enthusiastic about material and class is so much fun.,1
"Dr. Overby is amazing! You'll be glad you took this class, which condenses two semesters worth of chem into one. Overby lectures straight out of the textbook, so you can easily follow the outline. I took AP Chem and this was a good review of Gen Chem before moving onto Organic. Dr. Overby is available to help outside of class too. Really recommend!",1
"She reinstated the reading journals...lots of work, but its not that bad and its helpful.  Great class! panel projects are NOT as bad as they sound, their quite fun.  first exam is very doable if you just study for it (if not, your SOL).  second exam is quite interesting....youll know what i mean when you see it.",1
Assigns wayyyyy too much reading for very little quiz and test questions.,0
Best professor ever! Caring and a true Christian. Prof Louters wont give up untill you understand the material. Highly recommended !!!,1
I definitely do NOT reccomend this professor. his quizzes had nothing to do with the material learned in class and his loud teaching style makes it hard to comprehend,0
"His 215 course was one of the toughest courses I've taken at UH, but it's made me a much better programmer. The assignments and exams are rough, but Mr. Chin always is available to help and always answers emails within the hour. Not the best professor I've had but not as bad as most make him out to be. I did hate those 'quiz shows' though!",1
He is really very nice to students.,1
"Marcy was our Feminists for Action mentor.  She was really awesome.  She was a good support, had good ideas, and was fun to work with.",1
"Ive heard many good things about him until I took his class. His attitude is AWFUL, VERY AWFUL. He is one of the most hubristic people Ive met. Hes very good in the subject and helpful but his behavior is just toxic that itll lower your morale. I DO NOT recommend him if youre emotionally unstable. It gets worse if you dont agree with him.",0
"Doesnt even pretend to care if you are struggling. When I spproached him the week before the midterm asking for extra help, he referred me to an online resource that would teach me how to use python.  Lectures are insanely boring and he always stumbles over himself. but, Powerpoint slides make absolutely no sense on their own so still go to class",0
Talks for hours about nothing,0
Stay away from this guy. He is rude and unprofessional. He doesnt know how to teach at all and his book and notes were written in a way that u wont be able to understand it. Seriously idk why this guy is still teaching.,0
"Scherer is an extremely intelligent guy, but a horrible professor. He wizzes through the powerpoints and gets upset when you ask to go back or to repeat. Tests are extremely difficult and there are very little points in the course aside from the tests. A lot of times he talks to you like you're stupid and should already know this stuff.",0
"Dr.Scott is definitely one of the most intelligent, hillarious and helpful professors here! Her ""nerdy-polisci joke"" is my favorite!",1
"Lectures were verbose and almost irrelevant to the weekly assignments. Marking scheme very inconsistent and unclear. Not accommodating at all -- wouldn't give extensions even if a doctors note was provided. Condescending tone, did not value professor-student relationships and 'feedback' was not helpful for assignments.",0
O'Brien really needs to work on her punctuality as well as preparing in class learning materials. All she does is post whats in the textbook like a legit picture of it on the screen and just expects you to learn french from it. Clear criteria for tests and if you specifically study test outline you can get high mark,1
His classes are like big conversations and his exams are super easy,1
"This was the worst professor I've ever had. I'm so disappointed that SVSU employs someone who could care less about his students success. Makes his students feel stupid, scared to ask questions, and does not try to help you in any way. Tried telling me I plagiarized a paper this semester even though I went to the writing center for help! AVOID HIM",0
"Condescending, stammering, not interested in discussion or alternative viewpoints...kind of a jerk sometimes. Says the word ""uh"" about five times in every sentence, making him difficult to listen to for more than a few minutes. I will avoid taking any other class with him.",0
"You're paying her to read from the powerpoint slides. You're paying $15 for an app to let her know you're there. There's also a lot of quizzes that you'll take on the app. Upside* She offers extra credits (Attending the business events and writing about them) Basically, Be ready to teach yourself.",0
Very organized and pragmatic. Easy A or B if you study and practice. I took and failed the course by another prof. He made me change my perception of management science. Nice to have him as an instructor. He gave lots of real life explanations and examples.,1
Sit at the very front as he speaks very low and writes very small. Understand the first 2 chapters very clearly as it is the basis for everything else. His notes are clear but the textbook offers more detail. Speeds through lectures very quickly so it is difficult to follow. Exam problems often have a twist so be familiar with different approaches.,1
"Very clear about what is to be done, inspiring, responsive and helpful, understanding. Good class. I hate speaking in public but it was fun and she's very supportive.",1
Professor Mason was by far one of the worst professors I have ever had In college. If you email her she HARDLY emails you back answering your very important questions unless you follow up with her more than 1 time. She does not care for the well being of her students and doesn't care if they fail. She is unkind and shouldn't be teacher.,0
"Only graded on the midterm and non-cumulative final. I definitely think his class is tough because it's asynchronous and requires chapter readings, but I learned a lot and I think this is a helpful class to take if you're looking into clinical or counseling psychology. Very accessible through office hours or email!",1
She gives so many papers and you will have to read to many articles. The tests are unfair. She is a mediocre teacher and you will be so bored in her class.,0
Classes are not helpful. Doesn't teach or explain well. Marks hard and gives very little feedback.,0
"This is a good class to take if you have others you want to focus on during a semester. She just gives you the answers the class before the test and you write an open book paper every other day. However, if you desire to learn anything your better off with someone else.",1
"This was my only professor using non-synchronous meetings; meaning I could watch the recordings on my own time, at my own pace. He did a wonderful job making the lectures fun and easy to understand. Just a bit of studying and a solid understanding of the material make this class an ""easy A"" with this professor. Wonderful prof choice.",1
Takes attendance every class. Easiest class I have ever taken. He truly does care about his students. The only assignments you'll ever have are a midterm and a final which are both take home essays which he assigns the first day of class. He is all lecture but he tries to engage the class and realizes that some stuff is boring. Really amazing.,1
Honestly What a man. His class is not that bad just read and take the quizzes. He gives you the answers to the CA question in class and if your not sure about your answer you can email him and he will basically give you the answer. Go to class tbh we got ten points one day just for coming. Test aren't bad. Honestly best professor Ive had so far.,1
She's great. The class is really easy. Midterms and final were taken from in-class pop quizzes. Only best 6 quizzes were kept (out of 9). I learned a lot. Never really used the book. I really liked her lecture style. Most annoying thing was that you had to go to office hours to get quizzes/tests back - office hours were like 3 hours after class.,1
"Hilary is a great professor! Hes funny, interesting, and classes for the most part are engaging. Id suggest using Quizlet for easy studying as this class is pure memorization. You'd have to really try to fail this class. Textbook also isn't necessary at all for his portion of RELS1000",1
"It's pretty obvious that she only cares about volleyball because all she talks about in class is how great of a coach she is. She doesn't teach much and the quizzes are horribly unfair. However, if you show up to class, you'll still do fine.",0
"if you don't want to retake this class, don't take BB 450 with Karplus. his tests are rediculous. the first two midterm avgs were 45%. horrible teacher overall.",0
This is by far the worst prof Ive ever had! She can not project her voice and cant explain math concepts in a clear way. When the class tries to seek help from other students she gets mad at us for helping... This wouldnt be a problem if she could actually teach.,0
"Provides a PowerPoint for each of his lectures. There is a book available, but not needed, there is free online text available. Gives out the previous semester's test to demonstrate the test format. All homework is extra credit, helps understand concepts. All quiz and homework are corrected before the unit tests. No cumulative testing.",1
"Plan wisely when its nearing exams because you will have labs, projects and reading assignments on top of it. Its a lot sometimes, but its a good education and is worth it. Chuck is fantastic at teaching and has a great sense of humor. Just be aware of his wrath when its a bad day. Don't be disappointed if you don't get the get the grade you seek.",1
"Overall, this course is quite boring. TA has greater power over marking than prof. If you meet wrong guy, you may fail in this course. When you write a paper, bodies should lead conclusion and be relevant.",0
"Oh so boring.  I slept and read a few extra books throughout lectures.  I thought he was unqualified at the beginning of the class; but he seems to know his stuff.  Lectures are boring.  I'm sure part of it was the material this class covers, but he could have done more with it.  Did I mention his lectures are boring?  Well they are. Very much so.",1
"really good professor like to laugh ,and if you?ll talk to her she will help you also during the test she doesn?t care too much ....good luck",1
"She is so disorganized that she can only really function on a very surface level; she is constantly late to class, she changes lecture subjects willy-nilly in the middle of classes, she's a scatter-brained, disorganized grader, and she writes her assignments incredibly vaguely. She can barely plan 10 minutes ahead, let alone a whole class.",0
Great instructor with years of medical field knowledge.,1
kind of boring...but she's a cutie!!,1
Dr. Byerwalter is very friendly and wants to help! Her online class was well structured and easy to follow. I like that she posts her lectures rather than just a power point and the quizzes and exams are easy as long as you do the reading and watch the lectures. Only one paper and didn't have to do any discussion board posts.,1
She offers extra credit throughout the semester. She is a nice person. I would not take her again as a teacher. The lectures are not taught well. There were a few students who came out of class puzzled by the lectures she gives.,0
this guy is awesome. and sooo dreamy! its a great class. honestly one of the best art classes at depaul. you have to spend a lot of time on the projects but he is a really easy grader. i love him!,1
boring! she has a formula and never deviates from it.,1
Wilputte is by far the most closed-minded prof at STFX. She punishes students for having different ideas than her and will not listen to other interpretations of the text. She is super nice and friendly in class (which makes u want to like her) Also a mandatory class for English majors to fulfil 17/18-Century requirement. Marks unfairly hard.,0
"Unclear in class.  If the material were taught concisely, it could be finished in half a semester.  Not enough examples are done in class, and there are no solutions available to practice problems or past finals.  Final exam was much more difficult than homework problems, but was curved or something... Nobody failed in the end...",0
"I don't understand why everyone on here has had such a rough time with Malcolm. I took a one month Syntax course with her and found she made all points from her own textbook clear and concise. She expects you to work hard and pushes you the extra mile, but I found it was well worth it in the end. Outside of class, she was helpful and compassionate.",1
"Buckle up, and enjoy the ride!",0
Took this class online. Minimal live meetings. Very unclear prerecorded lectures. Difficult to talk to. Would not recommend unless you have to.,0
"I've gone to several office hours to ask more specific questions, and I found him to be rude and condescending. He will help you, but be prepared to feel like an idiot for asking. The first test was similar to the homework problems, but the final was unnecessarily difficult. Find another teacher, if you can. He was awful.",0
"Dr. King is by far the worst instructor I have ever encountered and I have a masters degree in education. Gives zero feedback when you ask for help, poor communication, and lacks organization. I can not believe he is allowed to still be teaching. Do NOT EVER take a class from him!",0
"One of the nicest professors I've had but not the easiest A. If you do all the past exams and make a solid note sheet though, you'll be fine. I didn't really study the powerpoints much. Try to take the class after gen chem so those concepts are fresh in your mind. Also a lot of grade buffers with clickers, quizzes etc..",1
"Don't miss even one day! because you miss one of the pop quizzes and your grades is screwed. Nothing is weighted and the class is just your points added up and divided by 100. The class itself isn't that hard and Exams aren't bad. However, she grades the EBP beyond harshly. Good luck.",0
AVOID DON'T TAKE HIM,0
Jill is a solid professor who is knowledgeable in her field.  She touches on risky subjects in class but does not show any bias and they are interesting for debate.  2 papers and 1 group project with worksheets in between which were not hard.  Would take her again even though she grades tough she is honest and is clear in what she wants from you.,1
"Professor Karush is a good teacher, especially if you actually go to class and participate. I started off doing poorly in his class, but once I began to attend and engage him, I found that he is a teacher who is dedicated to your success. Take him, you will learn a lot.",1
"He gives 4 tests that are confusing the way he words the questions. Not great when he gives very little time to complete the tests. Then there are 2 written assignments that he wants exactly what he wants, tough.  He gives study guides for the test that are poorly formatted so you spend too much time fixing. The guides haven't really helped me.",0
"Read the book. This course is not easy, but if you read the book, pay attention in lectures, and take good notes, you can do very well. Fail rate is high - he warns you of this at the start. It's almost certainly due to lack of following instructions and attendance. Labtutorial is not set up well. Pick your lab partner carefully.",1
She expects a lot out of her students. I often found myself reading the chapter after lecture to solve homework problems - which were nothing like that from the book (they were pretty difficult & would spend on average 6-10hrs for 8-15 questions). Tests reflected the homework questions. She was always available during office hours & answered questi,1
"Took her math skills class. The first day of class was the last day she did any teaching. Everything you do in this class, you're pretty much on your own, go at your own pace (with no instruction). It would make more sense to have everyone on the same page, doing the same work with her teaching us, rather than dumping on us with the textbook.",0
"She's not a bad teacher, but she's really weird and intense, she makes me uncomfortable. If you work hard you could probably manage a B+ but if you kiss her butt you can probably get an A",0
I love Dr. Grapenthin. She is such a sweetheart and will take the time to help you if you don't understand what is going on. Come to class and you will pass.,1
"Thank god hes retiring now because ive never had a more boring, monotone professor. Test are way to short so one question can screw you over and there is only two midterms. He uses wileyplus which ill never understand why. Seems like a nice guy maybe he was just done with teaching.",0
"Overrated. I did the reading and still didn't do well on the quizzes.  I never got called on to participate, either. He only calls on the annoying guys in the class and when I try to participate, he makes me feel dumb. Grades essays at random, says he doesn't look at your name but how come all his favorites get As and I get C's?",0
"Absolutely terrible. This guy didn't even want to teach the language we had to learn. He doesn't understand the problems you'll run into with your codes for the final project, even after you blatantly point it out. He confuses himself and annoys you by saying ""it's not rocket science"" every 10 minutes. Just stay at home and never show up.",0
"He curved the first exam by 28 points. 2 exams and final are the only grades. Although he fails to teach anything, I believe he means best. By far the most un-organized material of any class ever. If you want to actually learn and not rely on a curve to pass, do NOT take this class. N-O-T, not! He also HATES when the markers are dry.",0
Will read ninety percent of poets and one or two outside novels for any given period and tested on all of it.,0
"She's real tricky. The midterm was so easy, like ""I'll trick you into thinking this class is an easy A then destroy you at the final"". The midterm was the same thing as the practice test she gave out so you can just memorize the steps and ace the test. But the final was yikes, maybe it was the strike, idk. but read her textbook you should be fine ",1
Heath was the best English teacher I've ever had!,1
"Chris Vertullo is a really good teacher. She assigns homework but she doesn't check it and tells you that you don't have to do it if you don't want to. Also if you have a 96 average in the class, she lets you test out of the final with an A in the course.  Would take her again",1
He dont know how to teach !!! don't choose his class!!!,0
"DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS! Literally take Psych 412, Psych 452, Psych 470, or ANYTHING ELSE if you need a 400-level psych to graduate. She is the type of professor that makes rules up as she goes. Giving a score of 1 out of 5 was generous.",0
He is a teacher that acts like you already know how to complete this math. I spent most of the class lost. During lectures he talks so damn fast and again acts like we know everything that he's doing.,0
she set up the class really well and gave us clear instructions on what needed to be done. The only bad thing about taking her is that she only gives one opportunity for extra credit and her quizzes as well final exam she does not give you enough time to be able to read the question throughly so really need to be on your guessing game,1
Boring and not worth it. Projects take up so much time and you most likely won't get a good grade on it. Nice teacher tho. You learn a bunch of nonsense. if you decide to learn it lol.,0
"I enjoyed this class. I reference what I learned all the time. We read two books and many excerpts, but it never felt over whelming. Participation was not required, but everyone wanted to join the discussion. 8/10 would recommend. 10/10 with rice.",1
"Absolutely loved having Prof. DeSoto. While his reading assignments can become lengthy  at times, He does an exceptional job tying the readings into the class. Short answer quizzes are given for the reading and are often easy if you have done the reading. Easily the most caring professor at the University. Wants each student to succeed. TAKE HIM",1
If you value your GPA or sanity DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! He is the worst teacher I have ever had at UD. He writes by hand on a projector & it is illegible. Your notes will make no sense & they'll be hastily written. The exams are impossible and all you will do is sit in class and try to follow his bizarre thought train! RUN AWAY! You've been warned,0
Overall his class was okay if you need to take an English class online. I didn't like the way he taught the class. I felt it was more of a Communication class then English. Some of the videos were almost two hours long and you still have a few of them to watch plus some readings.,0
"Very good professor, very good designer! Learned a bunch!!",1
"Do NOT take her class. She treats a 3 credit course like it's a 6 credit course. She has you read 20 pages of the textbook, watch a 60 minute documentary, answer questions for analysis, and answer 10-15 other questions related for the meeting in only a 2 day span. She acts like her class is the only one in the world. Just AWFUL",0
It is a large class but very informative and the lectures are interesting,1
Dr. Write is a brilliant professor and a great mentor!! He is always there if you need extra help outside the classroom. Dr. Wright truly does care about psychology and his students.,1
In all her classes you  have to do a TON of hw that's due.  But she's very straight forward.  A very hard teacher.,0
"Awesome woman, slightly arrogant but that's half the fun plus she'll discuss what she's arrogant about with you after class. 
 
 great woman rooooooowwwwwrrrrrrrrrrrr",1
very tough grader. She knows the material but doesn't know how to teach it to the students at all. Not very helpful when it comes to exams. Her exams are impossible to pass with a a decent grade.,0
"Class is very boring, she is very unclear when lecturing, all over the place with her thoughts, really hard to take notes on it.  Demeaning marks on papers. Not fair. ",0
I must admit the tests were very difficult but I did enjoy the class. She expects alot from your answers and the discussion is great (SPEAK UP IN CLASS). She is sooo helpful at office hours and truly caring about students. She doesn't believe in multiple choice. Expect to study! Not an easy A class but worth it and enjoyable looking back on it.,1
"He's a very tough grader, with high standards.  Does not show up to office hours and comes off as very condescending.  I DO NOT recommend taking this class unless absolutely necessary.  really dampened my interest in this class significantly.  Definitely read the text and don't fall behind, it will help considerably.",0
"shes the best online teacher ive ever taken. Clear grading criteria, and easy A if you read the directions and put in an average amount of effort.",1
"If you read his reviews, yes he cares and will do anything for students, but he is the most disorganized, technology illiterate, unclear, and hard to understand prof at GVSU. He created his own course/projects/objectives which don't align with the book. Many times left class exasperated about assignments/lectures. Don't need a book, as he wrote one",0
"She is a nice professor. Sometimes, she tries to make some jokes during class, but they are not funny at all. I personally don't enjoy the environment of her class. And, you have to go to class; otherwise, you won't know what her slides are about. If you can take other class to replace, just take others. Not suggesting to take her class anyhow.",0
"I had Sigler for Life in Bible Times. This is one of the toughest classes offered at Moody, and I am not among the best students. I asked Dr. Sigler to help me learn to research, and he practically held my hand through the process. This class made me feel like a scholar, molded my Biblical interpretation, and imparted knowledge I use to this day.",1
"Assignment due in 2 weeks, by teaches the material a day before it is due He also comes up with weird projects and all the lab materials provided are not working Overall try to avoid him if you can. Take that into considerations when choosing TEs in 3B and 4th year.",0
"First, look at the ""easiness"" rating and it helps explain the glowing reviews. If you are a good, self-respecting student with intellectual interest, then avoid like the plague. If you are interested in being locked out of class like a 10yr old for going to the bathroom, then sign up. He was formerly a high-school guidance counselor. Remember them?",0
"Not everyone's favorite, but he is extremely knowledgable, has a wealth of experience, and a good sense of humor.",1
"Bio 120 is already a difficult class, it doesnt help that the teacher constantly bamboozles her students with misleading lectures that emphasize topics that may not be on the exams at all or, if are, are only 1 or 2 questions. She doesnt give exam reviews, and her exams are way more in depth than lecture. U need to read the book and study the book!",0
"Amazing professor, very helpful. Learned so much. Had her for A&P I and II got an A+ for both. If you study and do the homework you'll get an A.  Ask the Questions, she will answer.  Very nice and awesome.",1
"thick indian accent and a great sense of humor. he helped me out a lot when i forgot to do some quizzes. reopened them for me and wasn't even mad! gives study guides for tests that come straight from his powerpoints, but he won't put them online so take notes!",1
He's a super nice Prof. Especially for first year students. The problem sets were pretty much challenging and took me a whole week to figure but I think that's because I never went to office hours. However the final was much easier than the assignments,1
"Huge language barrier, and you have to basically teach yourself. You won't understand a lot what he is saying. I don't know how MCTC hired him.",0
"I would like to start by saying that she is a really awesome person.  She is fun to talk to and really cares about bettering her students acting.  However, having said that, she is not the best trained.  Most of her Acting I class is straight from the text book and not much real acting takes place.  If you have experience, this class is frustrating",0
"Horrible professor. She has very unclear expectations when handing out assignments and does not spend enough time explaining what will be on exams. Very rude and disrespectful, has made many students cry and shows absolutely no mercy when students are struggling. Gives only a few examples and expects students to know what to do on tests. AVOID HER.",0
"he's kind of a cornball, but very approachable and very smart.",1
He made up all the missed classes(due to national holiday/ University policy) on Friday nights.,0
"Does not teach. Goes on tangets related to his political agenda. He does not walk through problems, better off reading the text yourself and not attending class.",0
"She needs to retire, like now. I spent so much time and effort on this class and could not get higher than a C on a quiz, an exam, or the final. If you want to watch your GPA tank, be my guest. She could care less if she gives you the material to pass and told me to stop worrying about my C and do better, kind of hard if you don't help me PMat...",0
"My favorite prof of first year. She's so enthusiastic, gets off topic very often but class is entertaining. The material was mostly boring verbs, but as a french immersion student it was an easy A!",1
"The average of his exam in our class was a 47% and the average of the final exam was a 51%. Instead of curving the class or giving opportunities for extra points, he wrote a letter to our class saying that he gave plenty of ""free points"" and that we all need to ""be adults"" and take responsibility for our grades. No attempt to rectify the situation.",0
Unfair grading and a waste of time if you ask me. Too many long unnecessary assignments and you won't learn a thing! I know I didn't.,0
I don't recommend taking her class because she is not an organized person. She has no idea how to use canvas and never writes anything down so it's hard to know what the main points of the lectures are. But the worst part is she never goes over any material that is taught or readings so you have no idea what you are going to be tested on.,0
At the beginning Professor Adibe was really understanding and made the class fun but as we got further into the quarter his instructions became unclear and inconsistent. Has very thick and heavy accent which is hard to understand at times. Lectures are long and drag on. Midterm and Final are papers that he doesn't explain well. Would not recommend,0
"Powerpoints are a disaster. Never posts grades, powerpoint slides, or syllabus. Does not give out rubrics for papers or projects. Lectures are just long rambles. Completely pointless class.",0
"Professor Pave is, hands down, the best instructor at SBVC. His classes are interesting and you will receive daily instruction. He is encouraging and allows creativity and free thought. He responds to his email daily and I am sad that I have taken all of his classes that are available at Valley.",1
"He's going to tell you that the class will start busy and relax into the semester. For me, the class never relaxed. Lots of readings and papers every week and a huge paper due at the end. If you want to dedicate the time required to keep up in this class, go for it. But, I heard other professors weren't so demanding.",0
The best professor at Concordia. I wish he taught more classes so I could take them all! He is very passionate about what he does. He is also very understanding and kind of the struggles students go through. He is VERY clear on what he wants. Do the work and you'll get the A.,1
"Should teach at Middle School, rather than teach a Middle School English course at a college",0
"Made a gross class bearable and at times very interesting. He likes to bang on the tables, board and walls repeatedly when he is emphasizing a point which drove some people mad. Lectures are fairly clear but his boards can be messy at times. Overall, great prof and it was a privilege to have him.",1
"I think Eberts is really knowledgeable but NOT very approachable.  His tests arent bad but he doesnt really help you out at all with notes, since he basically just talks about pictures. I also dont like his comments about people leaving his class, what if there's an emergency?!? and why do you care?? its not your problem if they dont wanna learn.",0
"Accounting is really difficult, but Charlie does his best to make sure everyone understands the material. He was a great teacher and I would recommend taking him since it's such a difficult class. You need the book for clarification and he sometimes uses examples from the book, so bring it to class.",1
"Pretty easy class.  Doesn't take attendance but it does effect ""Professionalism"" at end of the semester, speak up in class to earn these 250 points too!  Online exercises are a little hard & the class can be boring talking about basic writing skills, i.e. formatting a paper & punctuation/grammer but still recommend for professional writing practice",1
"This is my second course with him, and it's essentially the same thing - name-drops of famous poets that he knows/knew and long, dry lectures that last the whole class period. He'll ask your opinion on something and then lecture over you anyway. Worth standing because he knows a lot of things, but definitely dull. I was dreading class by the end.",0
"Very knowledgeable, LOVES graphs and charts....  Assigns homework through readings, online discussions, and a separate novel. Studied vigorously and  quiz/exam questions were still so random and specific you'll get a B if you have an incredible memory. Careful on the essays too, miss something hes looking for and you're in C territory already.",0
"Has an accent that makes it almost impossible to understand him. Lectures often don't match what's being assigned. All assignments, including exams, are taken from the book, so answers are available on the internet. Given computer access during exams. Covers half an hour worth of content per week. Easy pass, learned absolutely nothing.",0
His lectures are long. Take notes and record on your phone. He goes so fast that you have to go back and listen and rewrite notes. Too much information per test! Gives extra credit opportunities.,1
"Apparently he lost all his money investing in an app that's supposed to teach your goldfish to twerk, so he recently returned to the teaching game after a decade in retirement. Super awesome professor who simplifies advanced content. The only downside is he randomly loses touch with reality and thinks he's in rural Oklahoma birthing a calf.",1
Over all a good professor however your grade in his class is mostly based off the test he gives you and lab. If you are not a good test taker you might want to keeep your lab grade good because HE DOESNT GIVE HOMEWORK AT ALL. You really have to study for his test because it is a lot of stuff. He does give study guides which is a blessing. Be ready,1
Very nice guy honestly but he's a horrible teacher. Tests are only 25 questions for two and they both really hard. If you're a freshmen like me who got him just take actice notes and maybe you'll get a B but this is a really hard class considering it's only a 1500 course. If you're not a freshmen than please dont take him please dont ever,0
"If you thing you are smart than him, then he will make fun of you in front of all students in the class. Once my classmates show him self up by tells him how to do the question, then he tells him to shut up. I was like ""WHAT"". You are the professor you not suppose to say the thing like that. a lot HW, test are hard, you won't pass by doing all HW.",0
i had her freshman year and she is the best professor omg she is so chill with things and makes class so fun,1
"The Life and Times of Winston Churchill was my favorite class so far. Mr. Thompson really cares about his students and is passionate about what he teaches. He's a bit like watching a children's television show, with a series of phrases he uses every day, and interesting stories and activities for the class to take part in. 10/10 would recommend.",1
"His lecture note are just pointlessly LONG and off-topic.... Same w/ the threaded discussions. If U go to his office, his won't give U a clear answer. It's so dumb. U only get graded on: 4 exams, 2/4 assignments, and a threaded discussion grade.. U won't kno the TD grade until the END!! So be sure to participate... Exams are random and unfair. Rude",0
"I don't hate many people. BUT I HATE THIS PROFESSOR! She is condescending, rude, conflict specific and incredibly uncompromisable. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. She is unfair with her grading, will not accommodate for sick days or family deaths   I'm a white male. one time she said to me, ""People like you need to realize they can't get their way"". wow. ",0
"Looks, teaches, coursework is all trash. When are they going to lock this psycho up",0
"No math teacher has opened my mind to the beauty of mathematics as much as Tuan Le. His asynchronous lectures were clear, concise, and informative.",1
"Dr. Cochrane is a great professor! She will repeat notes, is very helpful with answering questions etc.  She really wants class participation, so do not be afraid to voice your opinion.  The class is interesting and fairly easy.  Two exams and three papers. I would take another one of her classes.",1
"She is the most unhelpful teacher I have ever had. I went into her office hours and she actually told me to google my question! Lecture is pointless to go to but you have to. All she is does is babble on about herself and her stories and how she did this and that. DON""T TAKE THIS CLAASS!",0
"Great lecturer, class content is very engaging. However, his paper instructions are vague and he's a tough grader. He do be kinda mean.",0
Such an awesome professor. I really got a lot out of it and he's a great guy to learn from,1
Probably the best prof I've ever had.,1
"Dr. Cochrane is extremely nice and super helpful! She's an easy grader which makes the course fairly easy as well. Although attendance is not mandatory, she does like to give in class writing assignments on random days worth 100 points relating to the text(super easy read!) so I would suggest attending:) great class!",1
"Weekly quizzes are tough: he will use a lot of trick questions. Greater than half of the class was failing after midterms. It is all theory in EMC, and the questions are of applications. The issue is that he dosn't provide any CORRECT examples. They all have major issues and he moves on and ignores them. Never miss a class or you'll regret it.",0
"Psy216 was not what I was expecting, long boring lectures consisting of slides and that's all. I know why students are acting like millenials when the teacher just reads from her slides and doesn't do much more but expect you to know the material she makes so mundane. I took this class expecting a teacher not a robot. I give this class B. Boring",1
"I have her this semester and so far she is one of my favorite teachers. I got an 84 on my first test, and thats without studying that much. I did the online quizzes and the chapter review questions in the textbook and that was enough for me. I highly reccomend her for general psych, Great teacher!",1
"Seemed like a nice enough lady but has no clue how to use the moodle system based in MSVU, only teacher at the mount that doesnt follow guidelines to post on moodle. Difficult marker when you do all your work on time and try your best, unclear about her expectations and expects you to read minds... would not recommend the course.",0
"She is really hard. There wasn't much take home work besides reading the textbook but she is a really tough grader on papers. Attendence is absolutely mandatory, which isn't so bad, but if you do have to miss you better be in the hospital. She is alright at teaching but is not very approachable for help or questions.",0
Prof. Gold is literal gold and diamonds and platinum take a class w him ,1
"Terrible teacher. Didn't grade any assignments until the middle of the quarter. I didn't know I was doing a bad job, so I didn't know I was supposed to improve. I had to drop out because of this. Very late grader, insane amounts of reading and participation. IF YOU REGISTERED IN HIS CLASS, GET OUT WHILE YOU CAN!!! Especially if you're a freshman.",0
"Idk why he's so lowly graded. I mean, some people in my class don't like him, but he's one of my fav. professors. I mean, it's kind of boring, but come on guys it's a hist lecture! he gives good lectures that are knowledgeable, gives good examples. Never assigns hw. Just study for tests!! U really dnt get many..overall, the class is pretty easy!",1
He has a different sense of humor and he is kinda weird. But I love it. Possibly my favorite professor at Ferris.,1
"She is really sweet. I have statistics with her, which is obviously a lot of work, but she makes it as easy as possible. Lectures are very thorough so its easy to understand the material. I took Stat at community college and it was way harder than Dr Reiser-Danners class",1
"Absolutely the worst professor i've ever had. Calc is already a tough subject, then you add a professor who doesn't teach anything except theories & basically you're out of luck.",0
Very demanding.  Expects perfection.  Heavy workload.,0
"This guy is great. My favorite professor on campus. Just work with him not against him, and trust his restrictions. In the end, he is fond of all kinds of work. The initial limitations he sets forth are more cautionary than universal. If you disagree with, say, his ban on genre fiction, prove him wrong with your work. He won't mind if it's good.",1
This guy sucks at being an advisor.,0
She is a great teacher. She is very funny and explains math very well so you will not fair. Her test is very easy you just have to study.,1
"he's a piano expert and to pass a piano class, well you gotta practice and play piano, what more to say? Oh you also learn piano/pop culture and everything around music.",1
"He is very narcissistic and the way he oriented his class made no sense. The quizzes were absurd and asked verbatim definitions and half the class would fail every one and assignments like his resumes were all about his way. Even when i went home his ""right"" resumes were not right at all and i got bad feedback from companies about his style.",0
"lectures were *excruciatingly* boring. they were somewhat helpful, but youtube videos on the topic did a far more concise job at explaining.   course was pretty hard for some1 who's never programmed before, but it was pretty doable.",0
I would highly recommend Michael as a teacher. He makes English classes fun to attend and is more than willing to help when you are struggling. Gives extensions when needed and is gracious with marking. Going to class isn't mandatory but the syllabus doesn't fully explain assignments so I recommend either showing up or booking a meeting with him,1
Get real practice in negotiating. Lots of stories on how to avoid getting taken in the real world.  Pretty easy tests if you come to class.,1
"He doesn't teach you anything. He gives you work to do and tells you to read the course material from the course website on your own time in order to get the concepts. Basically, you have to self-learn throughout the course and keep up to date with the material or you will get lost quick and won't pass this class.",0
He's cool. Lots of homework. Read the textbook or you won't survive.,1
"Dr. Childs is great! I thought logic was going to be very difficult but Dr. Childs does an excellent job explaining the material and making sure everyone understands! She's very understanding and hilarious. If you want an awesome teacher and an A, take Dr. Childs!",1
"Most think he's tough, but most aren't trying hard enough. If you seek his help, he's always there to offer it. Take everything he says seriously, even if you don't agree. Whatever you do, don't use phones, tablets, or laptops in class. He can have a nasty temper, but he's a great guy if you do what he expects. Would take again.",1
"Whoever wrote those last comments are completely wrong. Mr. Goldiner is by far my favorite teacher at Cuesta. No homework, only 3 tests and 2 essays in the whole semester. He tells you EXACTLY what will be on the test, and it is. No surprises with this teacher he is crystal clear, not to mention really funny. Very intelligent and I learned a lot.",1
Great professor! Very clear grading criteria and tests/quizzes were right from the notes and textbook. Interesting material and class! Highly recommend.,1
"I would absolutely NEVER RECOMMEND this professor. She is the WORST TEACHER I have ever had. She want's people to fail. She grades extremely hard and hates to answer your questions. I didn't believe the reviews until I saw it for myself. I have a GPA of 3.6 and barely passed this class with a c. Students beware, RUN AS FAR AWAY AS YOU CAN!!!!!",0
"About 1,000 merely's per lecture, tends to talk in the third person, and does not encourage questions in class. Very sarcastic whenever questions are asked and does not help outside of class. Gives very little feedback on papers and tests. The only grades are a few tests and essays.",0
"If you miss more than one class he drops your grade by a letter. Extremely rude and misogynistic, wouldnt ever recommend a class",0
Dr. Gwara knows more about Old English literature than anyone has a right mind to.  His passion is contagious.,1
"Unfortunately, this is just a terribly made class that has seen little improvement in the years that it has been offered. McEntie isn't a bad instructor, but his lectures are boring and lots of filter talk. The textbook is not extremely helpful either. I wished they could use articles online since that has helped me much more. Hard class for a 100.",0
"The class only meets once a week. Each class consists of MANY court cases and before each class, you are supposed to have read and taken notes on them. During class, you go over the cases and nothing else. He spends most of class going over the first few and then rushes through the rest. He actually doesn't teach; the students read what they wrote.",0
"I attended every class, participated actively in discussions, did all the readings and assignments completely and on time.  Gives little feedback so it's hard to tell if you're not doing well.  If she doesn't like you personally it will have a negative effect upon your grade.  Do not recommend.",0
"I have never had a math teacher who has been able to break things down like Joanne Myers does. Trust me when I say, you need to get in her class if you have the chance! She has so much respect for her students and genuinely cares for her profession and students. She does her job very well everyday! I wish I could have Joanne Myers for math 121",1
"Brother Hammar is an excellent professor. He is very helpful when doing assignments and writing the papers. He gives excellent feedback and helps you reach your potential. Also get ready to laugh, he tells some pretty great stories.",1
"He offers a lot of extra credit, but I did not learn in class. Basically taught myself everything I understood in that class. Final exam replaces the 2 lowest test scores.... even if you did better on your exams compared to your final. really dumb idea but i wouldn't take him again",0
"HP100 is a great introduction course to the major. Dr. Hoffman touches upon all the specialties of the major through readings, guest speakers, field trips, and group discussion. Attending class is a must in order to do well on the final as all the questions reference past readings and speakers. Relatively, it was an easy class.",1
"Ask yourself why he says what he says and try to understand it from his point of view. There are 3 short answer midterms and 1 final and you have the option to opt out of one of the midterms.  Try to do well on the 1st two to give yourself some breathing room. His grading criteria isn't very clear, but if you can answer in his style, you'll be ok.",1
Excellent Prof.  One of my favorites,1
"He is so funny and energetic, I like his class! Make sure show up to the class everyday, cause he doesn't require any textbook and he doesn't use textbook to teach, so you have to be there everyday for notes! Work for the exam and you will get an A!",1
"the eighth wonder of the world: how did this guy ever get hired? he is disrespectful to students & talks down to everybody! you have to do concert reports, but he won't give you credit for them if he doesn't believe you went, even though you have a ti",0
"Super full of herself. First class she said ""Don't pay attention to RateMyProfessor reviews."" Thinks she's the greatest teacher ever. Super condescending and rude. VERY clearly favors students for non-academic reasons. Whatever you do, avoid at all costs. Seriously.",0
"She is sooo disrespectful. Does not deserve to be teaching at all. Loves those that suck up to her. Community service is fun when one feels like serving, but not being forced to do so. Don't take her class!!!",0
"He is the most unorganized person I have ever met.  Long labs that he doesn't even know what to expect.  He constantly leaves the room.  His explanations are so unclear. Ask anyone on the 4th floor and they will tell you.  The other professors know these things too, but hes been here awhile.  He's a nice guy, but he needs to retire. Blunt, but true",0
Awsome class   as long as you get your photos done by the end of the year you can get and easy A     missing class is ok once in a while but he teaches us alot during those periods and that is the best time to do prints   take this course it is awsome,1
How can someone so openly apathetic and depressing still be employed by the university??  Boring and interesting are not the same thing...,0
He's one of GV's finest.,1
Mrs. Palma is an excellent math instructor. She has good methods of doing math. She keeps you informed of how well you're doing in her class. I strongly recommend her!,1
"Do not take this guy for Java, how are you gonna have a math teacher that is always mumbling and is probably the most boring professors on the face of the earth teach java?  All tests come from book which he doesn't teach.  Save yourself the agony and stay away from this guy.",0
"McCrory is an absolute GOAT. I don't know a single person who doesn't like him as a professor. This will definitely be your favorite class of the semester. Best L201 teacher by far. IF YOU GO TO OFFICE HOURS ONCE A WEEK, YOU WILL GET AN A. Take good notes and you'll think its all ""chump"". I also definitely recommend having a study group.",1
"Not only a tough grader but an unfair grader. DO NOT RECOMMEND WHATSOEVER.  Also she is not afraid to share her views with the class, which I found unprofessional. Definitely an interesting class but it is not enjoyable whatsoever. She does give extra credit options but even is picky with that. DO NOT RECOMMEND.  Not a nice nor understanding prof.",0
He is a very good teacher and makes understanding business very easy. He is funny sometimes and i highly recommend!,1
"Professor Gullì was a delight to have, his accent makes it hard to understand whats going on if youre not really paying attention. Overall a great professor and a great guy.",1
"shes so moody and shes the worst teacher ever, her grading is uncomprehensible!",0
She grades discussion question assign. (which are due once a week) with either a 0 or 100! nothing in between! so just beware! attendance is a must b/c she puts class notes on tests but role isnt taken.Its a LOT of reading too.,1
Wonderful teacher and my favorite by a long shot. I not improved this much with any other art teacher. : ),1
"For MET205, expect 1-3 assignments per week. For MET307 expect at least a lab, occasionally a paper too per week. He's genuinely a nice guy, but he's difficult to understand and often goes off subject. His grading criteria and deadlines aren't clear, and he isn't the best to ask questions if your falling behind. ""Actually,Probably, Use your logic!""",0
His class doesn't seem bad at first. Material seems straightforward and you actually understand it. Then you see the test and realize you were wrong. His exams are typically only 1-3 questions long and the final is like 6 questions. The exams are graded very harshly. Lectures are very boring and repetitive and I personally learned more on my own.,0
"Dr Rocky, is an amazing professor.  She not only gives wonderful feedback on assignments submitted but responds to your email promptly with questions or concerns.  He course is explained to the fullest. I would definitely take more courses with her.",1
Soooooo fine!!! I do not have any idea what he teaches but he is HOT!,1
"I hated Hans. worst professor I've ever had, he doesn't even know Spanish, he constantly asked the class what certain words meant. he just teaches from the textbook that he wrote and there are sooo many things wrong with it. He told he i should just change majors because I failed his first exam... even though he taught terribly.",0
"Awesome professor, very funny and understanding. Attendance is *not* a grade but she will give you extra credit if your attendance is high - and you're not likely to pass if you skip. Everything she talks about is on the quiz with the addition of one or two things you'll have to read on for the exams. Homework is relatively easy. Easy class.",1
"he taught me evolution, and this guy makes me want to be a creationist. His accent is so awful I stopped going to class after the first week. it would have been a very interesting class if it was taught by a different prof.. but i'm warning you- it's impossible to pay attention for more than 10 mins. buy the textbok and sleep in.",0
"Professor Kuhlman makes math fun. He absolutely makes time outside of class if you need it. Yes, the class moves fast. It's his job to get through the syllabus set by the HCC math department. He has to get through the material (and there's a lot) in order to have the class ready for the exams. If you need additional help, you just have to ask.",1
DO NOT EXPLAIN ANYTHING CLEARLY,0
"Very lazy teacher, and he never will answer your emails",0
"This class was extremely confusing as there were 4 different professors for the one course (literature, art, music, history.) I like the professors as individuals don't get me wrong.. but I would NEVER take this class ever again. The lectures are extremely heavy and on boring subject matters. Quizzes every week. Felt like a condensed course.",0
"AVOID THIS PROFESSOR AT ALLLLLLLL COSTS! SHE IS NOT HELPFUL, CLEAR, OR NICE. she makes studnet's feel stupid for asking questions during lectures and zooms through her lectures while trying to cram 3 sections in one. i have taken this class before (a couple years ago) and am more lost than the first time i took it. DO NOT TAKE HER!!",0
"She was an alright professor. Spent a lot more time brow-beating against anglo-saxons, conservatives, and the Catholic church than actually teaching us anything about the Native North Americans. I understand what the natives went through; I've heard it all too many times before. I'm interested in learning more about them TODAY!",0
"Dr. Hurd is a good guy in general, he's really nice and he's funny but he's not the best prof, specifically for online learning. You basically just read the textbook and watch 2 hours of lecture videos a week. He also didn't really give out reviews for exams so you never really knew what to expect on them. A good guy but not the greatest prof.",0
"So far I am not doing so well. It is weird because I am also taking Business and Communication which has the same subject matters and I am getting an A in that class so I am not really sure what the deal is. Also, the software he uses to run the class is confusing... I did not get credit for two assignments because I couldn't even find them!!!",0
If you attend lecture you will pass class. Make sure you take down notes of all of his examples because those usually show up on the quizzes and make sure you study the quizzes because those end up on the tests. He has a very sarcastic personality and is very blunt which is why I found him very funny and loved going to class!,1
"Professor Newcomb is really good at explaining things and actually wants everyone to do well. Also, knows a lot of interesting information so class is always engaging and fun. And he's on point with the dad jokes. Great instructor, definitely recommend and only hope that I'm so lucky that I can be in another class of his.",1
exams are terrible,0
Good lectures that are supported with quizzes and tests. There is a review day before the test where you can ask questions on the review problems.,1
She was a fabulous at yoga 1 and made the class very fun. I am about to take a class this semester with her again.! Great prof.!,1
"Honestly,  the man is not that bad. You will learn a lot from him. Expect to spend a lot of time on homework.",1
"He didn't provide a grading scale. There was no assessment criteria. Group quizzes, a presentation  - which he assigns a few days before you present and a take home final. He suggests wikipedia is the place to find all the information. Some people never had to do a presentation, did they pass? or get excused? Overall doesn't care...",0
"I don't have enough characters to describe how bad this professor is. Made my life miserable and I had to go to the helping center to get home work done . He is a tremendous jerk, he'll tell you that is ""here to help"" and then yell at you for no reason. Anyways, get the quizzes' answers to ace the final and you can manage to get a good grade.",0
You have to take this class very seriously in order to pass but it is not impossible. Professor Smith gives you everything you need in order to pass his exams and mostly all of the material is straight from the book. If you can read through the chapter and comprehend what you're reading you will be fine. BAM takes a lot of time but is not that bad.,1
"DO NOT take this class or professor unless necessary. It is group work that you will be forced to do yourself if wanted done right, material primarily learned from unclear readings done at home, and work graded in the most confusing, worst way in which you can never predict or possibly imagine how to save your grade. A ton of work for no reward.",0
"I took econ at another school, was failing, and withdrew from the class. With Battista I have 97%. She makes econ really interesting - somehow it is my favorite class. She tells you EVERYTHING you need to know, if you attend class (100% necessary with her), take notes, and do ALL the homework, I don't know why you wouldn't get an A.",1
Great teacher.  The only people who don't like him are the students who copy and get caught.,1
Ms. Zink is knowledgeable and subject material. She knows what she wants from her students' papers.  She can be rather challenging at times. She's always willing to help with any questions or comments one might have with her critiques of an individual student's paper. Ms. Zink has high standards and wants her students to do well period.,1
Tends to be monotonous.,0
He was a really nice person but wasn't a good teacher. He had trouble explaining stuff. Since this was my first calc class I do not have a good understanding of calc 1 and now am in calc 2 trying to play catch up. Test's are worth a lot of your grade and in calc 1 somebody else makes the test so he doesn't know what will be on them.,0
He is completely terrible. He has no concept of how to teach physics and how much his students understand concepts. His entire class is based on clicker questions and he expects all students to master physics off of a textbook. I actually can't believe he is a professor in this school and I can only attest to my decent grade to previous classes.,0
"I failed to see any practical value in having us ""simulate"" the activities we could use with our students, most of which revolved around the Consumer Gaze, which I do not use because I find it to be very high school and not exactly intellectual. Also felt Wendy had pre-packaged responses to any comment, so challenging her is out of the question.",0
Professor Hamilton is great. You learn skills in her class that are actually applicable in real life. There is a lot of homework out of the textbook but it is not hard. She is also super understanding so if you need to turn something in late once or twice she will understand. If you do the work you will get an A.,1
"why do people write that Tony ""cares for students?""  As a student, who wants to be ""cared for?""  Maybe those students should be psychology majors instead.",0
Worst professor I have ever had. Miss a class lose a point on your final average. Only have 15 minutes to do a 25 question quiz every week. Over half the class dropped after the drop date. One test class average was a 25.26 ( there were close to 200 students in that class),0
"Stacey Edgar is extremely intelligent and a kind hearted person. She makes jokes about watching tennis, mostly. This class was extremely difficult for me and there was a ton of homework. She is tough to understand in lectures unless you sit in the front. She genuinely does want everyone in the class to pass, even if it may be difficult.",1
"The course syllabus is very good, but Professor turns it into Visual Studio and C# class. Webstrar server deployments feel legacy and have a lot of errors. Go with Azure deployment and don't waste time on the old webstrar. Quizzes every week, and chapter tests every two weeks. All the tests are based on pure theory which anyway no one remembers",0
Not helpful at all. Will tell you to rewrite everything! But the narrative books are interesting.,0
"DO NOT TAKE KERR'S CLASS IN SPRING/summer! even if you're good at math, it's set up to fail. 2nd week of class had 1st test, 3 days later had another test w only 2 days notice before. No way anyone can learn that fast before being tested on. It's not just that it's 7 weeks-had a spring math class before & did fine bc was graded on more than tests",0
"This professor just posted lectures that were pretty interesting, not too long and self paced which I did not mind. Seemed pretty distant most of the time but was not a tough class. Listen to the lectures, take good notes and pass!",1
"The class attendance wasnt mandatory but I insisted on making each session because I love the way he taught. He is hands down the best professor I have ever had. He cares so much about his students and makes the class so fun, it makes you want to participate. He definitely opened my eyes on what I didnt know about the Islam culture",1
"Dr. K is caring and always there to help you throughout the semester. He made a very difficult class a little bit better by being understanding and encouraging and answering every question, however stupid. He does tend to cut into class time to talk about research and fields where concepts are applied, so expect to read the book a lot.",1
"He's actually not that bad, I think.  It's hard to tell whether he is mean, hateful and condescending or whether he's trying to be funny.  Whatever it is though he really needs to work on his personality.  He's a graduate student that isn't ready to be teaching yet.  I've had graduate students before who were amazing, he is not one of them.",0
She's my favorite spanish teach so far. She is really good at explaining grammatical concepts. You have to go to class to practice speaking the language. She grades relatively easy which helps because learning a new language is not easy and you will make mistakes. She speaks very clearly as well.,1
Tests are pretty easy. She's not always very clear when explaining things. Don't fall behind because its hard to catch back up. The reviews she gives are helpful for the tests make sure you do them.,0
Pretty much the rudest and meanest prof I've encountered at university yet. Beware of asking for any test date to be changed even if an emergency has come up - he won't give you anything but a 0. Lame lectures. Tries to be funny but falls short every time.,0
"Terrible teacher, doesn't know how to explain things clear at all. If you ask a simple question, she'll make you even more confused than before. Labs are ok, but tests are all short answers with the exception of 4 multiple choice questions. Take another teacher.",0
"Great professor, always willing to help. As long as you study the ppt slides you will get an A for sure.",1
This class has lots and lots of material you have to memorize. In beginning it's going to be very hard. I sudgest to take lots and lots of notes. Daily HW every class period. Take notes of your hw!! 3 test and then the BIG final. One group project. FEMA TEST also. He is overall a great proffesor and is always there for his students.,1
"Very straight forward online class. Do your quizzes every week -- he gives you lots of time to do each quiz and let's you keep taking quizzes till they're all 100%. And then take 5 exams which basically reuse quiz questions. Do the ""work,"" get an A.",1
"Surprised to see that Bernadette gets low ratings! She was responsive and easy to understand. I took this class online. Once a week there were clear assignments and an exam. This class was a late start class, so it is a lot of information in a short amount of time, but I earned an A grade by completing all assignments and using the text.",1
"Very difficult class. Time goes by slow, lectures are boring pushes his political view sees it as the only view. Dont even attempt talking in his class gets easily annoyed. Attendance is mandatory to pass. Class is taught at a difficult level, get ready to leave class confused, Vocabulary terms are important.",1
He is not a good teacher.,0
Professor Roberts writes the most cryptic notes on the board. You definitely need to read the handouts and take notes more on what he says. His tests are half multiple choice and half essay which he gives possible questions out for ahead of time. the mult choice is a little harder but practicing the essays helps boost your score.,0
She is friendly but overall not a great prof.  She does not value creativity nor does she see things from any other point of view other than her own.  I took this class because it was a prerequisite but it was a total waste of time.,0
3 big projects but besides that almost zero workload,1
"Laura is deceptive: she's very cool and a lot of fun in class, but her assignments can be tricky and she's a tough grader. She knows when you didn't put the work into a project.",1
"Only thing I have to add to this is: she focuses more on poetry than fiction. If you are interested in poetry, take this and she'll teach you how to improve as a poet, but it is also valuable for writers. In fact, on our exam, we were tested only for the poetry readings and poetry terminology; none of the fiction.",1
not helpful at all,1
"The class is simple,just go to class, read, take notes and youll def get an A. The two essays are pretty easy as long as you inlcude what she asks for. Other than that, I would highly recommend her. PS. Use notecards for the exams, makes it 10X easier.",1
"She's very unclear, her lectures are beyond boring, helpful I'm sure but also at times I'm questioning relevancy. The entire class is one long group project which she can be very unclear about, she lets you know when things are due the day before and then when no one turns it she questions why. Pretty easy and fast grader,that is the only plus side",0
Dr. Troup made linguistics seem easy and he always was there for us when we had questions or needed clarification. He lays it all out and that makes for an easy A if you just put forth the effort and show up! :D Best English professor I;ve ever had!!,1
"Would not recommend this class to any upperclassman just fulfilling their grad requirements. Method of grading is completely subjective w/ no rubric attached to any assignments. Feedback is vague and not helpful. Spent 5 hours on one assignment and got 70% and 30 minutes on another and got 100%, inconsistency in grading speaks for itself.",0
"He is hard to understand and gives difficult multiple choice/open ended exams that most people get 50s on. He also fell behind on material. However, all the talk about his curve is true and will raise your grade by like 20%. Do better than the average and you will pass comfortably but it's still orgo, so it definitely isn't a cakewalk.",0
she never opens her eyes while teaching,0
"Very energetic, knowledgeable and funny professor. Sooo cultured, dresses wonderfully and looks like a model. Easy to talk to -definitely my favorite professor at UP!",1
"His class was one of the most difficult I've taken. He's pretty strict about cellphone usage and even going to the bathroom. He will literally stop class to ask you where you're going if you get up to use the restroom. I really just was not into his class, but it might be easier if you enjoy political topics or history.",1
"Cons: This was Professor Israel's first year teaching freshmen. He went very quickly and tended to skip steps in a problem, assuming you would do the math in your head. The tests are multiple choice. Homeworks are on Quest.  Pros: Dr. Israel definitely knows what he's doing. The class is easy if you took BC Calculus.",1
Not recommended at all.,0
"Overall, it was an okay class although I found him a tad self-obsessed and judgmental of anything he deemed lower than himself.",1
AVOID AT ALL COSTS,0
This professor has horrible communication skills. No integrity or willingness to own up when he may have conveyed a wrong message. Extremely unprofessional in his written and verbal correspondence as stated by other students if you don't agree with him. He will attack your integrity as a student if you say you misunderstood anything he said.,0
"It's all clear cut. There are weekly discussion questions and blog posts. You have to submit audio. If you keep a steady pace, it's easy to keep up and a pretty easy A. It's a lot cheaper than other places if language is required. ",1
"Absolutely useless when it came to actually transferring the knowledge to us. The lectures sound like he is talking to a 1st grader, and the exams are not what you are taught. loss of money, time and your mental health. It is ironic that ""psych"" is supposed to care about students' mental health, yet it is the most bogus material. Good luck!",0
He is a TERRIBLE teacher!!  He expects too much out of his students. Half of my class dropped because he was such a hard grader on tests. The only grades are four exams....,0
"This course is similar to AP Bio but goes into more detail. Go to all of the review sessions. You only need to study the review papers he posts every week for the exams. Make sure to do well on the labs, as the grading system is just total points. The quiz questions are usually harder than the exam questions.",1
"This guy is hysterical. He will go out of his way to make sure you get an A no matter how hard you try not to get one. The readings are often bizarre and so is he, but that's what makes him great!",1
"Great professor. His lectures are helpful. There are four tests, easy hw, and group quizzes so there is a lot of clangesto get your grade up. I never opened my textbook and get an A-",1
Dr. Serra is a great professor! The content is very hard... but he is a very knowledgable man and he makes the class worth going to.,1
"I have taken many online classes and I normally do very well in them. In his class, he taught us absolutely nothing. He simply had us read some of the textbook and write a paper, as well as answer 8-10 questions, then we had to respond to 3 people. His class is just discussion boards and papers. He is VERY unprofessional. 10/10 do not recommend.",0
"Does anyone know who Seven Macaw was? No? Does anyone know the astronomical background of Seven Macaw?   Be ready for long, boring lectures with unending rhetorical questions. ",0
Lectures are very unhelpful. Puts trick questions on exams. Exams are held on saturday mornings (we had one the day after halloween). Exam questions have very little to do with teaching material. Book is unnecessary. He makes you buy a textbook he wrote himself.,0
Awful. All she does is talk about her dogs. Cant lecture and pretty sure she doesn't even understand stats.,0
"He's horrible, never take a class with him",0
Professor Felizzi is the best. I even went to him for advice on stuff outside of the class and he was very willing to help.  I wouldn't say his class is easy but he makes it fun and enjoyable. I hope to have him for other classes.,1
"Nice woman, but She goes way too fast. Had specific questions, and she either made me answer them myself (which I didn't know the answers to) or told me I'm doing the steps weird and moved on. Suggestion, if you aren't a fast pace learner or actually want to learn and retain info, take someone else. I'd like to learn, not just pass a class.",0
First week of class is v busy. One discussion (no biggie) + FOUR essay type assignments due within the first week of class. A 400-500 word summary of the chapter due within 3 days of starting class & + another essay intro then read 2 more chapters and repeat the big assignments. He says there's only about 2 essays due a week. Not for the 1st!,0
"Dr. Kass is a very intelligent man, but that is about it. He does not truly care about how his students do. Sure, he ""flags"" questions, but he states multiple times throughout the semester that if you do not understand what he is talking about, consider a career switch. Not what you want to hear from your professor. Also, tries too hard to be funny",0
Super chill!  Easily the best professor I've had so far.,1
Boring lectures and goes on rants constantly. He's narcissistic and has you use his overpriced books as material. 50% of your grade is the midterm and 50% is the final. It's ridiculous and impossible. Do NOT take his class.,0
Professor Nobiletti is very passionate about American history. He brings in current events and films into the class. He has a lot of energy and is very inspiring. This is not the boring history class you took in high school. Be prepared to see the past in a new an interesting way. You will learn about cultural history.,1
"He is an amazing teacher. Makes hard concepts easy to understand. However, he has a temper and can make you feel stupid for asking a question or not knowing something. Do not use your phone in class.",1
He expect student to understand the first time he explain something.. He does not like to explain how he got his answer. If you're  not good at catching on FAST you will fail! quiz every Friday( 10 points). Test are HARD! and nothing like the Homework or anything he goes over in class. This class stressed me OUT!  YES I FAIL. DO NOT TAKE HIM!,0
love the woman! but the class is more like a group therapy session than a class somtimes.,1
"He is such a sweet guy, but I still hate math.",1
"Dr. Yost is actually a good professor. Everyone leaves bad reviews, however this is a college course, and if you want a good grade, you need to put in the effort. If you review the notes regularly along with the textbook, you will do just fine. The lab exams are definitely more challenging, so definitely study ahead of time for those.",1
"Paul Endo was my prof during the COVID crisis. He was not well equipped for this. Many of the usual class activities did not work online. He further had no idea how to use the technology and therefore lectures were often long and tiresome. Would not recommend him but if you have to have him, you'll be okay.",0
"Having moved on to a bigger university, I can say I don't understand what he's doing in Trenton. I didn't like the class, but his views and mine differed greatly. The only complaint I have besides him being too advanced for NCMC is I felt he was too preferential to his own views when grading for an ethics class where there is no set right or wrong.",0
"Knows the material very well but isn't skillful in teaching a class. Rambles. Gets off topic too easily. Isn't fair when providing tools needed for testing or quizzing apart from the famous, ""read the textbook"" line. Doesn't give specific guidelines apart from case studies. Should stay a chairman, but not a professor.",0
"This is my 2nd class with Tudico and he is awful. This class would've been interesting with another teacher but his lectures consist of mostly unrelated ramblings that can make the content confusing. It is obvious that he doesn't care for his students or their education, I think he just likes to hear himself talk. Extremely rude and condescending",0
He knows his material ,1
"Showing up to class and paying attention was ESSENTIAL. Doing the homework is a must- all tests and quizzes are directly from homework but they arent graded. He is rude to people who get answers wrong and will make you feel stupid for asking questions, but ask them anyway. Have to take again for a Calc 3 but not looking forward to it.",0
Boring lectures but you HAVE to take notes that are on the board and important things he says. Theres a big thick handout and a borrrrrrrring textbook you have to read for all 3 exams. No final. Really boring reading and need to stay awake in class to take good notes. ,0
"Wished I would've passed though. I thought the class was fun. He is willing to help but his exams are difficult. Spelling counts so make sure you know what's what. His lectures are short (roughly 45 mins to an hour) but the rest of lab is your time to study. If you are unsure, make sure you ask as many questions as you need, he won't get irritated.",1
"If you study as days go by as how he throws questions on his exams. You will be just fine. Some of his questions on his exams are repetitive, but different numbers as you take next exam, especially piecewise defined functions. If you don't pass his exams, you'll have a chance to correct them and math center will help you if you don't get it.",1
"Dr. Standridge knows his stuff, but doesn't understand the class or how to teach it very well. If you can teach yourself, you'll be fine, but if you get lost, good luck.",0
"He is a great teacher, lots of fun! You watch lots of movies and clips, and all of his notes are on Power Point on the School website. Quizzes for each chapter, but those quizzes are the same questions as the test, so you have seen them before. GREAT teacher! Highly recommended.",1
"Worst professor I have ever had! He is the toughest grader ever and expects absolute perfection. I have never had a class with such an abusive workload. Be prepared to spend at least 15 hours a week on homework, labs, quizzes, and pointless mandatory comments. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!",0
"I dont know where he got the material for his tests. I am a good student and for the first test i read the book, studied and went to every class: C on the test. next test: went to class studied a bit: C. Next test went to class once a week, didnt study didnt read the book: B. difficulty was way to high for a core class. good luck with howard",0
Worst class ever!!!,0
Jasper's is my favorite professor at USCA! I had him for 108 and he helped me and wants me to be successful. I'm currently in his pre-cal class! I wish he could be my professor in all my classes! Take him!! He's awesome! Wants you to learn and succeed! Best professor!!,1
"Favorite professor so far at SRU.  You just have to show up, pay attention, and do the homework",1
"Easy class, all you have to do is a lot of studing. Other than that she is just awesome.",1
He was rude from the beginning and he was rude till the end. He gave me zeros for assignments that I did. The article review makes no sense because I turned the same paper in for a different class and got 100% in the other class and he gave me a 0/100??? dropped my grade 10 points. I email him and ask him to check everything now before I turn it in,0
"Espo is one of my favorite teachers I've ever had, at first he seemed terrifying, but he's truly a funny and nice guy. His class has taught me a lot and we always have meaningful discussions. He's very passionate about what he teaches. Assigns 1 paper a week but they aren't too hard and are usually 1-2 pages. Really improved my writing. ",1
She is even more caring than my mom.  Inspiring and respected.,1
Wouldnt accept google docs because I couldnt get Word to work on my computer,0
"Dr. Taylor is an amazing professor! I took psych 3820 with him because my advisor said he was good. I am so glad I did, hands down the best professor I have ever had. He makes material you wouldn't think be interesting be interesting. I now have him for psych 2285 just because of his teaching style. If you have the chance to take him, do it!",1
"Her lecture may lack in clarity but she does write on the board.  She puts lots of emphasis on lab notebooks, so do the work!  She will help you if you ask for assistance but the lab is so big that individual help is limited.",1
gives out good handouts that outline exactly what is on the tests. very kind professor.,1
"Midterm is 45% and final is 55% of your grade, so pay attention. Textbook super helpful, lectures even more so. If you're thinking about law school his classes will let you know if you want/can/should go to law school.",1
"Very disgraceful professor who loves bullying his students. Has no lesson planned, always asks students hard questions in front of whole class and insults him/her if he/she cannot answer it.",0
"Funny guy, lean but repetition",1
I loved the people in my class and Addi. He's very relaxed about assignments and is understanding.  Hes very helpful when you ask for it and i would take him again. I wouldve gotten a better grade if i worked a little harder.,1
He is a very good teacher,1
There is no real point to this class.  And when you take a test the highest score you can possibly get is a 90 because she will take of points on essays for no real reason.  Think this will be a grade booster?  HAH!  Run!  Run while you still can!,0
"Worst professor I've had through my academic  career. Shows zero knowledge for material outside of the readings. Terrible speaker, very dull.",0
Really nice woman and cares about the subject matter. Adds a bit of humour to the class as well. Problem is she's a little disorganized in her thought processes that make the lectures and concepts really hard to internalize.,0
I enjoyed Prof. Aunave's class. She had so much energy. She has high expectations for her students so be prepared for that. I really felt like my french skills improved by taking her class.,1
One of my 2 favourite Queen's profs!  Baxter is the best,1
"May be an easy grade, but it sure is a stressful one. Professor doesn't teach much. You have to teach yourself a lot of things because she doesn't fully explain stuff thoroughly. Very lazy and a slow grader. Test don't really match what you've learned. Plenty of homework assignments. If you take her you would probably be as disappointed as I was.",0
"I like Yvonne, she's passionate about what she does, she's nice, but I don't like her teaching style. I took Exploring Photography, more like, ""history of photography"", she is way into art and film, you'll be using the darkroom for pinhole assignments and won't be learning much about your digital camera. Lectures are long and not hands on at all.",0
"This class/teacher makes me want to travel back in time and punch myself as a baby.  Moves along Soooo effin slow I just want to get up and leave for 30 minute breaks and come back right where I left off.  Too bad she's got the market cornered on this class offering, I'd definately go another route.",0
Highly suggest paying attention during lecture but also taking the time to teach yourself the information from the book. He relies on both sources of information and sometimes the book is more informative.,0
"Professor Nina is a quick-witted, sharp, outgoing, and deeply compassionate teacher who is committed to the intellectual and emotional growth of her students. She is quick with a joke, a tale, or a well-memorized recitation of some beautiful classical poem or passage. I wholeheartedly recommend taking her class. You will be better for it.",1
"DO NOT take him for lab. I learned the hard way. He grades labs very hard. He's good at explaining at most concepts. Though he does make you feel like you're stupid, when you ask him any question. Just remember...DO NOT take him for lab. You WILL regret it.",1
"Amazing professor. Tests were incredibly easy. Basically look over the slides (which are always available online) and you should be prepared for the test. Short and very easy assignments once a week but otherwise not a super heavy workload. Overall, would definitely recommend this class.",1
"She's an amazing professor!  She helps you step by step through everything.  It's best to show up to class, but she always puts the notes up online right after class. She almost always lets you out early!  And all her quizzes are take home quizzes.  The only downfall is her homework is always on connect and it can be very long.",1
"She is a really nice teacher.  If you need help she will always help you.  You have a midterm, final, a paper, and 2 class presentations (which are really easy).  The class is really stright forward.",1
"The WORST professor I have ever had the unfortunate chance of knowing. She is terrible with directions, does not thoroughly read through submitted assignments & then deducts points because of her terrible reading skills, and takes 5+ days to get back to you on any questions you may have. She also gives you 40 minutes to complete a 60 question exam.",0

"Difficult to understand the lectures, frustrating to work on tedious projects that aren't graded for content (why bother?) A good suggestion would be to use the Blackboard site more, the calender and grade features especially would be helpful.",0
"Chris was an awesome professor and person.  You can tell that he loves his subject and knows a lot about it.  Takes you on bunch of field trips.  Tests are  online, and you have two large project that are easy but time consuming.  Take him, u’ll enjoy his class.",1
"Isabelle seemed really nice and she was probably nervous as she told us it was her first time lecturing for such a large class but man..... she basically just read off the slide, all her own statements were just reworded what she had just said, and she was extremely confusing. There was stuff on the exam we NEVER covered. Goin to class not worth it",0
