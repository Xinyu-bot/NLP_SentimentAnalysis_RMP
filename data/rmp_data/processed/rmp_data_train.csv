"Class is so pointless, all you do is talk about the book he wrote. Did well in the class but would never take him again. He is creepy....just look at his picture.",0
Very flamboyant but still teaches well and helps you understand what he wants done. Cares a lot about participation,1
The professor is basically a live textbook (in a good way). If you don't like watching someone solve math problems though you can just read the textbook. Only part that really sucked was the TA. He's super harsh and mis-graded my homework several times.,1
"This Prof. is very funny and nice. You will need to take a lot of notes, which he will grade. He gives out a lot of quizzes after like 2 chapters. However, they are NOT hard at all. Just make sure you show up to class and take notes! He does give extra credit. I really recommend taking his class.",1
"She's an easy A. Barely have class the entire semester because she cancels a lot. When there is class, she reads through a power point or puts on a movie. There was two big assignments but were an easy A as well. So take her of you don't want to do anything plus she's cool.",1
"Dr. Chisholm is one of the best professors in the College of Ed at U of L. He not only teaches best practices but he models them as well. He is an advocate for giving and receiving feedback. When he gets feedback, he actually uses it to improve the course, imagine that! He is always available to meet with students outside of class. Great professor!",1
You never put a first year teaching in such a serious class,0
Prof. Baez is a very funny and caring professor who takes class to the next level. His lectures were so in depth and he really makes sure that the class knows what is going on with the material. There is weekly homework that he goes over if there are any questions and he hands out an in depth study guide to prepare for the tests. His class was fun.,1
"Amazing professor. Everyday she brought food for the class. But besides this, she took the time to read my essay and fix them. She offered to come to school on a non class day just to sit with anyone who wanted help with their final essays. This is a professor that will help you succeed if you want to succeed.",1
"Sam is really funny and answers all questions in class, providing a stimulating discussion. I took this class during my first semester freshman year and discovered I hated linguistics. Plus, my GSI barely spoke English and was horrible at explaining things. Would not recommend as an intro class. ",1
"Professor Benitt spends more time discussing UFO's and Big Foot, than he does teaching Astronomy.  He is obsessed with neatness and completely irrational.  His teaching style is haphazard and confusing.  He is all over the board, which makes it hard to copy down notes. My notebook looked like a treasure with all of the arrows I had to draw.",0
No Comments,1
"A kind, knowledgeable, phenomenal teacher.  I would recommend any of his classes. He is hilarious, engaging, and intelligent.  This class was so far from my major, and yet I enjoyed class everyday.  Study, its astronomy.  But Looney is fantastic.",1
"Professor Bowles knew what he was talking about and accepted any and all questions with great answers in class.  However, sometimes he went too fast in class and he did not post any of his examples online that he did in class in case you missed.  Overall he was average and I would probably take his class again.",1
Guy does not teach at all. Simply assigns homework problems and gives out pop quizzes almost every class that are based on the homework problems.  Tests are extremely difficult and without reading the textbook and teaching yourself the entire course you will fail. Do not take if you want a good gpa. Attendance only necessary bc of the quizzes.,0
"Wilson is a very sweet professor. She's very confusing explaining projects and assignments, but the cool thing is that she lets you do resubmissions after she grades everything. I didn't learn a lot (which is unfortunate) but at the same time I don't feel like it was a wasted class and I got an A. Just be wary of who you pick for your group!!!",1
Even though we went online I was able to easily complete the assignments. You need to read the textbook or else youll miss a lot of stuff on the exams,1
"This has got to be one of the easiest classes I've taken, and its not even 3 credits, its 4. You only have to sign on once a week. The workload is not overwhelming what-so-ever. Sobie gave quality feedback on all of my assignments. You could tell he actually took the time to read them. Impossible to fail as long as you turn in everything. Easy A.",1
"3 lab reports, a presentation, and a few quizzes. He's a fair grader and he tries to be funny.",1
This was a fantastic class and really enjoyable!  Pam Page showed a lot of enthusiasm for what she taught and was very approachable and very helpful!,1
"Prof always willing to help and doesn't want to move on unless we fully understand the topic. If you aren't that great at math, I 'd take him. He makes understanding the class quite simple. Homework also reflects most of the quizzes/exams.",1
nice pro,1
"Honestly I really enjoyed this class and learned so much. I was intimated by the subject of organic chem but Kiesewetter put my fears aside and really made it understandable. She gives you the notes, just go to class and follow along with the examples. Extremely test heavy but you can drop the lowest exam. Take this class with her she is the best!!",1
Decent Teacher just does not know how to present material in a understandable manner.,0
Professor Liggin is extremely qualified to teach this course. His industry and classroom experience allow him to effectively teach how to read and understand complex plans and do take-offs. He is absolutely very organized and straightforward in his lectures. Even his bold language and character goes a long way in keeping the class engaged.,1
Rambles a bit during class and goes off the subject a little too much. Not very organized just reads off the powerpoint and gives the test from teachers cd. Doesnt put much effort into it. He is very nice willing to help if you ask. Average teacher.,1
Mrs. Zbeida is an amazing professor all in all. She will answer all of your questions to makes sure you understand the material to make sure you pass her class. Mrs. Zbeida will make time for you outside of class to help with any problems you are having with her assignments or material. Her class is very fun and open. She cares about her class.,1
"Professor Doubleday is an amazing professor, especially for learning Russian. The organization of the class is perfect for learning a language, as long as you put in the time and the effort. She always makes herself available outside of class and genuinely cares about her students.",1
"Well, tell you what, take him if you want to learn and pass. 3 weeks more to go, but i will be back with him in fall for TC/IP and next Routing classes. Great lecture, if you missed a class, Professor will post the lecture online that means he care about his student. Very fair with grading.",1
"I had him for strength training as a freshmen because i need an extra hour, however I've never lifted in my life so I was terrified. I have always been a pretty scrawny girl, but that's definitely changed as I became stronger than I ever thought I'd get. He definitely pushes you, but it's for your benefit. He's super caring and an absolute gem!",1
"I took this class using my math lab so it was essentially a hybrid class. He cared about you learning anything and he would always ask if we had questions. The tests were easy if you did the work. But, his grading technique is super confusing... I would definitely take this professor again. He is really nice.",1
professor is amazing and funny. online quickly quizzes based on the chapter questions are not hard you could look in the book and find the answer easily. made a friday 8am lecture not so boring failed the last test before the final and emailed me to retake the test online. the final was online for us so i was able to pass the class with an A,1
"He is the best professor. I'm already a strong science student, but he made me love chemistry even more! If you're having trouble with any concepts, drop by to his office hours or stay back after class and he'll definitely help you!",1
She is by far one of my favorite teachers that  i have ever had. She is so worldly and intelligent and loves to share her knowledge. She is Russian and has a russian accent but that is all it is she speaks perfect english and i would assume english is her second language and she does a great job. I just love her class so much. Def recommend her.,1
I am happy with the way that he runs the class. He is very personal and actually cares about you. He will reach out to you just to see how you are doing. I would have him as a professor again in a heart beat. I enjoyed his class.,1
Tom D'Angelo is a great person and professor. You can tell he really loves what he teaches and cares for his students. I wish more professors were like him! Always open to a discussion and never judgmental about your opinions. Homework is one weekly journal done from the textbook readings. Just show up and read and you will do great!,1
"Very nice professor. He really likes this subject. ME on the other hand find it pretty long, and boring. It is an easy class, and he really puts an effort into it. Lots of writing to do. one group project",1
"I took her class in Winter 2013. Grades fairly, reviews well for all quizzes and tests. Japanese food day is awesome! My Japanese is now up to speed thanks to Professor Garrisi.",1
"Professor Miller leads amazing discussions and has a profound passion for her work. She comes to class prepared and leads discussions that are engaging and interesting. Extremely available out of class, and extremely approachable. She is a hard grader but her class is extremely enjoyable and you learn a lot. One of the best classes I have taken.",1
"He's easy to follow during lecture and he grades everything fairly. If you deserve an A in his class, you'll get it. If you deserve to fail, you'll fail. Great professor overall.",1
"Dr. Misurda gets a lot of hate, some of which I think is justifiable, but Dr. Misurda is definitely one of the best systems professors in CS. His 352 class is difficult, but you'll be thankful when you take OS (452). Once you've taken one of his exams, you know what to expect. Working hard in his classes will prepare you more than the alternatives.",1
Paoline is a great teacher! I loved his class. It goes by fast and he is very intelligent and helpful. Also a smartass which I like. He is very easy on the eyes also. You will learn a TON of info but make sure you show up on time!,1
"A great class, and an excellent professor!  Insightful and well thought out.  Definitely take this class: you will not regret it.",1
"Professor Morgan is definitely an expert in the journalism field, but pretty quirky. This class is obviously paper-heavy, but the articles/deadlines were not too demanding. Grading criteria are not super clear, but he is a relatively easy grader. If you just need to fill a slot and are not actually into journalism, this isn't the class for you.",1
"5 tests, the last being a cumulative final. 2 projects (both short papers). The tests are really easy and you don't really need the book. He provided us with online study flashcards, which were very helpful. Usually takes 1 hour to lecture, very rarely takes up the 75 mins. He is very knowledgable about ABA and I highly suggest him.",1
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS FOR CARIBBEAN BIODIVERSITY!!!!! Class grade only dependent on 3 exam grades out of 4 (1 is a cumulative final). The average grade for the last exam was a low D without the curve. He asks questions that are very specific about something he said during a lecture that he barely mentioned. Very unorganized way of teaching.,0
Amazing teacher I would take her over and over again,1
"No calculator allowed at all. Homework every night, due the following Monday. About a chapter a week done. Lots of examples and notes in class. Thankfully an older textbook. Tests are necessarily hard but go over every concept in the chapters.",1
"Ms. Moody is hands down on of the kindest professors I've ever had. She wants nothing more than to see you succeed. There are SO MANY extra credit opportunities, and she is always accessible outside of class. Every single time you turn in an assignment, expect a full page's worth of constructive feedback, and snacks for the whole class. 10/10",1
"I would never say I was good at math, like at all but Mr. Eisenberg is a really good teacher. His lectures are easy to follow. He has the class set up so that as long as you pay attention & actually try then you will pass with a good grade. He gives you examples of the exact types of problem that will be on the exam & is always available for help.",1
"This man knows absolutely nothing about Muslim Fundamentalism. However, that does not stop him from giving his ""expsert"" opinion every time he can ""grandstand"". Stay away!",0
10/10 would recommend. Really knew the topic and brought in guest speakers almost every week which was really interesting. Tests were open book - take notes on the lectures too!! Easy grader on the midterm paper,1
"Hollis is very passionate about biology, and his passion leaks into his lectures. i wish I could've taken this class in-person because it would've made the experience better. He does have 4 tests plus the final, but he does this to balance out grades. So, if you bomb one test, it's not going to ruin your grade. He's also easy to communicate with.",1
"I wish I had taken him in person, but he seems like a funny guy. The exams are BRUTAL though make sure you study. He is the most accessible prof I've ever seen.",1
I really enjoyed her class and we always had very interesting class discussions.,1
"Stevenson is one of my favorite professors. A&P is hard but she makes it the easiest she can. She knows what she is talking about and is very helpful during and also outside of class. Just like any other class, you do have to actually learn the material but she makes it enjoyable. I 100% recommend taking her for A&P both semesters if you can!",1
"Dr. Fetter is my favorite professor in the Butler MBA program thus far.  It is extremely evident that he genuinely cares about his students.  He tries to lighten up dry classes (such as stats) with humor.  He is clear, concise, do what he says to do and you'll earn an easy A.  He makes himself available to you when you need help.  A++",1
One of my favorite professors this year. He keeps lectures interesting and knows what he's talking about. If you are lost on any of the homework problems he's always willing to help.,1
"Marks was a great teacher, I had forgotten a few assignment and I just asked if I could have an extra day and he said yes and never took off extra points. As long as you participate and try you should get an easy grade. He is pretty easy on grading. ",1
His exams are really hard no matter how much you study you still fail. Dreaded going to his class. He is nice but hard.,0
"Mrs. Wells is very passionate about her job. She likes to make sure that everyone understands her material in class. Homework was asked of us but not necessary to turn in. If you understand the material, tests will show. Show up to class to learn the material and you'll be fine. She also gives reviews before tests which obv helps a lot!",1
I had him for recitation...he's so boring!  He just rambles on and on..maybe he'll be better in anthropology since it's his topic..,0
"As an English teacher, her English really sucks.",0
"AMAZING instructor. Mrs. McGee is the absolute best biology instructor on campus. You will do a lot of reading and assignments along with quizzes and exams, but it is all worth it. You have no choice but to learn in her class because you can't slack your way through. She is hilarious, adorable, and makes biology fun!",1
I absolutely loved Sara. I was so lucky to take her during my first semester just before she left for sabbatical. Super kind to her students and was always super interested in what students had to say about the scripts at hand. A queen.,1
He just talks on and one and on an on. Show up and stay awake and you will pass . It is an easy class just boring.,0
"Amazing, you'll like him! He does have 4 out of class and 2 in class essays but as long as you do the work and revise then you'll be good! He allows discussions which is great so you can understand the topic more! He is also willing to revise your essay and is very convenient and nice. Hands down take him",1
Needs everything to be very specific. do not be general ever!,1
Professor Kuhlman makes Calculus (honors) easy to understand and puts in a lot of work to help students understand tough topics. He is quick to respond to your questions and will spend time with you one on one if you need extra help. He is extremely funny and makes class fun! I would rate him as one of my top professors!,1
"Great microeconomics professor overall, gives extra credit opportunities after each of the 2 midterms. Lectures everyday but not boring.",1
Dr. Tour frequently inserts his personal political beliefs into the course. He is unforgiving and does not like most students.,0
Just gave the exam. Fair exam. Great prof who knows how to engage students,1
This class material is hard to grasp BUT  Michelle makes it easy. I wouldn't take this class with anyone else.,1
Professor Hayden was AWESOME! Took her online during the pandemic and she was helpful. Always tried to help me when I had issues becuz of me job during COVID. She let us text her if we needed help. VEry understanding and patient. I learned a lot of stuff I didn't know. She's a caring teacher that I needed this semester.,1
Great teacher really knows what she is talking about.  Lots of reading for the class but it is all interesting.  Quizes every week.,1
"Professor Antwine is a great professor from what I learned about her in my online class. She however did not respond to her emails, at all. If you truly wanted to speak to her you would have to go to her office.",1
He seems to love his job and is more then willing to help you be successful.,1
"Shartin is a really nice guy and always willing to help. Class is very difficult and hard to wrap your head around. However, if you go to at least 1 extra help session and he gets to know you, you will at least get a C. Was failing class and went to extra help for the final and ended up with a C+",1
Took this class 1st sem. of my sophomore year when I decided to switch my major to psych and it was the BEST start to the major. Her lectures were engaging and I never missed a class or got bored even though it was an 8am. She makes the material easier to understand by including stories of her experiences in the field and using lots of examples!,1
No Comments,1
"I took all her classes when she taught at UCSD. She's genius and changed the way I look at everything, taught me how to think more critically. Lectures were fascinating. To do well, read all your assignments, show up, and see her during office hours--in other words, if you're a good student, you'll do well in her VERY interesting classes.",1
Great class and a caring teacher.,1
"The worst teacher I have ever had from elementary school to college. I took his astronomy course as a visiting student a few summers ago. I go to a college that is ranked top 30 in the country and was expecting to do well in this course. Not only was he an awful teacher, he made you feel stupid for asking questions and if you dont understand.",0
Literally the worst professor I have ever had!!! She is not clear at all of what you are suppose to be doing. There is a research project that is the span of the class and she doesn't let you know what to do until the day before it is due and then gets mad that you didn't start it months earlier. ,0
"I took stats 146 from McNabb summer qtr., hes an excellent teacher, has some great tricks to keep you focused and engaged during class. Extra credit was offered on a handful of occasions. He teaches out of the book, but puts the material in his own words, making everything much easier to comprehend. Highly recommended teacher!",1
"Can't stay on topic in class. Tests you (extremely difficultly) on material you did not ever discuss in class, because he was too busy getting on his soap box for an hour. Also grades on whether your opinion on politics mirrors his- didn't think professors actually did this, I'm disgusted.",0
"I really enjoyed her class, I got the feeling some people were missing her sense of humor, but if you like a little subtle wit with your learning, she's your Prof. Gave great examples, was easy to talk to and ask questions, and helping find answers. Projects are well defined before you start, she gives you a checklist of things to include.",1
He's the best,1
He's the worse profesor.  I recommend not take him !,0
"Ridiculously hard tests, that don't focus on the ""main concepts"" he says he's trying to teach. Lectures are hard to sit through, although he did cut a deal with me when I failed one of his tests. So I can't rate him terrible as a person, just his class sucks.",0
Prof Flores is such a sweet lady. Her 2 midterms were verbatim from the study guide. Just do the reading and you will be fine.,1
He really knows his stuff. He doesn't just teach the material but he helps you understand things about the economy that you will carry into your adult life. Just make sure you READ THE BOOK before class or you will be completely lost. He gives a week to complete each homework assignment which is more than enough. Tests aren't too bad if you study.,1
He was nice in person but would roast me on my essays and never actually told me what I did wrong,0
"Jimmerson is a very caring and dedicated English professor. As a biology major, I hate English but I managed to get an A in the class. You have to try your hardest on everything you turn in to her because she takes off for every little error. With that being said, she does give a little bonus and is very willing to help outside of class.",1
"One of the best math professors I've had! She is very willing to work with everyone and different learning styles. Sometimes the concepts can be confusing, but simply asking her a question will lead to clarification. I would recommend taking her class strongly.",1
All the exams are take home but the problems on the exam are much harder than the ones we do in class. She is a great teacher she helps you a lot just make sure you go to class. I would not recommend and 7 week course. The class moves extremely fast.,1
"Lots of quizzes and homework, no final exam, just a big group project with 5-8 other people, she tries really hard to make it interesting but it just isn't and the concepts are just annoying to have to remember, we get a cheat sheet for exams and she grades attendance. Easy class but veryyyyy boring...",0
Great professor overall super easy if you show up do your work and you'll get an A,1
"She has a very clear voice that will most certainly wake you up. Very engaging and patient, she will wait for you to answer her question no matter how long you take. Attendance is mandatory - she remembers everyone's name.",1
"She is a very smart woman who knows so much about microbes it is unbelievable! Because she is so smart, she can forget at times that we are not on the same level as she is. The class was a lot harder than I expected, but I tried my best and got a B. Just don't give up, not everything is going to be easy, just work hard, go to lecture, study and you",1
Quizzes every week so be sure to study for them. There is a written portion and a multiple choice portion for tests. I recommend writing your notes out in order to help with the written portion. Pay attention in class and write down what he says. He does give partial credit on exams/quizzes. If you get something wrong hell write out the answer,1
She is one of the cutest people I've ever met. She will assign readings but you don't have to do them. They're very short though. She assigns essays but there is always a chance for her to edit it before you turn in the final. She isn't a tough grader on essays but she almost never gives A's. I recommend her if you're just looking to fill a credit ,1
"Although an absolute disaster administratively, Prof Mackenzie is one of the best lecturers I have had at McGill and also one of the most sweetest and generous. The exams were very easy if you went to class and took notes. He also provided and went through past papers that were nearly identical to the exams we had. An absolute gem!",1
Really good and insightfull teacher.  Very relevant application and helpful.,1
"Unorganized- does not follow the syllabus, Tons of HW -so you will never see the day of light. I've taken many online courses and this one was the worst. Does not teach anything. 3 Tests- first one 50 questions; test 2- 75 questions; final 100 Q; weekly discussions and must respond to others; must turn in 10 750 word essays.",0
"Crazy guy, sooooo funny! He is out there but his jokes are funny and keep me tuned in. Pretty easy teacher, just do the work. He is a fun guy. Very scatter-brained!",1
Professor Sheehan is simply a very dull teacher. This was probably the most boring class I have ever taken during my college career and I would not recommend it if your looking for a good interactive geologic experience. I really enjoy geology yet this class was brutal to sit through the lectures(Online format). Very easy A though.,0
Prof Yamazaki is a great and very knowledgeable teacher.  The subject matter can be a little overwhelming at first.  But if you study and know what she covers in lecture you will do well on the tests.  She gave extra credit for the tests and gives in class and pre-class assignments which will help you keep your grade up.  ,1
The lectures are often not relevant to test content.  Test studying can be difficult due to lack of direction in class. Study guide found to be irrelevant.  Working with students was a struggle.,0
Your not going to have a good time.,0
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE HER. SHE IS AN AMAZING TEACHER AND TRULY CARES ABOUT HER STUDENTS!,1
"Prof. Jalpal, knows his Marketing stuff, but he can't teach an introductory class.  Now if your at advanced marketing level than he's your man.  I can't support prof. that says, i don't get paid to provide solution to cases he uses in the class, and so won't handout his solutions.  Also, he has the class do 3 group presentations on same case/day",0
"The majority of my time spent sitting in the class I just think to myself, ""What is this guy talking about?"" For an organizational com course, his lectures are not very organized at all. He has his powerpoints posted online but the points don't make any sense and when he lectures it's all over the place and makes no sense. I wouldn't take again",0
"Jayne has a great knowledge base when it comes to nursing. If you have her for lecture, you will have no problem. If you have her for clinical, however, she is very intimdating, belittling, and angry. Many students have literally felt emotionally traumatized after having her. She will make you feel like you are incompetent and worthless.",1
"Absolutely awful. Didn't get the feeling I could approach her at all, and any questions I would ask, she would end up beating around the bush and not answer them. She treated us like children, talking to us condescendingly and just all around gave us disrespect when some of us have done nothing wrong. Got an A somehow.",0
"Dr. Kelly isnt a bad professor at all. Most of the opinions are based on preliminary writing courses the University required, which she really has no control over. Her own classes are very insightful and helpful without an intense amount of work. All required gen-ed credits suck, but her actual classes are great.",1
"Great class. Fantastic teacher. She is very enthusiastic in the material & often explains material several times. Study guides,several animations & videos.Its her first semester so she needed to find her groove  but great ending.Several students missed a lot of class.I attended every lecture.Even gave extra help when my comp. crashed & lost notes.",1
"You have to write, take, and then grade your own tests, FOR A GRADE(This will take you hours). Not to mention the numerous progress reports you have to send her just to tell her you completed another assignment. Do not take this class if it is given online. It will be the most stressful thing, especially when you have to write your own final",0
Not sure how this guy has such a high score. He did a terrible job explaining lectures online and they were short and uninformative. He included stuff that wasnt really covered on exams and homework. Maybe he does a better job in person :/,0
Prof. Conta definitely knows what he is teaching. He has real life stories to tell us about every single subject. Very experienced and respected person. Very friendly and interesting. If you are choosing law enf. as a career you must take his AJ 2 class. Best AJ prof in LACC. He will help you pass this class.,1
"Misurda has the style of teaching being, ""You're on your own"". His lectures are very dry and hard to convey sometimes. For 5 weeks he did his 'slides' on a piece of paper where students would follow and copy notes. Come exam time, he doesn't have them. The class average for that exam was a 60 and our second midterm exam average was a 58. Dont recco",0
"He is very intelligent and caring. He gives you every opportunity to get a good grade. Explains the topics clearly. I took this class before with other professor and had bad a experience, but with him was great. His notes and PowerPoint presentation are excellent. I will recommend him to everyone.",1
Dr. Baddar does an amazing job as a teacher. She helped me tremendously to see my potential as a writer. She will not give you an easy A but if put forth the effort the class is not difficult. Attendance and participation do matter but mainly because Dr. Baddar truly wants you to understand what she is teaching. I would take again most definitely.,1
"Hard lab professor. Tests are hard, material is not covered in class with much help. Couldn't continue because my lab grade was too low with little help from Prof. Stevenson.",0
GREAT PROFESSOR and i wrote that in all caps because she really is a great professor as long as you study and get everything done on time and sometimes set up a meeting with her to go over a lesson you didn't understand in class. Like i would suggest everyone to take her for Pre-calc & Calc you won't regret it. TRUST ME,1
He is an absolutely amazing professor. He knows the material well and is passionate about it. It's pretty easy to do quite well in his class if you just do your work and study for the exams. Plus he is SO HOT.,1
"She was a great teacher, very helpful, and easy to talk to. Plus side she gave a TON of extra credit, even though she said there will be NO extra credit at the first class. This is not a hard class, but intensive I advise you take all the ec u can! downfall.. she talked about herself and personal life too much!",1
"He's super friendly, helpful, and tries to communicate and keep everyone in the class interested, but he isn't a pushover, although he gives some credit for trying, Calculus isn't easy for a fair amount of people and if you're unable to keep up you aren't going to do all that well, but he is willing to help and an SI was available. Good professor.",1
"Everything on those power points. She is a little too happy, never seems sad or angry, talks to students like they're kindergarten students. TOO EASY CLASS, I felt like she wanted to help students pass, one of those easy prof. that have too easy class that doesn't really prepare you for BIO Series at UTSA. You will not find easier BIO Class at NVC.",1
Nelson is a kind teacher who cares for students. She has a monotone voice and talks very quietly. Her lectures are very boring and she talks from the PowerPoints. You can pass the exams by studying the vocabulary words/concepts from posted study guides before each test. You will have to do a project- which is easy! I recommend her if you want a A!,1
"The approach of this professor is to have a seminar style discussion of ancient philosophy. Because of this, you need to do the reading, highlight the main ideas, and be able to interpret them for the classroom. Knowing the assigned material for the day was mandatory when I took the class, yet attendance was not. Testing based on individual's notes",1
"I loved this class, so interesting and really if you put effort into this class you should do well. The biggest thing I can say to remember is to make sure to do everything as there are not that many grades and you will get hurt if you miss more than 3 things. Wonderful teacher and great class, wish I could take it again.",1
She is very nice and I'm terrible in math and passed it with not having to do to much work,1
Great class. I really enjoyed him. He is the best in SE.,1
"When I first took this course the set up of his website was confusing. There will be times where you'll need to email him. He will reply, but he'll have an attitude in the email, so if you like rude professors take him. I felt like I learned nothing after this course. I'm usually an A student too.",0
"Good teacher.  Do the work and get an A.  Lots of extra credit, can only miss a few classes.  Acquired good studying skills, learned how to take good notes. Didn't have to take this class and glad I did.  Keep up with easy homework and can get an easy A. Nice teacher",1
"I took this class during winter session. So it was a 6 week accelerated course, with a lot of information to take in, in a very short period of time. She did an excellent job of covering the material so everybody could understand it, and was willing to help students personally if they were confused on anything.",1
Loved her class! Take her if you want a great English teacher.,1
"Prof. Calkins was amazing! She was the sweetest professor I've had so far. She gives feedback on all of your papers, so keep a look out for her comments. She's very good at answering emails, so if you have a question, email her!! There's a lot of readings and online discussions but nothing unbearable. If there's an issue, talk to her! So sweet.",1
The lab was more straightforward than his class. Just take a prelab and show up for the lab. He is extremely slow at getting through students for grades so you might end up waiting the entire day.,0
"Very good, kind teacher.  The class was super easy, 5 or 6 papers throughout term, hybrid course.  Hardest thing was research paper, but relatively easy if you put your mind to it.  Would recommend her highly and take her again.",1
Very nice guy. he know his stuff. would take him again.,1
"Professor Serpell is incredibly brilliant, but tough - her class was the most difficult I've taken at Cal. Her lectures are great and encourage participation, but expect students to think hard.  I would recommend taking her class, but only to students who actually like English and are willing to put in effort necessary to keep up on readings.",1
great professor. tests aren't easy but you'll learn a lot from the class,1
"You can't avoid taking him, but be ready to self-teach. Lectures are confusing and meandering. Go to office hours with questions to do well. No curve so hard to get a good grade. Very old-fashioned type teacher.",0
"Previous commentor missed out. While Prof. Murphy's  lectures may have been easy to skip, they were also very interesting. Fun class and learned a lot.",1
"This professor is TERRIBLE. I have never seen a professor grade so harshly on DQs. On top of all of the homework I already have, he makes me stress about them. He is not considerate of personal issues going on in your life either. I would never take this class or professor again. I am a 4.0 student and he makes everything 10x harder with these DQs.",0
Dr. Batman is usually confused and unable to write out the answer to his own problem because he forgets steps or starts over three or four times. He really needs a wake-up call because he is failing to get students engaged because they do not understand the material.,0
WORST PROFESSOR I HAVE TAKEN. materials he teaches doesn't make sense.,0
"Dr. Polster is an extremely skilled teacher, and her method of teaching a foreign language is probably the best I've ever seen.  If you're interested in German or just need a foreign language, take Dr. Polster's class and you'll learn something along the way.",1
"Very nice lady, but for the most part she was unable to remain on schedule with going through materials for lectures. Dropped her class after the first test; 85% of the class failed because she did not grade in accordance to the book, slides or study guide she designed herself and told/made us use; was unwilling to discuss why she graded that way.",0
"Shes one of those professors that its impossible not to love her. Shes always taking the time to talk to students and get to know them. You almost feel like shes your friend. Theres 3 papers, you show up to class, write the drafts, you meet with her for a quick conference, she tells you what to fix for the final draft and boom you get an A!",1
"I had this prof. for Spring of 2020 and he very difficult to reach through email. He was very confusing, and unhelpful. Unless you had previous background in it like I did, you will most likely struggle. I had to guide quite a few students through the material. Some were promised regrades but did not get a response at all towards the last few days",0
"Only the grace of God was able to deliver me through this course. Just remember, if there is anything you should know about the REAL WORLD, is that you do not owe any form of kindness to someone that makes it a challenge for you. Even for authority.",0
"Definite GPA booster for me, can get 100% on online labs (MC Q's) if you compare answers with ppl. 3% survey bonus marks. Lots of recommended readings, but I barely did any of it (~5-6 pages altogether) and got 95%. Focus on online notes, learning obj, and video questions. Use textbook for reference, or when smthing is explicitly mentioned to know.",1
Venkata teaches a Chemistry course for non-chem majors. The books were interesting and he is very good about responding to questions promptly.,1
I would literally have to make something up about this man to speak ill of him. He is the best & my absolute favorite teacher in the University. He has a passion for what he does which makes it extremely easy for him to make the courses he teaches so enjoyable. I have taken 3 of his classes & plan to take them all if I can before i graduate!,1
I took her 8am psych sport class. SOOO BORING. You have to go to class and do the clicker quizzes that she does just about all the time. Her exams are a bit tricky so you have to read the chapters and study her power points to do well. Not much work outside of the exams though.,1
She is the best psych professor ever! Her lectures are fun and she gives you everything you need to know on the test through the notes she has you write. Her class is just so fun and enjoyable. i never knew psychology was so much fun. Her tests are based on a few chapters at a time. Just go to class and take your notes and youre good!,1
"super cool guy, laid back class. attendance isn't strict, neither is late work (as long as you turn in all projects by the end of the semester). gives a lot of feedback during grading, and overall just a fun teacher to have for art class.",1
She is never clear with what we are suppose to do and she could basically care less if you pass or fail. She is always saying follow directions yet her directions arent even clear. NEVER GET HER!,0
"Great teacher! His lectures are like stories-interesting.You will write the entire class period,so be prepared for your hands to hurt. Make sure you write down everything he says. His tests consist of a little bit of everything in the notes, so study all of it. As long as you attend class, pay attention, and take notes you will definetly pass.",1
His class is super easy. He goes over review and take home exams a week before the in class exam that's identical. You can use those for the exam and you only need the book for homework. I borrow it from the library no point in buying it. He takes attendance seriously so show up and pass. Easy A! I'm taking him for Trigonometry! HW isn't checked,1
"He's such an energetic lecturer- usually I don't pay much attention in class but Professor Ken can get anyone passionate about economics! In fact, it is because of him that I transfered out of management into economics. It also helps that he is v attractive (went to A LOT of office hours)",1
"Great professor! She provides you with all the help needed but don't expect to get an easy A. You have to study for exams and show up to class for attendance. There's one group project, fairly easy. She provides extra credit opportunities so you should def be fine!",1
"The classes went the whole time, but at least half was watching films.  The film selection was really good too.  Tests were basically terminology and not too hard.  The papers due every week were very easy.",1
"Extremely accessible & understanding. The class did have a lot of long readings & a few quiz questions each class about what we read, but they were all simple & interesting. She has since promised to decrease the reading load for future semesters. Class discussions were free flowing & relevant to both class & real world events. 2 tests & 2 papers.",1
"I loved this class! by far one of my favorite classes! it was easy and interesting. Professor Sellers is amazing, sweet and humorous. I definitly recomend this class and did i mention..no book. such a fun class and you will never see movies the way you use to after this class. :D",1
"horrendous and absolutely terrible. her explanations leave you more confused than before the explanation, assignments don't make any sense at all and quizzes are very hard",0
"Dr. Koskey was very thorough in her feedback and allowed you to correct portions of your papers for credit. She was helpful and really cared for her students learning. I felt very comfortable asking her questions and participating in class. The assignments were not difficult, but rather time consuming - so get a head start ASAP. Loved her!",1
Very good if you participate. Group project oriented but she makes sure everyone is participating all the way through. Has lots of real life experience!,1
"I loved him and the class. The subject is hard/a lot of information, but he made it enjoyable and palatable.  I learned a Lot. He is a bit disorganized, but his mistakes and forgetfulness is never taken out on the class. This was also the only class I never fell asleep in. He is funny and quite cute too! ;)",1
Pretty good teacher. I butt heads with him based on my lack of attendance. Putting that aside hes a great laid back teacher! Highly recommend.,1
He is an awesome teacher. His class is easy to understand. I didn't need to study hard for his class because he makes everything clear for you in the class. After all I loved his class.,1
"Dr. Swenson is an amazing teacher. She gives great lectures and even greater feedback. She chooses her lectures and assignments carefully. Most things in class are for your benefit. She's caring, friendly, and very smart. If you can, take her class! You will not regret it. ",1
"I wish he taught other classes.  The professor is smart, funny and an excellent lecturer.  He also is a sharp dresser and cute!!",1
"Beginning and advanced students are allowed in the same class, so some are bored while others are lost. Homework is returned without corrections and there is not much feedback from the teacher. Grading is harsh.",0
"First things first, his voice is the most monotone voice I have ever heard. If you do something wrong he looks at you like youre stupid. He goes on and on about the lottery and plays the hump day commercial before every class. He tries too hard in trying to make you laugh rather than actually teaching.",0
"Awesome class! At times, it can be boring but as long as you study a little bit, you can't get anything lower than a B. He's an awesome pianist too! Three short concert reviews, three tests, and he even has a nice ""Kosnik Surprise"" Extra Credit given out, too! I'd definitely recommend him if you're in the honors college, too!",1
"Honestlyonly take this class if you already have some photography/adobe premiere experience. His assignments forced me to get out of my comfort zone, which I appreciated. Having your work ripped apart in front of your peers helps to develop tough skinif you can't handle critique from Cheers, you're not cut out for Journalism, honey!! Get out now!",0
Professor Wood is a great professor. She definitely knows her stuff. She is extremely smart and she is definitely great at explaining the subject. She is very tough at grading. You have to attend the class if you want to pass it. Students don't like her because she is not the kind of professor that you can mess around with. She won't tolerate it.,1
"Read the book and discuss, that's half of the class. (I used an older edition and one chapter was different, so be careful) Participation is the most important thing to pass, so don't forget to reply! I really enjoyed the assignments throughout the class because they were all unique and different. Learned a lot about communication. Grades are fair.",1
"Funny guy, I recall he included some 'Periodic table of dessert' for an intro to astronomy class once. Still don't recall how it's relevant but A for humor",1
"Dr. Corrigan is super nice, but his class is easy to the point of boredom. He goes of on amusing tangents but you really don't have to pay attention in class or do the readings at all. Take if you want a really easy A.",1
she was pretty nice and fairly helpful. i did feel like she may have treated me slightly different because i was young,1
"The professor of this class is very understanding, if you try to reach out to him he will offer to help you succeed best he can on his end. That said, this class definitely takes more attention than most. The lectures were hard to follow at times, but accompanied by the book and online resources it was alright.",1
"Extremely disappointed and upset with Cyntha's teaching/behaviour this term. Questions on tests are misleading, marking schemes are strict, and do not follow the nature of the question asked. Rude on class forums, over email, and in person. Extremely unprofessional, and makes people feel degraded with how sarcastic, unhelpful, and mean she is.",0
"pretty confusing professor, it is hard to tell what he wants and your grade can suffer because of it. at the same time however, he seems to adjust his grading by the end of the semester to make up for the weird grades he gives. not the most pleasant experience to constantly be questioning your grade",1
"he's a good professor that explains his information really well. He gave out study guides to complete that helped so much with test. You do have to get the book but honestly you dont even need to read it. I passed without reading it, just come to class and take notes on the powerpoints and youll do great.",1
This was by far the best comp teacher I have had. Super helpful. I struggled on the final paper but that's because I am not a strong writer but I would definitely take this class again. An awesome teacher!! Not a ton of homework and everything is super clear on how to complete it all!,1
"You don't need a textbook for the class- everything you are quizzed on comes from his written lectures. They were open note too, and the exercises you did were never too hard and he always told you how to improve. Funny guy, his notes were interesting. Take him!",1
"Kubota sensei is on top of it!  She keeps us engaged as well well as stimulated!  She reviews and repeats, which some people complain about.. but that is what learning a language is all about!  She is very funny and very nice.. and totemo genki desu!",1
"Sam is honestly one of the coolest professors I've had. However, he does not use Powerpoint slides so you need to jot down notes during lecture + pay EXTRA attention because your notes will be your only reference. Lectures are discussion-based so you're free to interrupt and ask Qs. Homework are really helpful, exams are alright. Take the class!!",1
why is this guy employed at a 4-year accredited university? isn't there a community college or trade school he could be doing a mediocre job at? the man destroys the credibility for the  International Business Major at CofC,0
"10-week course! There are a total of 5 exams but the last one is optional (will drop the lowest exam score if the 5th exam is taken and it covers chapter 1-17). The course is very easy and self explanatory: read the textbook, take good notes, and you should receive an A for each exam! HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COURSE!",1
"She is very knowledgeable. She helped me lose 15lbs. and was very sweet. Tests are easy if you read the handouts.  Participation and attendance are mandatory, its PE, duh! Different variations of squats and push-ups. She likes to focus on the smaller muscle groups that you forget about like in ur shoulders n butt. Ur gluteus medius has been warned!",1
"Amazing professor, I once mistake him for a student the first time I met him hehe you can tell he is a chilled person. There are 4 out of class essays and 2 in class essays but it's not that hard as long as you do it. He is honestly the best professor I have taken for English and he is the best! You will not regret it I promise.",1
Excellent professor! She really takes time to make sure everyone in the class is on the same page. She explains very well and she is always there to help if you need any help understanding the material. Highly recommend her!,1
"still not my favorite as a person, but good prof. was very harsh and nitpicky but the semester got easier as it went along. I went to every class, including optional review daysreally helped my grade. 4 papers, online quizzes, VERY short readings, and options for what to write about, easy final. as long as you put the effort in its bad at all.",1
"He is an awful professor. You can't understand a word he says because he mumbles so bad. If you ask him a question, he repeats the same thing over and over again that doesn't help at all. He's definitely a big part of physics ""teaching you how to teach yourself"" so don't expect much for lectures. Avoid if possible.",0
"Very young, naive. Has yet to have his spirit broken but he's damn near close. Needs to embrace apathy in order to survive. Felt sorry for him. Pretty good guy, just has unrealistic expectations.",1
"Jason is a great guy, and he's always willing to make himself available to students. He's the sort of professor who is always in the student's corner, and that really encouraged me even though I had a really tough time towards the beginning of the class!",1
"Great teacher. She's a tough marker with essays, but it only pushed me harder, which is what a good prof should do. Sometimes it was hard to get a class discussion going, and she'd get peeved when no one responded to a question asked. Overall, good prof.",1
"Dr. K. is one of the best professors I've had at FGCU. I had her for a graduate class which is less formal than undergrad. The class was not all out of the book, but more life experiences and her past experiences. She is very knowledgeable and experienced in her area. She is very helpful outside the class as well.",1
"She is very clear with her instructions! Always willing to help if you aren't understanding. There is a lot of textbook reading, but if you participate in class it won't seem like too much. Ask for help if you need it and you will pass her class easily.",1
"Prof Marlowe is awesome. Lectures may be long but you have a very thorough study guide for every test. I got a 100 on all the tests without spending tons of time studying. There are also a few essays and if you're good at writing, it'll be easy for you. Participation and attendance matter. She is a great professor to have. Don't bother buying book.",1
Useless class full of busy work. Late grading.,0
She's too subjective. The course goes in circles and it's so theoretical it hurts. No substance. Unnecessarily tough grader. Take Brenner.,0
"Amazing professor, but very tough class. Good thing is that you are bound to learn a lot on law! Exams are in class written exams, not multiple choice. She does hand out study guides which are almost identical to the questions on the exams. Study those! 4 group assignments is the rest of your grade which are more like mini projects. Come to class!",1
"Dr.Reiser-Danner is great she has her own workbooks which makes it easy to learn the concepts but you still need the textbook so you can look up Z-scores and stuff. She is very helpful and will explain a concept to you 10 times if thats what it takes. Nothing against Verrekia, or Gans but take STAT with Dr. R-D you wont regret it",1
"Not a nice experience, she is very unpleasant and mean even to those people working very hard. You will regret taking her classes.",0
"You will learn in this class, not just regurgitate historical facts from a textbook. But, this means it requires hard work. Hale has students read primary sources, examine artwork, listen to music, and discuss the time period being taught. His essay exams require you to think critically about historical events, forming and supporting an argument.",1
Knows his stuff...could use some ESL classes but other than that...Hi5 as a prof. and individual,1
"Ervin is ridiculous! He might be nice in class and seem helpful but his tests are the hardest I have ever had. I'm an A student and got a C in the class after doing all the homework, going to EVERY class, and studying a ton. Studied forever for the final and still failed! Cheat sheets don't help. Good luck.",0
Hes a great professor and you learn a lot from. Be prepared if you have him twice a week then youll get quizzes mostly every class. Also on his midterms and exams he like to give extra credit questions on things off topic from the lecture like a video he showed. My only issue with him is he likes to give last minute assignments the week of finals,1
Really great professor! This was the second class I had taken with him and I have to say I enjoyed both of them more than I had expected since I was not sure about them going into them. His comic book nerdiness was always appreciated along with his sense of humor. Take his classes whenever you can!,1
"Professor Trombley lays her class out clearly. She consistently took the content from that week and related it to real life through discussion topics (which have several options to choose from). The weekly quizzes are easy IF you do the readings, practice tests, and read modules. This class is relatively low stress & I learned a lot.",1
"Excellent teacher. He explains everything thoroughly, is excited about what he is teaching, and never boring!",1
I felt that this guy knew what had to be done. He wanted students to pass and pass with a good understanding of the material.,1
"While everything is stated in the syllabus, assignment due dates vary. Her warning is to ""check in and pay attention,"" but it will cost you points. Almost like there's no room for error when you're taking this intro to psych class, especially if you also have work, life, and other classes on your plate. Her tactics are military.",1
"He knows his stuff, but he is very arrogant. If you don't know something he will put you down and say you shouldn't be out in public not knowing the answer. He gives a ridiculous amount of work, so don't try to take this class as an elective or if you are busy. He comes across as nice, but send him an email for help and you won't get any.",0
"Had her for org comm last semester, great instructor. At first I wasn't sure what the class would be about but it ended up being awesome. I learned a ton and this class really opens your eyes to organizations. Class is based HEAVY in the book, be ready to read, but you will certainly know what is expected of you.",1
Arevalo is a very temperamental individual. She doesn't like to be challenged and doesn't explain anything well. She runs through slides like its sometype of game and doesnt explain anything. She crams in material before exams and excepts you to guess whats on her mind. She is not considerate and not very present. and loves to single people out!,0
"Sometimes I was a little lost in the lecture, but he will stop what he's doing to make sure everyone is caught up before he moves on. He is a great teacher and really cares about the material he is teaching.",1
"Mr. Wickert is an overall great instructor. His lectures are very helpful for the 3 papers you will write. He makes everything very clear for what is expected, and reads your paper before you turn it in to make sure you are off on the right foot. I would highly recommend him to anyone! Makes you feel comfortable, he is very funny and sarcastic.",1
"I cringed every time he laughed at one of his own jokes and didn't really like his personality, but the class isn't bad. At least go to the beginning of class for the clicker questions, but otherwise lectures aren't necessary. Neither is the textbook. Use the powerpoints to answer his study guide questions and you should be fine.",1
"Probably the best A&P Lab Professor at QU!! I took her class fully online and it was not bad at all. Her directions are always clear and she gives great detail about the exams. The tests seem difficult but if you pay attention, study & ask questions, you will do great! She is positive and always answers her email. Take her for lab if you can.",1
"Always too busy to help students. Doesn't answer emails. Doesn't care about his students, especially graduate students who are trying to graduate. You have to beg and plead for an answer. I wish I had as good of an experience as some of these reviews, but he's the worst professor I've ever had. Maybe it would be better if he had an assistant.",0
Monschientastic!!! Great teacher. Helped me a lot and I would recommend him to anyone.,1
Edward J Tavss is perhaps the best chemistry professor in the country... The universe? Maybe... He is funny and he makes sure that his students understand every single concept before he can even think about going to the next slide. Is it worth going to Cook/Douglass three times a day for an hour? Not one bit... However Tavss uses a sign-in sheet.,1
"DONT TAKE HER CLASS! You'll never get full credit. Nothing meets her ""standards"" even if you've followed all instructions to the T. She's one of those profs who like to take points off for nothing, but when asked she'll have no negative things to say. Very frustrating! Put in SO much effort, only getting a B. I feel I deserve 5 A's at this point.",0
TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!!!! EASIEST A EVER professor Nelson is an amazing professor she teaches so well and its so fun and engaging and she makes the class interesting,1
"Disorganized, cannot hear a thing in his lectures, grading takes more than a month. His midterms are quite easy but the finals stab your back. He goes off tangent soooooo much it's kind of hard at times to understand if he's lecturing or not.",0
Knox is a good teacher and genuinely wants to now his students. Class is easy there is not much to do except one assignment a week. no lectures which is nice. taken online due to covid,1
On line class stinks - if you need help you need to go to the center.  Timed quizes and exams.  I always felt so stressed.  Not instructor's fault.  If you are sick that is to bad - you still have to take the quiz and test on line by a certian date and time.  Math would be better in the classroom!,0
"To be honest, Judith is a bit nuts and can contradict herself at times. For example, one week she told me to completely change the premise of my play and the next week gave another student an idea that was identical to mine. However, she knows what she is talking about and you will come out with a great product in the end.",1
"This class wasn't too bad, I've definitely taken harder. She is really nice and tries to make class fun sometimes by bringing performers to tie the music with lecture. There is one paper, 3 quizzes, and a final. She doesn't post slides. Don't buy the book, just study your notes and listen to the music examples on YouTube carefully.",1
"Grade: 40% midterm 60% final. Whatever you do, I have one word of advice: READINGS. DO ALL OF THEM. The open-note exam policy is pointless if you haven't grasped the concepts Prof. Smith wants you to pinpoint and how they are relevant to cases. Read EVERY page he assigns and make sure you understand. He is reachable during O.H. if you're confused.",1
"He did a great job with really difficult material. (182) Does a lot in terms of providing opportunities for students to improve, and in return expects students to work hard. I like the lecture style--tests student knowledge with questions so you get an idea of whether your understanding the material or not.",1
"She is a great individual and person but has questionable teaching tactics in my eyes. 7pt scale, tough grader with no explanation when things are wrong (makes it hard to know where to improve) some goals of this class seemed unrealistic and a waste of time. Other than that is was fun. She is the only BCOMM teacher that does a group project.",1
"Professor Kim's online class was a bit rough for the newly transitioned course to be online. It was a bit unorganized, but the overall lectures and assignments were conveyed well. I recommend participating in discussions to further understand the countless reading that you will be doing! The course was not necessarily hard, but definitely keep up!",1
"Excellent professor, I had an essay i handed in late and she was very understanding about it. Her lectures were very interesting and id love to have her teach a class of mine again, id highly recommend her.",1
Supper nice professor. All exams are either take home or open book. He's teaches by examples. He is an excellent professor.,1
"This class was great, the texts that we read were interesting enough to keep our attention but also broadened our concept of literary analysis. Iliana is super great and personable, easy to talk to and just overall a great professor. This class requires a lot of conversation in group and talking about what your thoughts are on the different texts.",1
"She loves what she does and it shows. Her classes are interesting, direct, and meaningful. Definitely my favorite professor at Loyola and highly recommend her.",1
"The class didn't have much work besides ""Labs"" which were basically webquests and required some reading but weren't that bad. There were a total of 5 quizzes which were all easy and the final was the same as the quiz questions.",1
He is the best professor I have ever had. I enjoy his lectures and he gives you all of the material you need for exams. Study for the exams because there are only four and there are no other grades for this class.,1
"tough grader, I tired really hard in this class but she kept on giving me a low grade",1
Greatest professor you will come across. Inspires us to learn more and experience more about our culture. You're missing out if you're not taking her intro class. I just wish she taught more classes. She kills it still though. Looked forward to class everyday. Why are you still reading this? Go sign up already!! ,1
"He assumed that the student knew too much, was too fast on his examples, and didn't seem interested in talking to his students after class. He was not helpful in the least. I would recommend anyone who may struggle with math to steer clear of him.",0
"always on campus.  very given of his time.  tries to get the most out of his students.  goes ""beyon the call of duty""....has an endless supply of lame jokes.",1
"Does not respond to emails.  Takes an excessive amount of time to grade and return assignments and papers (some assignments she didn't return at all). Returned papers do not have any comments on them. Strict attendance policy. Provided EC, but graded it using requirements that weren't stipulated. Does not update D2L. But, it is an easy class.",0
She's very fair and Cengage was messing up the portion of the class by marking incorrect answers and the assignments every week are 1-2 pages and she grades them very easily. TestsQuizzes were easy online with exam 4 optional (final).  I respect her for her effort and she is a good person to get to know on an individual level! Easy AB course!,1
hate this class! test are hard. studying is a MUST with lots of outside help. doesnt give out OLD powerpoints. Rambles.,0
"Will confirm your figures for your essays, goes to answer the exact same question but it's a different group and he'll say that it's absolutely wrong. Doesn't know what he wants. Has said ""i dont care"" and ""do better"" when people come to him for help. 80% of his neuro class have F's. Dont take him. You've been warned.",0
"I love Ms. Magallon! She is an excellent teacher and a great person. I did not think her essays were difficult at all, but others may disagree. Receiving feedback from her will help raise your essay grades, so get as much as possible! She is willing to help to her students to make sure they pass.",1
"AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID !!!!! He is like a nightmare! Terrible lectures. And he is really mean to you. He is a Monster. The homework is hard. You spent so much time on it, and you still couldnt get a good grade. Worst Professor Forever. If you dont want to torture yourself, be wise and don't choose his class.",0
"Very strict with students, but does not help you.  Leaves you hanging in online classes.  Does not grade, correct, answer or help in any way with your education.",0
Showing up to Matt's labs is very important but he is there with you the entire way. Matt really cares about each and every one of his students and is a very organized and smart individual. I highly recommend taking one of his classes. You are guaranteed to pass.,1
"Mrs. Elfring has been one of my favorite professors so far! She is an amazing teacher and shows that she really does care for her students and wants to see them achieve greatness! She always gives helpful feedback on papers and homework, and is there to help when writing your final research paper at the end of the semester!",1
"Make sure to read enough to be able to speak up at least a few times in discussion, otherwise sit back and enjoy his weird lectures - which for me were a welcome break as a second semester Sargent senior.",1
Great Professor. She is east to talk to and is very nice. She is quick to reply to emails. I would recommend this professor. I am taking her class again for enc1102.,1
He is very lecture heavy and moves WAY too fast during his lectures. You're better off learning the material on your own because he explains stuff in the worst ways.,0
"Awful, currently in the class right now & cant stand it. Shes extremely rude to students who ask multiple questions. She zooms through showing the class the steps to learn & solve the problems because she can enter everything in excel & use function buttons. Requires you to listen to her online lecture as well lots of homework. WCCCD needs new prof",0
"Very rude sense of humor, if you're sensitive don't take him. Not straight forward at all, assignments, if any that are given are confusing. Attend class or you will be completely lost! Tests are super hard but if you study and put your mind to it you will do well on them, its all memorizing. Must get the textbook, all reading and hw is from it!",0
"Idk how you do bad in this class. He literally puts how to write a lab report the first day. Do it his way. I did it,easily got to 20-30 pages. A lot of it can be just data from class, pictures,graphs. Show your report before handing it in to see if good. If you need help in lab just ask. Straight forward labs, just don't rush reading instructions",1
"Miller is great. He is very dedicated to his profession and a fun teacher. Very open to students ideas and I actually learned a lot about different styles of poetry, I disagree with all of the negative comments this is probably the only class that does not put me to sleep. TAKE THIS CLASS.",1
he was the best teacher I ever had. I am now a year out of him being my English teacher and I came on here to express how amazing he was. he was SO clear on what he expected in papers and uses many class days to go over and help you make sure you get an A. the only way you will not get an A is if you don't listen to him and do the work accordingly.,1
"Christina is a really cool person, but if she doesn't like your piece then you might as well just turn in a totally different piece. She is also pretty unclear of what she wants which can be good in art, but in this case it didn't work because she wanted specific things. I took Color Theory and I don't think I learned enough about color in class",1
"if u dont get biology, DO NOT take this class with her!  she should not be teaching a class designed for NON bio major people!  she uses biological terms each class which arent in the book. (only bio people would know them) exams are HARD!!!!",0
"I decided to take David's class because of the fact it was an evening class that worked with my schedule. That was a huge mistake, he seems incredibly unorganized, doesn't care to make things clear, teaches as if you learned this 4 times already, and just doesn't care. A student in my class had a concussion and David deemed it not excusable.",0
"This lady really makes us do an essay with 3 drafts, I'm not sure about you but that seems very unnecessary. On top of that she makes you do a letter of reflection on your paper to basically repeat what you said in your essay, so you basically gotta sum up your essay in four paragraphs which is so stupid and unnecessary. I DO NOT RECOMMEND>.",0
"I was previously obsessed with Anthropology and took this class as a refresher. Unfortunately, Sullivan caused me to stray away from it from further on. Although he is a charming and interesting person, he is an extremely disorganized professor. Very unclear. Very off-topic. I would not recommend him as a teacher. Chat with him for fun",0
She really wants her students to succeed. Genuinely nice person and very helpful.,1
Great class.,1
"I must be honest. After the first week,  I thought I made a grave mistake on taking her class. However, college is supposed to be easy. Dr. Northam's weekly discussions makes you tap into your critical thinking skills. She provides  great feedback that is straightforward and the truth. If you really want to learn about business, take this class.",1
"Assigns a boat load of reading, but they're interesting books. He urges you to develop a deeper meaning and to look for symbols in every book you're given. You must contribute towards class discussing at least once every time you meet for class. Papers are 7-10 Pgs but says you can write more ore express deeper thought. He is awesome.",1
"I got a 98% in the class, she grades really easily.  Some assignments are lame but for the most part they're not terrible.  You will learn a ton from her.",1
"She's patient and is straightforward with the class. If you need help you can find her. ME classes are never easy so of course it's not an easy A. And of course she's VERY!!! attractive, not that effects learning, but hey it makes classy way easier to get through on tough days",1
"There are no tests or quizzes throughout the semester. The only exam was the final, and the final was only 4 essay questions; which was annoying. Burke was a little unclear when it came to his expectations for the class. There are a few debates but they weren't horrible. If I had to take this class again, I would choose Burke's class.",1
hard to pass. not a good teacher.,0
"Very nice professor. Responds to emails promptly. All exams are online and open book/notes. Read textbook and don't worry about in class lectures. Listen carefully to guest speakers, always extra credit exam questions on their presentations.",1
"I had so much fun in 237(and an A). Go to his lecture, listen to what he says. That'll get you an A. Although exams are usually essay, no worries. Just write what he focused during class",1
"Not present during any of the lectures, very hands off, didn't really provide any support. When I was struggling, I was told to try and rely on outside sources aside from lectures and the book. Single assignments would end up taking 4-5 hours because none of it was thoroughly explained in the lectures. Midterm and Final had questions not covered.",0
Most examples are from text. Test questions based on homework and notes. Review midterms before final.,0
"Currently in the class. We just got our first exam back and I got a C. But, apparently, 19 people failed it- an exam that is purportedly the easiest of the semester. Material is DIFFICULT and he did an absolutely horrible job at preparing us for the test. When I chose to sign up for this glass I wish I would've read a review like my own. STAY AWAY!",0
"Classwork is a breeze. Speeches are also very easy (2 individual, 2 group). Lectures are pointless- I didn't learn anything from them. Prof Peterson is incredibly enthusiastic and kind.",1
Dr. Mizell was the best professor I have had in a long time. She was great. I enjoyed her class each and every time I walked into her class room. She was so nice and caring with all of us. She made literature interesting. My class was great. I would take her class again if I needed another literature class.,1
"Professor Prez is a great teacher, he assigns a lot of readings. But you kind of don't need to do all of them, just do the one that the asks you to reference in paper and you'll be fine. He gave the prompt for the midterm to us to take home and write on an index card and then copy in class. One paper to do at home. And the final was take home too!",1
Dr. Feige definitely knows what's he doing. His class is student centered. He continuously seeks both positive and negative comments.,1
"Her class is not so hard ,but she gives a lot writing assignment and the films for the class are an hour .",1
"She is a very nice person. I really enjoyed her class that's why I took more than one speech class with her. Before her class I was always interested to speak in front of the class, but I never was encouraged or pushed to do so and she helped me a lot with that. I respect her and she is one of my favorite teachers. I would recommend her.",1
"Profesor Luckett class was one interview paper(most of the grade),  4 quizzes, & 10 discussions. He does not give a word count for discussions so one week he'll say it's enough and other weeks that its too short and needs more writing.",1
"BUAD 205 is not a difficult class. Attendance is taken for a grade, so by just showing up everyday you can earn 100 points (600 total points in the course). Dr. Ranft is a friendly guy and does an excellent job guiding discussion. ",1
"I love Dr. Hartman she is so caring, and helpful. As long as you put forth effort she will help you with whatever you need help with. She is so understanding, and easy to talk to. She likes to talk to her students and check in with her students to make sure they are understanding the assignments and are doing a good job. Very easy.",1
"This dude is an embarressment to higher education. Does not answer emails, everything is last kinute. Completely useless to grad students. Just go do something else, what a joke.",0
"I would not be able to survive math without the help of this amazing gem. I took her last semester and passed with flying colors due to her excellent teaching, and this semester she continued to help me for free because she cared about my success. Absolute angel, and would 1000% recommend for anyone looking for the perfect math teacher.",1
This was the most enjoyable class I have ever taken.,1
Awesome. Completely hilarious. Down to earth.,1
It shows that this was her first semester teaching a course by herself.,0
"Little bit of some work, but it's applicable to real-life scenarios and she assists in helping you prep for future tasks, of which her assignments are geared towards.  Great teacher, but can go a little fast and directions can be a little hard to follow on paper.  She'll make you understand and like Stats if you are scared of them!",1
"If you have no background in  stats, absolutely avoid this class. He honestly reads directly off the powerpoint, (which he didn't even make), and he is no help if you ask any questions. It always seems like he just wants to get out of the class as quickly as possible. He is the worst professor I could ever imagine having in college.",0
Best professor I've had during my 3 years at CSUN. 3 tests make up your whole grade but he creates flash cards before every test which are basically the test questions/answers. Show up to class because he gives test questions which won't be on the flashcards. Amazing class and amazing professor. Easy A and one of the best psych classes.,1
Grades are solely exams and pop quizzes. Docks grade after so many absences. Tons of reading for the class. Exams aren't too difficult if you do the readings and pay attention at least halfway during class. Homework is easy and sparse.,1
Seriously NEVER TAKE THIS PROFESSOR unless you're amazing at math already I don't think he did his online lectures past the first 2 weeks of school he just uploaded the notes and it was basically like a GOOD LUCK type situation you teach yourself and him really he also teaches the most confusing ways to do things he confuses himself,0
Very nice as a non major it was a relief to not feel like the art I was putting out had to be as good as the rest of the class because she understood it isn't the same,1
She is amazingly nice but don't let the word 'yoga' fool you! it is an actual class! there are tests and a legit research paper! Its an easy A if you try. but dont expect it to fall in your lap.  there is a lot of reading and several writing assignments.  but it was a really fun class and I am glad I took it.,1
"Dr. Holtzblatt was very funny and kept the class entertaining through the term. There are no pluses and minuses in the class so beware of this. The material is not that hard, but there is a lot of homework and most of your grade comes from the test 85%, which are semi easy. He is the best accounting teacher I have taken so far at CSU.",1
"Extremely difficult class with info-heavy lectures full of small details. Write down any and all little details and examples in your notes, you WILL see them on the next test (and possibly quiz). He states that it is a no-memorization class, however it is very much so. Very knowledgeable and charming professor.",1
has funny stories. chill dude who is considerate of the priorities of his students,1
Participation Required; Breaks down directions and information in a fun and effective way.,1
"The course was pretty easy. It is self taught. You are required to read the chapters and create the files. Anytime I saw someone ask question on the forum, he gave snide answers. My polite emails for help obtained one word answers. But, do the work, you get the A. This was 8wk summer a course (same amt material), still didn't take up too much time.",0
"She's a great teacher. Gives a lot of hw and have to read a lot but it's english so it's part of the course. A lot of essays but break it up in sections. Go to class, its part of your grade. She really want to help you understand the material so will make sure you understand before moving forward.",1
Great professor! Super understanding and cares more about you understanding the material than grading you. If you show up and participate in the conversations you will pass. Very inspirational professor.,1
One of my favorite professor at Cal Poly Pomona. Really enjoyed his lectures. Gives out weekly homework and gives alot of extra credit opportunity to boost grades up. 3 test. 1 project. I reccomend taking his class,1
"He is a good professor. He is knowledgeable about his subject. In the beginning of his class it took me a few weeks to adjust to his class. However, his class is not that hard. You just need to work for your A ( thing that was easy). He is expecting you to attend to his class( mandatory) class proyects",1
"Professor Davis is an excellent teacher and does a good job of making dry material somewhat interesting through hands-on examples.  He also has a (dry) sense of humor, which keeps class entertaining.  Highly recommended.",1
"This teacher teaches Comp Lab, clinical, and adult health nursing. She is so much fun and loves to help her students learn. You can meet with her any time outside of class for help. Shes the type of teacher that doesn't mind you calling her cell phone and she will call yours if theres a problem. Great!!!",1
Easiest class I have taken!!! Exams: you can use the book and notes. He is really sweet and will help you out if you need help.,1
He is THE BEST. He has his own firm and worked for Walt Disney Imagineering so he knows his stuff. He has so many creative ideas that hes willing to share to help you out with your projects. I learned so much from him. He is super down to earth and understanding. Hes an overall great person and fun to be around. Id take him again in a heartbeat.,1
"A real nice guy. If you don't understand something, ask a question. He always answered mine nicely. He was also good at explaining things that were new to the class",1
Great Professor.  Three tests and one essay.  Gives great review before each test.  Very helpful.  Knows his stuuff great class discussions.,1
"Books: Originals by Adam Grant was fine, Lean Start-up book was so so and hard to read, ditch it quick.",1
"I finished this class with about 107% She gives lots of extra credit! Tests are multiple choice with study guides, sometimes even open notes, Homework was just typing key word definitions, Had to do one group presentation + one scientific report, But overall the course was very easy, she was super sweet, was there for help when you needed her.",1
"He literally gives you every answer to the tests. Grading is just 6 tests and go to 2 orchestra concerts. He's very... eccentric. Talks about political issues a lot, which I think is more interesting than music anyway. I recommend him. Do not get the book, it's a waste. Just buy the online access code.",1
Great teacher! Will help answer questions and will help you get a good grade if you try hard. I would spend 6 hours before every class in statistics working on the home work and studying and would come to class with a ton of questions. He typically comes to class early which is nice if you have any questions and gives occasional extra credit assignments,1
Taught me CRED. Gave our class a crash course in econ when we had an exam that day.(after the CRED lesson was done of course.),1
"I hate history, but love this class. Take it, that is all I have to say.",1
Probably the easiest speech class you can take. I loved the course and found it extremely interesting and not difficult at all! Gentry is fabulous and a really forgiving grader. Totally recommend!,1
"Bronie is so sweet and she is always so jovial. She is great at lecturing and her tests are challenging but not impossible. I think she has less homework than most math 31 professors, but there is still a lot (not her fault though). Her final is fairly easy too. There is multiple extra credit possibilities, so do take advantage of that!",1
love RIT and this teacher,1
"Hes a really caring and very knowledgeable of the material discussed in class. Takes attendance everyday by quizzes. Book is not mandatory at all, just need the access code. Easy A and an easy elective.",1
knows his stuff. excellent communicator,1
Do not take this class... Professor was not good at telling students what they need and don't need to know. Wasted countless hours studying material that I would never need to know because she said we would.,0
"Dr. Beck is amazing, she is always willing to help and answer questions.  She will try everything to help her students achieve.",1
Dr. Brown is great! He cares about his students and will help you.  His class is easy but I had this class 20 years ago and had to retake as I am back in college.  He is a very kind and gentle man.,1
"His class lecture is always based off the readings so doing them is very helpful for your participation grade. He offered a lot of extra credit. Attendance is mandatory and it will hurt your grade to not show up. There is a lot of talking and presenting, so if you hate talking in Spanish I would not recommend this class. He also gives pop quizzes.",1
"I took his Introduction to Programming using Visual Basic ... the beginning was rough, because I'm not a programmer, I'm a electrical engineer.  I need the class as a prerequisite for another class.  Rob is very clear and uses many teaching methods to get his point across.  All of his other classes are the same way ... YOU ROCK, ROB!",1
Fun & interesting. ,1
Professor Wheeler and her husband taught this class together and they are so cute and funny! The TAs are also super passionate and helpful outside of the classroom. Wheeler will make you get TopHat and quizzes you every day on the readings so (unless you're good at history) do the readings and you'll be fine.,1
"The most amazing teacher you will ever have. She truly cares about her students and does anything in her power to help whether it be academics, issues at home, or just anything you need. Makes class so fun by getting everyone involved. Took her for a 3 hour Winter class. it flew by and I miss it so much! Beautiful soul and mind. you learn so much",1
"If there is a better Professor that Senor Morcillo I have not encountered them. The professor is as understanding as the come, and very patient. He generally wants you to learn the language and does his best to help. He responds quickly by email and will assist in any way he can. Would take again and again if that was possible!!",1
"Great Guy- Cares about his athletes. Relates to his students and makes 2 hour lectures based on ""Micro-Economics"" actually interesting and bearable to sit through.",1
bates is freaking hilarious. great teacher and have learned a lot.,1
"As the previous review pointed out, his tests are very theoretical. The key to passing is to understand the concepts, not just memorize. Attend lecture, pay attention, use your brain, easy A.",1
I am currently taking him for Corporate Finance. He keeps the class interesting and tries to teach you real life situations instead of just learning from the textbook. Good Professor in my opinion.,1
He made the class really fun with his jokes and zoom backgrounds. He dropped 29 knewton homework and made it extra credit for those who did all of them. His gradings are merciful(with partial credits ). Do the exam review resources he provides on canvas and you are set. The textbook is for free but honestly I have never looked at it.,1
"Let me just say that Dr. Vartanian IS THE BEST PSYCHOLOGY PROFESSOR EVER. Just take a class with her and you'll understand. But anyway, participation is not mandatory IF YOU'RE GOING TO READ THE WHOLE BOOK AND TAKE THE EXAMS. however, if you attend all lectures you'll literally never use the book. She's really lovely and passionate, Good Luck (:",1
"Keeps the class interesting.  Those that claims he doesnt teach, probably do not have the capacity to learn.",1
"She is not clear with her instructions at all. She looks at you like you are stupid when you are answering a question.  She does not listen to your answer even if you shout it, like i have multiple times.",0
I recommend taking lower biology classes then go into BIO-168. Eric expects you to know biology like it is the back of your hand. He rushes his lectures.,0
"take this class , he is very super good teacher, i like him what he is ways his teaches ",1
"Kristi isn't clear with what she wants for the projects. Expects us to do a lot of things, but can't even catch up herself? It's past Christmas and still isn't done grading all of the assignments. Very little engagement with the class. Disappointing.",0
"During covid, she chose to have her whole class asynchronous. The content is very dry and sometimes copied word for word from the textbook. There is nothing captivating about the class since you only look at the slides and lecture notes and readings. She also clearly doesn't read my emails b/c she doesn't ever answer my questions.",0
"He makes you work, but he is understanding. He does recommend a textbook but he puts it in college of what you need so use it and save $. Go to class, be on time, you will pass & have fun. You will definitely learn, he pushes you, if you're serious. Easy A, if you do what you're supposed to do. I never missed a class & had fun. Quizzes online-easy",1
Most of the work is stuff not really covered while in the class. He assigned a paper on a subject he never lectured on but is touched on in his online notes.,1
Morely is an AWESOME teacher! Dont expect an easy class though. If youre serious about learning photography and improving your technical skills and jump-starting your creativity his class will do it! Hes tough on you but its because thats the real world! He knows his stuff! He may be a lil arrogant at times but the class is FUN and totally worth it,1
Phenomenal instructor and very caring. Wish I could take her for every class. She is awesome!!!,1
"Real police officer so he shares a lot of real life stories. Attendance is not mandatory but, if you don't do the readings you should not miss any classes!",1
Talks about race too much....knows a lot about math but doesn't know how to teach It,0
"Very nice prof. He does take attendance but he also emails yo the PP. Exams are identical to the study guide. Study that and youll pass. No homework or class work, just 4 exams.",1
"This is probably the worst teacher in the whole Peralta district, at least for CIS. Lectures are ridiculously long, usually at least 2 to 3 hours long with no breaks. Doesn't respond to emails, doesn't have a clear grading rubric, no feedback on homework assignments. Literally forgot we had a midterm. Take anybody else but him.",0
Dr Lopez teaches her class like youre one of her micro colleagues. She forgets that youre in the learning stages. Shes not approachable. She says that shes there to help but not really. Who says to their students right before an exam that I expect everyone to get below 60%. Not very encouraging. Pick another teacher. I dont recommend her,0
"Fetter is the man.  He will do whatever he can to help you in any aspect of your life, not just his class.  First half of stats is boring, but the second half was interesting.",1
I have taken this class elsewhere as an undergrad. At SFSU I took this at a graduate level expecting further depth. Was disappointed in the quality of the material. The instructor has experience in image processing but clearly is behind the curve in AI and pattern analysis. Not worth my time or money. ,0
"He rarely lectured, if he did he rushed thru the material and most likely, his lecture had NOTHING to do with exams. You are expected to read and teach yourself-- however, good luck trying to decide what obscure questions he will ask on exams. Worst prof.",0
"She has done an extremely poor job of handling the pandemic, and has shown complete disregard for students' digital safety and privacy. When I brought this up with her, she basically told me ""if you don't like it, drop the class"" which is an extremely inappropriate response. 3 1/2 years at UBC and I've never felt so disrespected by a prof.",0
"He's a funny guy and I don't have anything against him as a person, but as a professor he leaves something to be desired. He can and will ramble the whole class, and he's a very confusing grader; he rarely gives a reason for the grades he gives and although attendance is mandatory, he picks and chooses what days he actually takes it. He's just eh.",0
The instructor was great. The only thing I can say is that she hides extra credit in the lectures so pay attention. If you don't do the study guides you will fail the class. One thing I didn't like was the questions on the study guide weren't worded the same as they were on the quiz. I found myself hunting for the answers a lot.,1
Took async fall 2020. It was on the Tophat and textbook is included in the purchase. You read the book and answer mc and short answers for like 60% for your final grade. Midterm and final were easy as the questions were mostly from the textbook readings. Easy A as long as you do the work.,1
"O'Donnell is overly strict and unrealistic in her expectations for her students. Her way or no way. She's rude and uninviting. Public speaking is a fearful thing for most people, and she does not make it easy to overcome this fear. Go to class and do your work ON TIME. I will never take a class with O'Donnell again.",0
"Former Mayor Street is truly a character. The class is worth it just to hear the stuff he says. There is not much structure but it seems like if you complete the assignments you get an A. He also gets some really interesting high profile guest speakers to come in. I totally recommend the class, but just know that it's going to be a wild experience.",1
Rob is a great guy and cares about helping you but he is absolutely awful about replying to emails and therefore when you need help with programs you are kind of left high and dry. Definitely be prepared to spending a massive chunk of your time dedicated to figuring things out on your own! He is really great about helping you in class!,1
"TAKE EVERY CLASS YOU CAN WITH DR. HAUCK! He made genetics so fun and interesting. You cannot go wrong with him. You definitely still have to work for his class, it is not an easy A, but still very attainable. He tells you up front everything that you need to get a good grade, and if you do just that you cannot do bad.",1
"Professor Shira was a fantastic professor and I would most definitely recommend enrolling in any class he teaches. Shira is very caring about his students and wants each and every student to succeed. For example, at the end of the semester he told me he believed in me and was excited to see how my life turns out. 10/10 would recommend for a friend",1
"He uses algebraic formulas to explain every concept which makes everything needlessly complicated. So don't expect to learn anything from lecture. These formulas have been condensed into a ""bush bible"" which you can print out and use for his final to pass. He is good at putting on a show but he cannot teach or inspire students to learn.",0
"Initially, Workman seems a little intimidating. He is a bit scandalous for FUS, but I think that comes from his experiences. However, he was a great professor in and out of class. He worked to better enrich my education and provided me with resources that go beyond the course. He is funny and passionate, so class isn't boring. I would recommend him",1
He can be funny and he's real easy going. The class is not hard at all.,1
There are about 3 to four main papers in the class. She will make you work for the grade. Be sure to turn in all assignments and don't miss a class because you might miss out on in class assignments.,1
"Funny enough, I took this class because of the rave reviews I saw on here. The reality of it? This instructor hardly respond to e-mails or discussions, it takes around 4 hours to listen to a lecture, study the material, and take a quiz, and in addition, you don't get much time to complete quizzes. Very time consuming, I would not recommend...",0
"Hate and love relationship with this professor. His routine is easy to follow and straightforward.  He speaks clearly even with an accent, but the problem is he rushes each chapter. With such speed comes boring lectures. Ba's assignments are online only and he does give out exams, but they are easy if you put in the work.",1
"She is a nice teacher and tries to be helpful. She is a very fair grader, I would take another class with her again.",1
"While not easy, she does care. She is a genius, so the quality of instruction matches the rigor. Also is hilarious, making lecture fun. She does help out students though if she sees they put the work in. Make sure to take good notes during lecture because its not all about the book, she knows more than the book.",1
Awesome teacher she kept me interested so I actually learned...  Pay attention in class and you get an A in the class,1
"I took her summer math 0310 Good math teacher, very lenient when it comes to grades, gives extra credit, sometimes may have take home or open book test (so take notes!) I enjoyed her class because I did learn a lot of things too. She uses the 15 minutes tardy rule, and no use of cell phone, or she will just kick you out, which is fair. Grade: B",1
Pofessor D is a great man! I was actually able to get a good grade in his class because i put a lot of effort in my work.,1
"Incredible! She has so many experiences with advocacy & law. Her ''quizzes'' are more like tests, and are very detailed... but she prepares you well. The readings are lengthy, but she goes over them in detail in class, and is approachable in regards to confusion. Easy A if you participate, do the assignments, & multiple extra credit opportunities!",1
"Pajer is so sweet! She is always available to help. That being said, I don't feel like I learned a lot. If you don't pay attention in class you won't miss a lot. Write the 5 essays according to her specific requirements and you will do well!",1
This class was very boring but it is an easy A. There are a few quizzes and three tests so it is not too bad. I did not use the book that was needed and I am doing just fine. Take this class if you need it as a LASC,1
Worst teacher I've had yet. He judges you and belittles you in front of everyone. I hated this class and recommend that students find a different professor. He makes you feel stupid and isn't a good teacher. DON'T TAKE HIS CLASS!,0
"The homework, exams, and lab could trip you up if you're expecting a blow-off class, but otherwise its great.  Looney is very enthusiastic and the course is full of interesting content",1
Mrs. Ashby is one of my favorite professors! Shes very down to earth and will help you in any way that she can. I've had other math teachers but she just makes math click for me. I love the steps she gives for all the lessons she teaches. She's very sweet!!,1
"Oks was an avg teacher. When I took him, he made the grading scale A=80-100; B=65-80; C=50-65; D=35-50; F=35-0. I honestly did not learn much from him. I knew most of the material bc I had a good high school physics teacher. Made an A in Oks class bc of this knowledge. NOTE: Oks is known make ""E) None of the above"" a correct answer on some test",0
"For her lectures in the class, bring your laptop to type or record the lecture. She talks fast and goes through concepts quickly! She's always open to questions so definitely ask away. The class is content heavy so you really will have to pay attention to the details she says.",1
"Hensley is one of the best professors I've had at Iowa. It's not the easiest class, but he is a great person and cares a lot about the success of his students. He cares more about real-life experiences and application than lectures and textbooks. As long as you put forth some effort he'll respect you and help you with anything you need.",1
"Mrs. McGee is THE best professor I have had! She gives great lectures, and despite the fact that she may go on tangents, they're typically some way or fashion related to her lecture, and if they aren't, they're great mood lighteners. She also does not require a textbook, and her tests and quizzes are directly from her lectures. TAKE HER IF YOU CAN!",1
"Although attendance is not mandatory, it is very important to be at class as all her exams are based off of lecture material. Gives a ton of feedback on how to improve grade and is open to helping students bring their grades up.",1
Love her!,1
"World Literature with Professor Infante was a great introductory class. The works he picked for us to read and view were, for the most part, very interesting.",1
You will read a lot of articles. Easy A but so many essays to write but she isnt a tough grader. The final project requires presentation. You will be required to read a certain book after midterms.,1
had him for acc 300; exams were straight from the textbook...legit,1
"Pretty average professor, but if you are confused and ask a question he makes sure you understand before moving on. Takes awhile to warm up to him, but he's a good guy and can be pretty entertaining. Tests are almost identical to homework/review questions and he drops the your lowest grade between 3 tests and recitation quizzes.",1
"The class is heavily reliant on PowerPoint slides and Excel, which doesn't leave a ton of room for student error or professor's stories/experience. If you don't like homework, the grade is entirely based on tests and quizzes, which is nice. She is helpful after class as well. The class isn't thrilling but still solid.",1
"This has been my worst teacher in my time at PCC. Schubert does not teach well at all. He does all the problems and lectures with his back to the class and by the time he turns around, he's completed the whole problem and blocked it. Anytime someone asks for help he either says, you should of learned it in the last math or go to tutoring. TERRIBLE!",0
I learned a lot in this class. He takes extra steps to clarify assignments for the class. He always had a very good answer for every question asked during the class.  Great feedback on papers. Excellent class. Excellent prof.,1
She may be a little off the wall but can keep you entertained especially when you have to sit in her class for 5 hours. I wish I didn't have to transfer because I would gladly take her again. BOMB dot COM,1
"This man is my hero.  In class I constantly found myself wishing that Michaels and I were somehow related.  Alas, I was let down time and time again.  If I had my choice between Michael's 110 course and a harem of young virgins, I'll take Michaels any day of the week, and twice on Sunday.  Take him.",1
this was my favorite class I have ever taken at cmu! I would recommend it to anyone and I feel its a class everyone should take. Take it with Kathy Backus and you wont regret it! It was an amazing class and so so SO beneficial!,1
"His exams are HARD! There were 4 - 85 questions each. There is a ""map quiz"" every week and 2-3 projects. it was a little more challenging of a class,  but he grades on a curve. if you put in effort you'll get a good grade. I will take Sobie again for geog!",1
"Works very hard for his students, stays after school everyday to explain the material if you couldn't understand it in class. But he goes vary fast in his lectures and isn't super clear then.",1
"Her class was an easy ""A"" if you completed all your work. She gave out extra credit opportunities too. Worth taking her if you are looking for a GE class that's a stress reliever",1
"Awesome professor.  Really knows her stuff and makes herself available at all times.  Quizes and Projects due each week, but they are done outside of class and submitted to BlackBoard. Quizes are easy if you read and she goes over the business projects during class so you know how to complete them. 100% recommend!!",1
She was very friendly to me and always willing to help me even when i made stupid mistakes. Great teacher and always got her point across.,1
"Je l'adore! Elle est très dynamique, ses power-points sont très clairs. Elle nous fait beaucoup participer en classe, on peut dire nos impressions et opinions. Les examens sont représentatifs de la matière vue en classe, aucune pogne. Je la recommande vraiment, elle rend le cours très pertinent et intéressant.",1
Best Teacher Ever. She wants everyone to do well and will help you if you arent.,1
Shes fun. Class is too early but shes funny. Just do the work.,1
"She is very unclear and doesn't get to the point most of the time when she's talking about topics, she takes forever to grade basically anything, she was absent for every exam so if you had any questions on a test question you were basically SOL. Also she changed the syllabus 5 or 6 times throughout the year so good luck planning out anything.",0
"Alynn is an awesome professor, she's very clear and is very passionate about gymnastics. I would definitely take another class with her.",1
It's once a week and it's a steal in terms of class requirements. You will do great as long as you study/memorize the study guide he gives you at the end of each unit (the week before the exam). Take time for that and you will be absolutely fine.,1
Matthew is so kind. He is cares so much for his students and is very invested in his classroom. I highly recommend taking his class if you are taking FDN. The work is very reasonable and enjoyable.,1
"The driest topic psychology has ever seen is classical conditioning, yet Russ is able to make it the most interesting thing right after Stranger Things. Every week ends in a quiz so prepare yourself for reading. The quiz questions come from the end of chapter quizzes so make flashcards and be sure to learn all of them. A short paper and 2 exams.",1
"Mary is the best teacher! math also isnt my strongest subject, but she made it so easy and enjoyable. i would definitely take another class with her again!",1
I have never failed/dropped a course in my life... except his.,0
She was really cool i liked the way she talked.  She helped go over a lot of things with me and good to talk with,1
"He comes off as very serious and a stickler, but hes actually a very kind understanding man. Theres a lot of reading to understand the basic concepts of philosophical theorys. The class is him teaching you the theory through arguing. That may sound exhausting, but it works and made it the only class I wouldnt be checking when it was time to go.",1
"super cool professor and really easy class. makes lectures fun. she will call you out if you are talking while she is trying to teach, so be respectful. attend class if you want to remember the topics easier",1
I loved taking this class.Professor Guzzone is  great..Never boring and the tests aren't bad if you do the reading.I recommend it to anyone who loves music.,1
"Despite the heavy lecture material, Goldberg was able to keep me engaged during lecture with his quirky and upbeat personality. All of his lecture slides are posted on Moodle which is helpful if you happen to miss lecture. He allows students to record his entire lecture on their cell phone for future reference.",1
"I took the same class as the disgruntled student below and I have no idea what they're talking about. Anne's class is straightforward and coherent: the lecture is relevant to the homework, which is relevant to the exam. She is a fair grader and offers additional help sessions and practice exams.",1
oh my god what should i start with. first the class is way harder than it seems. u have to do so much work besides walking in the field for 4 hrs regardless of the weather. quizes are redicules. be prepared to know all the trees and flowers that u see and know everythiing he says. ton of memorization.,1
"I am happy that I took Chem 102 with Professor Harvey. She really tries to help all of her students. Her tests come directly from her lectures, homework, and sample tests. The only complain that I have is that she does not follow the order of her lecture notes and she teaches half of the material in workshops and labs. I really recommend taking her",1
You gotta WORK for your grade in this class 3 midterms and a final. Prof has at least 1 essay per test and final is cumulative. Difficult class but if u do the work u can pass,1
"Professor Nelson is absolutely AMAZING. She lectures exactly what will be on your assessments and provides a clear study guide for each. There are multiple extra credit opportunities, and if you follow the rubric on assignments, there is no reason to not receive an A.",1
She is a great teacher and proides study guides. All you have to is show up because you get a lot of in class assignments and just need 2 do your projects/papers.,1
Favorite professor since I've been in college. I'm actually taking another class of his next semester.,1
"Great class....still can't believe we get to talk about current issues in sport every class!  Excellent guy, because he encourages and listens to what students have to say.",1
"If classes are remote for fall term I highly recommend to not take this class, he is not flexible with the time requirements for the speeches, it is really not a public speaking class if it is online. He takes weeks in order to grade speeches and the midterm exam. Lectures relate to the class but I would wait on taking the class if things go remote",0
"I graduated over a decade ago, but Pearson's cruelty stuck with me. He seemed to think he was some sort of revolutionary acting teacher by being such a jerk with students, but really he was just rude, condescending, and on a power trip. I missed my grandpa's funeral because of him. That pretty much sums it up.",0
I suck at math and the first time I took this class I didn't pass but this is one of the best math teachers I've had.,1
very helpful describe in detail. give a good feedback of your all questions,1
"I don't know why people are complaining about him keeping us the whole time. Isn't the point to actually have the class you paid for? Anyway, the class isn't difficult at all as long as you turn in the movie reviews and listen during lecture. Most of the movies are very good but I guess me had to show us 1 crappy French art film. I'd take him again",1
"He is rude. I asked him to answer symble questions that I was not understanding. So I asked a symple question about an exam that is coming up. I asked ""what can I study for this quiz specifically, so that I do not study the wrong thing"". Simple enough. He said ""I am not answering any other questions"" which I thought was rude.",0
"Would ask questions in class/during test and he would say ""I didn't write the powerpoint"" or ""didn't write the test"". Skips through powerpoints all the time. He just doesn't teach well. Obsessed with teaching JMP software but you can't use it for tests?? Nice guy but not a good teacher. AP Stat is only reason I understand the class",0
So easy and really nice when it comes to grading. Didnt have to worry about my grade,1
Took this professor over summer and he made going to class monday through thursday not that bad! He is very laid back and an easy grader!! This class overall is not an easy class you do have 4 essays and 2 in class essays but as long as you do the work you will pass. I got an A overall and am really glad i took his class :),1
"Absolutely terrible.  Does not explain how he wants things then gets mad when its not what hen its not what he wants.  Never there, unclear, unhappy, waste of time",0
Amazing teacher.  Open book midterm and final.,1
He is an nice man but not a very talented in the teaching department.I learned very quickly just to read out of the book and to show up for Friday quizzes.that's right he does a quiz every Friday and they don't help on the test. All in all you are stuck taking him for organic because oc only offers him.,0
She would be a great 4th grade teacher with all of her petty nitpicky rules.Chastising grown adults is totally inappropriate for a 400 level college class.She gets really madd when people arrive late and are on laptops.She does not post her powerpoint lectures so you should be there for every class.She is knowledgable about the subject matter.,0
Not very clear on assignments and gives a lot of homework. Most of it is just busy work and not actually helpful to your learning. The material is mostly common sense but he asks very specific questions from the book on the tests. ,1
I loved Professor Reynolds. He made Sociology 101 super fascinating and his lectures were always enjoyable and funny. He is a great professor and I would recommend him to anyone!,1
Best professor I've taken yet! Took him for BUL2241 and am also going to take him for BUL2242. Exams are sooooo easy!!!!,1
She is not very clear on her assignments. She has an enormous amount of work for the class and unnecessary citations for discussions. She required you to have two peer reviewed journals for your responses to your classmates. She is less concerned about the content and more concerned with the structure of the papers. Hopefully won't have again!,0
This teacher is probably the best professor I have ever had. She is cool with what ever you want to do as long as you give her the respect that she deserves. Don't worry about failing the class its for participation.,1
"Prof. Wisotzki is one of the best professors I've ever had. She is a wealth of knowledge, is engaging when she lectures, and is passionate about the subject. I am a business major, and I loved the class! If I could take her again, I would. She also takes the class on private tours of the Art Institute!",1
She gives you freedom to choose each speech topic so that you can talk about something you are passionate about. This makes the class a lot more interesting because you can take time to learn more about what you care about as well as hear a lot of interesting information from other students. ,1
"Good natured prof, quite knowledgeable, tests are challenging but you can get a good mark",1
"This isn't my hardest class but I'm failing it. I suck at math and I know it, yet I can do molar conversions in chemistry and have a difficult time understanding stats. She sucks at this. Don't take her unless you like teaching yourself. Never gives any study guides for exams and there's a quiz every week. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS YOU WILL FAIL!!!!!!!",0
"Dr. Barton is outstanding. She exemplifies how an online math course should be taught. Best tip she provided: Math takes time.  She really wants her students to learn and puts forth the effort as the instructor. Take Dr. Barton for any online math course and you will learn. Do the work, ask questions-she wants you to succeed.",1
"Do not under any circumstances take this course online over the summer. There is a lot of forum responses to be made; however, the biggest problem is that he expects them to be done basically on the daily and you can't do them ahead of time. This made my weeks miserable as I couldn't go anywhere after work bc I had to go home and write a response.",0
Professor is great! Algebra isn't a easy subject but the way she breaks it down helps you understand. But don't think you won't have to study ! it isn't an easy A but definitely achievable if you put in work. I would definitely take her again.,1
"it is a show up and get an A- type of class, her grading is so superficial. You can skip class and she won't notice. Don't buy the textbook! you will never use it once.",0
Great professor.  I learned a lot in this class.,1
"With Mme Emond, it's mostly about stats: what are the % for this, for that...  important concepts in sexuality (gender identity, homosexuality...) are not explained with details they deserve and based on psychological processus of the human mind. It's basically memorizing things and throwing them up on your exam. Still, very difficult to get A.",0
"Neil Nevitte ran the most difficult course I took in four years of university.  Years later, however it is the only class in which I still retain much of the material covered. He committed the offense of expecting students to think.",1
"Show up, do the homework, take the exams. As long as you keep up with the material, very easy class. Exams are extremely straight forward and right out of the notes/homework. Very much enjoyed this class.",1
"Didnt learn much from this guy, and the only reason I passed was because the answers on his multiple choice practice exams were actually the same on his actual test.  So theres that.",0
"He's an awesome teacher. He's very nice and is an easy grader on all the homework and labs you turn in. I've made an A on all the labs and homework I've done. His tests are very tough, though. That is my only complaint about this class. There isn't a study guide, so you really don't know what to expect on the test except for to study everything.",1
She is a great professor,1
"She was a great professor and clear in her instruction! Even with the online format, she managed to utilize Canvas well when it was really new and integrate a well-fit learning experience! Sometimes reading and note-taking was heavy but nothing that was out of the ordinary. Would definitely have her as a professor again!",1
"GReat teacher ... scary at the begining, but full of energy and able to engage students on reading more.",1
Very nice professor. Easy A. Must take her!,1
Took sociology 101 and an advanced sociology class called social problems with him and absolutely loved it. He makes the class fun and interesting while learning a lot of valuable knowledge about each discussion we have. Would highly recommend him!,1
"Without a doubt the best teacher I have ever had in any subject. Subject matter was very clearly presented and she went out of her way to explain each concept until everyone understood it. She made math enjoyable, if you can believe it. I wish she could teach every single math class I take for the rest of my time in college. Amazing.",1
"Taken during COVID, she's too unaccustomed to online learning. Assignments were graded harshly, we got 0 feedback, and we didn't finish all the syllabus assignments due to her negligence. Had very little sympathy for students, answered questions with annoyed sighs and insults. Learned mostly through Pearson study modules & the textbook.",0
"Awesome teacher!! Cares a lot about his students.  Has the funniest, dry sense of humor.  Makes class fun and interesting. Exams are fairly easy, but group projects can be very time consuming.  I would definitely recommend him and the operations major!",1
"Not a fantastic lecturer. Most of it is dry and unengaging and feels like a waste of time. He doesn't like taking questions during lectures and sometimes lacks the words to articulate what he means. However, he's extremely helpful and nice if you take the time to visit his office hours.",1
She is an amazing Math professor. She makes the class very interesting and I promise you are going to love her class.,1
"This class consists of 2 papers, a midterm, and a final. The TAs graded the first paper super hard, but were much more lenient on the second. Midterm and final are really easy. Professor Kim is very clear during lecture. I recommend taking notes on your laptop instead of writing them down because he talks really fast!",1
This professor was horrible! I had her for the lab portion of PSYC 4483 and I did not enjoy having her. ,0
"This is one class I actually don't mind going to. Most of the books you have to read are decent and the class is actually interesting. The papers are a pain but doable. You pretty much have to go to class bc there are 6 in class pop quizzes, but they're really easy if you do the reading.",1
"Im taking this class now and I hate that she takes so long to grade your essays , you cant apply the feedback to your next paper! She grades the papers pretty tough too. Hard to maintain an A due to that . And she she doesnt have extra credit for you to try to make up for a bad paper. Id never take her again !",0
"HIGHLY recommend her, very easy, fair grading! open to dialogue,very helpful,very understanding. I wish I could take her again.",1
"Assignments are weird and seem pointless but they are fun and keep the students attention. For example, I had to make a suitcase for my one project to represent me traveling to the beach and it seems odd that I did that in an english class but it was very fun! Make sure you do all these assignments, there are not tests! I liked him as a teacher!",1
"Lectures pretty much follow the book, but he makes it interesting. He also has on-line lectures if you miss class. Points are given for attendance and extra credit.",1
"Incredibly cool guy, and a very talented author.  Sometimes the content of the class seemed to be very focused on what Miles wanted to do or see, and not really anything to do with the curriculum.  Worst part about Miles is that he takes way too long to grade things.  Probably wouldn't take again, but would love to still keep in touch.  Cook guy.",0
"He's a HILARIOUS German guy, makes a lot of jokes about his kids which makes the class tolerable. Always do the online Aplia homeworks, they really do help. The class is not that bad if you have taken economics before and just because it's ""agricultural"" eco doesn't mean a thing... barely any writing assignments but A LOT of quizzes",1
Susan is AMAZING. She has so much knowledge on the sect of pre-production and she makes every class fun and interesting. She will help you if you take inititive and ask! She helped me a ton. Best professor I probably will ever have!,1
"Amazing Prof overall, If I could take all of my math classes with him at Delta I would because he was way better than the other calculus professors there. Optional homework and exam prep guides that match almost directly with the exam he gives, make his class pretty easy. If you just study for the exams guaranteed B. Very approachable and involved.",1
"She was an absolute gem! She makes class interesting. There is homework but guys, it's English, it's expected. She makes class interesting and will allow you to change your work after she gives you feedback. She is willing to work with you on anything. One of my favorite professors!",1
If you LOVE plants this class is a lot of fun! Krings won't learn your name but he is a walking encyclopedia and he has a quirky sense of humor that's adorable. Get ready to memorize A LOT. It is not an easy class but very interesting. He is very soft spoken and only gets loud about plants.,1
"Super accessible outside class! Really works with you. Shooting assignments take forever and can be a real pain but learned a lot of useful basic photo composition and editing skills. Very chill. There's a textbook but you really dont have to read it for class, just before you hand in journal assignments.",1
"i know im not the best at chemistry, but Dr. Bushey was very rude even when it not intentional, writes everything on his screen so its very messy and hard to read, an tests and quizzes are very difficult",0
Lab with Prof Stevenson is the best! She is VERY clear about what she expects you to know for the test. She goes around and quizzes you during each unit which was super helpful. She always makes sure there is extra time the week before a test to review anything you want from the lesson. Use your time wisely in her class and you will be fine.,1
"Dr. Amid is possibly one of the best if not best instructors at Windsor. Not only does he really care about his students he makes sure he gives it his all so you can ""lock down"" the material, solidify your foundation in medicine before taking your boards. He speaks, teaches from experience based on his recent successes in mastering Step 1 and 2.",1
"He is a really nice professor! He is passionate about Physics, thus he gets excited over the topic, which is a good thing! He has a good sense of humor as well",1
very strong accent. very hard to understand.  I didn't learn anything in this class.  He teaches stuff that should be common sense to most people.  If you know  how to use a computer this class should be easy for you.  He gives out multiple choice tests which arent too bad.  pretty boring lectures.   Veryyy easy to pass class just do all the work!,0
"Prof Infante is such a nice and genuinely caring person. Despite the fact that I never understood a single reading and could probably, at the end of the semester, not tell you what this class is about I would take the course again in a heartbeat. It is rare you find a professor as nice and class discussion was always fun even when it was confusing!",1
"She always has an excuse for why she couldn't return promised feedback and for why she is not prepared. She will give you a B or B+ on almost every project regardless of how well it is prepared and given. She'll also sometimes go on rants describing how ""Men do this..."" and how women are discriminated against.",0
Hes a great professor.,1
This semester I took Digital Image Editing and Digital Photography classes with Clover  Leary. I learned a lot from her class. She is a very clear instructor. She's inspirational and very intelligent. I'm gonna miss her a lot.,1
"Very funny and caring teacher. Enjoyed having her as a professor and was very clear on what was expected in class. Very lecture heavy and are not given notes outside of class, so you need to attend class in order to pass. She drops lowest exam score, which includes non-cumulative final, so I didn't have to take the final which was a bonus!",1
"Attendance was not mandatory so I started to skipped class all the time, but I wouldn't recommend doing that. I missed a lot of material and he gives ""labs"" during class that are graded but you won't know about them unless you are in class. Used mymathlab so a lot of the hw in online. very helpful in class and kinda funny, not boring at all",1
"McDonald does an amazing job teaching this class. Despite it technically being a statistics class, you do absolutely no math in it. He explains how and when to use statistical tests, which is extremely useful especially if you're in research. He's also a super engaging lecturer. No CC or slides, he writes on a chalkboard, so show up !",1
"The class itself if so easy.  All you have to do is read some ancient story and then he'll discuss it in the next class period. There are mini quizzes everyday which are simple. All you do is watch movies. He cracks down on all cell phone usage, even though his goes off all the time. Wont let you leave until he dismisses you.",0
"Sooo hard. she clearly doesnt know how to teach, students corrected her all the time, and her tests were very hard. I even had tutoring and still failed. and she had assigned seating and in alphabetical order, what is this gradeschool? DO NOT TAKE HER, i took math 125 the next semester and got an A.",0
"Liz is great, absolutely hilarious and actually cares about whether or not you understand the material. She is willing to hold open labs outside of the set schedule and will stay after class to explain concepts. She is very thorough and knows her stuff! Ask questions because she's a wealth of knowledge!",1
"By far the BEST professor I have ever had. He is a very tough grader, and he makes you work for your grade. I passed his class with an A, and let me tell you I worked very hard for it. I learned some life long lessons in that class, and NO you do not have to be a poet to understand his lectures. He is an awesome professor! You will actually learn.",1
No Comments,0
"Smartbook hw for every chapter, it's like a 50-100 question quiz that you always can make an A on but only worth 5pts & takes forever. HW isn't bad, Quizzes okay. Midterm and Final are worth 300pts, made a B on the midterm & dropped my class grade 10pts. That was with it not being proctored because of COVID-19. No lecture videos, you have to read.",1
The man is out there!!! He is great and funny. In several ofmy classes with him we watched the Sopranos!! He is brilliant but out there.,1
"Diffenetial equations is already a difficult class made more difficult by this professor.   Bad: reads directly from book Maple computing assignment BRUTAL tests BRUTAL grading Avg50% Seems reluctant to give specifics when asking for help   Good: easily understandable and seems to care  smart guy, just not a good teacher. You will struggle.",0
"Dr. Cheers is an amazing professor! He comes off as tough but he is great if you ""meet him half way"".It doesn't matter if your an honor student, Dr. Cheers will make you step out of your comfort zone to make you better. If you cant take constructive criticism well, or get offended easily,toughen up. He's very knowledgeable and it's a great class.",1
I really think the Dr. Hill is a great professor. She really cares about her students success and has a great attitude and outlook. Her teaching style is also awesome as she reviews everything before testing that we need to know.,1
"She's alright. You will have a quiz every lecture on the assigned reading assignment and the exams are decent, but sometimes the prompts are weird.",1
"Professors dont matter that much with organic chem II. Good or bad the class is still gonna be one of the hardest youve ever taken. Accept that. But MS is one of the best professors if not. Always has a hilarious story, makes lecture fun. Material is hard, exams are fair and professor is amazing. Take MS above all other orgo professors.",1
"This class is unconventional but it may change your life. The man who teaches this course is inspired. Most of the class periods, he does not say a word; it is all student run. Between competitions (you'll see) he discusses the literature.",1
"Professor Burman is nice, but she is not for everyone. She will give you a zero for painfully minor mistakes but allows you to resubmit until you get full credit. She takes an extremely long time to grade. She lectures 2-4 days per week, reading from a word document projected on the board for the entire class. You cant be even one minute late.",1
Matthew has been one of my favorite professors by far. He is so nice and gives you ample opportunity to do well in his class. If anything ever comes up then you can just go talk to him about it and work something out. Very understanding and willing to work with you. You do talk about some heavy things in his class so be prepared for that.,1
"Benny is a wonderful professor and if you put in the time and ask for help, he'll make sure you're not left behind. He helped me immensely throughout the course. PHYS282 is hard by nature, but Benny made a serious, ongoing effort to help his students learn as much as possible.",1
"I despise math, and I have always hated it. This class ended up being my favorite of the semester! Prof. Dodson is really nice, and her lectures were easy to follow. She gives plenty of opportunities to ask questions. There were bi-weekly discussion boards, but they were pretty easy. HW was on MyMathLab, and it was an easy software to use. 10/10!!",1
"This is the best teacher you could ask for. Yeah her exams were difficult, but everything was right in the notes. This professor really cares about the success of her students.",1
"I have fun in Ms. Lewis's class. I am so sad that the semester is almost over. She is funny, but at the same time, she actually teaches you things that you really need to know for a college algebra class and future math courses. She responds to emails if you follow the correct format she gives you in the subject line.",1
Great Teacher who enjoys his job. Doesn't pressure anyone to attend but holds you responsible for the assigned work. Quizzes & Labs help get your needed points. Four exams per semester.,1
Great teacher!! explains concepts really well.,1
"Rebecca is an INCREDIBLE teacher! Her class is awesome and it really opens your eyes to new perspectives! However, the only  negative thing I have to say about her class is that the textbook is so boring and a pain to read. Additionally, the quizzes are timed and online, and they are SUPER detail oriented - which is a pain.",1
She is an amazing professor! She is very wise and very caring. She makes cultural heritage intersesting and relevant. Take her for Cultural Heritage 1 if you can!,1
Thomas Flowers is a nic person his only downside is he gives to much homework lecture heavy his work is hard and homework is to it takes six hours to complete his homework assignment the work load is to much for a Beginnings class lots of reading I hop this was helpful,0
"There's guide a bit of content in this course, so this isn't a bird course. You can do all of the quizzes/midterm off of the textbook, no need to watch the lectures.",1
"This was my first math class I have taken for college and I LOVED IT! Professor Ball is hands down the best teacher I have ever had! Such a funny guy, but at the same time doesn't get off task, and is able to teach the material perfectly! I wish he taught every math class! TAKE HIM AND I PROMISE YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!",1
"Professor Dixon is a great teacher, but she is a tough grader. She grades on a 7 pt. scale, so she expects a lot from you. Don't procrastinate on anything. Seriously. Your grades will reflect it, and don't be late to class. If you put forth the effort and do the work, you'll learn a lot.  Earning an A isn't too difficult.",1
"Ms. Myers is hands down the best math teacher I have ever taken. She wants students to succeed. Go to class, take notes, she tells what is on the tests, if you do the homework and come to class you will get an A.  She is hilarious, she cares about her students and I really enjoyed her class.  I would highly recommend her as a math teacher.",1
Bliss is the most helpful teacher ever. Knows what he's doing and is there for you no matter what. Has fun and unique ways to teach all his classes and to integrate real-life situations and anecdotes. He genuinely cares =),1
"At first I was apprehensive of Ms. Fedorchak because she teaches an english class, but I came out really enjoying poetry. I didn't know she was doing her MFA at the same time in poetry, so that addition to the class was really cool. I learned a lot from the poetry alone, more so than reading essays. I wish we talked about poems more in class",1
"Here's the deal, This class is difficult and time demanding! DO THE HOMEWORK!! Overall, Jing did pretty well. Show up for quiz - ( Extra Credit). No reason to fail, but not an ""Easy A"". But she will help you. Strict grader but doesn't count too much off. Her first semester, so somethings might be easier next go round! ASK QUESTIONS IN CLASS!!",1
"There is a difference between constructive criticism and rudeness. When you give constructive criticism, you touch on what the person did wrong AND right. This professor only pointed out everything wrong and nothing right when it came to my work. Needs to learn how to give constructive criticism if she wants to guide students into the real world.",0
"Kubota is great. She expects that you do the work and come to class prepared, but that's a good thing. Her classes are hard, but so is learning to speak Japanese; if you want an easy class, take Spanish instead. I had her for 4 years and think she's great.",1
"Good teacher, easy A, just study and read your powerpoints and review chapters. If you can get an understanding of your short answer questions, which are given weeks in advance, you should fly through your exams easily.",1
"Underrated, people that do poorly in his class don't follow his clear and simple instructions, most people don't attend the class and that is where they fall short, He is a great professor, very direct and always willing to help after hours, I didn't go to his after hours and still obtained an A. I was a horrible at photographer and now I am not!",1
I really liked him. He is very down to earth and the class was very interesting. Only a couple papers and a final group project. Class field trip was fun too.,1
Dr. Cox is the professor I would recommend for taking Cultural Anthropology class. She knows what she's talking about and she teaches well with providing useful information. She also understandable and caring!,1
"I had Prof. Bermudez during the fall, her class was asynchronous and a breeze. All of her assignment were extremely clear. Maybe I was just expecting something harsher in my first semester of college, but in terms of giving critical writing suggestions it just didn't seem like she gave them. She's super nice though, take her for an easy A.",1
Mr. Martin is the GOAT. (Greatest of All Time) That is all,1
"Very good professor, was an easy A, he is the coordinator for Kinesiology and really knows his stuff. I would take him again if I could.",1
"She is very tough. She demands a lot of work outside of work. She taught my class for 121, 211, 212. She shares a lot about Japanese culture in 121 but she stopped in 211 & 212. I became bored by the end.",1
"Great professor, very helpful with his students and always willing to help his students when they need to. The best math teacher I ever had.",1
"Mr. Stacey is one of the best Professor I ever had. His discussion is very clear and  he would give you hints of whatever will be on the test and make sure you listen to his lecture and I guarantee you, you will get an easy A. He is also always there to help you. He would respond to your questions quick. He would give you your grades within a day.",1
Definitely take Bob. He's amazing and this is a super easy lab class to take. It's also very fun and I learned a lot. He gives a lot of opportunity to pass. Just show up and do the work.,1
"He's great! Take him if you have problems in Math as he will explain everything. Homework is due about every week over the online access. Exams are open book, open notes but not to take lightly. He grades nicely, if you are on the right track, he'll give you a lot of points. I would recommend to take him if you have heard ""the bad"" about FINA 311.",1
He does know his stuff about photgraphy but he tells a lot of stories. Some of them are funny but most of the time they really have to revelance to what we are talking about. He gives you assignments that challenge you as a photgrapher and that really helps you grow. Sometimes his critques are a little harsh but in reality thats the real world.,1
"Introductory level course.  Professor lectures excellent, has power point available for students to review, provides a study guide, and extra credit opportunities are available for all students.  If you read the text and listen to his lectures, an A is very achievable.  Overall, a great class and prof!",1
"Dean is awesome. Rushes through material, but lectures are recorded and posted online for review. Practice exams are nearly identical to current exams, no answer keys, though. Free online textbook is unbelievably bad, just use google if you get confused. Always willing to explain things in class or in his office if you get confused.",1
He is the one of the BEST math teacher I had in my life. He makes math so easy to understand and he teaches the fast way to get the answers. I took him over the summer so he was more lenient but I would definitely take him for any math that he teaches lol.,1
"Had him for ENG 101. He's a great professor, and I think he did a great job making an intro English class at least somewhat interesting. He makes great connections between his readings (there's a lot so expect that) and real world/current events. Seems a bit awkward at times but he's a great guy. Would definitely take again.",1
"MS is a little arrogant, but he's really funny and very straightforward. All his tests are the same format. He teaches you exactly what you need to know, but it's still orgo so it's still super hard. He doesn't make it easy, but he's a good teacher. There are 100 clicker points, so go to class. Never used the book. He reuses old test problems.",1
"Jeff Allen is probably the best professor you can get for IRT. He likes to teach, even though it's a dry class, and he will do what he can to help you; always. He's lenient with when things have to be handed in which is nice since you have to take IRT at the same time as BUS101 which consumes ALL of your free time. Take him, he'll be there for you!",1
"Extremely poor class planning. Will make up useless activities just to fill remaining class time. Doesn't discuss texts adequately. Tests are fairly easy, papers graded easily. Most boring class ever.",0
I would not recommend taking this class online. It is a HUGE time commitment. It will not be the kind of class that you can just blow through.,0
"GREAT prof. Environmental physiology and Evolutionary endocrinology were my FAVOURITE classes I took at the university. You have to attend class, he does put blanks in his slides. If you understand the information you will do well on his exams, theres no 'trick questions' on his exams, just really understand the material. Fun group project to!",1
"I really enjoyed Prof Miller's class. She has such a positive attitude and genuinely cares for her students. Papers were fun to write as she gave us a lot of freedom with creativity. There's not a lot of workload, replies in timely manner, and gives great constructive feedback, and also gives you a chance to resubmit work if you didn't understand.",1
"Didn't like Bevis much... he's not very forgiving if you can't play volleyball as well as a varsity player... unless he's changed, I had him in 2000. Don't expect any favours either if an unexpected tragedy occurs!",1
"Very tough teacher. But, I haven't been more dedicated in an English class than I have been in his. His grading is tough, but if you put in the effort he will be easier. Also, try to make him laugh because then he'll see you as a friend and will grade a whole lot easier.",1
Professor Paoline is a great professor. Your grade is consisted of 4 tests and that's it. Each test is 25% of the grade. He gives very informational PowerPoints where most of the questions on the test come from.,1
"I'm currently doing the 1st 5 weeks summer course in the midst of COVID-19, and so far, it's awesome. Tests are take-home exams (you can use anything), but most of the answers are literally in his lecture messages box. His jokes are alright, but all I can say is that it's definitely worth the 8AM. Lectures can be dry, but you'll def get use to it.",1
"Unbelievable, hands down the best professor I have ever had ,",1
"If you have the option to take another teacher, go for it. She's unclear about what she wants due for class.",0
"Mr. Riley a good guy, but a not so good teacher. He flies through his powerpoints, virtually reading off the slide, and speaks without enthusiasm. He does give out semi-helpful worksheets, but over all I learned more reading the textbook than anything he actually taught up front.",0
I severely dislike this teacher for his lack of effort and bad attitude. Also doesn't respond to any emails even though I emailed him over and over,0
Hard grader and a lot of homework also grading system is messed up.,0
"it wasnt bad , reviews on articles almost every week and a final paper . follow his inst- on paper. APA STYLE GOT AN A  I WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND - NOT EASY , BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO DO . Dont be absent and do your work . nice guy love him , very smart",1
"She is amazing, lectures are so detailed. Tests are hard but study and record her lectures and you'll be fine !!",1
"I enjoyed prof Haucks lectures and his ability to talk about genetics in simple terms.  I was a health science major, but switched to biology because of his passion for genetics and science and education.",1
"Professor Boyles is awesome! He's super progressive and doesn't believe in the five paragraph standard format nor the lettered grading system. Basically, if you put forth a good effort on each essay, you will get solid feedback to become a better writer and an A+. Seriously, take his classes. 3 essays total with weekly discussion posts.",1
The professor is very helpful. I ended up getting a B+ but that is my fault because I didn't do well on a few labs because I was working overtime.  Hint...go to his office hours he is very helpful.,1
I really enjoyed his class even though I took it online and never actually met Professor Bliss. His lectures are clear and so are his notes. GO TO THE WEBINARS if you have any question whatsoever. He's super helpful and cares about his students that wanna put in the work.,1
"Professor Jassen is very nice and cares about her students. I have a strong science background so this class was easy for me, if you don't have one you will definitely need to study a ton! The class was more of an intro to anatomy and physiology and less of the cell bio I was hoping for, however I still enjoyed her class. Would highly recommend!",1
"Professor Sanborn actually very approachable; doesnt mind questions. She is willing to provide additional help. Honestly, the best accounting professor at wayne county community college. I took the class online & i was still able to get extra help in person to review the material along with other students from her accounting classes",1
The work that she expects you to do is reflective of a 400 level course. The depth of questions and speed at which she expects you to finish exams is not something that someone who is just trying to get their associates degree should be worried about. Just take someone else.,0
"Very scattered, gave us a syllabus and then pretty much didn't follow it. Never posted grades, and we didn't know exactly what we were being graded on (did participation/attendance matter? I still don't know). But he's super cool and gave a lot of good feedback on my writing.",1
"Professor Swift is so straightforward with what he expects you to know on his tests and very helpful outside of class! His lectures run smoothly and he's pretty funny! He's all about learning examples and getting credit for attempting problems so his class is low-stress. Overall, amazing Calc II prof!",1
Super easy class. Only meets a few times a semester. I enjoyed going to this class I kind of wish we had more face to face classes. An easy A,1
He's a really cool teacher. I highly recommend. He is funny and goes step by step with instructions in class which makes the work super easy. There is barely any work outside of class because he gives enough time in class to finish.,1
I love Peter! He's the best prof I've ever had and he's just starting out. So many other profs could take some pointers from him. His teaching is clear and his tests are straightforward. He's very easy to talk to and is always willing to help. He's funny and lighthearted and makes lectures enjoyable. I'd recommend Peter to anybody.,1
"Dr. O. is a tough professor, but she is accessible and clear.  If you have a question she is quick to respond.  Her responses on discussion posts are thought provoking and you learn from them. She includes comments for improvement on the CT assignments too which is very helpful in such a tough class.",1
AWESOME guy..knows more about business than anyone else I've met at Butler..does't care about grades as long as you learn something about business..most of my class got an A...definitely try to get in his classes,1
Definitely a solid professor. He's open to everyone's opinions and you can tell he is really passionate about his lectures. A couple corny jokes here and there but if you can get past that and put effort into the work and stay on top of the weekly journals then you're looking at an easy A or B. Would definitely recommend  this professor.,1
"Great prof--interesting class, considering the stuff going on today.  highly reccommed this guy!!  Find SOCRATES!!",1
"STAY AWAY!!! from this lady do not take her online for math because she barely explains anything, she just gives you the text book to read and expects you to know. She also is very rude when you ask her about extra credits.",0
Tests are rediculous. Cheat sheets dont help because he  has stuff on tests that you have never seen before. Sucks at teaching/and tries to fail everyone,0
Professor Sarah Anthony is the best! She is very passionate and enthusiastic and wants everyone to do well. Her classes are a good mix of reading/writing/oral and she is very helpful/nice and very approachable. Great class!!!,1
"Decent professor who knows how to convey his knowledge in-class. There are group components (it's an HR class), but it's manageable and there is lots of time/support given as long as you ask. Participation is not 'required' but he will call on at least a few students during lectures. Can take a joke and loves chatting/engaging with students.",1
"Professor Lawrence is positive and encouraging. He gives constructive feedback and doesn't hesitate to praise good work. He does takes a while to grade sometimes, however.",1
She is very unorganized and unclear.,0
"I would definitely recommend Mrs. Hanratty. She is kind of hard, but not too demanding and is always willing to help. If you take her class seriously enough, you will do fine. She does not give too much homework, but she holds you to a high standard as every teacher should. Mrs. Hanratty is a very good English teacher.",1
"Very, very tough grader. Her tests always seem tougher than the actual homework. I would not take her again. She is a nice lady though. I took her class for 2 times a week and we always seemed to rush through material. She would seem mad or annoyed when explaining things people did not get sometimes. Homework is collected the day of the test.",1
"Wonderful professor! Her teaching is very clear and she holds the attention of the class. She will make sure you understand everything. Very easy going, does not take attendance, and started class about 5 minutes late everyday since we had an 8am class!",1
"Very nice man, but this class was awful. He assigned YouTube videos instead of teaching and yet gave the hardest exams and homework I have ever had to do. Questions were unclear and made to trick you. He takes off an unnecessary amount of points for small errors. In office hours he is not helpful and says that it is for you to figure out. Run!!",0
"Professor N'Jai is a very good professor. He is extremely friendly and approachable. His class is easy for the most part. His assignments are scheduled and predictable, which is a plus. I don't think many people try hard in the discussions so if you actually put in a good effort you will make him happy. Just have an open mind and you'll be fine.",1
Even though she talks really fast and her test are super hard. She is a awesome teacher i liked her alot. She would stay after and help me with anything i didnt understand. She gives out extra credit and curves her tests which help alot. I recommend her.....and she has a great personality !,1
lool tbt to that one time in class when she said she disliked rap. I was shook. But I needed the course so whateves. She plays songs about whatever drug she's lecturing on before class starts. Her exams aren't easy and she marks hard but the course material itself isn't difficult. Class isn't a total bore even though it's history.,1
"LOVE wessel and psyc221! Very clear expectations and methods to succeed. Super interesting lectures, and every other week, you only have to go to class once. Fair amount of writing in this class, but you can do them in a couple hours and the essays are interesting. Easy A, but a super respectable class and professor. Considering psyc major now",1
"Professor Agol is nice, if a little shy. He will help students who reach out to him. Lectures are mostly clear, but also kind of boring (it doesn't help that class is 80 minutes long), but you don't really need to go to them because he posts slides w his markings online. I hardly felt the need to use the textbook, I wish I'd just torrented a copy.",1
"Professor Maria will not put up with disrespect. Homework is tough without a tutor to help. She informs her Students' what will be expected on her Exams. She is a tough grader when it comes to her memos for her individual Project. If you keep in contact with her she will help you pass as long as you keep up with Homework and, her Tutoring Session!",1
"If you need help, ask for it and he's willing to help. Lectures drag by because he constantly makes mistakes during examples and backtracks.   Easy summer course with him, both midterm exams were similar to last year's and the reviews he provides give a clear indication of what will be on the exam.",1
"Frank Sobie is amazing. He taught my Geography 142 online and it was a breeze after I became used to the online pacing and way of things, it was my first online class. His directions were always clear and he typically responded thoughtfully to any emails with questions that I sent to him. He offered extra credit a lot, was understanding, 10/10.",1
"Like another review said, Marek is an overall good person and a good engineer, however he is an absolutely terrible prof. As said, he's a very nice person and will answer your questions if you have them. But that's where the good ends. Pointless lectures, constantly stutters during those lectures, mind-boggling grading criteria and so much more.",0
"I liked taking his class. He is a very good professor, very friendly and never behaves rude. There were a lot of class activities, online bonus assignments and without the attendance you cannot score an A.",1
"Professor Kiesewetter is very good at explaining chemistry. She definitely knows what she is talking about and is very dedicated to the success of her students. CHM101 was mostly review for me because I took chemistry in high school, but she made me understand the new concepts. There are 4 exams and then the final. They are all fair not too long.",1
Awesome teacher. Very helpful. Easy to understand. Don't really need the textbook but make sure to check your blackboard for notes. I took him this summer and it was a very easy going class. I highly recommend taking his class.,1
"If you miss a lecture, you will be lost. He's really nice when you talk to him and ask him questions. The only problem for me was the group project as my group was not reliable at all and it was worth 40% of the grade. The TAs also have no idea what they are doing. You're lucky if you get a TA who marks according to the prof's instructions.",1
Knowledgeable,1
Lousy...,0
Insane class. This professor did nothing for us. When we asked questions we were shut down with rude responses that were smart ass like. It was just not a good course at all. We worked so hard to receive such petty grades. She obviously had favorites. I mean give me a break. We literally are having class over a screen. -GIB,0
Considerate,1
"She is a fair grader and tells you what you need to know for the exams. She can be a little rough around the edges but overall is a good professor and teaches the material in a manner where everyone can understand. As long as you study and practice for the exams, the class is not that bad.",1
Super real & rare professor,1
Very easy going,1
He's a very good teacher. Class was funny and not boring at all.,1
"A true honor to be taught by Professor Maheta-Wells. She is very organized and sticks to her syllabus. Her teaching style is fast-paced for 115 and 125 combined so make sure not to miss, and also take advantage of tutoring. She offers plenty of individual help during class and study labs outside of class. I'd take Maheta-Wells again.",1
"First B I have ever gotten. Mostly because he doesn't really work with students. He turns stuff in very very late and it's hard to understand what he wants on his papers. You have to learn to take responsibility, so be prepared well before class, take super good notes, and be responsible for what you deserve. He does know history really well tho!!",1
"He was very truthful in his syllabus. Every due date and exam date was presented at the very beginning of the semester. He was very willing to work around circumstances and very nice. He also curved every exam and had office hours for students to come by to get feedback on papers. Only thing I didn't like was his lectures, put me to sleep...",1
Prof Klatke is amazing! You def need the book and you will need to read the chapters in order to pass. Her tests can be a little tricky but it's open book so not too bad. She is always willing to help and goes above and beyond for her students. The class material is a little boring but the assignments make it interesting. Take her for sure! ,1
"Celia is a no-nonsense prof and wont tolerate anyone who isnt committed to ASL. If you are fully invested in the language, she is an amazing prof who will help you improve and will help you in any way she can. Would recommend attending her office hours.",1
Super Nice! Tells hilarious stories! Take notes in class there's barely any homework then do the test. Pretty Easy,1
Not my favourite prof for a course that requires clear explanations. His slides are very detailed and he tries to engage the class but he's not an interesting lecturer. His assignments seem straight forward until he tries to explain how to complete them; very vague and confusing instructions which makes them harder than they should be.,0
You really need to put an effort for this class but it's all worth it. Prof. Cervantes uses & shows examples in the lecture that are related to the lab. People have told me not to take the class and I still took it anyway and to be honest I really learned a lot. I can apply all those lecs & labs to improve my web development skills.,1
If you want an easy science credit don't take this class. Not horrible and you can still get an A but the tests are lowkey hard. This class should be an easy A so take a different professor if you can. Professor Oakley is a nice lady but doesn't seem to understand no one gives a crap about Geology besides herself.,1
He is a great professor that cares about his students. He responds right away and is a quick grader. He is an all around great guy!,1
"Ayland is an amazing teacher. He cares about the students, and is clear on grading criteria. He wants students to learn the material, and really puts lots of energy into the course. Highly recommend.",1
"He's really good at teaching and I'm not saying that he's better than other professors per se but his teaching styles meet my way of understanding. Since, he teaches really fast, you either listen and take pic of notes or take notes and don't listen. Also, you get a second chance to turn in all your unfinished assignments at the end of semester.",1
"Sadly the lack of reviews on this guy led me to take his class due to this class being set in the morning. First off, he relies heavily on the book to teach which isnt great because his tests barely reflect what you were taught and was supposed to learn by doing the homework. Also very inconsistent. Overall, take someone else.",0
"Her participation grading - stupid. Claims the way she grades you for coming is rewarding but you buy an app and get legitimately graded. You could show up and try but get a 50 on the questions. Her quizzes - easy. Use google and powerpoints. Her ""business problems"" are rough. Isn't challenging. you wont get an A. Time consuming... Learned nothing.",0
"Good teacher and is passionate about what she teaches, but she forgets things easily, like makeup tests and quizzes so make sure to remind her of those things. Also make she to check your email right before class because that is when she will cancel class if need be.",1
"Interesting lectures, she podcasts them too which is great. The material is actually useful, and she teaches it in an engaging way (asks the class questions, gives examples, etc.) I genuinely enjoy this class and the way she teaches it. Only downside is her multiple choice is tricky but still doable.",1
"Rancourt is awesome.  She's rediculously smart, has a lot of interesting things to say.  Go to class you'll get a B, she even let us use our notes for the final last semester.",1
Roxi is a tough cookie to crack but a really good writing teacher. Definitely made for an interesting quarter not knowing if she liked me or not. She really cares about class participation so come to class with one thing to say about the reading and she'll love you. Also write with passion and she'll dig it no matter what it is.,1
He is a nice guy but the lectures are extremely boring and don't pertain to the material covered. He will get sidetracked and talk about something irrelevant for a half hour. The tests would have been really hard however he puts up previous tests on blackboard that end up being the exact questions on the exams. You just have to memorize the answers,0
Fine Professor. Lectures are not that interesting but the exercise in the 2nd half of the class are fun.,1
"Dr. Walker is a great professor. I have taken him for two classes and I have loved him for both. He is a very funny, caring, respected professor. He is always willing to help out and cares for his students deeply. I would definitely recommend taking him.",1
"I received an ""A"", but the course was still terrible. He changed around assignment dates and his exams were utterly confusing. To illustrate this point, the 'Questions for the Instructor"" discussion thread had over 200 posts by the end of the semester because all 25 students had no idea what Dr. K. was expecting on his exams. Frustrating. ",0
"Overall, OK professor. His main deficiency is he doesn't provide a lot of examples to clarify the material. The textbook is literally the worst book I've ever read in my life. Thankfully, the bulk of his exams come from the notes. HW is copy+paste. Depending on the class average, curve can be legendary. Summary: better than average EE professor.",1
IF YOU ATTEND ALL LAB CLASSES YOU WILL GET AN A.  HE DOES NOT LET YOU LEAVE IF YOUR LAB IS LESS THAN A B.  SOME STUFF IS CONFUSING BUT HE IS ALWAYS MORE THAN WILLING TO HELP ALL HIS STUDENTS.  HE CARES AND LOVES WHAT HE DOES.,1
"asked for help on 2 separate occasions in LL; both times she was excessively rude and clearly annoyed when i dared interrupt whatever she's (always) listening to with her headphones. no idea how she is still employed at ACC, let alone teaching. sour attitude with a superiority complex.",0
"Choose her class! She was one of the most interesting instructors I met at CCSF. She's easily communicated and gives good feedback. I like social science, and her class gives me a good beginning for anthropology. You should pass the course if you know the concepts well. Otherwise, participation is a matter for both attendance and group discussion",1
Tidwell is an awesome professor!! She grades in a timely manner and is an awesome lecturer. We wrote 5 essays (all either opinion or prompt based) which were fairly easy to complete and had great feedback on them. The lectures aren't super boring and she really cares about giving proper information!,1
Matt is an amazing instructor and makes learning stats easier.,1
Tough but thorugh.  I liked her... its not as bad as some people said. Quizzes were tough but open book.,1
"Benny cares about you and will adjust the grading scale according to how the class performs. He is lenient in grading exams and looks to see if you understood the concept rather than focusing on whether your answer is correct. Grading: 2 midterms (50%), final (30%), hw (20%). Hw is tough and long but I learnt the most in this class.",1
"He has a fun, sarcastic, corny sense of humor. He's a great teacher, and will answer any questions, even if he's already answered it a million times. His tests are easy if you just go over the slides, read the chapters, and practice a couple problems. Projects are ok if the people in your group aren't idiots.",1
this is the best math teacher. He is very helpful. He makes it fun and more easier to learn. His class is very enjoyable. He makes you want you come to class he makes learning fun,1
"Professor Sheridan is great at what he does. His lectures are great and allowed me to learn a lot about U.S. history. If you genuinely enjoy studying history, I would definitely recommend him. However, I struggled with his strict grading criteria, which was not expected in a lower division course.",1
"This class is a lot of work, but pretty much what one would expect going into learning a whole new language. If you want to learn Arabic, you cant go wrong with Miss Tabur. So far I have loved this class. She doesnt mind reviewing the material with me during her office hours. She is funny and she also smiles a lot, which I find endearing.",1
"Fantastic teacher! Knows what he is teaching, with very helpful videos to complete the projects. Fast at replying to emails. He looks for your effort, and he loves creativity. Hands down, would take a class from him again!",1
Her test are hard and you really do not know what is going to be on them and the amount of poems and other things you have to memorize for the test are way to much. Also the test are short so if you miss a few then you grade drops fast.,0
Professional and will help out with all of your work before you even turn it in if you want.,1
"Don't even think about taking him for Differential Equations. The first day when he said this is the first time teaching this class in 20 years I should have dropped it. Not prepaired, completely oblivious his surroundings, doesn't know what he is doing half the time, and just a bad teacher in general. Don't make the same mistake I did...",0
Hes very dry but funny. actually enjoyed class. If you show up you will pass,0
"My 4th class with Mike and nothing has changed. Lacks details in lecture topics. Assignments are not as rigorous or technical as I expect. He should cut down on the total assignments and increase the difficulty and quality expected. Currently, the TAs have admitted they grade easy as Mike does not set high benchmarks from students. PS:Lab is a joke",0
"Very sweet, understanding...not too tough.",1
"Very well at explaining math concepts in a way to grasp easily. There is no graded homework, but that homework is exactly like your quizzes and tests so I highly suggest doing it. As well as you listen to him in class, show up to class, and do well on the tests and quizzes you can easily make an A in the class.",1
"Great Prof, not my highest mark but she keeps it interesting. Very serious marker - no easy marks from her. She is however extremely accommodating and pushes students to achieve their fitness goals. Oh, and Also pretty easy to spend an hour a week looking at!",1
didn't care about student understand or not. many tests and didn't have time to ask he question.,0
"Pipiras is an entertaining lecturer. His tests are reasonable, they are a combination of lecture and homework problems. You will definitely want to take notes for every class and re-read the example from class as they are also in the book. I recommend reviewing the notes from each class before doing the homework.",1
complete all the discussions and papers you will pass. Papers are short no more than 2-4 pages,1
Best teacher ever. Easy class and he makes it fun. If i could i would have him for everyclass,1
Just try your best to don't choose this instructor. Loved design classes until i choose him. Class is easy he makes it terrible. He is a nice person and a good engineer but not a instructor. Marek if you ever see this just give up. You been teaching for 15 years and i am still saying this. I would give you a 0 but website won't allow me.,0
"The Test are hard in the beginning but as you go along they'll become easier. In order to pass you will have to study, you will learn in his class. He has good lectures and he's caring. All around he's solid",1
Decent teacher. Not the best but not the worst.,1
"He's a great teacher.  Very laid back and easy going.  He gives pop quizzes every now and then, but they aren't really a surprise because if he gives you a reading the class before you can count on maybe taking a pop quiz. Even then there's a 50% chance you want have to take it because he makes you roll a die to see.",1
"Great professor, always there for office hours. Always very nice. Professor Hunt always clarifies if needed. She is the best professor I've had.",1
"Dawn is a nice woman and is very educated in her field. However, the class was all lecture and pretty boring. Attendance isn't taken, but she uses in-class Top Hat activities to determine who was present and who wasn't. Your Top Hat scores will determine a heavy part of your grade, so beware. The final is a group project which I'm not a fan of.",1
Professor Platz is a good professor. She gives a clear criteria on what is wanted and is pretty lenient on most occasions. If you need a writing course to be fullfilled take it with Jenny Platz,1
He's horrible. He's hard to understand and when you ask for help he just shoo's you away. He's all over the place during lecture and the problems are always unfinished.,0
"Dr. Brown is a charismatic guy but  not an easy professor. Needed to memorize a lot of info that wasn't all on the slides so you really had to pay attention (speaks at low volume). Not many tests so there's a lot on each one - expects very specific dates, locations, multiple examples (all short answer). Too in depth for an intro level class.",1
"She is such a sweet and understanding lady. She loves her job. She tends to do a lot of peer editing. If you go to her office hours, she will give you so many suggestions on your paper. She likes to see A LOT of improvement from your rough draft. Her grading is extremely fair. You get out as much as you put into her class. Take her!",1
"His lectures are confusing if you are new to this (non-EE student here) and are full of jargon. Says that ""it's not a programming class"", but you definitely need some coding experience. Go in during his office hours, he is much more helpful and also very friendly. Gave us the option to skip the final (he'd take an average of the first two tests).",1
"I had Swift for both in person and online courses. He is really great but is better in person. The lecture videos are insightful. He isn't easy and expects a lot. Go to his office hours, he is very helpful and friendly.",1
"Dr. Knapp is extremely organized and efficient in his teaching style. His lectures are informative and thorough, and he always makes sure that everything is retained by his students. He wants you to succeed in his class!! His office hours are flexible and he is incredibly helpful to anybody that needs assistance.",1
"You definitely have to put the work in to get a good grade. Quizzes every week, two midterms and a final, but he's not a harsh grader. Lectures were kind of boring, but he explained things in great detail. He expects you to remember a lot of stuff from Calc 1 and wants you to put the work in. Overall decent professor, but the class itself was hard.",1
Participation is CRUCIAL to your grade. Prof. Guttmann is really passionate about his work. There's a midterm and a final. Weekly aplia and DB is mandatory. As long as you do your work and take good notes you will be fine. I barley studied and never read the txt book. Type your class notes for DB and do extra credit when he offers it!,1
"Proga is very passionate about what he teaches and is a very kind guy. He wants to ensure you get the material and the class is comfortable for you. There is no homework its just 3 tests and one gets dropped. He does love it when people participate, but he won't scold you if you don't. Good class to take for non-stem majors for the science credit.",1
"Dr. Hug is the BEST professor I have ever had. She is friendly, helpful and really interests you in the subject. She is always willing to help students when they need it. Her grading is fair, and while she is not an easy teacher, she is more than willing to help you succeed. I highly recommend.",1
Awesome teacher!!!!!!,1
Rick is a nice guy and is super smart. He worked for the fed for a long time so he has a ton of experience in the field. His teaching is hard to follow though. He expects you to have the chapter read before you come to class but then talks about completely different material. Then he tests on material that we've never covered. Lectures are boring.,0
"Very passionate, felt like he actually cared about the subject. Didn't bs us, told us what we needed and didn't need. Kind of insistent about textbook use but if you have programming experience you probably won't need it. Easy grading criteria, very accessible in and outside of class.",1
Thad makes Phys super easy. He gives you practice tests that are very similar to the real test. He lets you know when to pay extra attention. He's funny and makes the subject interesting. Easiest class to pass when taking it from him. Never had a better teacher at Butte.,1
Its a really easy class Professor Wood is very nice and caring I highly recommend and you will have group projects.,1
Sudipto is one of the most easy going profs at McMaster. You learn everything from his courseware that he wrote and it's so straightforward.,1
I do not like math or chem.... so this class was a nightmare for me. Still passed because he is a good prof. I could not imagine having a terrible prof taking this class.,1
"For those of you who are English and Non English Majors, I strongly recommend you take this class. English 111 is not as hard as might you think. You will write 4 essays and to listen to powerpoint each class. Yes you need textbook. Can be a little picky while grading essays. There are also no quizzes, no tests, and no finals.",1
"Worst finance Professor at Salisbury. Class isnt too boring but you will not learn anything. Each test, more than 90% of the class did not finish on time. He says lazy things like how him grading your work makes him deserve teacher of the year. Do Not Take him.",0
Amazing Professor she posts the lectures online id recommend taking the notes before class her Quizzes/Exams are easy and sometimes open note she 100% knows what she's talking about.,1
"Absolutely incredible professor. She is so well-versed in psych and neuro, and offers her class a wealth of freedom. On labs, we don't get points off for the ""wrong"" data if the lab is done properly and we explain the data/why it is wrong. She also tells exactly what to study for exams, and the questions are straightforward.",1
"This class was a lot more in depth than I expected. If you plan on going to law school, you should probably take this class. If you are not, then probably avoid this class. 90% of grade comes from two moderately difficult tests. Smith himself is a nice and funny guy.",1
"Jeff Allen is the man. Keeps computer class entertaining which is hard to do. So laid back and relaxed. Great teacher, highly recommend him for CIS",1
Awesome teacher!!!! 100% would take again. Passionate about what he does and makes class interesting!! As long as you take notes you will pass!!! Gives extra credit so show up to class!!,1
"Dr. S-C has a very developed understanding of policy & government. I appreciated her candid, honest attitude about our political system. However, the structure of the class could use some work. I did not feel prepared for the exams, regardless of how I studied. Also, the work should've been spaced out more, & instructions could have been clearer.",1
"Super great lectures! He's funny and makes history entertaining and not boring. Usually history classes are difficult and textbook heavy, but he doesn't use a textbook and as long as you show up and pay attention, you'll pass. If you listen and take notes and spend like an hour studying for the test then you get an easy A.",1
"Awful. Didn't grade anything and gave tons of lengthy weekly assignments.. at the end of the semester I had 4 recorded grades. 95 95 87 74 I ended up with a B.. I did over 20 assignments (essays, projects, quizzes) I have no idea how my grade was calculated.",0
"Dr. Ortmann is an excellent choice for American Governmemt & Citizenship (PS101). There's not very many assignments, and only two exams (Midterm and Final). Otherwise, attendance is mandatory, you must participate, she's great during the lectures, very sarcastic and funny, and you will most definitely get an A in the course.",1
Such a sweet amazing professor. I truly enjoyed this class she really cares about each and every single one of her students. Lectures are great she really knows how to teach!!! Love her!,1
Shauna is kinda and very experienced. She knows her stuff and I would enjoy watching her argue in court. She's fair and caring. If you have an issue you can most definitely take it up with her and come to a solution. I would highly suggest taking her class if you can.,1
"I took his class online. He assigned chapters for each week from the book but I never used it, explains everything in his notes. Easy class and he makes the material interesting.",1
BEST TEACHER I HAVE EVER HAD. EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE HER FOR A CLASS JUST TO SAY THAT THEY HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING HER. DEFINITELY A SPITFIRE!,1
DO NOT take this class if you're in chem 121. The professor is not good at teaching that class. She is disorganized and does not go off the syllabus. The tests are ridiculously hard and you would get a much better grade taking Van Huizen. My lab partner is in VH's class and is much better prepared for everything.,0
"Avoid her class like the plague. The content would be interesting if she wasn't teaching it, she uploads 80% empty slides on D2L and excepts you to do well somehow. Our 2nd midterm was 12 powerpoints with roughly 90 slides in each one, so 1080 slides for 1 midterm lol. Should retire since the only thing she's good at is lowering your GPA.",0
He's a great professor. Comes prepared to class and is passionate about what he teaches. Tough marker but if you try you'll get a good grade.,1
He's a bad Prof that doesn't know how to teach material. He also showed some kids email in class to everyone saying that he was sick and wanted to email his assignments. Rick then complained about the email for ten minutes. Basically a volleyball coach that for what ever reason for what ever reason was able to land a job as a Prof.,0
"I did every single assiagnment, went to every class, ALWAYS participated however I got a C-. That is because I always did my essays last minute! I suggest visiting her during office hours and have her point out things to fix in your essays! She is a little unclear about assignments and expects a lot. If you need help, she is there for you!",1
"She enjoys teaching and makes class fun. I learned a lot from this class and I am grateful to her for it. She can be a harsh grader, but you can't learn from slacking off the whole time.",1
"Professor Johansen was awesome!!! Very professional. Very understanding. Simplifies learning at your own pace. Journals were engaging and fun to do and she is very specific as to what is required, so there is no confusion about grading. She was a wonderful teacher and made this class experience fun for me. Definitely take her!",1
He talked too much,1
"Best teacher I had at this school. Very helpful, always available if you need help. Great advice for transfer students. Funny and easy-going but knows when you're bsing his work so don't! Makes class fun and willing to listen to suggestions for future material. Ran out of classes to take with him but wish I hadn't!",1
"Easy class, talks alot just rambles on and on, hard to follow at times. No rules, which is nice as you can basically get a good grade by doing extra credit. Over all just ok.",1
24 CHAPTERS IN 3 MONTHS!!! ENDLESS READING AND GRADING MAKES 0 SENSE! CRAPPIEST TEACHER! She has an attitude for no reason. She does absolutely nothing for the class and you WILL have to teach yourself everything.,0
"Worst professor I have ever taken. Contradicts most of what he says which makes writing any essay hard when you don't know exactly what he wants you to do. Always finds something to nitpick on, downgrades just because he doesn't like the way you worded something, even though your way isn't wrong.",0
"I came in late, turned in work late, you didn't have to do all the assignments only submit for the final like the ones you've scored your best and that was it, pretty easy. She had some easy homework and then when was close t finishing it all she told the class we didn't have to do it anymore. She showed us videos,let us leave early,was nice,fed us",1
"Attend class to know what is going on. Lots of reading. He put some much work on the syllabus, but we didn't do half of it only because we were behind and not enough time.",1
"This teachers teaching style is different to say the least! 95% of the time he goes of topic and rants about the history of... or what he deems interesting facts! Overall, not much learned from class, extensive amount of work! Long and teedious! This class is not for the weak of heart!",0
I had professor McConnell for a face to face class we did not need the textbook because his notes/lectures were always on point! I had him during the COVID-19 and our class transitioned to an online course. He was also very helpful his lecture videos were amazing and he is just great! I would totally take him again he made statistics very easy!,1
Dr. Flannery has really worked hard to make sure we had the best experience with the COVID outbreak going on. He dedicated time to making audio lectures on top of his hand written lectures. Though the presentation was a bit harder with having to do it online instead I definitely don't think it would be hard to accomplish in a normal course setting.,1
"Workload: 1-2 10 question multiple choice quizzes, 1 600-800 discussion post, and a 50-150 one question ""survey"" each week. We also had one 1200-1600 word essay but it was about our own cultural identity so very straight forward. Easy class to take in the summer since all assignments are due each Sunday. Interesting and relevant topic!",1
"Never stays on topic. More interested in telling BS stories about himself, trying to impress us rather than teach us. Never around when I needed help. Knows a lot (I think) and wants you to know it. Seemed more interested in helping (& flirting with) good-looking girls than anyone else. But he is fun (for a prof).",0
Get on her good side early and fast. Only take with her if you are serious about acting (not for people looking for DEC credit). Good teacher for people really interested in learning the craft- method acting. She also likes to see growth.,1
This class was an easy A. Dr. Corrigan was very helpful with papers and his lectures are hilarious. Visit his office hours because hes an amazing professor to talk to!,1
"Lynn was my favorite teacher, she is wonderful, caring, supper helpful and always willing to help out no matter how long it takes. She does mess up once in a while, she has her reasons but she deserves such respect, as should all professors. Her class is simple and I enjoyed going to her class everyday. She is now a close friend of mine. (:",1
"This was a really interesting class. Definitely be ready to write, and be willing to improve your writing greatly. She always responds quickly and gives good advice and is always willing to help.",1
"She is an amazing teacher. I looked forward to going to class each day. There are 3 question quizzes almost every day, so reading the textbook is important. She is quick to respond by email for questions and is very understanding if you have something going on. I really liked her and she truly cared about each of her students!",1
dive for dreams or a slogan may topple you (trees are their roots and wind is wind) trust your heart if the seas catch fire (and live by love though the stars walk backward),1
"I am happy that the previous writer on this list has received help from him. However, this is far from the truth, and if the new students will come in his classroom with that mindset they are in for a rude awakening. Just do not take his class, and you'll make yourself a favour.",0
"T'aime ou t'aime pas...moi j'ai adoré!!! C'est probablement le meilleur prof que j'ai eu. Il forge le caractère et nous montre c'est quoi travailler fort. Il sort de l'ordinaire mais il faut que tu apprenne à aimer son humour et que tu ne prenne pas tout au sérieux ce qui dit. Il fait peur au début, mais après, tu finis par l'aimer!!!He's the best!",1
Great Prof! we had a lot of discussions in the class and they were very interesting. She's very fair when it comes to grading and testing.,1
His online hw is so annoying! There are 40 questions and a lot of them have more questions within the question. His voice is very low and monotone so you can't really understand. On top of this his lectures are fast. He tells you what to do for a problem but doesn't go into depth about the concept. He also expects you to already know most stuff.,0
Avoid like the plague,0
"There's only one word to describe this one: loopty-loop! But yoga is cool so take the course. Hint for the final: Sikhs avoid meat not because of compassion for the animal, but because humans are not designed to ingest the adrenaline flowing thru the animal at the time of slaughter. You were not going to get that one right.",1
"The class used historical role-playing games, so not as much lecturing. Helped to develop writing and speaking skills, but reading and preparation is necessary to do well. No tests, so papers and participation make up the grade.",1
"Ms. Jimmerson is wonderful but she's a very rigid grader. She will take off points for even small grammatical errors and syntax, so editing is your new best friend. Utilize the writing center for every paper, as soon as you can; doing so, and not missing a day of class (a secret source of bonus points) can help boost your grade significantly.",1
"He is a good guy. If you attend class, do your work, then all things are set. His class is a little bit difficult in the beginning, but it's fine later on.",1
"You will be fine if you are on top of your work. If you know you are going to slack, dont even bother. DONT PROCRASTINATE ON THE HW/PROJECT. If she catches anyone plagerizing she will penalize the whole class and give an essay quiz so dont do it. If you are the type who doesnt like to be caught off guard, read the online txbk pages she assigns.",1
by far the EASIEST science teacher! she's nice and funny. she tends to get off topic BUT its related to the topic. she WANTS you to bring in a cheat sheet for EVERY test.,1
This class is very basic and Dr. Chang truly thinks everyone can find a use for stats in their life. The homework does not get heavy until the midterm and the final. Usually it is just 10-15 questions to make sure you understand the material. You get to use StatCrunch which is an online program that does calculations for you.,1
"Jim is one of the best professors you can take as a social worker. His course isn't well structured, but he's one of the few professors on campus that really cares about his students. Class is difficult at times, but ALWAYS ask for clarification. He is old, but the sweetest old man ever.",1
"Probably my favorite informatics teacher at UW! He is so wonderful and makes learning enjoyable. He's very approachable and is always willing to help when you need it. I'm not the best at coding, but he's definitely given me the confidence to improve since he's so good at explaining concepts and really genuine about wanting to help students.",1
Best teacher for music 105 I took this class online I highly recommend him.,1
"Great prof!  He always lends a helping hand.  The only time he'll pick on you is if nobody responds to his questions.  If you have to take Writing II, definitely try to get into Dr. Lane's course.  You write maybe once or twice a week, but you aren't graded until the final portfolio.  He's great so take him if you can...",1
"Professor Dowding is the man that will take your writing to a level far above the writing of your peers. Dowding is undoubtedly the professor that has had the most impact me at BU. His syllabus is designed to make you question your commitment to the class before things get rolling, but stick it out. He is hilarious, intelligent, and teaches well.",1
"Mesozoic Era, but went far beyond, and too much detail. She inherited this huge course, so can't blame her. Summer course REQUIRED >= 50%, else fail. One of the lowest final class-grade averages of all my 35+ courses. Open book/notes quizzes fairly easy, but final closed is hard to study for because of the text: NO lecture notes, just text-book.",0
"Smyth is a great professor who is super passionate about history, especially Native American history. He likes to get the class involved in discussion and respects differing opinions on historical topics. If you like history, definitely take his course!",1
He's a bit quirky but was always wins to help if you asked questions. ,1
I really enjoyed Pam and the class.  We learned a lot of helpful information and she made it as fun as she could.  I recommend her highly.,1
"Jon is very knowledgable in the HR field. His class consists of a case writing, activity, and quiz each week with reflections every two weeks, and two large projects. He has guest speakers come in every week to talk about the module. The only downside is all the writing you have to do.",1
"His class is super easy. Only takes attendance 5 times randomly worth 5 points each. Tests are super easy, he gives a review and the exact test questions are at the end, you just need to find the answers, and they are all on quizlet. Just memorize them, plus he drops your lowest test score. No need for a textbook.",1
"She's literally thee best. Any questions you have she answers them with no problem at all. very easy to understand, makes everything related to something you know so you can understand the concept better. I would take her again",1
"Sam is THE BEST professor I've ever had. He's hilarious and insanely smart--literally a leader in the field of linguistics, so much of the relevant literature is written by him. This class teaches you so much but the exams are super easy -- no studying required.",1
Really tough Professor. Not reachable by email which is the only way to communicate now.,0
"Dont get me wrong this prof is very sweet & kind but she is a very hard marker! Make sure you show up to lecture & do your readings or you wont pass. She also has her favourites that she tends to be more lienent with. She canceled a class, and didnt lecture us on those chapters too which sucked. She was an okay prof but I wouldnt take her again",0
"Very nice teacher, very hard lots of quizzes, all timed and lots of questions.  Too much material given to study it makes it confusing.",1
"Definitely one of the more challenging courses I've taken here at Hof. But Guttmann is truly a genius in his field and you will learn more about the world and how the economy works in just one hour of his class, you should absolutely take him, esp. for International Econ. He is the best professor at Hofstra.",1
If you show up to Dr. Cupani's Lab you will pass the class with an A+. But if you skip lab all the time and don't fill out your lab manual you will fail. Really easy lab and she was hilarious.,1
"Professor Bowlin is the laziest teacher ive ever had. She hasnt taught us anything in class, she just has the students continually present powerpoints to do her job for her. In the other class i have with her, she just sits on the podium and reads from the book the whole class while she told us to buy it cause we ""need it"" I would avoid her",0
Nice professor and kind. Lots of extra credits to make up your quizzes. Interesting screening.,1
"Wonderful, enthusiastic teacher. She makes a class that could be potentially boring, a lot of fun. She taught a 3 hour night class and maintained great energy and enthusiasm while teaching. I really enjoyed learning from her. Make sure to do her assignments and study for her tests and you'll be fine.",1
"Honors class. Very fun and engaging, topics were very interesting. Found essays to be easy. if you don't mind writing, and you're not stupid, definitely take her honors class.",1
"Horrible. Worst teacher ive ever taken. She grades WAY too hard, and is not good at teaching at all. If you miss any work, you cant make up for it. She is too strict, and slow. Would never take again. Terrible",0
"Truthfully, I don't know how she has a rating of 4.2 here. I work exceptionally hard on every one of her assignments and it's basically impossible to get an A. she gives grades like 9/10 and 15/16, even when you follow the rubric exactly. She says ""great! but what more can you add?"" If you need this course to get your GPA up, find someone else.",0
"Often misunderstood: In class, she is not only teaching the subject but also a very singular conception of ""the professor"" and of the philosophy of teaching, through a self-conceived postmodern performatic method, that makes use of facial gesture, body language, and vocal expression, plus sartorial and make-up props: A truly revolutionary method.",1
"I was really bummed when I didn't score high on my Compass test because it meant I had to take this course, but Ms. Cambic made class enjoyable. As long as you study the vocab, read the book assignments, and participate in class you'll for sure earn an A. She's the sweetest!",1
"She is a caring person, but communication on projects and assignments were not clearly stated. CIS 280 is more of a independent learning class than teacher led so get ready to do all the excels by yourself and only a few walkthrough tutorials with her. I do still recommend her for this course, but make sure to stay on top of classwork.",1
"Professor Gibbons is a leading nuclear proliferation scholar. She is the real deal. Her wealth of knowledge and professional experience translates to the classroom wonderfully. The readings are difficult, but Gibbons boils them down to a digestible main argument. Gibbons inspires her students-highly recommend.",1
very nice person!,1
I don't recommend this professor at all. In her class all she does is scan the book and read directly from it. I can do that in my room on my own time. I have learned nothing from her class. Now I have to find someone else to help me on my work. ,0
I did not enjoy taking her. She was confusing in her lectures and assigned way to much work. I never understood an assignment and always had to look up what she supposedly taught us. I do not recommend. ,0
"I respect the professor that Ms. Dobson is. I like the variations in her math techniques and she is definitely a master at her craft, but with that being said, she does expect you to pick up on the material fast. I appreciate her teaching methods and would take classes with her again in the future!",1
"Started off interesting, but my attention span waned. He's a very likeable prof who makes some funny jokes during his lectures but I wish the class had more variety. It's just an hour and fifteen of him talking at you. Overall it was a good class, but sometimes it's tedious to just sit and listen and scribble notes down for so long.",1
"I love Lisa, she's my adviser and she has done everything possible to help me through college. She talks to me on a personal level instead being treated like a underling. She gets on the same level and I think it really helps her connect with my issues towards situations/school work/etc. Will do anything to help her students.",1
He is very strict.But he is a person who makes every effort to help their students. He has great patience and excellent pedagogy. I have learned a lot even though I have a condition such as attention deficit. Prepare your class well.,1
"She helped me pass. You do read a lot. However, If she sees you working then she will help you. Attendance is mandatory.",1
Very straight foward pay attention and you will do fine great teacher. make sure to do homework or you will not pass.,1
Hands down one of the rudest professors I have ever had. I have never met any professor who is so rude and seems uninterested to teach their students. He truly seemed like he did. not care if we learned the subject or not. He said that calc 2 was the hardest math class yet he said we need to teach ourselves. He did curve a little at the end.,0
"Dr. McDonald is passionate about what he's teaching, and I got the impression that he loves teaching his students and preparing them for what actually ""doing Biology"" is going to look like. However, this class should not be taken lightly. The final is 45% of your grade and can legitimately wreck all the progress you've made throughout the semester.",1
"Her style of teaching is straight to the point, she explains the chapter, gives examples, then has you work out problems. Every day is the same, so it made math fun, I knew exactly what to expect. An amazing teacher!",1
Best profesor for A&P take him if you don't you will regret it. 4 exam including the final for the lecture. 2 exams for the lab midterm (combine MC & fill-in) and final (all fill-in.) Take note!  I mean it  write down EVERYTHING he says because the exams are from the notes best part (old school) no power point board only. Answers all questions,1
"Taking one of his classes will definitely improve your writing. His lectures are never dry but its unclear as to whether his theories on the lit are brilliant or bull... great if your prepared for a challenge, but otherwise I would take Kuzmanovich for American lit and take Nelson for a class in his field - short fiction",1
Great teacher! He is very clear and will explain everything completely. He is very patient and will go back to anything you didn't understand.,1
Mr. Trower is extremely helpful in trying to help you understand the material but the class its self is hard. I am not good in math at all but I passed with an A. I was able to do this because of all the extra credit he gives. I nearly failed every exam he gave us but thanks to all the extra credit I received an A!!!,1
He loves his work.  He may go off on tangents but it works I learned a lot in this class and he's one of the nicest prof. I've ever had. he can grade hard but its a philosophy you need to have complete thought out statements.,1
"Dr. Starner is one of the BEST teachers I have ever had.  He is helpful, caring, and knowledgable.",1
"The class is pretty straight forward; I'd recommend studying for testsquizzes, but they're not impossibly hard. Eric is a great guy, but his lectures are very dry.",1
"At the beginning of the semester I wasn't a big fan of Bushey, but he has grown on me. This class is very difficult, definitely a flunk out course. But, if you are willing to put in work you can pass. Do not skip class, he moves very quickly and if you aren't paying attention you will miss a lot of material. The tests are hard so definitely study.",1
"There are weekly essays (which can get kind of tedious/annoying) and group discussion. He doesn't give any feedback but I've managed to get As in every paper & discussion. For honors, the cutoff for an A is a 94, but, if you try & write well, there should be no issue.",1
"She is a horrible teacher. Not receptive to criticism at all, speeds through the presentations like a game, will have the biggest portion of the test (open response) about stuff you hadn't gotten to. If you attempt to push back on her she will talk to you passive-aggressively. I loved bio so much and she has left me hating it.",0
"Dr. H is very funny and relaxed professor. She really knows her stuff and presents the information in a captivating manner. It is because of her that I am adding Anthropology as a 2nd major. The readings for class are by no means overwhelming, and I found them appropriate and interesting. Students want to be in class.",1
awful teacher. would never take this class again,0
"hes very rude. doesnt know what the internet is. easy a, lecture heavy, but just really rude",1
"I was expecting a lot more from this class. Serpell was a brilliant prof. but her lectures were usually too broad thematically while at the same time incorp. theory & a TON of new terms that we're responsible for on the final. Way too much work (2 papers, 2 rather pointless ass., a final, + graded attendance & weekly quizzes) for the little back.",1
Dr Richardson is awesome!,1
"Took him at Scripps. Swift is so kind and caring about his students. He really wants you to learn math. He's traditional in that he lectures on the whiteboard and assigns homework from the book, but his homework is always very helpful and lectures very understandable. He is very available during OH to help if you don't get something in lecture.",1
"Michelle is so friendly and helpful! Her test are challenging, but I learned so much and felt comfortable asking for help when I needed it!",1
One of the best Cox professors. Extremely knowledgeable and passionate about derivatives. He's easily accessible and always willing to explain concepts in office hours. Exams force you to fully understand subject matter rather than memorize. Would highly recommend.,1
"My favourite prof by far! she is so funny and kind, class is a pleasure attending",1
"John Wall gives good notes.. pay attention in class and you should be fine.. If your not a reader, then he would be the prof to take. I read a minimal amount of the readings necessary, and did well on the course. Make sure you go to class, he learns your name and everything",1
The best psych teacher at ELAC. Very approachable and very understanding. Great lectures and notes. She really likes group work. Makes psych fun and easy to learn. Highly recommend her class!,1
It's a shame this man is a professor for the prerequisite classes. He seems so unhappy teaching 2D and 3D which transfers into our class environment. If you are not conceptual or performative do not expect him to like your work. I see him discouraging many future artists which is very disappointing. Do not take him if you have the option.,0
"He's very straight forward. Pay attention and you are bound to pass. He also is very engaging and adds bad humor to his lectures. If you think its funny when professors try to be funny you will enjoy mark. He has very corny jokes. Overall, he is there for you and definitely knows his stuff.",1
"Too many quizzes, but the cumulative terms quiz saved my grade along with the extra credit. The midterm and final are in class essays that he grades extremely hard. His lectures were at times engaging but wouldn't understand when i looked at my notes later. You have to go to class to be able to study for the essays. Felt that the readings were rand",1
"Although she's occasionally witty, her lectures consist mostly of her reading off lists and statistics from her lecture slides. The work load is pretty light even though her project instructions are kind of convoluted.",1
Professor Draper is extremely organized and insightful. She always meets with students and tries to understand any situation they might have going on. The lectures are amazing and she lets students incorporate their thoughts and opinions. The people who gave her a low rating did not do the homework and missed class.,1
"Extremely slow on grading and handing back assignments. Lectures that have good information, but you have to wade through the extraneous ramblings. Your project will require much time and many components, but it won't be until 6 weeks in that you can even start. By the time you are cleared for interviews and other methods, you will be rushed.",1
"You NEED to KNOW and INSTALL: Wireshark,Subnetting,NMAP, VMWare, How packets send/rec. He assigns Group projects every few weeks. Gives a HUGE curve at the end BUT he WILL EMAIL you to tell you that you need to DROP the course based on your Quiz,Midterm,etc. Study HW problems - Quiz is based on it. Write all he writes on board.IF LOST GoToHisOFFICE",0
"Currently in his PHY125 class. He has an unrealistic expectation for Non-Science majors. Talks to no end during class, not requiring feedback. A lot of his opinions infiltrate the lesson plan. PROCTORED Quizzes and Tests. The theme is that he simply can't teach. He is smart no denying but doesn't make for a good prof. Get ready to teach yourself.",0
"Just finised her class, althought the class was a bit of a rush it was still easy. Just have to put in a little bit of commitment and you're good to go. Just do all of her response papers, and don't wait until the lass mins >_<. Again THE BEST ENGLISH TEACHER EVER!!!! Register early",1
This is a great class. As long as you call in for the weekly conference calls he pretty much gives you the answers. Very flexible & will work with you if you need an extension on an assignment. Very responsive to emails and questions. I would take more classes from him. I didn't like law before I took this class but now I am making law my focus.,1
"This prof may know her stuff, but she's better suited for a research position. Classes are incredibly long and boring, tests are semi-relevant and the majority of her examples are out-dated or don't appeal to the class.",0
He is very convincing when it comes to acting as if he has no idea what students are up to. He is a very good writing teacher. I was able to improve my writing skills drastically through his Humanities course.,1
"I think hes a good professor, and probably way better in person. He tried his best but the course just wasnt structured well, and the grading criteria was practically non-existent. Kind of difficult to figure out what hes looking for.. two assignments, midterm & final essay. Answer a series of questions (5) about 1/2-2 pg each.",1
"Talks entirely too much during class (especially for a 400-level one), talking points are incredibly repetitive, extremely flaky.  He does have extensive and interesting knowledge of critical theory, though.",0
"If you want an easy A, take Caruso. Funny, energetic guy who isn't afraid to speak his mind on crazy things. Lectures are often his coverage of the material along with class input. Tells you what you need to know for the tests, of which there are only a few that he lets you use your notes for. Get ready for a fun, entertaining class.",1
It is the beginning of the term. He has answered almost all of the questions people ask respectfully. I had to be the one to complain against him to have him update his blackboard assignments. He ignored students asking for updates on projects due. Everything was based on last terms deadlines confusing you if you need to make your schedule.,1
"This semester was different from the pandemic (DUH), but it really gave us a chance to see professor's true colors. Professor Draper was terrible. She didn't support us in this internship class. She added more work than she should have, given how stressful this semester was. She left me feel unsupported in this class and I would not recommend it",0
Awesome professor. Her experience in the law enforcement community shows. She brings real world events and her police stories into her lecture. Class went by really fast. If you pay attention in class you will be fine,1
"Hardest professor I've ever had. I would not recommend taking him. He lectures straight off power points but flies through them like you already know the information. I didn't learn much from this class at all. Quizzes are hard. Tests are hard too, but are communulative throughout the semester. ALOT of studying outside of class. DO NOT TAKE!",0
He is such an amazing professor. He only tests on what he lectures on. Does not use the book at all. He really cares about his students and wants them to do well.,1
"Graham is Graham. He is a very good teacher and extremely thorough if you show up every day, which is awesome. He assigns homework, but you don't have to do it (I recommend you do) and he's a very rough grader on the test. He wants you to know the subject, but I also am not sure if he really cares if you don't.",1
"Nice guy, takes his time when teaching the material and really tries to make it make sense to you. He taught the summer section of PHY 2410, so the classes were really long, like 2 and a half hours. Still would prefer over some other professors.",1
 GET BOOK ONLINE.  Many assignments.,1
"I cannot say enough good things about Dr. Riffe. Seriously so down to earth and one of the most caring professors I've ever had. She makes class fun by making most of her lecture discussion based and is determined to learn your name even in a class of 200 students. One of the best professors at UNCC. if you have the chance to take her, DO IT!",1
Dr.B is the shizz! Coolest professor ever!,1
"Very nice man but a terrible teacher. It was a ""teach yourself class"" which is hard when its college-level physics. His lectures were all over the place and I never had any idea what was going on. He gives a one problem quiz almost every class and the tests were very tough. He curves each test average to a 75 because almost everyone fails. Bad.",1
"I took his class during the Winter session. He Gives about 6-10 hours of video lectures (boring for non-art history majors) and 90% of his class is exams. You can just use the book for lectures as they are identification, but for exams you must understand the significance of the art piece. Only take the class if you have excellent time management.",1
"Boring speaker, monotone, with no passion. I have Aspergers and have difficulty with social situations. He did not accommodate my disability, just scoffed. Group projects would have been much better if there was a discussion board, forum, or chatsomething to get to know classmates and discuss problems. If I could ask for a refund I would",0
Took her class online. Her Instructions are not clear for assignments that are not pre-outlined by the book. I informed her I was struggling with the class several times. Her response was rude+unhelpful and very unprofessional.,0
"Clear grading , 4 tests & exam , easily accessible outside of class, MATH LAB is a must to actually understand but you get extra credit, lets you use the calculator, very calm , you can miss a few classes and even use your phone.. hands down best stats teacher most wont let you use the calculator at all. EASY A/B",1
"Dr. Mark is very straight forward with what she expects from you. There is a quiz and journal entry due each week, along with group activities for points during class time. Participation is required. There are a few major grade assignments and tests throughout. Overall, she provides a lot of insight to working as a human resource professional.",1
"The way he explained things was confusing, so it's better to stick with smart people. You can missed a few classes and made the points up with extra credits. Overall it was an easy lab class, just a bit confusing. No textbook. If you take this class, you will surely get an A.",1
Prof Hurlock is a very caring person who is willing to the extra mile to make sure the writing of her students improves throughout the semester. I never liked English but her teaching method makes the class enjoyable and unstressful. She always has clear grading criteria and gives good feedback for all the essays. Would definitely recommend!,1
Professor Waller started off as a tough cookie at first semester but ended up as a best friend to everyone by fourth semester. She really wants everyone to succeed! Love Her!,1
"Jeri's a sweetheart, easily my favorite prof in the design department. She's very helpful with assignments and is pretty flexible and will adjust the class schedule as needed if multiple people are behind schedule. A really fun, positive learning experience... can't wait to have more classes with her.",1
"Terrible teacher. Got good grades so far, but approaching him is useless for help. He's very rude to plenty of students. The class is all lecture, and for tests, he only gives you the questions. 100 questions on test, must find answers yourself. 6-8 page essay. 2 100 questions tests. Never expect to leave early. Would not take him again.",1
She is very enthusiastic in class which makes it easy to pay attention. Most definitely the best chemistry professor at WSU. Makes you work hard for your grade though so be ready to work ,1
"He is a very nice person and had some fun lectures, but the tests are way different from the lectures. The first exam had an average of like 68% and that was because his quizzes, lectures, homework, and honestly even the book don't truly prepare you well enough for the exams. He scratches the surface and expects you to dive deeper. Seems flipped.",1
He taught the class so that all could understand. For those that had a lot of prior knowledge and for those that did not were able to learn something from the class.,1
"It took Professor Jewell's class in 6wk format. She was a wonderful professor, very kind and intelligent. Expect to read a lot and write a paper of two. End of term project was a blast! Writing plays are better than writing papers! Received an A without any trouble. Do the reading and participate, and you're sure to pass! ",1
"I can't speak for his other classes, but there is no excuse for failing Math 45 with him. He is more than fair and curves exams by grading them out of one less question. (A 15 question exam is graded out of 14). He also drops your lowest test score and you get credit for homework as long as you did it, he doesn't grade on correct answers.",1
"He's a good guy but I did not enjoy his teaching style. His instructions were clear but grading style was inconsistent. I would ask for one on one time with him to improve my papers throughout the semester. He would give feedback, but it was more negativity than constructive criticism. Nice guy, but an average professor.",1
"Susan is pretty good. My problem is that she has no problem publicly calling students out when they do something wrong which does not foster a good learning environment. She needs to be better about responding to emails & getting off task. Overall, she's okay. If you like spastic, energetic teachers take her. She does chose favorites though.",1
I've had this professor for two different classes and loved both. Go to class and you will easily get an A. There is built in extra credit in every aspect of the class. There are no tests except for the final. Mini quizzes every week but looking through the chapter gets you through them. Take notes when he goes over the quizzes and you are golden.,1
She does not care about students and thinks she is more important than she really is.,0
"Gives very thoroughly lectures, lots of visuals, helpful websites and videos. A lot of partner or group work with almost all assignments. Really good and detailed feedback on assignments and projects. Really cares and asks for reflection to make the course better. I loved this professor and class.",1
This was the worst class i have ever taken! Every other class she would stand up and read something from the book (we can do that ourseleves!) and the other class we wrote a small paper in groups of 10. she did not help us in any way and she showed no interest in teaching or having us learn.,0
"When I first arrived here I took her class and did not pass. She expects a lot of reading and a lot of participating. Although I got a NP, her class was very interesting to me because it had to do a lot with the Latin culture! Honestly don't take her class if you have the chance.   ",0
"Rachick is a good professor of Russian, however his student-professor skills could use a little work, he is very caring if you are falling behind but he's also a tad bit judgmental when trying to help; it's definitely not recommend to be in multiple languages with his class because he will expect you to prioritize Russian over the rest.",1
"He puts 0 effort in catching the rampant cheating that was clearly happening with inflated test scores this semester. He could have at least randomized test questions, but it is clear the he is totally OK with punishing honest students.",0
"For the most part I really enjoyed this class. I felt that it was eye opening, challenging, and intriguing. Cox is very educated about her field and wont let you forget it. A bit critical but kind most of the time.",1
"Took calculus in high school and did very well, but Coop's approach to teaching isn't very helpful. Write down his in class examples, but try to read the book for further understanding",0
"Professor Schap's lectures are fast-paced and pretty confusing. He assigns a lot of textbook reading and practice problems that are not graded. HOWEVER, this extra work is how I actually learned and did well in the class because the lectures were confusing. If you take this class, do the extra work because it will be to your benefit in the end.",0
"taught u stuff that was not applicable till the next test so she would teach u new material right before a test, that is foolishness",0
My favorite instructor! He's very approachable and will help you in any way.,1
"He is awesome! My favorite quote from Gary May ""If you don't want to be here, then sign the role sheet and haul ass. I don't really care."" HAHA. He's very laid back and funny!",1
"Barger is a great prof and keeps you entertained during an 8:30 am lecture, he is easy going and enjoys class discussions, he marks quite hard but if you put the effort in you will do great! Favourite prof!",1
BESTTTTTTT,1
DR. Ajay is an amazing professor. He's very detailed in his lectures and helps out outside of class via email. An easy A.,1
Dr. Baddar is one of the few professors that actually cares about students and education. She is a well-rounded educator that wants to see students succeed. Class is very self-explanatory and is easy to get an A if you do all the work and come to class! This class will greatly better your essay writing skills without extra busy work.,1
"Stay away from her. Grossly unprofessional. Almost her entire class is failing. Her test averages are the lowest of all sections(multiple semesters). Insults students. Actually wrote up false paperwork about a student to retaliate against him filing a a complaint with dept chair. ""A"" students go become failing students in her class.",0
"Although she teaches a 3 credit hour fine arts course, I had the most homework assigned to me in this class than all of my others. She expects you to already know how to play an instrument and read music. She is rude. Avoid taking this class at all costs.",0
"Mark Berkson is the best professor I have ever had. He is incredibly engaging, and funny. He has been very understanding with everything going on in my personal life and with the pandemic. He is not a very harsh grader, but there are not many assignments to grade, so just make sure you are on top of everything.",1
"Professor Burke is AMAZING! You have to read a lot of information but he teaches in a way that makes history interesting. He includes moderen examples, videos, musics that intergrates with the topic and makes it easier to understand. I always looked forward to his class because of his great attitude and his fun teaching methods. GREAT Teacher",1
"The course was very interesting and made more interesting through the professor. Normal online class things, discussion board, reply to others and make sure you do your readings.",1
"She is a great teacher, she is super helpful. In her class hard works pays off so as long as you do the work you grade will reflect how much effort you put in. I would definetely take this class again with her as my teacher",1
Took the eight week online course and it's no joke! Be ready to work and have lots of it. She is no joke. Kind of a tough grader also. Takes a while to respond to emails.,1
"I love Quinlan! He's so awesome and fun and his stories really help you understand what he is teaching! He is very funny and he gives out a lot of extra credit points on tests if you speak up in class. You are rewarded for being a well rounded student in his class. Talk to him about sports, he'll love you.",1
"Don't get me wrong -- Scott is a good guy. I just don't understand his class half of the time. I have to go hunting in the book to understand what exactly is going on. Penalizes you for group mates' mistakes in group projects. I do my homework the night before and he gives me more credit than it was worth to begin with, though, so that's nice.",1
He is a sweet heart the exams are just like the homework,1
"Really funny, I thought Id hate chemistry, but with her teaching Ive gotten a lot better",1
"I don't know what others think, but he is a very good teacher.  He was very even and fair in presenting material, a good mix of visual and lecture too.  Don't believe what others are saying, just take the class and see.",1
"This was such a fun class! One midterm (MC and essay), one research essay and a final (MC and 2 essays). Material is super interesting, however you do need to attend all classes because this is where the info for test essays comes from. All MC is on the textbook. If you have the chance, take this class with Jaymie, it is amazing!!!",1
"He is a nice professor, very helpful,his exams are hard but his purpose is to make students think and feel challenged so they could learn. he gives H.w and pop quizzes and they r easy since they r after the homework due date. Dont worry about the grade , just study hard and u will get a good grade A+ prof",1
"If you're looking for a good College Algebra teacher, take Ms Gordon! She is so amazing! I never understood math very well before I took her class, but now I actually like math! Take her!!!!",1
"She was straight forward at the beginning of the semester, by telling us to READ THE CHAPTER AHEAD OF TIME.  And it helps so much!  I took accounting a couple semesters ago and dropped out of pure confusion, we are mid semester right now but I'm still holding an A and still very interested! READ AHEAD, highlight, make a formula quick guide!",1
"He is a really nice guy but this class has no structure. His lectures are all over the place and he goes off on tangents that don't relate to the topic at hand and that can be confusing. There are very few grades, so there is a lot of weight on them. Grades on specificity. POOR STUDY GUIDE. Disorganized. But nice guy, just not the best teacher.",1
When I took him last semester he changed some stuff around and now you have to write more papers. They are not difficult but still time consuming. The class is still easy but a lot more work. I would not retake it though if i could,1
Professor is very passionate about his subject. Gives ALL test questions before test you just have to find answers...which were still HARD to find! Will still need to put in effort to get A/B range but otherwise not hard. Takes 5 random attendance checks for 5 points each. Not as exciting of material as had expected though. More like Earth science.,1
This subject could be decent if taught by the right person. She's not it. Lectures didn't correlate with anything and we all seldom scored above C-range on tests. She cancelled our final the day before without explanation  which shattered my chances at bringing my grade up. She then refused to let me do anything else to help my grade. Steer clear.,0
"Taking INFO 201 with mike was amazing. The class in general is pretty straightforward with more emphasis on assignments- Unlike CSE 14x classes, there is not much emphasis on style. Mike responded to slack messages really fast, and was also open to answer any questions during office hours.",1
"Dr. Wolf does really care about her students. I don't understand all these negative reviews. If you are disrespectful, don't expect her to go out of her way but if you're working hard she seems to be able to tell. The class requires work but you'll learn a lot if you do put in the work. Interesting class and I would take it again. ",1
"First part of class is lecture for 30 min, then speakers are brought in on the topic, then watch a video. All topics that are relevant and fun to learn about. Have to go to class because a TA takes attendance. All tests are online and Knox is funny and keeps the class very interesting. Really enjoyed this class",1
"Good suggestions on color mixing, paint handling. Poor management of class time. Critiques went way over; she stayed later to finish & implied that anyone who didn't stay was not committed. As a single parent w child care obligations I had no choice but to leave, although I was hugely committed. Left a bad taste, insensitive, elitist.",0
"Prof Merdian is not funny or caring. He screams and mocks students in front of the whole class. Some students (yes, plural) dropped his class due to the anxiety he was giving them. He surely knows his stuff, but teaching is not his forte. Very disorganized and we never used the book or lab manual. Be ready to lean a lot on your own...",0
Professor Zimmerman is not doing well in the virtual world. She doesnt post assignments when she says she will and gives feedback on assignments after they are due. She forgot to give my class a midterm so suddenly made the final worth 40 percent. On the final she included content she never taught and posted a ppt so we could teach ourselves.,0
"Zank is awesome  well spoken, great sense of humor, and incredibly knowledgeable aboutanything and everything to do about the Southern Levant. I loved the class and I think it's a great course for anyone with any interest in the Abrahamic faiths. It's important to know the history of our worldly problems and this course sets you up for just that.",1
This class wasn't hard as long as you did the work. 2 discussions a week taught by the TA which was fine because they are all really knowledgeable. The semester is split into 2 by having 2 main essays you work on. Plenty of time to do them with a lot of opportunities for feedback. If you take some time to work in this class you'll get an A,1
"I took her online class and I let her know what my problems were and even came to an in class class to do the work but she was kinda mean, and had an I don't care attitude.  I'm taking it again in class and I'm sure I'll do fine but I won't like to have her as a teacher.",0
"Laura is one of the most unorganized professors I've ever had as a student at UWM. We have assignments from October that are still not graded. Her assignments and quizzes all have typos on them, her instructions for everything are confusing and full of nonsensical words. Good luck if you have to take this class with her.",0
"If you take intro or her gender and sex class, then you will have a blast. But if you take any higher level courses with her be prepared. She never actually teaches the material, it is up to you to learn it. Basically I learn more from the books she assigns than her in my other classes.",0
"She is a great professor, you wont regret taking her class, she's easy to contact outside of class, and really cares for her students, Take her class!!",1
"Walters was a great teacher, very knowledgeable. But doesn't give leeway to those that don't study. I passed with an A",1
"Great guy, whose very funny. Material is interesting and lectures are thorough. His tests are extremely tough. Make sure you study alot and talk to him about anything you are uncertain about.",1
"I took her summer online class and she gave an extreme amount of homework. Her reading questions were basically all essay questions that were very difficult. She gives way to much reading and work to do for an introduction class. Also when you tried to ask a question she replies with a snarky comment which, made me never ask her anything again.",0
"I did not really like that she spent the first half of the semester solidifying grammar, but other than that, great assignments/essays to get you critically thinking. Helps establish good habits of analyzing and LOTS of discussions. She grades essays pretty harsh though, but her feedback helps you become a better writer for sure.",1
"One of my all time favorite teachers - she is very good at getting students to think, rather than just memorize, which is rare in science.",1
"One of the most useful classes that I have taken for my major. Gives a great overview of everything you need to know about HR, very interactive lectures. Quizzes/tests aren't bad, straight out of the book. Other assignments include mock interviews (very helpful IMO) and a career assessment. Loved her, she was an awesome professor, would take again!",1
Angie is the best prof at X! She is so passionate about her work that you can't help but enjoy learning it. She uses her own textbook so it's really easy to understand. When you are reading it you can basically hear her voice in your head. You do still need to work hard to get a good grade though but she is always there if you need help! Love her!!,1
"This class is very difficult, we're completely online you gotta learn everything on your own. Hw will take a long time. The test is insanely difficult and has no correlation to what we learn or the hw which is so annoying, the curve is really big bc of that but I wouldnt rec anyone take her unless you wanna study 3 hours every week on your own",0
The only qualm about this professor is grades seldom get posted on Canvas. Do the essays and journal and thats 50% of the class. Group project and quiz's are another 35% and the final and talking during class are the last 15% Grade faster PH! :P,1
He loves chemistry. I had him at 8am and every morning he put me in a good mood with his excitement and enthusiastic personality. He loves what he does and is very open to talk to students.,1
"He gives extra credit for attendance/in class assignments, and i mean like 100 points worth so go to class. Also, do yourself a favor and use MINITAB instead of R. It isn't free, but much more user-friendly. KNOW THE BOOK DEFINITION OF ""P-VALUE."" It will be on every test. I never missed lecture & still had to do lots of reading outside of class.",1
"Don't be scared by pervious reviews of this professor. She was also readily available to help, quickly answered emails and quickly graded assignments. She gave clear instructions on what she was looking for and truly wants to see students succeed. She can give intense feedback during presentations, but it is only to help you achieve a better grade!",1
"I'm surprised at the F13 reviews.Marks explained that this had been his worst term in 20+ years due to many horrendous incidents. He was teaching in pain all semester and doing his best.  He sincerely apologized for not meeting his own standards. Even so, I thought the class was good and would take him again.  He cares. Earlier reviews show that.",1
"One of my first classes at CSN. He's a funny and smart teacher, but you really have to work to learn. These aren't easy concepts to grasp and the lectures don't make it much easier. The bookstore was backlogged for his book, so try to order it before the week before school starts. It's unlikely you'll be accommodated for the bookstore's failings.",1
he was not helpful at all. was trying my best in his class and drop me supposly becuase of my absences B.S.,0
"I really enjoyed taking this professor, she was very supportive on feedback for our writing assignments. I really hated english classes but after taking this professor she made me feel like its not to bad after all. I really recommend to take her!",1
"Absolute worst teacher I ever had. Avoid his classes at all costs. He is rude, inconsiderate, gives no instruction on all and expects students to learn everything on their own. Spams your inbox all day with useless announcements and takes credit for work the students did themselves. Abandon all hope, ye who enroll here.",0
"Pretty easy class but there is a good amount of writing between discussion board posts, text study question submissions, case studies and exams. The textbook required is very useful and easy to read. Prof. Hoang was traveling during our class so he was behind in grading but he tried to check in whenever he could.",1
"He's one of the WORST most disrespectful teachers I have EVER had, talk about 10 year. If you have question or want to participate in class be ready to be humiliated. He makes fun of everyone for not understanding the material he doesn't know how to teach. Its not a good sign when the other Stats teacher tells the other classes Guetter has lost it",0
"Prof Humphrey is an excellent instructor! He is such an easy going person. His lectures can be long, but always interesting. I would def recommend.",1
"Great professor. Really patient and tries to make class interesting with meaningless bonus points that are awarded for answering random questions, correcting minor mistakes and making comments of your own.  Homework is a little more than average but it will help you understand the material.  Review sheets given before most tests  You try, you pass.",1
"class is boring, but if you do the work and study you should get an A",1
She is my favourite english professor. extremely approachable and gives good feedback.,1
"Awesome professor, he teaches by his whole-heart support. He alway does his best to help you get knowledge and experience. You should be thinking different and extend more your lecture, if you can not or stuck, ask him. He will be really welcome to help you. and the finally you will get an unbelievable result. take him for your knowledge.",1
"Miranda is disorganized and showed up to the class late or right at start time. she enjoys rambling about unrelated things which also wastes time, tests are fairly easy if you go to class. she likes to ask questions about examples and side stories she mentions so pay attention to those! the only reason people went to class was for clicker quizzes",0
Debbie is a great professor and works hard with all the students. She also was a good friend and helped me a lot after class at her free time.,1
"Professor Hart was very scattered.  She never showed up to class on time.  She would make up our assignments during class, and would change topics frequently.  There was a lot of reading assignments and discussions involved.  Many small assignments could help your grade if you knew what she wanted.  A long paper was the bulk of your grade.",0
"Professor Cox was born to be an Anthro professor. She truly encompasses what it means to be cultural relative. She has real world knowledge & always takes time to share this with her class. As complex as these times are, COVID , she still managed to nurture each of her students inquires & truly provide a great transition & educational continuity.",1
"Total tool. He is very easy, but a tool. Very biased with Christianity. He is a Pasteur too. I felt like I was in Sunday School. If you can take another class, take another...but if you have to take him he is pretty easy. Easy review questions, easy quizzes, easy tests, just show up to class and listen, you will get a A.",1
"He is a really straightforward professor who really cares for his students. Although his voice is really low, the class is basically self taught. The online homework examples do really help you understand the content better. Quizzes and Homework are online through MathXl. Take advantage of his office hours and you'll most definitely pass the class",1
Good class overall,1
"Absolutely fantastic at explaning things.  His lectures are incredibly well organized and easy to follow.  Assignments are tough, but well explained.",1
"Murtuza cares for his students and tries his best, but will leave you a little confused at times. But if you ask him a question he will happily clear things up. He gives you packets every class and yes you will have to teach yourself, but its manageable. His reviews for the midterm and final are key to doing well STUDY THEM! 2 easy projects too.",1
"Such a sweet lady, checks every class to make sure everyone is on the same page and doesn't need help. Sets out her tests very clearly, and makes class fun. Lets out",1
Dr. Crawley is a great guy and professor but at times goes off topic during lectures which makes them hard to follow. You are expected to read the assigned pages from the textbook prior to class and will have a quiz on the readings every class. This does help retain the material and assure that you are keeping up to pace. Don't miss class!,1
"Professor Trombley was an awesome teacher and very helpful if you need her assistance! She will make you work for your grade which makes perfect sense!! I would definitely suggest that whomever is reading this, you wont be sorry taking her!",1
Dr. Rolls is a great Music Theory teacher. He works to make sure each student understands and passes. He is more than willing to meet outside of class to help you and work individually with you. We also have Saturday review classes where he gives up his time for an hour and if you want to go you can.,1
She is an awesome teacher! Willing to help you when you dont understand! Always very well prepared for class and knows her stuff! She is great I would take her any day!,1
great teacher! keeps lecture interesting. be sure to study a lot of definitions!,1
"Dr. Luttrell is very nice, but his method of ""teaching"" is just reading through powerpoint slides. You can skip class and read through everything on your own and understand it just as well. One good thing about his class is that he curves all exams to 75%.",0
"Awful.  If you are paying for college and are serious about your studies, avoid this one.",1
"best possible professor anyone could ever ask for. creates such a kind atmosphere within the classroom, and truly does her best to make the class as enjoyable as possible. always has a smile on her face, and cares deeply for her students. all around a wonderful and delightful person, as well as a respectable and capable instructor. please take her.",1
PROFESSOR LEE HAS GIVEN ME A CLEARER UNDERSTANDING IN THE SUBJECT OF COLLEGE ALGEBRA. SHE IS PATIENT AND TRULY CARE FOR HER STUDENTS. I DEFINITELY TAKE HER CLASS AGAIN.,1
"He's a nutty professor, but attendance isn't mandatory and we just watch movies all period. Its an easy A.",1
Mrs. Hanratty is wonderful!  She gives clear grading criteria and she gives good feedback on papers so you know how to improve. She cares about her students and wants you to succeed. She gives you plenty of time to work on assignments. I would highly recommend her if you want to learn something in English!,1
"Zeng is a pretty nice person, but english isn't her first language so occassionally it was confusing when she said certain words. But the class is kinda tough. She does curve and give extra credit but she doesn't do that great a job teaching us material.. she was my only option for this course",0
A really approachable prof with interesting lectures! Work hard on the paper and you'll get a good grade,1
"Had him for helping relationships and Diversity.  Awesome teacher, but not an easy A.  He expects you to do the work, so that you can discuss it in class.  He does not require busy work.  All homework and tests are to further your knowledge.  One of the best teachers I've ever had, but expect to read a lot!",1
Dr. Hazell was truly great! I wish that all of my professors were as inspiring as him. This was the first history class I actually enjoyed learning in. Would recommend taking his class x100,1
best chem eng prof ever,1
"Dr. Mason was an awesome professor, and I loved having him. All of his course was laid out ahead of time on the syllabus so there were no surprises. You can tell he has a background in education because he really knows how to teach.",1
"Her course is simple- readings that lead to homework, which lead to tests. Lots of reading but honestly you can just just skim the reading. Tests are all short answer and extended response. Overall if you like theology, not a bad course. If not, I would recommend perhaps another course because you might just fall asleep every single day (i.e. me).",1
"She is knowledgeable about what she teaches. She is clearly passionate and teaches the material well. The only problem is she is terrible at getting back to students and directions for assignments are vague at best. There was an essay that had vague directions, everyone had the same questions days before. She didn't answer any by the due date.",1
best teacher ever! would take all my CJ classes with him. Nicest man you will ever meet. Knows his field very well.,1
"I was afraid of taking her class, but it was one of the best classes I have taken! Professor Wolf is extremely organized and direct on what is expected! There are weekly reading quizzes, 2 midterms, and a short paper but the concepts are easy to grasp. She might be a little intimidating, but dont be afraid to go to office hours!",1
Hands down best English teacher ever. All essays are 4 pages or more. Only get 3 essays throughout the semester and of corse midterm essay and final. I'm not good at writing but she taught me a lot. Made writing essays easy! Class was so interesting because we learned ALOT of the Latin culture. TAKE HER IF YOU CAN! ,1
"Mandatory reading every week - approx. 100 pages. Multiple choice midterm, 8-10 page near the end of the quarter, and a relatively difficult in-class essay final. During lecture, Prof. Perez stated that his class was NOT going to be an easy class at all. Thank god I ""S/NC"" this class.. If you're looking for an easy ""A"", look elsewhere",0
Took her Spring 2020. She's a sweet and nice person. She made tons of retake exams which are great. Her teaching isn't phenomenal considering her 10+ years of experience. Just okay. Students print homework and lecture notes. Need to have a printer! Makes a lot of typo mistakes. She made a mistake on correcting my test too. Forgets things a lot.,1
Mrs. Nelson is a great teacher. She is an amazing singer as well and is so down to Earth. The content is very easy to understand if you study and read and pay attention. I would highly recommend this class.,1
Dr Kelley was a great instructor. She provides rubrics for assignments and gives great feedback. This was an honors class and we had 10 annotations to do which were kind of hard. Shes very responsive to emails and gives extra credit. She provides all of the notes needed on class instead of a textbook which is great!,1
"Mr. Oberle is AMAZING! His lectures are clear and concise.  I feel the homework assigned and quizzes/exams given are right on. He was ALWAYS available for extra help. His ""MATH"" jokes are hilarious. I had a lot of personal difficulties this semester so I have to repeat Math26 but I made sure I got him again and created my schedule around his class.",1
"This class was real hard and Sara doesn't exactly teach it the best, but she is an awesome person at heart. I've taken a class and performed in a show with her and she's a cool person to work with, so it helps if you get on her good side. Also, if she sees that you are putting solid effort into the class she won't be so critical of your work.",1
"By far the best professor I've ever had. Keeps long lectures interesting and fun. Only 3 tests including the final which can seem scary but his notes stay in your head so it's pretty easy to study for them. Need 2 textbooks but they're worth the pain. Easy A if you pay attention, even if you're not interested in the subject. Will take him again!",1
"Ms. Forth is a great prof to listen to. She engages her audience through the use of technology. Also she is a fair marker, having all exams (two mid terms and a final) in a multiple choice format. I would highly recommend this prof for this course",1
She was a great professor! Extremely helpful and a nice person. Tests were easy if you went to class because she summerized everything.,1
"She is a very nice lady, but I do not enjoy her as a teacher. Sometimes it feels like the students asking her for more is a chore for her. She also feels somewhat judgmental over our abilities, even though everyone is struggling meaning that we need more help. She is a nice person but her teaching style isnt very universal for all learning styles.",0
"She's great! If you want to pass just show up to class and get participation. There are no tests or quizzes just writing assignments. Her assignments are interesting, and she gives you all the information and materials needed to write a good paper! She grades kind of hard, but gives great feedback. 10/10 would recommend!",1
"i just dropped her class. she is completely useless. she doesn't actually TEACH. i have not learned a single thing other than she is a high class,condescending person. i have emailed her dept when she felt the need to degrade a student in front of the class. do not take her. do not waste your time.",0
"Chem 42. She was very passionate about teaching, and chemistry. Excellent at explaining what needed to be done, is understanding, and cares about her student's grades. Overall great teacher.",1
"GREAT PROFESSOR! EASY A!! 1 group project through out the semester (very easy). Gives study guides that really help, 4 exams through out semester. Only homework you have are definitions from each chapter. She gives at least 5-7 quizzes through out the semester ( says there are pop quizzes but she really hints to you when there is one) 10q's.",1
"You must attend your lectures in order to get a good grade in this course. She tests on pictures and maps, however she does not post pics/maps on her slides, so BEWARE OF THAT. She posts lots of slides and you have to know all of them to write the exams. It is a difficult course but if you have a great memorizing skill then you will do good.",1
Mr Ed Warr is truly a great teacher. Try not to miss any class because he sometimes give quizzes that appear in tests. Take your laboratory works seriously  and also take notes of whatever he says in class.,1
"I absolutely adore Kmack. Hes the sweetest prof out there. Yes hes extremely forgetful and unorganized but you gotta give him a break... Hes been teaching the class maybe even before our parents were born. Straight forward quizzes, difficult final. Go to his Office Hour, hes the best. I can never hate him even if I get an F for the class",1
"He explains concepts well, but his tests are far more difficult than in class. Should probably go to class if you want to get a decent grade. Don't know a soul who did well and didn't go to class.",1
"Dr. McDonald is a great and funny professor. You will not regret taking your required investigative lab with him. A 5 hour lecture one day a week seems like a lot, but this way you do most of your work (and even outside work) during class time. He puts in a lot of effort to help you and the class is EXTREMELY easygoing just like him.",1
"Prof. Dudley's class is hard, but it isn't really her fault. Marine bio just isn't as fun as it sounds. Attendance to class and labs is mandatory. The labs are gross. The class is easier if you do the reading. She's very intelligent and the tests reflect the lecture material. Outside field trips were boring. This class is loaded with females.",1
She was extremely rude and was constantly calling out students. She was also very unclear with assignments and got pissy when people messed up. She would walk around the class and stand over people's shoulders all the time as well. I did well in this class but she made me uncomfortable.,0
"Sullivan is very disorganized, things are often not graded on time and he takes a very long time to respond to e-mails, or just does not respond at all. Notes given in class are often very different from the things we are expected to read online and in the book and there is no correct way to prepare for the test, all of them have been different.",0
The easiest class I have ever taken. We were supposed to take 6 small quizzes from the book throughout the semester and we only did 1 because she forgot to post them. Very forgetful and kind of an airhead. She has put many of my assignments in as 0's and it takes her a while to put them in. Super easy but annoying because of how she is.,1
A very considerate teacher who cares about the expansion of national education. A wonderful teacher!,1
"Overall he is a good Professor. He does care for you, he wants you to learn and pass. I've leaned this by being in his class, I can tell by his great personality. So do the work, participate in class, and you'll be just fine.",1
"He was a very kind person and tried to make lectures fun and entertaining. This was a difficult class because many of the concepts are more counter intuitive. Parts of the exams were group focused, but it's still on the student to know what's going on. I failed this class the first time and had a different professor. Recommend Loren over anyone",1
She was pretty tough but she knows what she is talking about. Group projects were fun. I learned a lot about teaching. ,1
"I took 3d Design with him. A genuine guy that loves what he does. Just don't take this class expecting an easy A. His projects make you think analytically and critically, and when it comes time for his infamous critiques, be prepared for criticism. He gives plenty of class time to develop your ideas and is always ready to help if you need him.",1
While I am not necessarily the biggest fan of his teaching style (I do not do well with a lecture based class) he is still super helpful!,1
"I had a teacher say once that in math and chemistry if teachers use scantrons they are just lazy and that is so true. This gy uses all scantrons so it doesn't matter if you really know this stuff but make a minor calculation error you still get no credit for what you do know. Take from Hodge, his tests let you show what you've learned.",0
"Participate and do the homework. This is a language class, and Sensei Garrissi expects you to speak the language in the class.",1
"Great lecturer, interesting life stories before class, has a lot of knowledge on policy and law and relates it to everyday life. You can catch up with podcasts which is super helpful if you commute. Readings are not too long compared to other Classes and if you do them and go to class its easy to do well. Test are fair. Super interesting material!",1
"Do Not! I repeat Do Not take this Professor under any circumstances! Please try to avoid him! His Syllabus is not clear, he does not give you extra credit, he has no compassion for his work or his students and he will give you lectures about how getting a degree dont matter when it clearly does! Because he wouldnt have one two Or three degrees!",0
"Wasn't a big fan of Fetter.  His class consists of asking questions and watching Panoptos out of class, not the way I like to learn.  Quizzes and tests are lengthy and hard.  Likes students who ask questions and seem interested.  Doesn't really go off grading scale and curves, but class is difficult.  Go to review sessions and go to class.",0
"Mrs. Wright barely taught us anything & barely communicated with us (in-person or through email). Lots of group assignments and quizzes on TB chapters (which you don't have to read). No lecture material. She is not very accommodating or approachable. She does not reply to emails for weeks. The class was an easy A, it was just frustrating",0
Great Professor!! She LOVES what she is doing and does all that she can to help students out to prpare for every aspect of the class! Makes learning fun!,1
She has a weird grading criteria in which she gives a cumulative final and if you dont pass that even if you have a good standing grade she will fail you. She is awful at explaining and she even puts things on midterms that werent on her study guides and arrogantly tells you she knows it wasnt on there but you can atleast try for partial credit.,0
She is the single WORST prof I have ever had! She is scatterbrained and contradicts herself. She is rude when asking questions are asked and literally just rants about plants and climate change. Grading criteria for midterms is nonexistent and she expects you to be an expert on the subject even though her lectures are utterly useless. Good luck,0
"She is a good teacher that is big on structure. The class is really just about following instructions to the letter. She gave exact checklists of what she wanted for each paper. The book provided helpful examples. It is not hard to get an A. She even gives helpful peer reviews before its time to hand in the final copy. Follow instructions, do well.",1
"Dr. Green is one of the best professors I've had. You WILL grow as a writer in this class. There is a lot of reading (expected), but he paces it out really nicely. Lots of participation points. Great feedback on essays, and many chances to submit drafts for early feedback. Allows rewrites. Also, a chance to write your own fiction. Take this prof.",1
"Hands down the best class I took all semester. Wessel cares a lot about her students and gives great feedback on how to improve and do well. Tons of extra credit options and one of the exam grades is dropped, so if you do well enough on the 2 midterms, you don't need to take the final. She's incredibly smart, and I really enjoyed the lectures.",1
"It's all about her good side, get on it. Go to office hours, keep up with the reading, contribute in class, and if she still doesn't like you, be ready for that B+.",1
"He REALLY cares about his students and will go to great lengths to make sure everyone is succeeding. Super funny/comical and honest/genuine. Writing is horrible, and he didn't always explain what seemed obvious to him but was confusing to the class, so make sure to ask lots of qs. Key is to just do a lot of practice. Overall, great prof!",1
"Curses, always cancelled class, never emails, never gives criteria for work, has walked out of class",0
"Ok don't get me wrong, she's a nice woman and was accessible outside of class but if you need to take a class to fulfill a requirement, look for someone else or wait until the next semester. She provides feedback that isn't that helpful and when you ask for help, she basically tells you to settle for a lower grade.",0
"She worked with me.  This was my busiest semester, with 16 hours and 30+ at work, and I was holding a retreat in November.  She worked with me and helped me out big time with assignments.  She is really into Literature, and is well versed.  She knows her stuff, and enjoys sharing her personal stories.  Really knows how to connect with her class!",1
"This class was the only class that I'd look forward in the morning. As a freshmen, I thought that I wouldn't be ready for this course but man, she's hilarious and super caring. Homework? Barely any. Her lectures are very fun and most of them relate to the world today. She always bring laughter to the class, it's truly an amazing class.",1
"I really enjoyed this class and I really liked this professor. There were huge technical issues with the learning software we were using - the computer marked correct answers as wrong, but Dr. Ikegwuonu went above and beyond to make sure that everyone got the grades they deserved and showed a lot of leeway. Very passionate and knowledgable. ",1
"If you are unfortunate to have him for your COB 300 marketing class, JUST CHANGE MAJORS NOW! He is by far, the worst professor I have ever taken. He will tell you to study a certain part of the material, and test on the complete opposite. To make it worse, he took a class in grad school about formatting exams which are ridiculously hard. Good luck!",0
"If you are terrible at math, avoid this class at all costs! She barely knows how to speak English. Her explanations just leave you more confused. You are better off watching Youtube videos for an explanation than listening to her.",0
Very easy course online. Its a self teaching course with only three due dates for the semester. All you have to do is follow the book step by step for coding projects which make for easy assignments.,1
"This class was not only extremely useful, but Dr. Hartman made me look forward to going. She made me a better writer & editor. 5 total assignments that will apply to life after college (emails, resumes, reports, letters & memo's), as well as being graded on attendance, quizzes and participation. Take this class (as a junior if possible)!",1
"This teacher is all over the place by going back & forth between the book & online & this is where she lost me in translation. I felt as if I was teaching myself & she made the subject even more boring that it is. She left me confused & frustrated with her assignments & I lost my desire to learn. I felt like a failure, so I dropped.",0
Very nice lady! Always willing to help. Only has 5 essays in here English 101 class. Easy A!,1
"His tests were really hard. The tests were nothing like the labs or homework. His lectures weren't so great, he started off expecting you to understand Matlab and how to code. Major of the class failed or got a D. Not an easy class at all.",0
He's a pretty good teacher. His notes are very informative and gives great examples as to what he's teaching.,1
"At the beginning I hated this class more than anything in the world. Her teaching style can be very bold as she likes you to participate lots in class + takes her a very long time to return grades on essays which is frustrating. Although these are the negatives I found Maureen growing on me toward the end - if you put in the work, you can do good",1
"You can tell that she really wants to help you, but she is not smart enough to do it. She has been teaching this course for at least 3 years. But still she doesn't know how to help students with their english. Highly recommend you NOT to choose her class.",1
Hoffman is really hard for biochem. I know students here are saying good things about him which I agree with. He's not a bad guy just rushes through lecture and his exams are only thing that your grade will be based on. Whole class wants extra credit but Hoffman don't care.,0
"Really a good class. TBH Im conservative and didnt expect much from the class, but felt like Dr Carter respects all students and wants to use anthropology to reach out. Like others said, he changes lives. the work load is what you would expect, and Patrick did a great job as teaching assistant. Always responded to emails and was v friendly.",1
"Day 1 I was certain I made a mistake when my guidance counselor signed me up for his course. Over time he did grow on me, has a way to keep lectures decently interesting. Tests cover a lot of info, but I never had a problem with them. Very strict guy though, especially about lateness and absences. Overall not too bad. Not a ""friend"" type of prof",1
"Don't call her professor, Miranda is really chill.  She's super personable & funny when lecturing!  If u love small dogs, she brings adore each class.  She kept the class interested 99% of the time.  I found it hard to contact her though.  4 or 5 speeches and mostly politically prompted, and a few short 1 page papers.  She offers extra credit.",1
"Attendance is not mandatory - as he podcasts everything. The class is graded on one midterm (30% of your grade) and one final (70% of your grade). Both are in class assignments, short essay form, where you answer questions based on hypothetical laws or legal arguments. They are open book and open note (no electronics though).",1
Do not take his class. Avoid it at all costs. The MLSC actually has their own sections just for students in his class because of how hard he is. He's different from every other professor at OSU in terms of homework and tests. Homework is very tough and grades it hard. Also tons of pop quizzes and a quiz in the first week worth 9% of the class.,0
"Had him for COM 221 and honestly he's one of the best professors I've had here at Riddle. If you follow the rubric and the steps provided you'll get an A or at least something very close to it. Furthermore, he adds a lot of flair and personality to a class that otherwise would be pretty boring. He'll keep you engaged. Overall 10/10 would recommend.",1
"This guy is a jerk and a half- he seems like he knows what he's doing in lectures but if you talk to him individually, he'll treat you with utmost disdain.  He shows up at class like 10 minutes late and then blames class being late on the computer and projector and then treats the repair people with comtempt.  What an a$$h0le of an individual.",0
He genuinely cares for his students and wants nothing but the best for everyone.,1
"Has to be one of the easiest classes at Rutgers. Minimal work, but a lot of it can come down to your TA who grades your final paper and short assignments, but on the whole ridiculously easy. Definitely take it.",1
The greatest professor I had met in UW!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
Dr.Nevil is such a good teacher!!!! she's soo helpful kinda strict on grading but is outstanding!!!.. you should def. take her!,1
"I just got an A in the class.  Your entire grade is basically her **** project.  She even dropped the final exam, so there was no point in even going to class after the midterm exam besides group meetings for the project.  Whether or not that's a good or bad thing is up to you...  avoid if you can",0
Extremely harsh grader that makes you feel like the worst writer in the world. Pray for a B.,0
"She's an amazing teacher. Don't believe most of what you read from past students besides, it takes her awhile to grade assignments. If you need clarification she helps you. Expect to read!!! I learned a lot from her and I'm happy I took her class. ",1
"Introductory Modern Dance class - pretty chill in general, the prof is nice and encouraging. ",1
"She is awesome. Take her, you won't regret it. She's willing to help and willing to listen to everyone.",1
"She was really funny and nice in class, but a super tough grader. If you didn't say something at least 3 times or more in class, then she would take points off your participation grade. Never could get full points on an assignment, she would always find something wrong with it.",0
I really enjoyed the class. The professor is extremely helpful and willing to meet outside of class for additional help and clarification. I really appreciated that the syllabus was well organized and easy to follow.,1
"This class was not easy, but Patrick was a great help.  He is accessible when you need him, and his lectures are good.  Sometimes he writes sloppily on the board, but you can usually follow along.  I would definitely recommend him for upper level math courses.  He knows what he's talking about, and he wants you to pass.",1
"wow words can not describe how great of a professor, professor Quinlan was! even though it was a 4 hour class, he made the lectures fun and really interesting. He incorporates a lot of personal stories when giving lectures which really helps you understand the material better. The only downfall to his class that the test are worded weird. An easy A",1
"Andre Turcotte is hands down the worst prof in the communications department. His content for SPSS is beyond advanced for our knowledge, and he does nothing to help the class understand the maze that is SPSS. In fact, he loves to leave early and leave it up to his TA's to answer 57 questions from a class of 150. Pray that you have Brady as a TA.",0
"Great, Great Teacher. The Comp sci dept is the best. KC is easy going and fun to be with. sometimes she gets a little over the top but you leard to deal with it. She loves everybody and will take walk ins anytime of the day in her office.",1
"Reading the reviews made me wary, however after going to lecture and doing the first midterm, I'd say all the 1.0/5 ratings are from salty students who don't study. This prof is awesome, yeah she speaks softly during lecture, just pay better attention! She has immense knowledge in archaeology and you will do well if you study hard! Highly recommend",1
"Paul Young is awesome. If you have any interest in learning the music industry, Paul's your man. While you must show up to understand the material, and the material can get a little heady, he acknowledges this and tries to make it accessible for everyone. Tests can be a little challenging but study and it's not too bad + the material is fun.",1
"Crystal is an exceptional instructor to have, with many years of experience teaching. Lessons are informative and delivered in a way that makes it easier to understand; course materials are very helpful for reinforcing concepts + exams. She is very helpful in assisting students who may not understand certain concepts to ensure that they succeed.",1
"This was one of the worst classes I have ever taken. I am fairly certain I will retake it, not because I didn't pass but because I didn't get anything out of it. I don't feel like I have any better understanding of the subject. DON'T TAKE THIS TEACHER! This was a disaster of a class.",0
His teaching style was exactly what I was looking for. I enjoyed his class and learned useful stuff.,1
This teacher is great. He is extremely helpful and takes extra time if you need additional help. He is very nice and understanding. I would also say that he is very smart. I was hoping that I could take his class for managerial accounting but CSN already has teacher to fill that position but I will be writing to CSN to let him teach that class.,1
"Very nice guy, but gives a lot of work. He gave more work than the other ENES100 professors did and also graded pretty harshly. You also need to participate to earn credit because he knows when you don't. A lot of extra credit opportunities were given.",1
Lectures are completely pointless but sometimes there are in class responses that she takes attendance off of (which is 15% of your grade).  The majority of her class is her reading quotes off of her slides. Very annoying class but assignments are easy,0
"She's very nice and gives great feedback on assignments, but gives so much work! It's mostly busy work. It's helpful for extra grades but that's about it. There's SO much reading. Most of the readings are pretty long. She grades participation and attendance.",1
"I went in to Smith's Constitutional Law course as Donald Trump, and came out as Barack Obama. He is insanely knowledgeable and challenges you in the right way. He is very funny in a dad joke kind of way. Midterm and Final make up your entire grade, and are both open note. DO THE READING. I have taken multiple courses from him, he is amazing!",1
"Professor Perez is a wonderful instructor. He is easy, good grader and takes his class seriously. Very helpful and you won't regret taking his class. Easy, great and fun assignments in his class.",1
took her twice! She really knows how to make you approach environmental questions from all different angles. Great class where it doesn't even feel like a chore to learn,1
"She's a really good teacher, just go to class take notes and you will pass easily. You get a study guide and a lecture guide that are both super helpful for the tests, there isn't much homework but you must attend the lab or you won't pass. Overall its an easy and interesting class as long as you put in a bit of effort.",1
"I just finished up astronomy with prof Benito. I ended up getting an A in the course.  The material is very interesting and you get to see the planetarium as well as go to Jones Beach at night with the telescopes,  I learned a lot about astronomy which was a lot more interesting than taking bio again.",1
"I absolutely loved the lectures that Dr. Yang gave this past semester. She was so caring and was always available to answer questions during office hours. If you can manage to be lucky enough to have her for freshman biology, take advantage of the opportunity. She offers a great perspective on many concepts that make them easier to learn and absorb",1
"The negative comment about this teacher is simply not true. Professor Lamprey is easy going, knowledgeable, and helpful. You basically get what you put in and if you want respect, do your homework and show up to class. Easy ""A"".",1
"This class is hands down one of the best classes I have taken. I her class and COMM 1101 (the general public speaking class) and Dr. Swenson's class is SO much better, more hands-on and I feel like I learned so much more from her class. She is a very kind, fun and engaging professor and I would recommend taking any/all of her classes!",1
"Engaging, corny guy. Occasionally he'll bring in live demonstrations in class. His lectures though, IMO, are not as straightforward to me. It's really important to attend class and pay close attention. You won't pass just by reading his PPT notes. Focus, read prior to class, and attend study sessions if given. You will make it.",1
"He's the best music teacher ever, he doesn't do assessments in my case, but that's because I take piano lessons with him, but I do take it for credit so that I can get it free because one of my parents works there. He is laid back, chill, and if you're taking a class, easily distracted, but other than easily distracted, he's the best.",1
So her exams are take home and she uses a packet which basically if you use will get you an a on the exams. As a person though she would literally yell at people who didnt understand and were trying to ask questions as if they were stupid.,1
"She was very helpful and knows lots about computers. There is a lot of work in her classes but she often helped us with it in lab. She is very good at explaining content, is understanding and nice!",1
"Maher has been great for me in both Mammalogy & Bio Stats. Very laid back teacher but at the same time he knows how to enforce his material properly. A lot of it is straight from the book so buying the required book(s) is highly advised. He has some good humor, is very approachable & good at answering questions. Would take again. -NL",1
One of the best prof I have come across!!,1
one of the hardest classes ive ever taken in my life. he is no help at all and will rip you apart if you make a mistake. he may be a very smart man but just dont take him,0
"She literally gives you ""short answer assignments"" but in reality its 2-3 paragraphs per question and there is 5 questions. Its just so dumb of a professor to do that. And during a pandemic. No sympathy. Avoid taking her",0
"I don't hate many people. BUT I HATE THIS PROFESSOR! She is condescending, rude, conflict specific and incredibly uncompromisable. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. She is unfair with her grading, will not accommodate for sick days or family deaths   I'm a white male. one time she said to me, ""People like you need to realize they can't get their way"". wow. ",0
"Great professor! Lots of energy and clear understanding of the material. She keeps the class very fun. If I had to take another Kine, it would be with her.",1
"Homework problems were way more difficult than exams, but exams were not easy either. Wang does a nice job with this class because we actually see applications of statistics to electrical engineering. Homework sets often contained MATLAB, and it was good to see the material from that perspective.",1
"His instructions are not clear and sometimes disccusions are graded pretty harshly, overall it's an easy class",0
"Very interesting class, had ""pop"" quizzes at least once a week. If you dont do the reading then there is no way you will pass. No midterms or finals but you have 3 papers to write. Participation in class is a good way to get an easy A in a big chunk of the final grading. Very interesting teacher",1
"Professor Lawrence is perhaps the best professor I have had at BYU. He cares about what he teaches, and he cares about his students. He has wonderful insights, ideas, and assignments. His class requires preparation and attention. Without them it is possible to go to his class, zone out, and think him an average teacher. If you are prepared it rocks",1
"If you want an easy English class, take her! There were a few essays and a final group project at the end. She gives short readings for homework and has quizzes on them but if you do the reading they should be easy. If you turn in your essays and do well on the quizzes you should be able to pass the class with an A.",1
A real gem of a professor. His class was my favorite Gen Ed/Hub Unit so far. A great class if you have decent Bible Knowledge and would like to supplement it.,1
"The best professor I have gotten all year. She is a little heavy in homework, but nothing that will take more than an hour or two to Oral quizzes is a big thing for her which is not too difficult and you can use your notes! These actually make you pay attention to the course material and this helped me learn a lot.",1
if that was psychlogy then i'm glad it wasnt my major...another bad class at PBU...all he did was preach every class and show movies...,0
"Quizzes are only 3 questions, Exams are 5 questions, each question might have 2 parts.... he doesnt upload grades on Canvas, so good luck knowing what your avg is. He expects too much and you should learn things he doesnt teach, he said you guys are not pets, you should apply whatever tricks I teach you and apply them to what I dont go over",0
"Her accent is a little tough. Grading is clear. Compared to other professors, her class is better to take.",1
"Very rude, very condescending, help was nonexistent. He did nothing to actually help his students. Threw a tantrum in the beginning of the semester and cancelled class because we werent asking enough questions. Very unprofessional. If I could give zeros, I would.",0
Outstanding instructor. Does things different than others at Manoa.  He did his PhD on how to teach a second language and it shows. You'll get more from him than any other.  Highly recommended.,1
"Ning dosent teach.  You have to be able to study and learn the material on your own.  Attendance is a must, due to the fact you have in class work sheets you have to do everyday for credit.  You can work with a partner on the material and when your done you can leave.  I would not recommend this class if you can not learn math on your own.",0
"Take this class and you'll be sorry. He pulls up the book online, throws it up on the projector, and reads directly out of it for the whole class period. While he's doing that he explains how the book is meant for mathematicians, not students. His grading system seems completely random and will give you 0 on a question almost randomly. Do not take.",0
"She's the reason I decided to become a Psychology major, I want to be  like her some day.  She's great! I Highly recommend her class",1
"Dr. McCorquodale was a guest lecturer for Professor Ku's section of ENG100. It was hilarious. I really like how he is. I wish he were teaching full time again. He swears a lot and makes funny jokes, but what is really important is he tells us about industry and what is happening. I think his comments will influence my career decisions.",1
"what a lot of my high school Am Fed classes were lacking was linking the concepts we were taught to real-world situations, and Dr. SASS was great at that. i never missed a class, and i didn't get bored once. however, i would not recommend taking this class your very first semester, especially if you are in honors.  the workload is a shock.",1
"Very good professor. The material in the course is very abstract and the recommended 10 hours a week is accurate if you really want to understand what it is you're doing. He gives you a really clear idea what is going to be on the tests and what is expected for assignments. The class is HARD, but it has nothing to do with the way he teaches it.",1
"Devoted to helping her students succeed. She would stay after lecture and help students identify and look at fungal structures during lab. Anne is always willing to stop in lecture and answer questions as long as needed, never worrying about falling behind on the material. It is clear that she wants her students to truly understand the information.",1
"Attendance is NOT mandatory and he will tell you that. Lectures are funny and about todays society. All powerpoints are uploaded online so tests are easy. Only grades participation, basically just give your opinion in class 5 times before Christmas. There are three papers, best score of 3 counts. I got a 100% the first one so never wrote anymore",1
I'm in her class now and I must say she is passionate and helpful. I absolutely love her. She's easy to talk... Except homework and a lot of writing but if you apply yourself and seek help she's totally there for you. I would recommend her in a heart beat.   Might I had she's beautiful! ,1
"I love love love Connie! She is such a good teacher, from the moment we started the class I knew I had made the right choice. She helps people overcome stage fright and makes the classroom an overall relaxed, comfortable place to improve your speaking skills.",1
No Comments,1
she was a hard and confusing professor,1
"I had professor Malcom for Differential equations, and he was by far the best math professor I have had. He is very approachable and will help you with homework on the day it is due. His exams can be tough, but if you study and know the material you will be fine. Do the extra credit it ends up helping your final grade by a few percentage points.",1
There are a lot of assignments to do.,1
"DR,H is a God-sent woman, specifically for anthropology. This issue is, do NOT take her if its for gen. ed. She takes a class or so to get into he grading style and vibes. If youre an anth major and dont take all of her classes YOURE MISSING OUT!  Love her!",1
"Dr. McCabe is both feared and respected. He is by far the toughest instructor I have had; but I learn so much from him with each course. I failed my ""Revelation"" course with him but I still found the experience worth while and I hope to retake the course. I took his N.T. Theology course and yes it was challenging but did I learn anything? Oh YEAH!",1
"Nice guy, wants to do examples but gets sidetracked and forgets to finish example. His test are dialed down from material covered.  Overall, class is bs and shouldn't be required to graduate!!",0
"He is really hard to understand. He contradicts himself during lessons and confuses himself a lot, which makes it hard for his students to understand. He is forgetful and spends most of the class mumbling.",0
Econ is hard but flannery makes it a little easier. His powerpoints and slides make no sense but he explains everything enough to where you can get the point. Hes also funny sometimes,1
"Dr. Parker was enormously patient with us when we moved online. He accommodated our various schedules, supported us when writing, and made sure our final submission was a success through feedback.",1
Easy grading criteria. Not many papers to write. Interesting course content. Attendance and participation is important.,1
"I do NOT reccomend this teacher. His Biology 101 class is one day a week, and you have THREE quizzes every class. He is unorganized and someone else comes up with his tests, so he has no clue what will be on them. He gives no study guides or extra credit. My friend missed one day of class and his grade went down TWO letter grades. No leniency!",0
"She believe that her method of teaching is the best she even stated she would make allot of money if she sold her material and ways of teaching, but for me!! Her way of teaching did  not work she gave so many notes!! And it bothered me that she would hand write her test they were all stumbled up no have to bring extra paper to solve the problems",0
McDonald's lab is probably one of the better classes I've taken here. You learn a lot of technical procedures (get ready to do 5 hours of gel electro. every week) but it is useful and you get enough time and leeway to do everything required. McDonald is also a notoriously easy grader and just a really nice guy. PS. don't take if you hate bugs!,1
"Great teacher ! Show up, do your work, and do whats asked of you.",1
"John is the best professor I've had at Knox so far. ""Questions? Comments?"" He's also a kick-ass water polo coach. Take every econ class you can with him, because he gives away points like they're nothing.",1
Terrible choice. All she does is read off the slides and is not willing to help the students when they have questions. She even gets annoyed when you ask questions. She thinks she is funny,0
"Poor teaching skills. He himself has trouble teaching the material. On multiple occasions the students had to correct him on problems. Has very little knowledge of what he is teaching. Most of the course grade is from 3 tests. If you are not very good at math, I STRONGLY suggest that you do not take his class. Save yourself the trouble!",0
"Considering this was a 1 credit class, I expected it to be easy and of little importance. I was wrong. Although this can be a tough, work intensive course under Dr. Laughlin, I personally learned a lot in this class. I learned a lot about myself and now know what major I want to do. I also completely understand the process to transfer! A+ work here",1
Excellent teacher and class. I learned a lot and highly recommend.,1
"Stephanie is a terrific lady and tries her best to make lectures interactive and fun.  We had online open book/note quizzes usually every week, but they were difficult if you didn't read beforehand.  Only two tests, a midterm & final, and she gives you great study guides.  She also uses a lot of the quiz questions on the tests, which makes it nice.",1
"Ive had trouble with math all my life. I'm 50, Mr. Narin is the FIRST teacher I have ever had that made math easy for me to understand. He will work with you, just talk with him. If you dont say anything you can't blame him for not helping you.",1
"BEST GOSH-DARN PHYSICS PROFESSOR ON EARTH!!!! SIMPLY THE BEST!!! BETTER THAN ALL THE REST!! Homework  HAPPINESS, Tests  FUN FUN FUN AND EASY!!! EZ PZ!!! So put on a HAPPY FACE every time you are in the class! Study Study Study A'S!!!!!",1
My growth as a musician in the short time that I've studied with this professor has been incredible. Her ability to convey musical concepts and explain in fine detail exactly what to do to produce the gorgeous sound and result that you're looking for is amazing. I love studying with her!,1
"He is very helpful, and you can ask him anytime. He knows what he is talking about, and his explaination is always neat. Although he is only one physics teacher at GCC, I strongly recommend his class.",1
"I could tell he wanted his students to do well in his class. He was willing to answer questions and give extra help. His notes were pretty scattered and confusing to follow at times. For the most part, I relied on other sources to teach me the course. He goes through the material pretty quickly, and this class required a LOT of outside effort",1
He is the BEST!!! TAKE HIM! SIMPLE! He makes Math easy and fun!!! Def recommend this guy.  Also hes crazy funny!,1
"The professor is very kind and always pauses class to ask for questions. Unless you are interested in the subject, the class is very boring. You spend most of the class/semester looking at weather maps on pressure and temperature. Try and make friends at the beginning of the semester because at the end of the semester you have a giant group project",1
"The material on the exams are not based on understanding, but on stupid memorization.  He also injects his political and religious views into a chemistry class--no small feat.  He is extremely arrogant.",0
"She is a very kind person and makes sure everyone understands was it going on in the class. There is a decent amount of work, but it is by no means difficult. The exams are easy and she gives extra credit.",1
"Very hard class. Always got good grades until I took this class. Jumps right into high intellect teaching. Near to impossible to pass. Study guide had over 130 questions, which were hard to study for being that we get it a week before the test. Very very tough grader and tough class. Would not recommend.",0
"The class was incredibly easy. I took the class online through dual enrollment. My only complaint was that he was slow to grade essays. by the final week, only 1 of 4 essays had been graded for me so i received very little feedback for the final research paper. Other than that, I would recommend for an easy A.",1
"Professor Egan is a great guy who is always interested in feedback. Obviously with COVID things were different, but Egan made sure to communicate with students to ensure that we had the best experience possible. There was a lot of work for a 100 class, though it was very easy. 100% recommend professor Egan!",1
"Judith's style is wee bit tooo intense, but she knows what she is doing.  At times it felt a bit like ""drama therapy"".  She is a brilliant writer!",1
currently taking online class. she is very lecture heavy and hard to understand. Homework is easy but exams are very hard. Class averages are always low. she does offer extra credit a couple times throughout semester to help raise grade. wouldnt recommend.,0
"I was completely lost.  Tests did not accurately reflect the homework.  You had to really understand the concepts (and I did not).  Tests were open notes/book, but it really didn't do much good.  I got a B because I randomly did well on one test, but I didn't learn anything.  My grade was pure luck.  Most of the dept. sucks so I guess he's alright.",0
The professor can be disorganized but she's very understanding. It's not hard to get an A as long as you do the labs and she drops the lowest quiz grade. There's a lot of reading but she summarizes them in lectures and she was lenient with handing in labs late. She's genuinely caring and her dog is really cute.,1
He is a great teacher and class was always fun. I was in his developmental psych class for the first time he taught it and yes he is Hot!,1
"Zaitsev is overall a great professor. He is very approachable and will be willing to work with you if he sees you are struggling. He is very passionate, makes lectures engaging, and his textbook is very helpful and note-taking easier.  My only complaint is that he is condescending and impatient at times. Other than that, he is a great professor.",1
Prof Zeman is great at what she does and loves what she does which makes her a great professor sad she isn't doing A&P 2 :(,1
"She is very sweet and truly cares about every student in the class.  She is very educated and passionate about special education, which makes her a great professor.  Her quizzes are very easy, and as long as you put effort into the assignments, you will get an A.",1
"Dnt take him. He is old and cranky. Quiz Evey day , test are easy 150 multiple choice but still he is  mean. ",0
Gentry is a good teacher..I took her online Flex2 class so of course there was a lot of homework but it was easy to me. This course has lots of material that is common sense. The only bad thing I have to say was she only gave one chance to get extra credit you have to put together a First Aid Kit & needed like 40 items to expensive for a student!,1
"Doctor Green expects a lot from his students, but he gives thorough feedback and will help them become great writers. I highly encourage all English majors to sign up for at least one class with him.",1
She's great. The class is really easy. Midterms and final were taken from in-class pop quizzes. Only best 6 quizzes were kept (out of 9). I learned a lot. Never really used the book. I really liked her lecture style. Most annoying thing was that you had to go to office hours to get quizzes/tests back - office hours were like 3 hours after class.,1
"Professor Allen is the best. You have to go to class he takes attendance everyday, but you have to show up if you want to pass the tests anyways. No homework or quizzes, but there are six tests. He is really funny in class and he takes the time to answer lots of questions and makes sure everyone understands.",1
"Good teacher, but a tough grader. Only 3 tests all semester, so do well on all of them. It's a great class and she's a wonderful lady, but you need to stay on top of your stuff to get an A",1
"Best chemistry professor. She is the department head yet she is very humble. If you know nothing about chemistry, you can listen to her lecture and it will make sense to you. I am glad that I took her. I wish she was teaching more than one chem.102 class so that all the students can get a chance to take her for chem.102 and learn from her.",1
"Do the readings and you'll be fine. My class had two case simulations, and those cases showed up on the midterm/final. Go to class on the day of the simulation and listen carefully. Other than that, attendance isn't mandatory and lectures are podcasted. Easy course overall.",1
Mr. Wickert (now at Clark College) was one of the coolest teachers I have ever had. He's realistic and witty and offers one-on-one help whenever you need. We did have required texts but we rarely used them.,1
"She is a great counselor, and extremely helpful. I suggest her advice over any others.",1
amazing professor. his lectures don't put you to sleep and he makes the class fun.  just show up to class and do your 3-2-1s. you have to do an incredibly easy midterm and a short presentation at the end of the semester. easy A. also don't bother getting a textbook.  ,1
"Mrs. Hanratty is very dedicated to British Literature and encouraged my learning of the topic.  Tests were difficult and she's a tough grader, but overall loved her class. ",1
"Sara is the best teacher I've ever had at BGSU. I've had her for multiple THFM classes, and I learned so much in each. People think she's ""tough"" but she just has high expectations for her students and doesn't expect less than their best efforts. If I hadn't just graduated, I wouldndefinitely take more classes with her in the future. ",1
The class was full of long assignments and graded activities with unfair distribution of credits. You will have more than 10 assignments  activities together each takes more than 1 week to finish 1 quiz and 2 exams. He didn''t teach. He just made you work. Don''t know how something works Find out on your own. His feedback was ambiguous. ,0
"Erika Lytle is the best teacher at ABtech hands down. She is kind, intelligent, and funny. She cultivates an environment for people with differing opinions to learn about each other as people. Not only is she a brilliant teacher, she is a genuinely good person. Public speaking can be daunting, but if you have a chance to take it with Lytle, do it.",1
"Teacher is very nice,but is very confusing, goes beyond what is required which makes it confusing, grades random problems and i have never done so poorly in a class until this class. Went to the tutor center many times to get help. I would not reccomend this class unless you are very good at math and need little help or you want to retake it.",0
"At the beginning of the semester there was some communication issues with due dates of homework, but from there on out, this class was wonderful. Mrs. Myers' lectures were always clear and understandable. She was fantastic at test prep, and as long as you put in some effort, you'll get a reasonable grade.",1
"He is the best teacher for students who want to study. He is smart and funny. He wants to help students, easy to talk or ask questions. I learn a lot from his class. It's not an easy class, but you will learn a lot. His passionate on teaching inspires me sometimes.",1
Great at making lectures interesting. Genuinely cares about her students. Put forth a little effort and you will succeed. Great for both science and arts majors.,1
"The class content is not difficult.  The professor makes it difficult by setting her own criteria for grading that is not part of the assignment.  Elizabeth does not follow the rubric, does not answer questions, and makes up erroneous grading criteria.  She doesn't even understand the course she is teaching. Worst excuse for an instructor.",0
"She has been by far my favorite professor since I've been in college. She made learning enjoyable and fun. Her exams were straight forward and came right from the notes. You have to attend class to be able to fill in the notes, however, she does not take attendance. Overall she's a wonderful professor!!",1
"2nd time taking her and will take again if I can! She is on top of keeping the class informed of everything via email. Great, detailed feedback on grades. I took her online this time and it was a fair amount of work that helps keep your grade up. Weekly discussion posts and quizzes teach you the matieral well. Easy class to pass and very fair&nice",1
"I made an account just to say TAKE THIS CLASS! Do not think twice. The TA's grade a little heavy but if you understand the material and follow the grading rubric you will be fine! Jason is by far the best professor I have had at UT. He knows his stuff and he wants you to succeed. HW every week, Excel labs, and a project at the end of the semester",1
"Although his lectures may be kind of boring at times, he is extremely knowledgeable in the field of cognitive neuroscience and breaks up lecture with funny personal stories and interesting video clips. His lectures are far more engaging than most other professors",1
"He's amazing. Online class, however he's very willing to help via in person or over the phone  if you make an appointment. Class consists of weekly papers that involve reading primary texts, summarizing them and then analysing them. There are class discussions where you post on d2l and respond to students on a weekly basis also. Good professor!",1
Thad loves what he does and it shoes in the way he teaches. He is very helpful and always willing to stick around after class to help. I wish Butte had more instructors like him,1
Only a few teachers make me really understand Math. And he was one of them! He takes the time to really teach and if we are confused he is patient with us students and explains the material. Average homework; not too much but not easy either. Such a great teacher! Just show up and study your notes for test!,1
"um ummmm ummm um um um.... this is all I would hear in lectures. He can sound intelligent but at the same time also sounds like he is just reading the pp. again he says um so much the class started to keep count, up into the 700s....",0
I absolutely loved this class. He made everything interesting and all of the hard concepts make sense. All of the tests are essay tests and I felt like he graded pretty accurately. I looked forward to coming to this class every day.,1
"I recommend this class to any chemistry major. He does teach fairly quickly, but he covers the topics completely. I recommend printing out his PowerPoints beforehand and taking notes on that. (lifesaver) Read the text and practice. His tests are difficult, but if you do the study modules (extra credit) and homework, you won't have any issues.",1
Took 3 week summer course. Not much work involved.  Seemed like she kinda just made up an assignment on the spot and had us turn them in the next day Weren't really hard assigments though. 2 of the 12 days we were in the gym and 2 days for midterm and final. In total it was like 8 days of actual class. Pretty easy A for a summer course.,1
"She's the best professor at Allegheny.  You most likely won't get an A from her, but you will learn and grow as a student more than any letter grade could ever reflect.  Students complaining about her grading simply are not willing to listen to her or put in enough effort. Take one of her classes, even if it is only WOMST 100; you won't regret it.",1
"Dr. Cheers is one of the most difficult prof. i've had to deal with. He's rude and there are days where you want to punch him in the face. But know this, he was the only prof. that made me reevaluate my decision to be a journalist. He made me see you have to find your motivation yourself. I'd recommend this class for those who need a reality check.",0
"Dr. Green is a great professor who understands that COVID-19 means classes won't be conventional. His zooms are a bit long (2.5 hrs 1x/week) but he covers all the bases and makes sure we feel prepared. If you can't read 4-8 different medium-long texts/week, group work, multiple media essays, or in-depth discussions this class isn't for you.",1
"This course gave me a better understanding of how government operates. I looked forward to coming to class each week because Professor Reece made a class that most may find boring, very entertaining and interesting.",1
"horrible! horrible! horrible! He seems like a cool teacher at first but very confusing on his grading and instructions. 3 test thats tough. Tough grader, long lectures, has favorites but makes you feel uncomfortable about learning.",0
no comment,1
"Professor Wood is a very nice teacher. Sometimes her explanations are a bit long and confusing. The course wasn't really all that easy after the 6th chapter, but she is willing to help, and gives students many chances to catch up.",1
"Easy class, just do the discussion boards and papers and you will do fine. The papers are easy but sometimes left open-ended. This results in a bit of confusion, but just email him and he will clear anything up.",1
"He's the best teacher I ve ever met. It explains everything with details and example. Besides, he tells you his experience and inspires everyone to grow up. I never wrote a review, but he deserves it.",1
"She is one of the best teachers. I wish more teachers were like her. She's nice, caring, very respectful and shows that she cares about everyone in the class. She explains the material perfectly and she is very understanding and reasonable. I would have her as a teacher again. She's the best and I enjoyed the class. Thanks Ms. Cambic. BEST TEACHER",1
"The material he teaches in class is almost no help when it comes to homework. Then when it comes to tests, reviewing homework, the study guide (which is a list of topics), and writing a sheet of notes seem almost useless, because the problems are not what you prepared for. The good thing is that tests are heavily curved as well as the final grade.",0
"Before taking this class I was worried because she did not have amazing reviews. This was one of the easiest classes I have ever taken. She gives an insane amount of extra credit, lets you use a notesheet front and back PER CHAPTER on tests (4 chapter tests), and has high energy during lectures. I literally had a 104% in the class. Highly recommend",1
She took the moment to bond with us and was always so nice. I was going through it this semester and she helped me out so much. I couldnt have asked for a better prof. It was an easy A I just didnt turn in stuff. She also let me complain about my political views for 10 pages and let us pick most prompts. Shes wonderful,1
"DO NOT TAKE WITH BROWN. The worst professor I have ever had. Lectures are all over the place and have nothing to do with the tests. A monkey could probably teach better than him. He doesnt give two craps about you or your grade, and although he may be smart, I dont know how he still has his job. Good luck getting a passing grade.",0
"I am so confused in his class, the whole class is. His lectures barely scratch the surface and his tests are the hardest thing that you will ever take. I do not recommend.",0
"Lectures are very quick, sometimes only 10 minutes. They can be hard to understand, though. Class is essentially based off speeches and the 5 homework assignments. Reading is not essential although she assigns it. No final or tests.",1
Very difficult to understand him. Long winded explanations that dont clearly answer questions. Never fully completes examples put on the board. Tests are extremely difficult.,0
"I thought this dance class was going to be a lot of fun, but instead, it's a lot more work than I thought it would be and there are not many As.  If you're looking for a fun, relaxing dance class (as a beginner, I was), this is not the professor for you.",1
"He is a complete waste of space what you learn in class does not pertain to the tests, which are based completely off the book. He spends most of his time rambling about nothing and I would have been better off taking a REAL programming class.",0
"As a new professor, she is terrific!  I hope she stays at AC.",1
"She had no idea what she was talking about. Told us to google stuff because she didn't know the answers. Reads straight from PP and you can barely understand what she is saying, but she puts all PPs on blackboard. It is pointless to go to class. Only gives grades for tests and doesn't grade them correctly. You can pass but you'll be miserable.",0
"Berkson was my favorite professor my freshman year. He is clearly passionate about what he teaches and wants you to be just as knowledgable on countless topics just like he is. Intimidating at first, but pays off in the long run.",1
"Reads off powerpoint, doesn't explain anything. When she tries explaining she messes up and only confuses you more. Students corrected her on every quiz and exam because there was something wrong. Heavy accent which makes her more difficult. No curving, class grades are set lower although. Easiest Ochem professor at CSU although,just teach yourself",0
"Professor Lipson is obviously a very knowledgeable person, but his soothing voice and his tangential lecture style makes it hard for me to stay engaged in the class. Ive learnt a lot from this professor from the first half of the semester, but as the semester progressed I felt he was pushing many claims without a strong base of evidence.",0
"Alisha is an amazing professor! She makes the class extremely interesting. She does a Kahoot at the beginning of every lecture, and she helps the class with the first few grader projects. She offers a ton of extra credit. I actually got 296 extra credit points (she halves the amount at the end). All of the homework is online and is super easy to do",1
"Read the text on your own easier to understand. Nice person, boring teacher. Could have been a great subject if it was more interesting and engaging. Assignments not clearly explained, expectations and course content could be explained better. Lost interest in subject.",0
The course was very organized. I really enjoyed this class and reading the chapters! The only thing that would give me anxiety was the quizzes because you have a small limited time to complete them. But overall great class!,1
"I took prof horn online and I must say this online class was VERY VERY easy. If you don't really care for English but you alright at writing papers  and NEEDDDD an ""A'.. I highly recommend taking her. All discussion post and papers are fairly short and easy. Nothing too complicated. Just gone  head and take her and grab that easy ""A' that you need!",1
"final for the class was by far the hardest of all the exams.All the tests are fair if you follow the study guide, but didn't think so for the final. Probably brought me down to a C unless he curves so i wanted to write this b4 finding out my grade.Great class/Professor..really conveys material well and is helpful! Just study EVERYTHING for final :/",1
He is awesome!!!,1
"There were discussion boards and chap. tests which were stupid! He'd take one tiny thing from the book and make it a test Q., instead of asking a question about a concept. I didn't like how he structured the tests, but if you have the book w/you, there's no need to read the chap. beforehand 'cuz you can just take the test w/out reading the chap.",0
He's really funny and interesting. He truly knows what he is talking about and he is organized in his lectures and topics. I didn't even sign up for this class willingly but I'm glad I took it because I learned a lot and he is a great professor.,1
He thinks of himself as the go to source for work advice when in reality he has no work experience or knowledge. He brings politics into class. He also takes off points when grading papers with no explanations.,0
Mr. Pierce is a very good professor. Test are difficult if you don't study or take notes. Does give a lot of extra credit like off campus clinics and making 100 note cards for each test. Tells a lot of stories but they most likely have a connection to the lectures that day.,1
"I was derading Chemistry - Dr. Nelson made it okay. It was still difficult for me, but he was available to answer questions, provided interesting labs and analogies. He made it much less painful than it could have been.",1
"Do not take him. Do EVERYTHING you can to avoid his World Civ gen ed class. His expectations are absolutely ridiculous, and his tests are impossible. I've been in a number of times to his office hours and he is NOT helpful. If its between not having enough credits, and taking his class, take the less credits. Avoid him for a gen ed class.",0
"I've taken German Cinema and German 1 with her.  Great prof, made ALG the only class I was constantly eager to go to.  Sie ist wunderbar.",1
Seriously one of the best math teachers.. He goes above and beyond and makes everything simple and easy to understand.,1
"Nice guy who tries his best, can explain some things well, but other topics you are totally lost. Needs to do examples.",1
"Very passionate, extremely inciteful and highly knowledeable professor!! He expects you to show up and pay attention, you're in college not high school and he has a lot to teach. Great teacher! Would take him again!! SHow up and participate and you'll get a good grade.",1
"Mr. Allen was a GREAT teacher. If you put in the work and respect him, you will do amazing in this class. I would for sure take him again. The people that complain are the ones who dont go to class or dont do the homework after the lessons which for sure help you later on do well on his exams.",1
"Extremely pleasant and helpful, always willing to listen. Tests are not overly difficult but a good deal of studying is required.",1
"He was probably the nicest professor I've ever had! Was extremely caring and understanding of any outside problems we were having. Taught the class extremely well and overall just amazing. If you can, I highly recommend signing up for his class!",1
"I like him as a person, I really do. His other classes are fine (despite the fact that he always chooses incredibly hard to read textbooks). This class is a slog and honestly makes me question why I'm in the major. He gives almost no guidelines on the paper that is due and every day you have a quiz in class, but you never go into detail.",1
a very helpful and interesting professor. he may be scary at first but then the atmosphere was relaxing and I actually learned a lot. He was very encouraging during the preparation for exam. one of the best professors i had in this program,1
"Worst class ever, respect yourself and choose a different professor",0
Great teacher who is there to help you find your way. 102 can be a tough course - don't expect to get an easy A. But Melissa makes it very straightforward to succeed. If you're in the Honors section be prepared for an extra project.,1
"Good teacher, she is knowledgeable, professional, approachable  and kind in her words to students. Take her class you will be well prepared for your life's journey. One of the best at Humber College.",1
She's an AMAZING teacher!!,1
"She is definitely a tough grader. However, she gives great feedback and will sit with students for as long as she needs to in order to help them. She really appreciates different perspectives on literature even if they are not what the textbook suggest. She is spunky and fun, and class is not mandatory, but certainly recommended.",1
"The class is an intellectual joke. Take home exams and everybody cheats. If you want to ""get over"" this is the class for you. but it really is an insult to college.",0
"Best teacher I've ever had! The only class of the semester where I actually learned anything and didn't feel like I wasted my money. Plus he's cute and really funny. He made a very boring subject relevant, interesting, and fun! <3",1
Prof Infante is both an adorable person and a fabulous professor.  He listens to his students and makes time to meet at least once during the semester with each student in the class. He make required material interesting and understandable. I furthered my Spanish significantly in the 2 semesters in his classes. SPAN 307 & 334.,1
"The class itself is super easy, but I wasn't the most fond of Gray as a professor. I liked her at first, but from some of the remarks she's made I realized she's kind of an insensitive person. Aside from that, get ready for boring group projects, being treated like a 12 y/o and lectures that seriously drag. Should've taken the 6 week online course",0
"Ms. Polster is very friendly and helpful, however her guidelines for assignments weren't very clear. I recommend her, though.",1
"*This course was taken during the Spring 2020 Covid-19 pandemic* Prof. Davidovitch would be much better suited to teach graduate level courses than a second-year physics course. His lectures were confusing and too fast-paced, assuming students already knew more than they did. A great person, but made the course material too difficult.",0
Dr.Z has a thick accent but you will adjust to it quickly. She makes the lectures bearable with jokes and commentary. She writes down all the notes on the slides so it's easy to understand and take notes and she is willing to help any student that comes to her. She's very knowledgeable about the subject and her passion for anatomy comes through.,1
She's amazing. Take her class.,1
Always willing to help students out. Good teacher. Funny guy. Goes a little slow but really does make sure everyone is understanding as he teaches. Gets the class involved and makes things fun.,1
Dr. Berkson is the best! I learned so much taking many of his classes while a Religion major at Hamline. Take at least one of his classes before you graduate or you are really missing out!,1
"Tests are difficult, make sure you review the slideshows and notes. Ask her for help in office hours, and communicate your situation to her actively. She will help you out if you put in the time and effort. She really enjoys learning about various sciences, it's definitely something she's personally invested in. She cares about her students.",1
Do not take his online class. Gives homework problems and expects you to learn it yourself. Only grades are tests and quizzes. He doesn't give any guide how to learn the material. Just 2 minute videos to teach you that barely explain the problems.,0
"Nice guy, effective at explaining everything and not a redic. grader like some TAs. You will actually learn something in this class and an A is do-able if u put in a little effort and pay attention to his comments on your past lab reports to improve on later ones. 3 reports overall- pretty straight forward and not crazy. Recommended.",1
"Hardest, worst professor. Do not take her class if you can avoid it ",0
She's really nice and always seems upbeat.  She's just hard to pay attention to.,1
Awesome teacher,1
Excellent director and teacher.,1
"You really have to work for your grade. If you don't have a passion for this subject then don't take this class! During the 2nd practice test review he went on for about 30min on surplus a topic that wasn't heavily covered in his test. Practice test is similar to his tests. He doesn't go over enough word problem examples, so study, read, n practice",1
"i just ended my semester in her class. Let me begin by telling you, biggest mistake i made in college so far. I knew i should have dropped with a W when i had the chance to. But i believed she would see my effort and perseverance but no, it didn't matter. First day is 40 people, ends with about 12 people. Final group project, everyone got a D or F!",0
"Mark Hooper is one of the Best Lecturers I've ever studied under. He is really on top of his stuff and is widely read. Mention a field and Dr H has an answer. A very free-spirited man with a very tough approach to grading. Your first lectures with him could be frightening but once you get to know he expects  what he calls LEVEL V, you are safe.",1
This professor will make you cry tears of boredom. This is the least engaging class ever . Dean is extremely unorganized - he puts test material on canvas the night before exams and changes due dates last minute. He gives little to no instructions for HW. He cant figure out how to use zoom efficiently to save his life. Avoid at all costs!,0
"Needs to get a grip, he can deride his students when they don't understand a subject immediately. Goes off on irrelevant tangents, wasting our time. Needs to use better short forms for words he writes on the board.",0
Lecture was long and tedious..........,0
"Dr Harvey truly is a master of chemistry. Her class will break you down because there is so much hw and the exams really are difficult, but I assure you, pay attention in EVERY lecture, do the assignments, give it your absolute best, and you will learn so much. My only qualm is that she can be a bit feisty if you ask too many questions",1
"Scanlon isn't really that bad. He gets excited about what he teaches and it may sometimes come across as yelling. He may seem unapproachable and grouchy, but he's really not. He's willing to help anyone and everyone who has a question.",1
"Love his baritone voice, explains algorithms very well.",1
"Great teacher! Very intelligent. The course structure was set up differently than I've every experienced: no tests and minimal papers. Class mostly consisted of group work and debates. Awesome, engaging class. I learned a ton and had fun! Highly recommended.",1
"PROFESSOR PERUYERA IS GREAT, HE WILL READ OF THE POWER POINTS BUT HE REALLY KNOWS THE MATERIAL, YOU NEED TO STUDY FROM THE BOOK POWER POINTS ALONE ARE NOT GOING TO HELP YOU. TAKE HIM, HE IS A GREAT PERSON. HE LETS  YOU TAKES YOUR NOTES AND POWER POINT TO TAKE THE TEST.",1
"I have nothing but good things to say about David. He goes above and beyond just teaching. He legitimately wants to influence you for the better and make a difference in your life. The best teacher I've had at Iowa and maybe anywhere, I'll be hard pressed to find one that's better.",1
Amazing professor! She gives really good feedback and makes sure she takes her time to help her students.,1
"He is a terrible prof.  He may know the subject well but portraying it to students with very little mathematical background in the manor he did was horrible.  He has no control over the class, his accent is very thick, his exams are very hard which are multiple choice with no feedback.  The hw is online which makes it difficult to learn.",0
Ericka is AWESOME!! She makes lecture fun. She's not intimidating or shy at all and cracks jokes throughout the whole 3 hours. Great teacher!,1
"if im being honest, i went to only one class in person and skipped the rest. prof richmond wants her students to succeed, so she is straightforward with everything. the quizzes are very easy if you read some, and the tests arent bad either. all online. very easy A!",1
"This is one of the best teachers I have ever had at pikes peak. I would take his class again in a heart beat. he likes to make sure you are keeping up with the reading by giving quizzes, but he only keeps the top 3. ",1
"Prof. Bush is a nice man with incredible knowledge of all aspects of tort law. However, I felt like his opinion about the law interfered with the class on some occasions; he has his own way of teaching, the text book is a minor tool at best, heavy usage of handouts.",1
Looney is a beast.  Best prof on campus and this class is extremely interesting.  It is the easiest astronomy and physical science class you will find.,1
Best professor ever. I would want her to be my professor for every class if that was possible! Definitely take her class!,1
"He was a great prof. He opened my eyes and mind to the different aspects of Duende and changed my views on life. I'd never heard of it before. I thought he was a good marker, and i'm suprised that other people don't. The class was interesting and I looked forward to going to it. I wish he taught more courses!",1
"Words cannot describe how terrible this class was, take Mrs. Pickham if you want to have a chance at passing speech.  And if you do for some reason take this class, be ready to hate your life, dont come in 1 minute late, dont fidget while giving your speech and make sure to let her know i hate her guts, thanks.",0
stein is the best and really cares about you excelling in her class. i took this my first semester at elon and she really helped us strengthen our writing skills and look at different forms to show information. Shes great if you're looking to better your writing.,1
Hart was the worst prof I've ever had.  The only thing I learned in this class was that she thinks protists are cute and that she loved fungi.  No use attending class because you learn nothing.  Teach yourself the material using the textbook because that is your only hope.,0
LONG LIVE MARTHA RANCOURT!!!!!,0
"Professor Zaitsev is the best! I really enjoyed lectures and lab with him on Sunday mornings, the lessons were never dreary and he was very interesting and engaging. He truly knows his stuff. He gives 4 exams(including the final) and drops the lowest grade.  And his book on Amazon makes it extremely easy to follow his lectures.",1
"Shes SO NICE! Easy A writing class; 2 simple presentations w/ 1 page reflections; 3 four page papers, 1 10 page final paper. reading is required for all of them. Very lenient grader as long as your essays have a good sense of organization & content. Left class early often, Doesnt lecture much. u just need to read & write what she asks of u;",1
"Easy class, Pierce knows his stuff and loves to teach others about it. Every review you should have answers word from lectures, there is no hidden or hard questions about his test. Pay attention, and you'll easily pass. He is hilarious would highly recommend for a GPA booster!",1
He is very fair and will help you if you fall behind. He cares about students who care about their work. He is very knowledgeable with software as he worked with a firm that helped create Adbe Photoshop when it came out in the 1990's. Its important to explain your Graphic design work in his classes.,1
"I honestly hope you don't get this professor. She's very unclear with her instructions and will assume you're not ready for this class if you're not a strong writer. She grades very harshly, and won't grade your work if she thinks it looks incomplete. If you get her spend time at the writing center and do what ever you can to be on her good side:)",0
"By far one of the best professors I've ever had! Took her for an intersession summer class that was 5-hrs long, but she made it go by so fast! She made class fun and very interesting. I would definitely take her again, no doubt! Although, she is retired, she still comes back to teach because she loves it! Need more professors just like her!!",1
"Easy A, however the workload is very intense. Either an individual or group assignment due every week. He doesn't release grades often, but gives everyone full credit  don't fret. You will have to create a lot of diagrams & charts for unnecessary things. He usually gives poor feedback and complains even when you follow his instructions. Easy A tho",1
This teacher is a little strange but very nice. Explains things very well. I am not good with math and managed to pull an A in this class. If you need a math requirement take it with him,1
This guy decided to change up his grading policy mid semester thinking it would help students. This was the first time I have ever gotten curved down in a class. He is a new prof and thought a 100 question final was fine and said 300 questions was bad. He is new and doesn't teach. I highly recommend you don't take him,0
"he's fair, but he also taught with two other professors. he took the most time to help my labgroup though. very helpful and insightful!",1
"She is very good at teaching, I have learned more about writing in her ENG100 class than I did during the entirety of high school. And she knows how to use zoom and canvas. A big portion of the grade is writing essays. Her class is challenging but not unreasonably so. Scheduling office hours with her is very easy and she is very helpful.",1
"Professor Cooper is absolutely amazing and I'm really happy I took this class with her! I'm not an art major so none of my projects were good, but Im still doing well in the class! One thing I don't like very much is that she picks favorites and doesn't pay much attention to anyone else. As someone who struggles she just walked by me a lot.",1
The best Psych teacher on campus hands down. I learned so much with out even knowing it!,1
"only have to go to class like 5 times. everything online pretty much, easy class, great lady, lots of guest speakers",1
At first I was super annoyed with her lectures it was super difficult to sit through 3 hours of lecture then be expected to practice what you were just shown-wore me out! But I stuck in there and if you put in the work and support what you don't understand with tutorials then you can get through it! In the end I learned a lot!,1
"He tends to get on his soap box a lot in class. He rambles a lot so don't try to answer his questions. He tends to talk down a bit, I think this is due to having young children so he talks to everyone like that. He exams are very hard (multiple choice is near impossible to get right).",1
I don't understand VHDL but managed to finish all homework and project except the last part(project was divided into smaller projects). You can email or ask after class when you are stuck. I think he curved our final exam too.,1
Professor Henao was an amazing professor. My first semester of Spanish my teacher never gave us exams or homework really but then took this for SPN1120 and it was very different. She gives exams but they are easy if you do the study guide. Also there's a lot of online homework but you can finish in 5 minutes. She's very sweet and cares about grade,1
She was a great fair professor I got received an A for the class. I would definitely take her class again. If you study and read the chapters you should do well.,1
"Prof. Sun is not a great teacher but he leans towards the better side of profs  when compared to others in the department.  He gives many pop quizzes in the class that can come at any time, but even if you do bad on the quizzes you can still ace the class by doing well on the final.  Do the hw cause that's the best way to learn the material.",1
"Great teacher. Belongs at a University. She is cooky and aging, but you can tell she is still sharp and knows what she is talking about. I would suggest going to all her classes and taking good notes. Even though she is super nice, her tests are tough. Study, do homework and complete all extra credit she offers.",1
Hard class but not necessarily a bad teacher.. you just need to do your part. The tests are very hard but his curve is awesome. He also gives a quiz almost every class worth 10 points to keep you on your feet. I would say it's not the end of the world if you sign up for him but he's probably the hardest teacher for 120/121.,0
"Terrible teacher, mean, angry, does not care about his students; I don't know why he ever became a teacher. Have to study a lot and use the textbook.  DONT take him you will regret it",0
"Dr. Hauck is amazing!!! If you struggle with upper-level science classes like me, definitely take his class. It's difficult but very clear and he really cares about his students. He is great about working one on one with you and is super easy to talk to in office hours.",1
"Professor Kaszubowski truly loves the subject she teachers. Her class is ALL lecture, and the assigned readings are just given to further enhance your knowledge on the subject. There are two big exams, a couple in class discussions, a map quiz, and a paper. Overall, if you study and do well, this class is not a hard A. You'll learn a lot as well!",1
he's good and full of character.,1
"Marna is a recent grad student. She says the same words always: ""Thinking of this idea of."" you'll get tired of it quick. And if you ask her a question she'll say ""ok so what we're gonna do"" and literally give you no answer. However, she is a very nice grader and a nice person. Sometimes passive aggressive but overall not bad. would recommend.",0
"Remember English 102 is accelerating class. You have to run for assignments, essays and quiz. I took this class and I always work very hard for this class. Ms. Magallon is very helpful teacher to those who work hard and regular in class. I learn a lot from this class. She is amazing. If you work hard then u will definitely pass this class as I did.",1
"Professor Wisner knows the material and presents it well.  Very tough grader, but if you work hard you can get an A.",1
"Prof. Bartl doesn't waste his student's time or money. I'm usually bored with my other online courses, but the readings in this class were interesting.",1
"Never replies to emails, never clear about assignments, never clear with tests, terrible lecturer",0
"If you're not a music person, it can be kind of hard - believe me, I know. But she's really helpful, and as long as you take notes, you should do fine. She's really nice, too.",1
"Class started out with 35 students, 5 remained and only 3 of them passed. I recommend taking Newman, he is more thorough with his teaching. It is a hard class, I get that, it's college, but Kula's teaching habits weren't for me. I dropped his class and took with a different professor and it was 10x's easier to comprehend.",0
A solid option for Bio lab. Explains everything clearly before starting lab and will guide you if you need help,1
"Tough subject with good professor. Moves fast but provides slides,Practice exams VERY similar to exams and lets you make one index card. This class is nothing but a bunch a formulas and knowing how to use them n some excel, He knows his stuff REALLY well, You are getting real knowledge not textbook stuff. Take him but get ready to study n work hard",1
"Il fonctionne avec le manuel, cad aucun notes de cours aucun power point (a part quelques powerpoint du manuel quil va envoyer par email). La personne est respectable en tant que tel mais sa maniere d'enseigner est mediocre. A eviter, il y a de meilleurs profs pour ce cours a uqam.",0
"The course is not an easy bird course to take because the content is quite hard to understand if you have no previous science background such as physics and biology. He will post readings before lectures and slides after lectures, as well as review guidelines before exams. He is a nice person and he is alwasy willing to answer questions.",1
"Dr. Hansen does an assignment called ""Brown Bag"" where he meets up and has lunch with a group of students from his classes. This is so he can get to know each of his students. He really cares about his student's individual situations. If you need more time on an assignment or test and have a valid reason he will work with you. He is very kind.",1
"I had Professor Vallieri and he is fantastic and a great overall person. He can be blunt, but he does treat you as an adult and even equal if you treat him with respect. He is fully willing to help you on essays if you put forth the initiative. I definitely recommend to take him for both Comp 1 and 2.",1
"He likes to have a lot of classroom participation and is very energetic, but does it in a wrong way. Tries to take feedback from students but lots of times gets lost in what the feedback actually is. Picks on people a lot, and attendance is taken every class, so if you sometimes skip, might not be the best choice.",0
Lots of reading in the class. There was one major paper which required a lot of background research. He enjoys engaging with the students during discussions and pushing us to think more critically. He grades fairly but tough so make sure you go over your papers multiple times.,1
"Terrible class. Prof is passionate about his own research, but is otherwise very monotonous and lectures regurgitate the textbook exactly - didn't even study lectures for exams, and skipped a bunch. Put in groups of 5-6 for projects that could have been done with 2-3 people tops. Most people just end up sitting around. Vague with instructions.",0
She good. If you work hard you will get an A paper but if you do average expect a B or C.,1
"If you can avoid her, please do. The exams are hard...you read 11 plays and are expected to know who said what lines...the papers are long (10 pages) and she is extremely critical. She has a touch of arrogance and will willingly fail her ENTIRE CLASS.",0
"Do not take his class. For the field class prepare for the class to end sometimes more than an hour past what is schedule. Very strict grader, heavy on the report papers every week. Boden teaches intro level classes but teaches them in a more complex way than most people understand. In other words, if you dont know a lot about geology good luck",0
He made my CSUN experience so much better. He really cares about having his students learn things that we can use for our own career later. He's so understandable. I looked forward to going to class. If i was sick i wanted to be there. He's so inspirational and his grading is amazing.,1
"So far throughout my academic career this is by far the worst professor I've EVER had. DO NOT TAKE HIM! He targets students who slightly question him in class. When you ask about your grade in the class he won't tell you how you're doing, he doesn't lecture clearly in class, he's petty. This isn't a challenge, its impossible. Don't waste your time.",0
She does a good job of getting students involved. Definitely a passionate professor. Would recommend,1
"He's a very knowledgeable teacher and fair grader. Tests and quizzes not too bad. He makes you go home and watch videos to teach yourself and take notes how you need and reviews it in class. MyMathLab isn't fun, but if you go to his office hours or ask for help in class he'll answer every question you have in a detailed way. He's great.",1
"Do not take this class until you have taken physics! That's all it is! The people who were lost were the ones who never took it. 3 exams with an optional final. Exams were HEAVILY curved. She wasn't too bad, but didn't seem sure of herself. Study old exams, read, and visit office hours and you'll be OK.",0
"This class is thought by 3 different professors. Her section is by far the most difficult. She seems to be really passionate about hip hop, black women, and feminism.   The other 2 professors were easy to understand, to the point, and actually made sense when relating back to the main subject of the class.",0
"No lecture slides, no in-class questions, he is the epitome of an old-fashioned Proff. Learned a lot, very refreshing. Go to class and take good notes, he doesn't spoon-feed you. Haters are just too lazy to put in the work that he demands. By far my fav Proff!",1
Amazing!,1
Really relatable and responds to emails very quickly.,1
"Easy to understand with an accent. kinda boring, will make you want to skip every once in a while.",1
"This is the worst teacher ever.  He not only puts the program to shame, he also puts the fire service to shame. Makes many mistakes. Has multiple incorrect answers on tests. Doesn't give feedback and so on. If you are looking to become a firefighter, please do not take him.",0
Amazing teacher. I was so worried cuz I've heard bad things but he really was excellent!,1
"at first the class was okay and she was nice. the first part of the quarter consisted of mainly reading the 2nd half of the quarter, the course consisted of more writing and less reading. i got a B+ in the class but i did put in a lot of time and effort in the class. and she was very picky in writing styles she is enthusiastic but the class was ok",1
"I have taken McNabb for both math97 as well as stats. He is a wonderful teacher and relates what you are learning to real life situations or obscure situations that really allow you to understand the material. He really sets you up for success, you just have be willing to show up to class and put in the work.",1
"She's a great professor and if you're in college to learn, you'll find yourself loving the class. The course materials are not hard, yet you have to pay attention in class and do homework! She has her own textbook and it's a great resource not only for the class but later if you have to take the MCAT or PCAT also. Overall, she's really awesome!",1
He's not affraid to call you out in a discussion board in front of everyone if you make a mistake. He is a TOUGH grader (I've never gotten a 100 on a discussion board despite working hard) despite all this I still love his online class a lot. He emails back quickly with a problem and he grades FAST. I love that.,1
Hard grader,0
AZ was my professor at Hofstra University. I cannot say enough good things about her was by my side all semester and available to meet for one on one help and tutoring. AZ is without a doubt the best teacher I've ever had and she is funny that makes class fun.,1
"He definitely wants to see his students succeed in the class.  The material is pretty tedious and is loaded with different rules and code sections, but he lets you know which ones to focus on.  It seems he worked hard to become a better instructor, and I believe he did a great job.",1
"A Wonderful teacher! I could not have asked for a more patient and enthusiastic professor. I recommend that anyone interested in a foreign language, take her course!",1
"This teacher was awesome. He was always there to help when I needed it, also he know his stuff pretty well.",1
This rating has been removed as per our site guidelines.,0
"Lots of reading but most of it is on Sparknotes.  Lecture/discussion based classes. Some topics can be interesting, but depends on the level of student participation.  Pretty much a high school level course. Not a lot of variation in class setup- group work, essays, and lectures.  Interesting if you like English.",1
He takes a a long time to understand the abilities of the students he teaches. Does not understand the preparation given by the prerequisite courses and assumes a lot of material not covered by other courses. His homework is achievable but difficult. His exams are tough. Not much feedback initially but was decent by the end of the course.,0
"Took Terrorism from this professor. Clearly once a great class, but after decades has devolved into a long lecture on books that we do not read and general opinion. Not your typical history class -- No historical background in the traditional sense. The subject matter is fascinating but the class was disappointing. Almost dropped it twice.",0
"He did have some pretty math jokes, and he liked to tell the history of what we learned about.  He didn't really explain anything else.  He would just quickly go through everything without stopping to explain his steps.  Also, his examples did not really help for the homework, and the quizzes were different than both homework and the lecture.",0
She is really nice and helpful.  There is no reason anyone would have a hard time in this class.  Must take.,1
"I had him for only lab. He seemed to be a little more chill about labs than lecture (from what ive heard). The only thing is that he NEVER responds to his emails--ive prob sent him 5 email since march and still havent heard anything back... so we'll see what i got in his class. Do the work, be prepared, and be smart and he'll like you",1
"None of your exams and tests actually have reviews that correlate to the test. There is too many places where your work is such as owl, McGraw hill, and then on blackboard you have your lockdown browser tests and exams so everything is disorganized and very confusing. Overall, this was a super hard course so I withdrew, would not recommend.",0
"The class was mainly lecture and discussion based. very little assignments given in class. All exams were papers that were about 1-2 pages. For final, there was only a project which you need to present in class. He very critical with grading his paper. He is a good professor and passionate about what he teaches. The textbook is needed!",1
"Fantasic prof, available any time for extra help or clarification. VERY knowledgeable.",1
"Prof. Bronie has been teaching math at SMC for decades. She's sweet, organized and, ivy-league-trained. More importantly, she is very caring with her students. She makes herself accessible outside of class to help one-on-one. Her tests are fair. Do the work, attend class, study as expected with any math class, and you will do well in her class.",1
"Professor Young is an incredible instructor! His lectures will teach you so much about the music business, but most importantly, he makes you excited to learn!  If you make the most of his classes, and really take advantage of all PY has to share, you will leave his class feeling inspired every day and with a new perspective on the music industry. ",1
"Mrs. Nelson is the best teacher I have ever had. She is amazing! Beautiful person with a beautiful heart. She is so passionate about the subject, which makes classes way more entertaining. As long as you take notes and study, the tests are super easy! The Honors section is a breeze IF you put work into it. If you don't, then you'll be in trouble.",1
"Super easy class, didn't need to buy the text book. No homework, just study for the tests. His powerpoints are on webcampus and he keeps your grade updated.",1
"Online class instructions were a bit confusing, essays graded very differently and harshly, definetely turn in every assignment and on time, but not sure your best effort always gets the best grade in this class.",0
This is absolutely the greatest teacher in the world. She is very specific about what she expects you to know and will go into greater detail with you about anything you have questions about. Test are cake.,1
"For a speech teacher, she is very nice and helpful.",1
"She's a pretty O.K teacher. She can be annoying at 8 a.m though. She tend to tell random stories, will ask the entire class(literally each student) a pretty rhetorical quesion, and seems to take it personally if you sleep while she rambles about something irrelevant. Other than that she's ok. If you need help her office is open.",1
So easy to work with,1
"To put it simply, get ready to teach yourself Orgo Chem I and pray that the massive curve at the end of the course will save you. Only 4% of people in my 200+ section made A's.",0
Mrs. Olson was hilarious!! We met twice and received one credit just for showing up. She ended the class around an hour and a half early just because she felt like it. We watched optical illusion videos and went on a field trip to the library and hung out. But we also learned life long skills that are very important and that I use daily.,1
"Professor Benjamin really does mean well. This class is very lecture heavy and I didn't really understand them. However, the material can be learned if you put the work in. I strongly recommend going to the Math Lab to get additional help. Make sure to do the extra practice problems as they are very similar to the test. He really cares :)",1
"Sam is amazing. If you are a music major, you will see him plenty as the Double Bass Professor. Every Wayland resident loves him. He is kind of awkward, but it's really okay, he is so passionate, caring, and very funny when you get him to open up. Make sure you appreciate this man to infinity. (I have never taken his class, I just know him personal",1
Shes cool,1
Very great teacher she teaches what she does very well and explains things the way they are without confusing you All your grades are basically posted on online  so you know exactly where you stand Her quizes come with review and you go over the quiz review in class Excellent teacher By far One of my favorites,1
"I took her for ENC1101 and then recently again for ENC1102. She's honestly one of the best professors at Broward College. She's awesome, caring and funny! She's clear on what she expects and she makes the class fun and interesting. I would recommend her to anyone!",1
"Bulgarian. Likes to quote Madonna. Has an app on his phone that lets him take care of kittens and sometimes you hear his phone meow. Cool dude, easy class.",1
"have professor Tompson for PS101, Andy class is ridiculous compared to my friends'. This class was WAY over the top for an intro psych class. most other classes had 3 tests and no final, whereas Tompson gives 3 in depth tests AND a cumulative final. In addition, she requires a difficult 4 page paper that NO OTHER PS101 class requires.",1
"I took Dr. Knapp for several classes during my time at LBCC, those being two musicianship courses, three theory classes, and a music appreciation class. If I could, I very well may have tried to take him for each theory and musicianship class, he's that good. Knapp is a great teacher who can assign a lot of homework, but the homework really helps.",1

"Great Class, Professor Birnbaum definitely knows forensics.  The papers were not difficult (for graduate level) and he is generous enough with the grade.  There is one test, the final, just make sure that you have been doing the readings or it will bite you.  The grade of your previous assignments can carry you though.  Would take again.    ",1
"This is a one credit class on careers in environmental biology. It is really easy and you get to learn a lot about resumes and cover letters. Professor Hansen is a great teacher and helped me a lot with networking to find jobs. Overall, its an easy class with a lot of benefits.",1
"Short story, long suffering. We maintained good relationship until the last. Surprisingly, she filed me to the conduct center on the last day of the school without informing me what made her think a work I spent hours of working was not mine. Yes, she violated the rules. She ruined my good moods for 3 months until righteousness came.",1
Awesome Comp Sci professor.  Maintains good humor despite the inherent boredom of any computer courses. Highly recommended!!!,1
"Makes sure you have chance to do your best.  Grading: sensible point systems. Schedule: predictable. No pop quizzes. Tests: no trick questions, gentle nudges towards the intended answer. Lectures: good read of the room, well-structured flow of information. No TI calculator necessary. Lets you use Excel in Stats, like in the real world after school.",1
"Absolutely hands down the worst professor I've ever had. Not helpful, not available during office hours, completely self involved. Pretentious, teaches theory entirely from one perspective. Also she can be rude and inappropriate. Essentially, she does not care about students, she is not interested in teaching, and she should not be a professor.",0
"Of all the classes I took online, sociology was my favorite! I am a pre-med major and this course gives you an insight into the different problems we face as a society, but this professor made the weekly discussions meaningful instead of having you repeat the information from the textbook. Highly recommend she is a very nice lady!",1
rude to students calls us stupid and lazy by saying all we do is play on our phones. tests are unbearably tough and half the things on the test he never talks about in class. Whenever u ask questions he rolls his eyes won answer them because apparently he told you about it before. I could go on and on about him! If you see him as your teacher RUN!!,0
"Excellent teacher. Always willing to stop and clear up any confusion on a topic. While he grades hard, he will do everything necessary to help a student succeed.",1
"This class was really great. Weekly reading, lectures, an extra assignment of some kind, and a discussion post with two replies. If you do the work, you will get an A. Li is nice and gives weekly follow-ups on the content from the last week to make sure you understand the whole point of the assignment. Would highly recommend.",1
"LOTS OF HOMEWORK!!! She sends ""What's Due"" emails after each class. No tests, but if you don't show up, you WILL fall behind. She's very busy, but responds to emails very quickly. She's pretty awesome in general, and really interactive.",1
"She gives you details on what the course is about via a syllabus. Since it was an online course, any responses from students were taken via emails; in which she was ready to rely to many. Gives positive feedback after finishing their work, which is an easy pass.",1
"I had Dr. Thomas during her first semester teaching. She was amazing! She truly cared about the students in the class and wanted each of us to succeed. It was a lot of studying for the lab quiz each week, but it is doable. She made the more boring or in depth material fun and relatable to us. Also, lots of opportunities for extra credit.",1
"Bad professor, bad man",0
"No marking scheme. He'll mark some questions normally and others extremely unfair. Dont complain though, no reason, university wont do anything since he makes too much money for them. Read the BOOK, in class its easy stuff, exams arent.",0
You are never going to know your grades.,1
"Dr. Casimir is very sweet but soft-spoken. His lectures are not mandatory but in recitation, he gives quizzes and answers HW questions. HW is due weekly 10/12 questions. Labs are long with a lot of calculations but attendance is mandatory for full lab report credit. Test are online also",1
"Smart & witty, she really makes the class interesting. Her little side comments about society/loyola/students/etc. are one of the best things about this class! She makes you work hard for the grade, but in the end it's worth it. I got so much out of this class. She's great to talk to outside of class. Missing class can throw you off, so go.",1
"I thought she was fair and you got the grade with what you put into it. The project is important. Easy to understand course. You do have to understand the syllabus though well and don't turn in the assignments late. There is a lot of reading, she does have videos posted for the first five chapters of the course.",1
Took him for Math 45. You will not pass if you skip class. Each meeting is lecture heavy and he will go through it fast. Make sure to ask questions if you don't get it. Tests are worth a majority of your grade so make sure to study and do study guides.,1
Professor Trower is SO NICE! He is SUPER helpful and loves giving extra credit. He also likes to apply the concepts he goes over in class to real world issues. He has got to be one of the best professors I've ever had!,1
"Professor Ortega is truly caring, understanding, and fair. He puts multiple blocks of office hours for students and is very passionate about the topic. I really enjoyed this class and learning about the Caribbean!",1
"Do the work to grasp/remember the material and you'll pass, simple as that. (8 week course) Grade: A",1
"Easiest ochem 1 prof at CSU, but teach yourself. Unresponsive to emails &  reads slides to you. Exams are fairly straightforward w. lots of bonus chances &  curves. Knows kids cheat & didnt care. Final is repeats Qs from quizzes & tests so GO SEE UR TESTS. Some Qs from test banks others from Depoali's hw assignments. If u need an A shes your chance",0
Wayyyyy too many readings from various books. No tests except for a take home mid-term. One paper that you work on all semester and pop quizzes on the readings. Real cool guy who will help when needed. ,1
Very very nice Great at teaching the material Hard to get a hold of outside of class,1
"She is an amazing teacher , you will like her class . she makes it easy to everybody , she helps you to pass the class and get good grade ,just do the homework she gives and attend the class and you will be good. Any thing you need in the class or with your homework she will absolutely help you . I recommend every body to take the class with her .",1
Jurmu navigated the Pandemic well keeping every single student engaged in what limited meeting time we had. He always made sure we understood the curriculum and provided additional office hours to take advantage of if you were unsure about a certain topic in class. I would heavily recommend taking a course taught by Professor Jurmu.,1
"Dennis is a respected artist, but should not be teaching. He shows up 15 minutes late everyday and sometimes takes attendance sometimes doesn't. He gives everyone a B as long as you show up and try. He tells you to watch videos on the internet if you want clarification on anything. He plays on his IPad all class long. No demonstrations ever.",0
"Have a quiz and journal entry every week. All quizzes and exams are open book. Her TA, Amanda, is pretty awesome and really helpful, she brings coffee for her morning class. 3 exams but not worth many points so you will be okay if you don't do so good on one. 4 assignments that are super easy. Go to class because she gives participation points!",1
"Professor Goldmann is great! Her tests are strictly based off of her lectures, so don't buy the book. Just show up to class and you'll get an A",1
"Prof. Prussing knows her stuff. Yes lecture is boring, but she hands out 50% of your notes in class.Readings are interesting and incorporate well.Just want to say that her TA's DONT deserve to be in grad school, (this means you MANDY DICKERSON). They like to screw people like me that KNOW what they're talking about out of good grades.",1
I have Professor Carr atm and he is really resourceful and tells class long stories. Be sure not to miss too much and always raise your hand.,1
Corporate Finance,1
"Very interesting guy, not a great teacher. He doesn't tell you the criteria for anything, so you are always wondering what you have to do/when the due dates are. His tests come out of nowhere. He expects you to be an expert anthropologist even though it is 1001 level class. Not an easy A at all.",0
"Fantastic professor. His lectures are very interesting, and he explains economic concepts in a easy to understand manner. Homework and exams can be challenging, but he is very accessible outside class, and is always willing to help students. My only gripe is the terrible third party website he uses for HW/txtbook. Apart from that great class!",1
LA is amazing. She is a giant source of knowledge about anything touching criminology. She has so much experience and she's great at explaining. The tests are fair and easy enough if you do your readings and attend class. Textbook is mandatory but also very enjoyable in general. Would take her again without hesitation. I love her.,1
"Class is easy, but boring.  Tests are really easy.  Lots of PowerPoints and movie clips. He does not get to know the students so do not be surprised if he has no idea what your name is until the last week of the semester.  He does check attendance daily, and if  you miss 6 days, you lose a whole letter grade. Miss 9, you get a D, miss 10 and FAIL!!",0
"David is the best professor I've had by far. He's super funny & makes you really want to come to class, so it doesn't really matter that attendance is mandatory because you'll actually want to go. Tests and quizzes are extremely easy & he really wants you to get to know everyone through networking, so you'll meet a lot of cool people because if him",1
Professor Ruskai is a great Professor. Her grading system is clear and easy for students to understand where they stand in her class. She explains the course work very well. She treats her students with respect. I loved the course because I had a great professor who knows how to teach students.,1
It's a so so class. I would not take it again though. Too much writing,0
"This was a very tedious class and the tests were extremely hard. Office hours only one day each week, but the hours run all day until 4 pm and no other accommodations made. Dr. Draper is a genuinely kind person and will take time with you if you ask and support you. Interesting subject, although lectures are hurried so write fast!",1
"She's really nice if you get on her good side. The class is hard and she's very passionate about the subject, so be prepared to work really hard! Talks forever but if you start your work while she talks in lab you'll get out faster; take good notes in lecture and you'll be fine!",1
"Thrasher isn't the worse teacher. Toward the beginning of the semester while discussing prehistory, when a class member asked her what date the Neolithic Age began, she said she didn't know because she doesn't want to learn something that she didn't believe in. I thought that was the most incredibly stupid thing I had ever heard from a professor! ",1
"If you want a profession in photography, then this class is for you. Quizzes are pretty easy, if you pay attention.He expects his students to grow as photographers, which is why he is pretty opinionated on critiques. On first day of class he will admit to this and tries to be lenient on first few days of critiques. Great teacher.I recommend.",1
"I took his online class over the winter session. it consisted of a group project, reading a few chapters a week, a discussion forum per chapter, and then a unit test per week. Tests are easy as long as you read the material and take good notes, but it is A LOT of reading. Put in effort and you will pass. Overall, great professor, I learned a lot!",1
EASY A!,1
Sometimes Ms. Trapp can be a tough grader but if you follow her instructions you should get an A.  So far I have a high A in the class.  She normally lets us out early.  I don't have any problems with her.  :),1
"He is a very difficult professor, He makes you do quizzes Every 2 chapters. Import lane mid term and the final combine. Where you have to re learn the information you learned in the beginning to even passes class. My recommendation is to not take him. He does not give you enough time to study. He gives you the study guide day before the final.",0
"loved his class. he is very funny, how he even talks make you laugh. very nice teacher. however, his tests are hard. you have to study the text book to pass the tests. labs are fine. lots of homework and quizes. have to show up for every class since HW and quizes are due on each class meeting. so I had fun in his class and I was studying very hard.",1
"too much memorization. this guy can't teach. wth, he marks u wrong even when u give him the right answer. WHAT A JOKE!!!",1
No Comments,1
One of the best professors I have ever had. His lectures are inspiring and very interesting. He gives extra credit. Just make sure you study for exams and do the homework assignments.,1
"A little boring and her lectures are hard to follow at times, but she's nice. If you need to, just ask her to slow down and she will. Take good notes and study them before the tests and you'll do fine. I didn't get the textbook and the class was pretty easy. I liked that she didn't spend overly much time on wars, and taught other things too.",1
I wouldn't recommend Coop for anyone who has never seen calc before. His explanations are unclear and the examples he gave in class were beyond easy compared to the problems on his exams. His exams have a generous curve because the averages are so low and he does very little to prepare you for the departmental final. He's a nice guy though.,0
"He does not go through any examples and just shows the answer. Rather learn on my own. Spends way too much time explaining concepts and its hard to follow along since he struggles to speak fluently and constantly says ""uh"". His lectures are the opposite of engaging you'll wanna just teach it yourself and wish you switched to another professor.",0
Jen is a great professor though a bit eccentric. She is quite literally Professor Trelawney. She is passionate about writing but can be a bit loopy and MIA but I really appreciated her writing prompts and feedback!,1
Pretty damn good.  I a person who runs from math: passed and she made it seem so triveal,1
I took her Global Women in Leadership class and she is absolutely wonderful! Started off each class with a safe space for us to discuss our days and weeks which was awesome. Her three assigned books are good reads and she is super flexible with people. Would 100% recommend.,1
"Fred Shira is a great guy and repeatedly encourages his students, however the class is far too easy for a college level class. All we do is write papers and more than half of them aren't graded. He is a very interesting guy and fun to talk to. He has a lot of stories to share with his classes from his life and he is happy to share his experiences.",1
"Best professor ever. Very intelligent, loves to give out A's!",1
"Mary Layoun is eccentric, outspoken and intelligent. She genuinely cares about student success and is compassionate about lit. Somewhat repetative in defining concepts, but it only helped. Her lectures are entertaining and thought provoking, easy to listen to. Easy class to read and interpret comic books. Highly recommend this professor!",1
Most classes were a lecture presentation format. Weekly quizzes and discussions plus 3 out of class experiences were required. She is pretty flexible if you ask about deadlines and we played jeopardy a few times.,1
"TAKE HIM!!! This is the BEST MATH PROFESSOR. Doesn't mind breaking down anything you dont understand.  He goes over all test/quizz material and will let you use your notes at times. Not a hard grader.  You will not be in class for the full class time. He cares about his students, wish I could take him for all of my Math classes.",1
"He's a very strict grader and deducts any points as possible from the test and homework. He talks very low so make sure to sit in the front, if you have any questions he's willing to help. Besides that the class isn't as hard if you know what you learn in MATH 125.",1
"I never thought it would be possible to laugh so hard and learn at the same time.  This guy should be a stand-up comic.  Also, he has a nice body!  The added bonus is you'll learn alot in his class!!",1
"Mr. Kuhlman is without a doubt the BEST teacher I have ever had. He is engaging, funny, and accommodating. Even though he is super busy with the other classes he teaches, he makes each student a priority. He provides resources online to help you study. I place Mr. Kuhlman in the highest regards and EVERYONE should take his class. HE IS THE BEST!!!",1
"There's a lot of group projects and participation will take you a long way in this class. She's a very caring, understanding teacher. She's funny and definitely one of the nicest professors you'll ever meet.",1
"Professor Melendez is your best bet for ECON2304. He does a great job of simplifying the material, however, if attendance (tophat) wasnt mandatory I probably would not show up to his class. Everything you need for hw and exams can be found in the textbook and powerpoints. Definitely not an easy A but exams are fair and workload is average.",1
"I took her online class and it was like we didn't even HAVE a teacher. She assigned the homework. Never really helped or returned emails. While she was teaching the class she graded maybe four assignments. (She just gave us all full points for turning them in.) Unless you like to learn straight from the book, don't take her; she's an awful teacher.",0
"Lipson seems like a good guy, but, quite honestly, his class was boring. 100% of classes were lectures, and there were few times for discussion or in-class assignments. He is super thoughtful though. He prepared thorough study guides for every test and they are very helpful. This is a polisci class, but lectures were more biased than I expected.",1
This class was way too difficult. I have taken many psych courses here and this is one of the hardest. I'm a straight A student and I will be lucky to pass this class with a c+,0
"Honestly, I would recommend him, he's a nice guy and a lenient grader. I failed this class last semester and he made the subject so much easier to understand. He will always answer your questions and is easy to reach. HW is like example problems in the lectures. Really helpful review before the midterm (3 of them+noncumulative final).",1
"Her class was incredibly easy if you showed up to class and did the homework. Having a deaf teacher takes a week or two to get used to, but there's really no problems with communication and she's very easy to understand.",1
"Mrs. McGee is a great professor. You will have to work hard though, she grades the open ended questions pretty toughly, but she gives you study guides so you know what to expect. You will be able to pass if you put the work in, and she posts the powerpoints online so that you're able to stay on track.",1
"Prof. Shaw is absolutely wonderful.  Teaching is her activism, and gosh is she good folk doing good work.  Her classes are transformative, and demand critical thought, participation, and the willingness to consider and restructure your world view.  She is kind, brilliant, and committed to her students above all.",1
"ATTENDANCE IS MANDATORY! Even if you have a valid excuse he wont let you make up anything, youll get a 0. He covers material very quickly & does not respond to emails. I went to his office hours once & he was almost an hour late!  Hes very rude & belittling about everything. Definently easier/ better professors out there!",1
"I got nostalgic and looked up Mr. Lofrano.  I took his golf class back in 1997 and it was one of my favorite classes.  I took it because I needed a PE class, but I ended up actually loving golf!  Who would have thought?  Mr. Lofrano is funny, cool, and I credit him with getting me to love golf!!!  Glad to see he's still teaching!",1
"If you are terrible at math like me but still want an A, he would be the best professor to choose. Homework and quizzes due every week. Exams are exactly like the quizzes and he gives you two tries so you can get your best score.",1
"Great Professor! First thing she says to the class, ""Just call me Apryl."" Very very helpful when it comes to papers. She'll look at your rough draft and it may be an F worthy paper and she'll give you the pointers you need to make it an A. Only bad thing is that she seemed very liberal politically, which is fine, but i shouldnt be able to tell.",1
She can be over-the-top w/her echo &choral responses(vocab words I learned from her) She was the only teacher to EVER push me to work hard &do more than expected. I respect the way she didn’t grade work bc it kept me working hard. She was the ONLY prof who taught me how to teach. My future students will thank her bc she taught me everything I know.,1
"Great Professor. She's young and relates things we learn in class to up to date scenarios that interest us. She gives you review sheets for her tests which is very useful. Her homework assignments don't take too long and are very useful when preparing for a test. Overall, one of the best professors Ive ever had. Highly recommended",1
"Overall this is an easy online course no deadlines but there is tons of reading easy midterm and final, I would take this class again. But if you like multiple choose exams and no papers this is not the  online class for you. You will be required to write papers in this class. The text book is cheap and he provides the rest of the readings.",1
"Professor Foster was great to have and I wish she taught French 102! There will be homework everyday, but it's definitely worth it. She had fun exercises and games that helped with learning the material through out the book, which you will definitely need! Attendance is also extremely necessary to be successful in this class!",1
"Coming from high school, I was scared of college level spanish. he turned out to be the easiest prof I've had thus far. participate and show interest in what he's teaching and he'll love you. Talk to him on a regular basis in Span. If you ask questions on tests, he gives you answers (if he likes you).",1
"Textbook not required but helps a lot - quizzes are online and in-class, online is more of a practice round though and can only help your grade. Attendance helps drive home the concepts, not mandatory but well worth it to show up. Professor is funny and succinct, would recommend.",1
"Dean was OK. Going to lecture is important, often boring but just go. No cum. final which is clutch. Boring and not super useful, but we made it folks.",0
"I really like professor Liao. I think he cares about students a lot. Even though some students might perform not as good as expected, he would not give them hard times. His tests are 95-99% similar to his in-class lectures. If you pay attention to his lecture and do homeworks, defnitly you have no problem to ace the test!",1
"Professor Alemayehu is a professor who really cares if his students pass. His classes are pretty easy, just do the worksheets that he assigns and you'll be fine. He usually goes over the answers in class, and often lets you use your worksheets on tests. There are around four tests rather than a midterm and a final. Easy A if you pay attention.",1
Horrible! :( Feel bad because he means well. But take with a diff teacher if you can,0
"Amazing teacher. Makes learning criminology extremely fun and easy. During lecture he doesn't use powerpoint or write on the board he just talks, so base your notes off what he says because thats what the test is going to be. There are weekly quizzes so do the assigned reading and you should be able to pass easily.",1
"If you're taking Chem167 it doesn't matter which professor you are taking it with besides for lectures. All of the professors use the same blackboard page and will have the same exams and quizzes. Expect a fair amount of homework, quizzes, and TopHat questions. If you read the book ahead of time nothing said during the lecture will be new to you.",1
"It would be a great class if she stuck to subjects like, I dont know, German. I dont pay my hard earned money to hear a language professor give her inane comments about the patriarchy and gender discrimination. Other than that the pedagogy is good. This being said, the other GERM instructors are also great so I recommend them to new students.",0
He is a very goo d professor. He makes music as an interesting subject to work. He works out with his students and tells them what to study on before tests. His study guides are extremely helpful. I recommand anyone to take his class,1
Roxi is a pretty good lecturer. I enjoyed her class and I became a better writer thanks to her. The only issue I had with the class was the amount of time spent philosophizing over the small stuff. Getting too deep and too technical with the boring stuff. That made class a bit less interesting.,1
"Least helpful professor i have ever had to deal with. Serious manner issues. Dont bother showing up 5 min late, he locks the door. Whole class is scared to ask/answer a question, because he will ridicule you if not up to his standards. Does not give fair warnings about tests, never reviews for tests.",0
"Moody Professor, Grades how she desires. Be prepared not to get grade results for weeks. Easy subject made hard!? Doesn't respond to emails, no grade checks ever! ",0
If you want to learn take Professor Conroy. He gives amazing lectures and if you do not understand something he will explain it again until you understand it. He cares about every single student in his class. Everyone matters!!!! He gives reviews before each test which is very helpful. I learned a lot in his class.,1
"Assigns a lot of homework, but it's all beneficial. Really prepares you for the social work career. Full of experience. Expects a lot of his students. A few tests from the text book and lecture, and then assignments are the rest of the grade. Their easy, just a lot of work. Take him! You'll learn a lot.",1
"First off, shes a HORRIBLE teacher; I dont understand how she was awarded the Fulbright Scholar for teaching. She's hard to understand in lecture, and belittles you in front of classmates when SHE's the one who is unclear. She also doesn't reply to emails in a NICE manner. I've never met anyone more rude in my life. Stay away from UHCL bc of her.",0
"Dr.Smith is a great. This is one of the easiest classes. No midterm not final. Just write a few papers, submit them. He is very helpful in helping you with your papers, and learning your mistakes, very friendly. Hope to take more classes with him. He's the campus newspaper advisor.",1
Dr Foster is great! He cares about his students and their success in college. He is very helpful if you are having any issues. I recommend him to anyone. I am just starting college and he alone has made me look forward to the rest of my time here. The material he taught will make my college carrer a success!! Thanks Dr. B!,1
Never got the final back. Infuriating class from start to finish. Takes off points for silly reasons.,0
"Brace seems nice at first look, but she's not as cute as she appears. Her lectures are VERY boring, and she never comes to class prepared. She wings half the things she says most of the time. Grading wise, it's confusing. One paper she could be an easy marker, the next it seems like she didn't even read it.",0
"Very nice and helpful professor. As long as you put time and effort into the homework and lectures, you'll pass with at least a B with no problems.",1
"Network Architecture and Protocols was a living nightmare...Karvelas' slides we crap, his DL format was email vs. Moodle like everyone else, exams were absolutely impassable, and he didn't even admin his own exams...STAY AWAY!",0
"BY FAR ONE OF THE BEST, REALLY CARES, FAIR, ABOVE BOARD WITH ALL HE DOES, ONLINE CLASS AND WAS GREAT,,,, GROUP PROJECT IS GREAT BUT LAZY STUDENTS DO NOT HELP BUT ARE DEALT WITH,,,,,TEST HARD BUT ARE DOABLE.....A MUST TAKE CLASS OR CLASSES WIHT PROF. CARR",1
"closed minded and not helpful- Announced to the class that ""white people steal everything from us."" She was very offensive and only accepted her opinion. CANT STAND HER",0
"Super cool professor, class is super interesting. Learned a lot. No need for a book, everything is in the power points. 10-10 is my rating for him.",1
I had him last summer and found him to be a great professor. He clearly explains a lot of the concepts and gives handouts. ,1
"I've never written a review but I have to for him. He is by far the worst professor I've ever had. Rude, doesn't help students, and consistently insults and makes you feel terrible if you don't know the answer. He said that if you need help to ask questions and when you do he insults you and tells you that you aren't studying enough. Don't take! ",0
"Great teacher, highly recommend taking this class if you need the music credit. He's lecture heavy, but the lectures are clear, easy to follow, and not hard to listen to. Read the book, listen to the music selections, and you'll be fine in this class.",1
"He is awesome.  Very enthusiastic about the subject and gets the class interested, too.  He is very funny and tells good stories.  Not uptight at all.  Very laid back.  I don't like Math classes but he made Calculus (normally a very painful subject) enjoyable.  Take him!",1
She was very helpful and an excellent instructor. I would highly recommend taking her online course. The Wiley Plus software at the University of Houston has helped me tremendously. The assignments are straight-forward and the guidelines are clear. I would get an early start on homework so you can work on it in a timely manner.,1
Dr. Eubanks is easily the best instructor at NCTC. I took his comp I and II classes a few years ago and I truly believe that his help on my writing was an influential part of me graduating with honors from UNT this May. If you want to learn how to write successfully then take this class. If your lazy then don't!,1
"covers a lot of material and requires a lot of reading but she's a really good teacher. at first i was worried about her tests that are in essay form, but they're not bad and i got an A- in the class. i'd definitely take her again.",1
"I loved this professor. He taught US History in a way that made it a story, and it was interesting and exciting. I got so excited about going to his class. He's kind and thoughtful and easy to access outside of class. He also accepts late work!",1
"This class was a great experience. Not too hard, but challenging. She gives many examples of what she wants and is generally passionate about what she teaches. I recommend Zuidervaart.",1
"Covered to much to fast, lacked substance",0
"Professor Shelby is a wonderful Professor. She is very clear on what she expects. Attendance in her class is a must because little assignments at the end of every class session. She prep the day before the test. Show up, pay attention, and do all the work assigned to you and you will pass.",1
What can I say?. This is one of the best people I have ever know.  I published a Physical Reviews Letters and another paper under his advisement. He is very concerned with your learning and really wants you to understand things. I have heard wonderful opinions about him. His english is very stylish and very Australian.,1
Dr. O shared many real-word examples on the discussion board to make the class lively. Great feedback and will ask for a resubmission if you miss many of the CT assignments. She is a great professor and I will take her again if she teaches more classes at CSU-Global.,1
"She cares a lot about her students passing and always gives you chances to boost your grade up. Lectures were confusing but I think that was more because of the material. You definitely need to study to pass. I enjoyed having her as my professor, she is very nice!",1
"The professor gets very political in class and it's annoying. Too many readings, no laptops in class, you need the hard copy of the text. Lots of HW. Don't take this class when you have other important classes that take a lot of time because this professor seems to think she's the only professor we have.",0
"Very helpful instructor! Definitely recommend him because he goes step by step. He will also teach you some very helpful short cuts. He also cares very much for his students, and I think that is super awesome! Definitely take him!",1
"This class with Alynn was great! She marks very fair,  gives good feedback, and is willing to help individual students with anything they need help with. I would highly recommend her class to anyone!",1
This professor is so rude. Not recommend!!!,0
"Worst Professor I have ever had. For 1 credit lab, he makes you write 20+ lab reports or else you would pass an 80. Finds anyway to subtract points, gave me a 65 on a 50 page lab report , that took 7+ hours to write. Avoid him at all costs for any class",0
"Amazing Professor that take the time to relate textbook reading to real life experiences making learning clear and concise. High expectations, but very amicable to work with students to see them achieve.",1
"He is a nice professor, always there to help. Still needs to work on his lectures, does not really know how to explain. A bit unclear when doing problems, he knows the material. 3 exams and 1 project. ",1
PRETTY EASY HE POST ALL THE READINGS AND NOTED THAT YOU NEED FOR EACH WEEK THEN POST THE TEST AND REFLECTION PAPER THAT FRIDAY OF!,1
Ms. Lee motivates students to achieve the highest results. She really cares about each student progress. If you are interested in course there are no doubts that she will do her best to help you. This proffessor is the most student orient on the course. I am really happy to be a part of her class.,1
She's amazing at her job she's patient ,1
"If you can avoid this professor, literally do it. Her online site is beyond convoluted and she doesn't make expectations clear. If you forget to turn something in, good luck. She also responds to emails in the rudest way. Seriously don't know how she got so many good reviews. Avoid, avoid, avoid!",0
Amazing instructor. Loved the course.,1
This professor is great. She has very clear grading criterea and if you have any questions you can always ask and she will gladely clarify. She takes attendance but she is very lenient. Overall she is awesome and I would take her again! 2 easy tests 2 easy debates and 2 projects.,1
Rick is hilarious. This activity was one of the best ones I've taken. His games approach makes the learning fun. Don't piss him off or he'll get grumpy.,1
"This is the best Professor at Elac, she provides the notes on canvas and you just need to print it and bring it to class to follow along. She goes over on what will be on each exam and drops the lowest grade on one exam. She's adorable and super sweet. People like her make me enjoy going to school and not feel any anxiety. No textbook needed.",1
Professor Trubatch was not a good lecturer. He would write things on the board without explaining what he was doing and would often just mumble while facing the board. When he did try to say something he sometimes wouldn't even finish his sentences. He never used examples to explain a topic which is necessary in a math class. Avoid at all costs!!,0
"Prof Conroy has the potential to be an excellent teacher once he figures his stuff out. He seems kind & honest &  is always an email away. His tests are tough and long and are 3-5 chapters deep. He needs to double check handouts, space his tests out, & not assign a project less than a month before Finals while still preparing for our 3rd test.",1
Not a good lecturer. All he does is assign youtube videos to watch at home and tests you on it. His classes consist of answering questions about the homework and correcting quiz questions you got wrong. Only reason I passed is because I took Calculus in High School. I chose to take 75B with him after 75A because there's very little work to do.,0
"Max has not handled the situation well, did not give us guidelines or dates of graded material (quizzes). He also does not give respect to students at all, and will not even give guidance on exams. It's no wonder the midterm average was so low. All he has to say is what would be on the exam, rather than respond with ""don't pry for information"" BAD!",0
"hes really calm and collected, does a great job at explaining the material and cares about his students. great professor overall. you will not regret taking his class",1
Expects you to know everything. Difficult to understand and knows most of the class does not get it and still does not try to make us understand. If asked a question he will only repeat himself and make you look dumb. Horrible Prof.,0
sweet,1
"Let me be blunt, if you do not put in work, you will not pass. Mrs. Prasad is one of the most AMAZING professors I've ever had. You must be able to teach yourself (no text book we use K-Learn) but Mrs. Prasad explains things thoroughly, is fast paced but she will take the time to make sure you understand. Put in the effort and you'll easily pass.",1
Final required you to attend class as questions came from lectures. ,1
I lover her. She really cares about all her students and helps you in any way she can. Her lectures are interesting and I actually made friends in this class even though I am anti-social person. I would definitely take her again if I could.,1
"Had Dr.K back during Fall 2007 and Spring 2008.  Awesome, awesome prof.  Do the readings, and you'll be golden.  He has a hilarious sense of self-importance.  Ended class 60 minutes early one time to bitterly complain to the tech people about the faulty projector.  After all, he did want to give a Renaissance Art Lecture LOL ;)",1
She is  fair grader. Gives great feedback. She knows her subject and has useful things that she emails us with. An awesome online course. The only thing is the textbook is a requirement.,1
This teacher should be fired. You leave his class with less confidence than when you started because he makes fun of you if you dont understand in front of the whole class.,0
"There is a lot of work to be completed for this class, but I believe that it has made me a MUCH better academic writer. Other than that, Tom is an incredibly caring and intelligent person. To be in his class was a blessing and a pleasure.",1
Best teacher I've ever had. Extremely generous when it comes to turning in work. There are no late-work penalties (except for a couple of peer discussions),1
"Lots of homework but after the midterm it gets easier and his grading is more lenient. The quizzes were challenging, as well as the midterm and final. There are a few group projects that are time consuming but easy A's. Should be an easy class if you are good at math. If not, be prepared to teach yourself the material. YouTube was a lifesaver.",1
"I took lessons from pawkett for 1 semester and it was disappointing. Not a good teacher for ROCKBLUES type stuff. He seemed like more of a classical guy. His lessons are monotonous and a lot of the time it felt like I was learning random things for no reason. Plus he hardly seemed interested throughout the lessons, often ending lessons early. ",0
"She is very biased and if your opinions do not match hers she gives a lower paper grade. She is a really nice lady and does care. This was her first year, so hopefully she improves.",1
Awesome class he is very knowledgeable on the subject and willing to go out of his way to help.,1
Best professor ever! I wish she had a part two to some of her classes. I looked forward to this class every day and never wanted to leave it.,1
"I love Ben, he's a Ph.D. student so he's really chill and understands if you miss class occasionally. He constantly tells jokes during lectures and draws pictures which he then makes fun of. There are not many grades in the class and the majority is a group project were you present for a whole class but it's not bad.",1
THE GOOD COMMENTS ON THIS INSTRUCTOR IS FLASE. I SUGESST HE WROTE THEM HIMSELF.,0
"Sometimes he skips steps, but if you ask for it, he would happily stop to explain it; he is also very responsive to appointments/questions outside of class. He does give you credit for showing work, he even tells you which questions on the hw you will be quizzed on. Make sure to attend his lectures, he gives tips on how to solve specific questions.",1
"Get on his good side and you are golden, otherwise good luck.",0
"she set me up for failure, did not give grades back until the drop date, if you have a different opinion than her she will fail you, my whole class is basically failing now, have to meet outside of class and graded on it, have to come up with your own exam questions and even those are not good enough for her. exams have too much for the time period",0
"If you're a disorganized student, this professor is not for you. She is very clear about her expectations, she is very understanding and have great concerns for her students. She do not tolerate lackadaisical behavior, she motivated me. This professor  wanted us to know the work,  gain an education, not a just a grade. I love her teaching style. ",1
"Professor Rarick is an extremely nice guy and & good teacher of Statistical Analysis. Lectures are very easy to follow & the course material itself should be easy for anyone to understand. I highly recommend taking him if you're required to take SDS. He teaches in a fun, casual, & effective way. You'll get an A if you put in the work. 10/10!",1
Stay as far away as you can from this class he is a nice guy but he flips the switch on you quickly if you miss an assignment. If you have no options then GROUP CHAT is all I can say and make sure you message each other so you dont miss an assignment,0
"Very knowledgeable in Nursing and can teach you ALOT. Very stern and we even butted heads a few times but in the end, I felt so prepared for my next clinical.",1
Prof. Guzzone was the man....he was very knew a ton of good stuff about an interesting subject....always had sweet music playing when you walked through the door.,1
"Good professor, very knowledgeable. Uses video clips a lot, but they are very useful for his teaching on history. We had about 4 papers due and some quizzes on a book. He grades a little hard. I would take another class with him, I can honestly say that I have learned a lot through his class.",1
"Nice guy, but spends the entire class on a single PowerPoint. Goes really in-depth into most things, though, despite clearly wanting to focus on ancient Rome. Good for early-level history classes.",1
Skulstad is super chill and really nice. I had him for Film HD production and his grading was pretty standard. As long as you tried and your stuff turned out decent you passed. He enjoys hearing about your ideas and outside projects and has good ideas for how to improve your work. He is very picky about some things tho,1
"Nice teacher, took online. Very helpful. You will have weekly discussion posts, 3 Reader Responses (400 words) and 3 essays (800-2200) words. Lots of writing. She has a mandatory number of words for everything, even discussion posts.",1
"She has some fill in the blanks in the actual lectures but doesn't put them in the posted slides, and you will be tested on them so be sure you watch lectures. She's well educated on all of the topics and is very well spoken. If you pay attention and do the readings the class it's easy to do well in and is also very interesting- you'll learn a lot!",1
"Wow. I don't think I have ever hated a class so much. I dread going to this class every single day. Pearson is a nice lady, and she means well. But she has no idea what she is talking about half of the time. She will assign an essay and be confused on what she assigned. Do not take this teacher.",0
"The class isnt hard, but you do have to understand the material. His HW is useless for the exams, and is also very long and painful. 8-10 pages of HW reliant solely on excel or R, Rstudio is annoying when he doesnt teach you how to use them properly. His exams are mostly like the reviews. Do well on the 2 midterms, skip the final and get an A.",1
"Very understanding, caring woman. She really really cares about all of her students both in thier personal and academic lives.",1
"Do the homework, have intellectual conversations in class, NO electronics, overall an awesome professor.",1
"This class was incredible. She really prioritizes thinking like a scientist and wants you to enjoy lab every week, and tries to keep the workload manageable. Lots of feedback is given for all assignments and she checks in with the class regularly to make sure everyone's doing well. Extremely available outside of class too!",1
He never uses the chalk board  and never have any helpful exercises. He don't give direct answers and if you ask him for help he tells us to go to the SI student help which: I feel should be the teacher. He is very forgetful and act as if nothing is wrong. He can speak spanish fluently but is not a good teacher.,0
"Ms. McClung was a great professor. Instructions for assignments were always clear. I found that the drafts she made us do also made me a better writer. Btw keep up on the drafts, or you'll fall behind when final grades go in. Never scored lower than an 87 on a paper & we only had 4 + journals every now and then. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! :-)",1
"This class contains  lots of participation and group projects.  Attendance really matters in her class, if you miss a lecture it is hard for you to pass this class.  The textbooks were used everyday for this class.  DR. Mark went out of her way to help anyone with any questions they may have.",1
"She is not your usual type of professor, that's for sure. She literally PERFORMS her classes: every word that comes from her mouth is pure poetry/philosophy. Not everyone's cup of tea but I loved her!",1
"Really enjoyed her class, made it interesting and fun. I learned a lot. Would recomend her for any class.",1
"He is a very tough grader, and it is impossible to get an A on the homework and in the class. Would not recommend taking him",0
Very helpful professor with a great insight towards future technologies. One of the best professors I met at Tech so far. I would highly recommend taking his courses as he wants students to learn.. learn and keep learning,1
"Dr. Mike is absolutely amazing. He wants his students to do well, and does everything in his power to make that happen. He always shows how much he cares AND believes in his students. Mike makes it more than possible for you to get in the class. Definitely take his section, HE WILL LET YOU IN EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT IN CSP!! It's so worth the extra day.",1
"Hard to hear if you sit in the back, but just study for the exams and do the easy homework and you'll do fine.",1
Stay on top of the readings for this class because there is a lot of them. The work was at a level as if it was an in person class. Prof Pfeifer seems like a cool guy though just based on his lenient grading and how fast he responds to emails.,1
"Super friendly! Admitted he wasn't great at lecture timing with class being online. However, the material is digestible and he gave us practice questions for each lecture that line up with the difficulty of the exam questions. 5 exams, pretty straightforward with a take-home part for each. Don't even need the textbook, just rewatch lectures",1
come prepared to participate or dont bother with this Professor. He earned my respect by making himself available outside of class. He gave me solid advice and that advice is why I'm still in college.,1
Helpful,1
"Incredibly difficult for an intro class. She has no idea how to budget class time, will rip apart your work in front of the class, and expects far too much of her students. Reading questions are absolutely ridiculous and took me about 5 hours per assignment. Takes about a month to grade your assignments.",1
Great Professor. But very slow in lectures. Sometimes he wastes lot of time by explaining  the basic concepts. But homeworks are interesting and challenging.,1
"I had Dr. D in 1976. Learned alot. Made the courses I had interesting. As a Field Public Health Sanitarian, the courses were very helpful. Can't forget the knowledge that was passed on.",1
"Some of the labs are difficult but if you ask him questions, he will answer and help you out. Most of the work is done in groups, so that only makes it easier. He is a fantastic teacher who loves and knows what he does. ",1
"aw i cant beleive what im reading with some people. He is so nice.you have to try to understand his humor,he talks alot about himself butthe man is proud. he also is very smart he makes me crave potato chips and soda cause in class he eats.. other than that he will prepare you for e2 cause his e1 class is way ahead of the others.. HE IS A MUST TAKE",1
"Yvette is a wonderful professor. She is very funny and she gives personal stories as examples which helps a lot. There is on paper, one midterm and a take home final. She is very clear in what she is looking for. There is a lot of reading but it's interesting. Take her class as soon as possible because she keeps mentioning retirement.",1
Sara is the best teacher I have ever had. I took Social Justice and Social Welfare in the US and it was my favorite class I have ever taken. She cares about her students and wants them to succeed both in the classroom and outside. Her class is very interesting and is an easy A if you actually do the work and pay attention to the powerpoint lecture.,1
"4 3-5 page papers, 4 presentations, 10-page final and presentation, lots of reading. Too much work for lower div. but an easy grader with clear expectations and rubrics for all assignments. Only daily hw is reading, which can be 10-80 pages a night, depending. A quirky guy who loves tech and history. Shows cool videos and often grants extensions.",1
"Super Cool and funny. He definately knows his stuff. You have to read and study, but you'll be better for it.",1
very sexy and hot ummmmmmmmmmm,1
Kopp's a cool dude. Laid back and open to all ideas. The textbook (online) is needed as there are short quizzes every Sunday. Speeches are fairly easy and you will do will if you follow the rubric and maintain good eye contact. Attendance does matter. He will mark 5 points per unexcused absence which got me a B. Fairly easy class and cool professor,1
"On the first day, God created Earth.  Before that, Kregler created God.  And on the second day, Kregler created music...and so it has been.  Michael Kregler is a genius, to say the least.  One time in class, he actually told us the most meaningful thing I have ever heard: The microwave, oh yes, the microwave, does its job.",1
"I love Dr. Polster! Her class is hard but it is so much fun. She wants everyone to do well and learn German, and she will do everything in her power to help you succeed. As long as you keep up with homework and go to class you will do well. Don't let the other reviews complaining about homework scare you, she is an amazing teacher.",1
"Dr. Boden knows his stuff and is very passionate about Geology. The 101 class is, lets just say intense. if you pass the class you will know much more than the standard GEOL 101 student. that being said, pay attention, memorize the stuff and stick it out. It's a hard class, but prioritize it and you'll probably be fine.",1
"7 quizzes, pretty tricky at times and you had to prepare a lot for them. He also gives EC. Put in the work and you will be fine.",1
I was very disappointed with Mrs. Dudleys class!! she is very passive aggressive and very monotone during lectures. During labs she talks for a good hour n a half before you even start the labs. I do not recommend if you're looking for a bio teacher that is approachable and wiling to work with you.,0
"really nice, but can bite your head off, but dont take it personally. class is mostly boring unless your interested in the engineering of the equipement. dont have to go to class, but there are some small things that you have to know to get A+ which you have to get somehow. Has a stutter with ""s"", tries really hard, but has to learn powerpoint.",1
"Professor Northrup is amazing. He gives his students a real understanding of the material and doesn't just teach from the book. He is by far the most accessible professor I have had yet, and he genuinely cares about his students.  He goes above and beyond what he is expected to do.  If you have a chance to take a class with him, do it!",1
"makes an impossible class not so bad. however, he teaches like a flipped classroom so you do homework then learn it the next day. this class is so hard he should have just taught it normally, but go to his office hours and he will help as much as he can. this class is either something you get or you dont, so good luck",1
"Professor Malone was pretty organized and helped make this class pleasant. He lets us drop one test and five quizzes at the end of the semester, this helped my grade a lot. It is pretty difficult to fail this class if you do what he asks. Homework is optional and he lets us retake quizzes as many times as we want. Highly recommend I loved his class",1
"Katey Leverson is such a sweetheart and her lectures are always interesting. Her exams are all completely reflective of her lectures, so don't skip class! If you show up, listen, take good notes, and spend the necessary time on your homework, you will do great in this class.",1
"I found this instructor focused on retaining and exercising power over his students rather than effective teaching .For example, he would deny students entrance if late to his quizzes (even for a couple of minutes),make last minute demands such as upload an assignment the day that is due when he had explicitly asked for a paper version previously.",1
"The class is basically AP literature with lots of class discussions, yet few on American Government.  No textbooks or tests, but many essays, projects, and novels to read.  Class takes a lot of work, but if you are dedicated, it is so worth it! Lawrence is super friendly and cares every bit about your education!",1
Mr. Edward is a wonderful teacher. I learned so much from him. NSCC is lucky to have him,1
"I found him as an OK prof. His notes were relatively organized, and always posted in advance. 
 
 Had a bit of trouble when people asked questions though.",1
"Prof Engleke is great!  She is very helpful especially during clinicals.  She will always call everyone to observe/try a new procedure.  Her lectures could be a bit too fast paced.  Somehow she expects you to know the contents.  But then I took her during 203, so I guess by now she expected a lot from us.  She made nursing very interesting.  A+",1
Prof. Shimko is great. He gives lots of extra credit opportunities and puts all the lecture notes online. Attendance isn't mandatory but this class is interesting enough that I wanted to go. ,1
"Mr Cervantes does not make the class easy by giving handouts, but his taking the time to answer each and every question of students in a way that makes complete sense makes the class easy to understand.   He knows a great deal about Web Development, and he does not hesitate to share his knowledge with his students. He is a good professor.",1
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED do not let her be your 1st choice. She is a kind teacher &loves math but she is higly confusing&wants you to spell out each word&number if your problem is 2+24 she wants you to explain why and how do you know for a fact that  4. Makes everything more confusing than what it needs 2b. Group projects? what are we in highschool?,0
"Lab is a easy A, just show up for the 3 hour lab. The classes you dont need to attend lecture but you do need to go on fridays classes becasue theres a quiz every friday on an article. You have 10 mins to complete it. You'll get 7/10, 10/10, 8/10 on most of them. 3 midterms (one counts as the final). answer the questions from lecture slides!",1
Professor Guzzone is absolutely incredible. This is my favorite class that I have ever taken in my life. He is so knowledgeable about music and the history of it. I had a 3 hour class that met once a week and always wanted to stay for more! I never even needed to take notes! Tests are so easy if you pay attention and read the chapters when asked,1
"easy A, very lax in style of teaching. 10/10 recommend. He will aid you when needed, good personality. 2016",1
"Dr. Isenberg is a kind, funny, and easy going professor who will work with you and answer questions or concerns. Content heavily neuroscience based, so if you are not a psychology major it may be hard. The class lecture is based off power-points, but are not uploaded into canvas so be sure to take notes. There are no study-guides for quiz/test.",1
"A very good professor. Anyone who can't hack-it in her class is a joke. Easy class if do your part. Just show up on time, be respectful, and do your work. Compared to the demanding math and science faculty, though not her field, here at ccp, she is one of the easiest professors.",1
"She does not give any feedback after homework and tests. This is an online class and without feedbacks, you cannot easily do corrections and prepare for exams. She does not care about what situation you are in (COVID) and she will gladly give you an F and when you ask for corrections she wouldn't give them to you because she is too lazy to do them.",0
"She missed a field trip and made the students do it again to make up the work. She talked about herself a lot, too. Generally speaking, I found that the best way to learn the subject was to ignore her. The class itself was easy (especially since she has 60-79% as a C, with A and B being normal), but not because of her teaching by any means.",0
"Sensei Morales is one of a kind, seriously! He cares so much for all of his students which is the most important thing a professor can do, aside from making learning fun and easy esp a foreign language (WHICH HE DOES TOO!!!) 10/10 will be taking JPN 1121 with him. YOU WILL LEARN JAPANESE!",1
He's a great teacher after taking this class at sac and failing this class was a breeze and he is a very nice person. seriously do not get the book save your money. Participation is key in this class.,1
He is not at all helpful if you don't agree about grade,0
He makes frequent mistakes when teaching and often made it more confusing than it needed to be. The material wasn't extremely clear the first time he taught it but he always answers questions the students had. Once it was clear what to do then it was easy. He's pretty funny and I had a good time in the classes.,1
"She is SO unaccessible. She teaches at like 3 different places, doesn't always reply to emails, and has a grad student do ALL of her grading. If you want to feel like you're taking a pointless and difficult class with no teacher, take Oakley. She isn't helpful but still grades harshly. Complete waste of time, do not recommend.",0
Good lord he will give you the biggest stack of reading in the world.  DO THE READING. DO THE READING OR YOU WILL NOT DO WELL. He's a cool guy and has interesting things to say. Also he has a really nice dog that he walks around campus. ,1
BEST CLASS EVER,1
Dr. Lai is very knowledgable professor.,1
"Good teacher but gives a ridiculous amount of homework. Try 5-10 assignments a week; oh & there are 5 papers. Additionally, many of the assignments seem like busy work that she doesn't even grade based on effort/quality. If you do poorly on an essay or miss an assignment, it wont matter bc there are so many assignments to balance out low scores.",0
"Barely uses Blackboard. He posts homework assignments with solutions that are barely legible and some solutions are incorrect.  Dont bother going to class. He takes the easy way out by just deriving formulas and going through theory, rather than doing examples. 65% of the class failed the midterm and he told those with low marks to drop the course.",0
"She is nice but doesn't grade, can be very unclear with what needs to be done, and is slow with any sort of feedback",0
Awesome. Extremely approachable. Super clear standards. Grades are not negotiable? Very fair normal class. What more could you want?,1
She is so sweet and really knows what she's talking about! Not many professors can lecture and make sense without a power point or notes! She made me really like psychology!,1
A very fair and approachable instructor.  She takes her job very seriously as well.  She is also very respectful of students.,1
"it seems like you have aton of assignments, but dont worry, you can revise all of them as many times as you want before the final portfolio. if you placed directly into this course you will do great. if you did good in high school writing, you will do just fine in here. do your work and you will do fine!",1
"Easy to Understand, but not too interesting.  Fair Grader, overall easy class if you do the work.",1
"Take his class if you aren't good at math. I am in his online spring semester course. He's a great teacher, funny, and grades fairly. His lectures can get a little boring but he doesn't call on you or have unnecessary filler work. You have to buy the online lab course($60) to complete the homework, it's super doable. 5 tests plus 1 final.",1
No Comments,1
"This class is not bad at all. If you already have practice in health science or basic bio, a lot of it is just review until you get into the nervous tissue section, which was the only section I had stuff I've never seen before on it. Its 4 exams and a final, and everything on her exams is from her ppts so if you study em you'll pass. Ended w/ a 95",1
"shes a nice teacher..you will definitely need the book and study on your own because her lectures are EXTREMELY brief. make sure you do well on the essays and the in-class work, take notes and study for the tests on your own and you should do good. overall, smart and nice teacher. class is fun.",1
"Good person, okay instructor could be better. Class participation heavy, lectures every class, thought experiments and the like.",1
this man is amazing,1
I had him for Political Economy. He's a really sweet (and funny) guy and knows the subject really well. Sometimes he may be unclear because of his accent and because he digresses a lot. But overall the class is pretty easy. The tests and quizzes are SUPER easy. Read the book and take notes and you'll do fine. He's one of my favorites.,1
"Professor Lawrence is a very nice man and really cares about each student individually. Downside is his lectures can get a little dry (especially when the class doesn't participate) and he assigns a lot of reading. You don't really have to do it though - SparkNotes is more than enough. Easy grader. If you enjoy discussion/debate, you'll do well.",1
"I took Pete for Math 94 and 107 and I wish he taught every Math class SFCC offers. He makes Math fun and achievable (After 20 years w no math, I got 4.0 in both classes- he's that good!). He even has songs to help remember formulas. He genuinely cares about students and their success. He memorizes names and even brings doughnuts!",1
"Even if you need to take him for accounting 101 DO NOT. Very nice guy, joking and funny but not a single class I payed attention in and makes a difficult class even more difficult to try and learn. Strictly shows youtube videos that we could look up ourselves",0
"I graduated in 1992 and had Dennis and Donnna Corrigan, Dennis was an Exceptional teache and I still talk about him to this day.  I got employed 2 years later at National Geographic due to the skills he taught me. I Don't know if you read these Dennis, But Patrick McGrath, Tom Onell, Tim Bobko, and Johanna Logan think you wre the best......THANKS! patrickjfmcgrath@hotmail.com",1
"I had Erica about 2 years ago, but since then I have been about to come to her office and talk about anything I need her for. Her class is fun and she makes you feel important. I just wish I could take her for every class I have to take. She is by far in my top three teachers at AB Tech.",1
Awesome professor. Clear lectures. Very helpful in class and during office hours. The course is quite difficult though and will require you do the homework and prepare appropriately. Highly recommended regardless!,1
"Teacher is terrible. She contradicts the information in the textbook when lecturing. She seems to not have read the book. She makes a very easy class harder than it really is. The quizzes WILL NOT prepare you for the exams. No idea where she pools the questions from or the format, but the Exams are awful, and she won't prepare you for them.",0
"Pretty solid guy. It's pretty obvious he wants to make sure students feel well respected in the classroom. Don't have your phone out, show up to class, do the online homework, and raise your hand every now and then, you should be fine. You have to put the work in though, but then again, you have to do that in every foreign language class.",1
"Smith drones. He doesn't make sense very often, because he mumbles and interrupts his own sentences a lot. He is enthusiastic about the classes he teaches, but having a different opinion will get you interrupted and disrespected. Over-all he is fine to be in a classroom with as long as you don't put too much stock in your teacher's opinion of you.",1
She is my favorite professor by far. Go to office hours a lot and she helps give useful tips on how to combat quizzes and exams and some potential things on the exams she wouldn't give to the class. She gets a little bit sidetracked sometimes. You must go to her class if you want bonus marks!,1
great,1
She is amazing! As long as you go to class and pay attention you will make a good grade. She does a Kahoot before each exam that basically give you the answers to the test. She attended ECU and is easy to relate to. She doesn't tolerate disrespect but she's very fun! Enjoyed going to her class.,1
"This class is hard, but its a two-in-one gen-ed knockout, and the content is very stimulating. Unlike most classes, you have to actually participate to pass. Sections are easy and offer extra credit every week. Very funny dude. Not much more I can say.",1
"I love Ms Miller, most people will call her tough. College isnt easy, there are so many resources to help. She is understanding, and helps her students as much as possible. Just dont go into her class expecting to get by doing bare minimum, &that should be for any class. As far as response time, Ive always got a email the day after or night of.",1
Most stressful course ever.,0
He is awesome!! I would take him again if I could!! Makes it so much fun yet still teaches! Homework is basically extra credit on test and extra credit you can earn up to 15 points and its just going to theater shows or chior concerts. Hes so awesome anyone is lucky to take him hes so cool and a great teacher overall. He cares alot,1
Takes forever to grade things and takes FOREVER to respond to emails. The layout of the course is super confusing. I got an A from literally writing all the study guide on tiny index card for midterm and final. The rest of the stuff I did mostly copy pasted stuff on Google. Text is difficult to understand and totally useless. Don't take if you can.,0
"Very brash and unapologetic dude. Office hours are practically non-existent because he's adjunct. Physics is hard, but he puts in a lot of work to try to help students really understand the concepts instead of just the underlying math.",1
"Costanza is a truly nice and genuine guy. We used our textbook once a week to complete a study question in class with a buddy. I took the class with a friend and shared the book. I made a B+ but only because I missed notes prior to one of the 3 tests we had. Good teacher, good guy. Reminded me of Ned Flanders from The Simpsons, in a good way!",1
"He's a good guy, but a lot of what he teaches is hard to understand because of the way he teaches it. I strongly recommend having a background coding before taking this class, otherwise it'll be hard!",0
"His English is not that good and he can't really explain well, he mostly reads from the slides and the lectures are sooooo boring!!",0
DO NOT EVER SIGN UP FOR THIS PROFESSOR. He is not interesting or interested. He will not work with you. He thinks the only reason you exist is for his class. There were massive withdrawals for my class. I am an A+ student and I was getting C-. DO NOT BELIEVE THE OTHER COMMENTS OR YOU WILL REGRET IT.,0
I AM AN A/B STUDENT AND PROBABLY GETTING A C OR D IN THIS CLASS.  DOES THIS TELL YOU ANYTHING?,0
"Professor Berkson is the best professor I have ever had. He is so knowledgable about whatever subject is being discussed in class and nurtures many student-led discussions. I never considered majoring in Religion, but after taking Berkson, I might switch my major!",1
"This teacher is not transparent to his students. Does not use piazza, barely uses D2L. Extremely lazy when posting information about hw and exams. Does not post announcements at all. Joke of a professor at an academic institution.",0
"Only two assignments for this class, the midterm and the final that are both take home essay format. You are given the questions for both at the beginning of the semester so you can work at your own pace. Only downside is that is your only two grades for the semester so you have to make sure you do well in order to pass. Lectures are funny.",1
"You will do well if you read and complete all assignments on time. Very helpful if needed. Weekly questions (5-7 ) and weekly quiz (20-40). Instead of Research Paper will assign Case Study, all information on how to complete is given, so nothing to worry about. If you do all assignments and Case Study you will learn a lot and get a good grade.",1
"Sam is a great guy who really knows what he's talking about. If you have questions, he will definitely answer them. He really seems to understand students. His lectures are interesting, but my only complaint is that they lack structure and are quite repetitive. Overall, if you come to lecture and take decent notes, you will probably get an A.",1
"Miranda is a true gem. She's the spazziest professor i've had, but that's okay. She makes up for it from her hilariously bubbly personality and her sassy wit. She truly cares about her students and wants everyone to pass. This class was super easy, as long as you put effort into your performances, you'll get an A. I know you read these Miranda, ILY",1
Garrisi Sensei  inspired me to push myself and gave me lots of tips for memorizing  kanji and vocab. We communicated through email and she always answered my questions the same day it seems. I thought she was very generous with her time when she stayed after to help me and  a couple of other students. I better get  her next semester she's awesome!,1
"Covers a lot of information in class, but if you cannot get it all down in your notes, you can review it on Tegrity.  Lots of reading for each class and discussion on the readings.",1
"I am a Semester 4 student of the paralegal education program and Ms. Pemberton is by far the very worst teacher at Humber College. She is very anal, she does not mark your valiant efforts well, and she is far too strict. Take another else for Criminal Summary Convictions and your grades will be great!",0
"She is very passionate about Italy, which makes learning much more interesting. I like her but she would get very frustrated with my class. She seemed a bit demanding also, I felt like she expected me to spend all day studying Italian and have no outside life.",1
"While Dave was fun and amusing, he failed to live up to what I wanted in a business professor. The tests were completely based off of what we read in the books. The lectures only went over a choice few topics ( book too)and he went through the slides so quickly it was hard to take notes. He seemed to be really knowledgable though so that's a plus.",1
"The best of the best. She has high expectations but will do everything she can to help you meet them. If you communicate with her,  she will be your best resource. Very funny and witty,  and knows the material extremely well. Would give her an A++ on being a fantastic advisor.",1
Dr. Kennedy is a chemistry nerd more so than a teacher. He sometimes expects you to understand things as easily as he does or thinks you should. He is a really nice guy and fair grader.,1
"if you are into film, he is very knowledgable, and he is pretty interesting and a cool guy. the class is awesome and you dont even really need to stay for the films, but dont miss a lecture, his tests are way hard.",1
"Professor Juncay is very helpful, loves questions and discussion.",1
Ben is great at working out problems in a clear and concise way for the class to understand.  He is able to answer questions with clarity and patience.  He sometimes goes off on quirky tangents but it breaks up the dryness.  I haven't had a math class in 20 years and was really happy with him!,1
"Dr Sam is a good professor. I have him only on Lab. Besides his heavy accent, he always try to explain everything clearly.",1
"Took her for stats, super easy. Makes you do a lot of discussion board posts though, but still not bad. ",1
"Absolutely loved his class. He was well informed on what he covered during lectures, as well as anything that may have popped up spontaneously during class discussion. Not a difficult class, but I would advise reading your material and participate in class. Exams were straight forward. This was easily my favorite class since I've been at CCP.",1
"Mr. Jiao is a great professor, will work with you if you need help. Show up to class, pay attention to lectures and you will most likely pass. He does a good job explaining lectures on power point. Overall a great understanding teacher.",1
"He definitely wants you to pass the class. He explains during the class the homework and prepares you well for the quizzes. If you do the discussions, assignments, and quizzes you will pass. He is always willing to help you if you have questions.",1
"Prof Olzman is very outgoing easy to talk to. I took her comm 304 class virtually due to covid and she made the class very easy to follow, and the workload is pretty minimal. She's also very understanding.",1
"Professor Jenkins was great. Very engaging during the weekly discussions, and provided good feedback on assignments. Very fair grader and her classroom felt a bit more relaxed than most, which is a nice change of pace from a lot of the HMLS and PSAD professors at UMUC...I'd take her again in a heart beat.",1
Amazing teacher. Make sure you go to class or you will fail. She will definitely bring the actor out of you. Will defintely help you cope with stage fright. Very easy DEC class for D. MUST TAKE!!!,1
You will not receive  specific or constructive feedback on assignments. She will not provide feedback in the rough draft or the final draft.  She is one of the worst online teachers  I have ever had.,1
He was an awesome teacher. He gives you the exam questions beforehand and if you read the material he puts on BB and go to class you should be able to get As or Bs on the exams. If you miss any class though he deducts points but gives you extra credit opportunities. Definitely one of the best classes I've taken!,1
"This is one of the sweetest professors you will ever meet. He is so kind and understands that this is a gen ed and that we have very busy lives. He also does not give as much work compared to the other Mus200 professors. As long as you attempt to do the homework assignments, he will give you full credit.",1
"She is a sweetheart. Very young too. Probably only 34. She has silly humor, so cute. She is the cross country coach at the college. Take her class. You wont regret it. She is excellent at teaching, helpful, and patient as well.",1
"she is the last person that needs to be in health care field. i missed the 1st day my son was in hospital and she informed me she didnt care and refused to tell me what i missed then brought it up in her lecture as an ""example or hypothetical situation"" critical condescending, its all about her and her life NEVER take her class",0
"Had to attend lecture in order to be there for her pop quizzes. All notes were written on the board but she posted them on canvas so if you had to miss you could still get them. Tests were easy as they were verbatim from the quizzes and in class assignments. Also there is extra credit, even though you most likely don't need it. EASY A!!",1
Professor May knows his stuff. I really benefited from his knowledge. I would recommended his class.,1
"Arrogant but brilliant. He hates left-wingers though - don't be offended he's just a little pompous and opinionated. Teaches very well, but watch out for his writing, it's awful. I've heard he's an excellent prof for upper-year courses. Genius.",1
Very Very Very easy! Lots of essays but grades easy! Expected to show up to class for participation,1
BEST PROFESSOR EVERRRR!!!!! She brings snacks to class and is a VERY good professor. she is very sweet and i would take her a million times if i could.,1
"Took online sociology marriage and families. Avoid this professor for online classes, his syllabus is in broken English, he is not responsive to messages, and he does not have anywhere regarding the assignments throughout the semester, just sends weekly messages of what is due. Maybe a good professor in person, but awwful for online material.",0
"She knows her material, but not how to teach or grade it. She grades on page space filled rather than quality of content with notes and will give normal scantron tests at home with confusing questions on material not covered in class at all.",0
I had him for College Algebra and Trigonometry and received A's for both courses. He makes it easier on us because he goes over projects and thr test review packets that are identical to the take home and in class exams. During in class exams we're able to use our notes as well. If you're going into higher maths I wouldn't recommend him.,1
"I LOVE SRG. CONTA!HE IS THE BEST PROFESSOR AT LACC. VERY VERY HELPFUL IN EVERYTHING. HIS TEST ARE EASY, NO H.W AND IF HE DOES, NEVER COLLECTS IT. HE SHARES A LOT OF HIS EXPERIENCES AS AN OFFICER WHICH ARE AMAZING. AND HIS STORIES HELP AS EXAMPLES OF WHAT THE LECTURES ARE. U WILL NEVER MEET ANOTHER PROF. WHO GOES OVER MID/FINAL TEST ?'S THE DAY B4.",1
One of those unfortunate instructors that doesn't care whether you pass or not.  She is very critical and strict/excepts no excuses.  Depending on her mood at times she was funny but she clearly has an issue with equality and brought it up over and over and over!!! I got an A but had to cross my fingers til the very end!,0
"He is a super nice guy and is always joking around with us. A lot of getting up and moving around which makes the class go by faster. Unclear on papers, and doesn't answer questions clearly. Received the same grade on all of my papers and tests. Homework is a show on Netflix which was awesome.",1
"Dr. Mike really wants you to learn and succeed in the course.  He really prepares you for the exams as his section tends to be the highest of all the sections.  He has a dry sense of humor, but can be really sweet at times like a teddy bear!  Also if you are well prepared for umich, his CSP course puts you at the same level as everybody else.",1
Prof. Kim decided to make it so that the only way to view his lectures was to see them live. If you are an international student do not take this class due to time zone problems. If you are a domestic student still avoid him because his refusal to upload is a clear sign of being an egomaniac who demands your presence to pad his fragile educator ego,0
"Prof. Rickerson is amazing and knows so much about her field. She is so enthusiastic about this subject and she relays that in her lectures. Class does require a bit of studying before tests, but homework is almost non-existent. Her accent can be tough for some, but you'll get used to it. I would absolutely take her for this again.",1
"Papageorgiu is amazing! I highly recommend him! He will assist you with any questions you have, and he is hilarious.",1
The nicest lady ever. Easiest class ever. Totally would take her if I were you. You have to go to class because a big chunk of the grade is based on attendance.,1
"Dr. Gelderloos is a wonderful lecturer and a respectable man. However, I can't recommend his class to people who are trying to maximize their courseload or who are working. He gives an outrageous amount of work, easily several times more than my other upper level classes. His classes are difficult because of this. Have free time? Yes, take him.",1
"Great teacher that runs a no BS class. Grades are calculated entirely off of tests/quizzes, which he will prepare you well for. Homework is optional, allowing you the freedom to let yourself fail if you don't take the class seriously and practice, but also allows for more flexibility in your studies. Your grade will be a reflection of your effort",1
"He focuses on the text book for everything. Doesn't like to be wrong, he's always right because ""he's a professional"". I thought I was doing great and expected a b+ ended up with a C!!!!! he sure is a tough grader. Expects for you to be working on his class all the time.",0
This professor was one of my favorites.  He knew the material and presented it well. He even responded to most of the discussion questions. Most professors don't do this. His projects were super easy and made you feel like you were out in the field doing them. I would definitely recommend him and take his class again.,1
"Good teacher,with sense of humor always willing to help.Some things are a bit harder than others but all in all easy to comprehend.Does alot of extra credit which helps at the end of semester,so attendance is important.Does not like if your tardy and will not accept late homework.",1
"I took math 115 in the summer with him and let me tell you, he should NOT be teaching.  He may be a good tutor but he is NOT A GOOD TEACHER.  He does expect you to just know the stuff and he doesn't teach anything.  I ended up having to drop the class and waste the $400 I paid for it... Not a happy camper!",0
"I had her for Spanish 103 and I love her! She is very funny and made discussion entertaining. I believe she grade pretty hard, but she is a awesome teacher. I'd register for her class asap. She is better than most Spanish's teachers I heard from my friends.",1
extremely tough grader. on all assignments I didn't get any higher then a 70% I highly recommended avoiding her class. She takes forever to grade assignments i turned in 3 assignments and she took the entire quarter to grade all of them and took 3 hrs to grade my final.,0
i took Rafferty last fall. She told you what you had to do to pass and was always willing to help in office hours. Physics can be really boring but she made it interesting. She records lecture videos every day and posts them so if you miss class or need to see an example again. The homework is hard but the program walks you through it. Take her,1
"The class was super laid back! Took her in Spring 2021. However, the quizzes are 10 minutes 5 - 10 questions, but the discussion posts and learning activities are super easy. You do have a semester project that is needed to be done in order to get credit for the course no matter if you pass or fail. Really nice professor as well! NO EXAMS AT ALL!",1
THE BEST OF THE BEST. caring and willing to help,1
"IDK why she's a professor to start off. She Can Not Teach!! If you ask her a question she is unable to answer because she doesn't know herself. Take my advice and avoid her at all cost or you will regret it. She also teaches Auditing, do yourself a favor and do not take her!",0
This course is a complete waste of money and time. This guy has no idea what hes doing hes terrible. Professor Thompson does nothing more than read off The overhead projector its obvious he has no idea what the cost is about. Long boring lectures that have nothing to do with what youre going to be tested on sad so very sad. Take another class,0
"She's very clear with her lectures, but WILL shove her political views down your throat too. The online quizzes make it easy to pad your grades, but you have to read the textbook and jot down everything she says, even her opinions, to pass the exams. I got an A in her class, but the experience wasn't very fun.",1
Mr. Humphrey is a really good instructor. I highly recommend taking this course. You will learn a lot from him.,1
"Her attention span is very small. One cough and she'll stop the whole class to talk about our flu shots, then she spends an hour talking about that, then complains that we're so behind. She's unorganized. She'll come to class late and leave because she forgot our work. She made me delete a whole paragraph because the ""vocabulary was much too hard"".",0
Take her for ENG 101 and 102! she's the best,1
"He had a good sense of humor which kept the class time moving quicker. He did complete reviews of his exams before the exam. What I did not like was that he races to finish his scheduled work and doesn't have time for your questions if you don't understand. He also rushed the ""final"" pig dissection and I would say his teaching is very disorganized.",1
"Good man, very nice, but shouldn't be teaching anymore. First quiz was very easy, midterm was very hard due to poorly worded questions. Second quiz should have been easy but like his previous exams there were mistakes riddled throughout. Average for the class rn is maybe around a 50 (you can see everyones grade).S/U-covid is saving my GPA luckily.",0
"Dr. Smirnov gives challenging Wednesday worksheets, but he is always almost accessible outside of class for help. Holds reviews several nights before an exam; these review sessions are extremely helpful and I recommend that you go. Quizzes every lecture; exams are usually half multiple choice, half comprehensive. You reap what you sow. Cool proff.",1
LOVED HER! I'm taking her for spanish 102 for the summer. Such a sweet woman. The class is VERY doable and she definitely wants everyone to do well! She will help with any questions you have and very helpful in general. I personally loved her. It's not the easiest class in the world but if you can put the time in definitely take her she's the best!,1
"4 exams composed of questions requiring perfect memorization of several philosophical persons. He personally attacks you for not reading or being incapable of answering his questions. NOT OPEN-MINDED AT ALL! Utters inappropriate things in class and is just an all-around bad professor. More than half the class dropped the first week, but I couldnt.",0
Dr. Ponce is an amazing woman!  She is a great counselor and cares about her students!  She will motivate and help you achieve your dreams.,1
Best bio professor at WLU by FAR. Dr. H does everything he can to keep you interested and is always looking to help out the students in anyway possible (without giving extra credit). Very friendly. Very funny. Tests are difficult but fair. Doesn't really take attendance but you have to go to get the info for the tests. 10/10 would recommend.,1
Jackie is the best teacher ever ! She is the best teacher ever ! Shes SUPER FAMOUS cause of her kindness and always respect her students. She always makes me feel so thrilled every time I attended in the class. She makes me feel like I WANT TO ATTEND TO THE CLASS. Thats the truth. She gave us so many games n if u pass it u will get HW PASS ��,1
He is a really good prof. The class is really easy for everyone no matter if you are an AG major or not.,1
Hard class. A lot of studying will give you a C.,0
"I love Matthew to death, don't get me wrong, but this class in the way he taught it for ME personally was unbearable. Discussion's are pretty uncomfortable at times due to topics discussed in class (Race, Gender, LGBTQ, Women's Rights, etc.) , and is usually very one sided. However if you can sit through class and tune this out, its super easy.",1
"Best professor i took at brooklyn college, honestly changed my view on physics. Amazing and nice",1
Very passionate about the subject and knows a lot. Uses  interesting stories to emphasize what we are learning. Very upbeat and easy to stay interested for a three hour class.,1
I've taken Krutz in the past and always enjoyed his classes so nothing against him. Learned essentially nothing in this class though.,1
"Awesome, fun laid back teacher. Made classes fun. Bring him chips!",1
I learned a lot from this class. She was a very tough grader but gives good feedback for you to improve. I really did not like her at first but she's very intelligent and knows what she's talking about. Her class can be very boring because it lasts the full 2.5 hrs but she asks discussion questions so we can be involved and time goes faster.,1
"Prof. Pave was very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about what he taught. Always able to answer questions and give amazing stories about religions. A lot of quizzes & writing assignments, but they're not difficult at all if you just read the textbook. We had to read 2 additional books which were very interesting, and his feedback is great & detailed",1
She is seriously the sweetest and most helpful lady. She makes assignments very easy and interesting to students. I would definitely recommend her over other marketing teachers. One of my favorite classes,1
"Love this man, chose him for my advisor. He's hilarious, more to himself than to anyone else, but he tries. Labs are easy and there's no way you can't at least get a B. He does this wonderful thing where he creates a spreadsheet for each test and throws out questions with too many wrong answers from the students because he didn't teach it well.",1
Professor Yelleswarapu is very caring and his lectures were good. He emails back very quickly and is very understanding.,1
"I've learned more in his class than I have in any other at this point. Incredibly knowledgeable, and easy to pass. If you fail his class, you're an idiot.",1
"This is the easiest class that I have ever taken. Anyone who says that this is a hard class is an Ag major that has had it really easy during their community college days, or they are a lazy liberal arts major. Would recommend for an easy science credit. I have no ag experience whatsoever, and I got a 100 in the class. Buy the course packet.",1
I wish he would teach other PAD classes. Excellent professor.,1
This class pretty much followed the book exactly. It helped you understand the concepts of programming but the book basically tells you exactly what to do. The assignments are grouped into 3 deadlines so you have to make sure you can keep yourself motivated. He was amazing at returning grades quickly. I always got mine back within 24 hours.,1
"What a gem of a professor! The kindest and funniest man alive, and extremely open-minded!! Your participation matters in his classes but I doubt you would refrain from participating because his classes are so much fun! He is not a harsh grader but he barely gives out As. I only enjoyed Theology because of him. TAKE PROF PERKINS LISTEN TO ME!",1
Doctor Heybornes lectures were very upbeat and interesting. The tests are hard but Id you study and do the homework youll be fine.,1
"Amazing, most brilliant and brightest graduate student!",1
"Terrible professor, avoid at all costs. She's horribly disrespectful and the class is difficult only because she gives unclear grading criteria. She uses too many group projects to avoid having to lecture. Participation points are given arbitrarily and will bring down your grade. Worst professor I've ever had.",0
This class was super easy. If you show up you get an A. He basically is just an overall caring guy who is trying to do his job while making it as easy as possible.,1
"She's a really good teacher and the assignments are easy but she's really big on attendance, she is really fun to work with. As long as you go to class nd do your work you ae sure to pass,",1
Sorry that I only could take Professor Russo for one class.  Great class. ,1
"Absolutely horrible...seems easy when you are in lecture and are reading the book, but exams are harder than the anatomy exams. MC with answers like A,B, None of the Above,All of the above, 2 right answers for all questions. Very detailed on exams with obscure questions from specific cases. Bad lecturer, lecture puts you to sleep, AVOID AT ALL COST",0
"Her first test in bio 101 is just to make kids drop her class its extremely hard, her lab is insane and she makes the midterm harder than the other lab teachers, She is never in her office during office hours, get ready to study if you take her class, take maxwell instead..... Dr. Hinton is really nice and funny but her tests are insane.",0
"Dr. Tavss is a Rutgers legend. He is retired but you can find ALL the students in gen chem1 and 2 using his notes to this DAY! in his notes, he explains things so clearly and will step by step solve problems to help students build the ability to solve more challenging problems on their own. He is the only reason I learned any chemistry at all!",1
"He is a really good professor, I'm glad I tock psychology with him.",1
"Absolutely loved this professor! Even though I took her English 101 class online, she emailed once a week to remind us about due dates (online teachers generally expect you to know your due dates and don't do reminders). She was super friendly and helpful when I needed to reach her via email. Her assignments aren't hard but they are time consuming.",1
"Yes, it's possible to get an A but you'll definitely have to work for it. The content is pretty interesting, but you have tog get super organized in this class. You'll have multiple things due every week and a ton lectures to go over. If possible, I'd avoid this class as an 8 week course. You'll definitely always have somethingto do in this class. ",1
"Jim is one of the best professors you can have. He doesn't really teach a lot, but all his assignments are super easy and he takes time to make sure you really understand them. You can do very well on the assignments and would pass even if you fail the tests. He's one of the few professors on campus who truly cares about his students.",1
Extremely helpful and fun.  Highly recommend taking her classes.,1
No Comments,1
Dr. Z was prepared for class everyday. She always has a smile on her face and is extremely funny and kind. She is a great person.,1
Not a difficult class. Tests are straightforward. Basically the whole class is lecture of pictures from ppt and then tests from the book.,1
"Professor Ou Yang is great professor with in-depth knowledge in Accounting. The class projects will give you a clear understanding of how an analyst will do in real world. However, the final is a little bit challenging if you are not an Accounting major. Over all, he is a nice professor and you will be inspired by some of his thoughts and ideas. ",1
I usually try not to judge professors because I know they have other classes but I couldnt let this one go. Shes very unorganized and does not give back your work until the very last minute. Our class didnt find out our grades until the week before the final and it was too late to drop. Do not take.,0
"Way too text book oriented, not up to date with current trends his knowledge begins and ends with two examples: coca-cola, and Toys-r-us. participation based on arbitrary facts like if you check your email in class, how professional you are, etc. has pop quizzes like elementary school.PHD in consumer behavior so he scrutinizes little details .enjoy",0
I took Math2120 with Dr. Gueye and he's knowledgeable. His review was really useful for the final exam,1
Not the easiest subject and is focused on formula application. Moved pretty quickly and the textbook isnt used much but mainly as a reference. Posts slides online. Attendance is mandatory. Very good professor as he knows the subject very well. Had 2 exams allowed an index card for formulas. Final optional. 5-6 HW.,1
"Fantastic teacher .take with her ,you will fall in love with chemistry in her class",1
"Andor is a great professor. I had him for the ECO/HST class that he taught with Sabi. He's funny, easygoing, extremely knowledgable about history, and an all around interesting guy to talk to. He doesn't seem to care too much about deadlines, but he can be a tough grader so make sure if you turn something in late that it's good quality.",1
Took a seminar with her.  She's amazing at facilitating discussion and keeping the discussion on track and connected.  Very clear and brilliant.  So kind and helpful and understanding in office hours. Fair grader and wrote an entire type page of commentary on our essays for how to improve. Highly recommended.,1
she just hands out A's,0
"Great class and excellent professor, i had her for comm SPAN 2307 & 2308.. i will miss her now that i no longer have her in my next class. very helpful but come to class and do your work. i totally recommend this nice lady",1
"She goes off of powerpoints, but it's also important to read along and do problems in the textbook (she usually uses the textbook problems in her exams). Most of her exams are usually open ended, so make sure you understand the formulas. Overall a great professor, and she really does help out, but you just have to make an effort.",1
Professor Calkins is an amazing ENC professor. Wanted to take her for 1102 but couldn't get a spot unfortunately. She really cares about her students growth as writers and really helps you when you have questions about your papers. If you care about your grade she will make sure you get the best grade possible.,1
"As long as you turn in your essay on time, you will get a B no matter how awful it truly is. To get an A in the class, you really have to work for it. She does not have a rubric that tells you how each essay is graded. You won't learn a thing in this class.",0
He is not very helpful and quizzes and exams rarely relate fully to what was learned. The homework he assigns is barely worth doing since he never goes over it and it isn't the same problems as the quiz. ,0
"Dudrick is the man you aspire to be once you're in the professional world. He is so excellent and concise in his teaching and in his thoughts that it's a shame more people don't know exactly who he is. He is the best professor I've had at Colgate, bar none, and should be mandatory for all students of philosophy and of thinking in general.",1

We know you use a hair dryer.  What What What a hair dryer?  Great Instructor.,1
"Erik Riverson is awesome! He cares about his students and is responsive to emails. He's very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the material and he makes the classes interesting. The course material isn't always easy, but he makes an effort to promote understanding. Really happy I took this class an would definitely take him again.",1
"The best teacher ever, you can learn so much from his course, he can always explain difficult things in simple words,  and he is hilarious and passionate. Love his class.",1
"He is a horrible professor I really do not recommend anyone to take his class he talks down to you like if you are a moron, says horrible mean jokes, and his grading is just horrible DO NOT DO THIS TO YOURSELF!!!",0
"Compared to other math professors, Graham is pretty good. His lectures are pretty easy to follow, and he explains things better than most. He does not grade on a curve however, and will be pretty tough on grading. He does 4 exams, a final and 10 quizzes for credit. Quizzes can be done as a group. He also assigns homework, but it's optional.",1
"Professor Hunt is one of the sweetest people ever. Her lectures are very informative and she is always available outside of class for extra help. Her homework is very easy, she gives a decent amount of tests but if you study they are straightforward. I definitely recommend her class",1
"Very scatterbrained, not organized at all, I do not recommend taking her at all.",0
"Don't take him!!!!!!! Boring, sarcastic, and a very tough grader. Class is only based on essays no book work.",0
"Had him for OB. Great professor, one of the best in Paul. If you ever get a chance to take a class with him, do it. The midterm was in essay format. For the final we had a group project. ",1
"So great. I loved watching her train of thought and went out of my way to take another class with her this semester. Youtube her, if you really want to know. She's on there.",1
Dana is awesome! She is extremely helpful and understanding.,1
She's awesome! I wish she could teach every class! ,1
"After reading good reviews, I was excited to learn about crim in a sociological context. LA's lectures are painfully dull and boring, you're better off staying home and reading the text and slides. Shes super dismissive and seems to revel in her white privilege. Always uses same weird anecdote about her being able to drink vs an indigenous woman?",0
"Dr. Bulriss will provide you with all the tools to succeed. If you follow the syllabus and do the work, you will be rewarded. Dr. Bulriss is well-versed in Project Management. You will learn foundational tools and concepts to grasp the basics for success.",1
He knows how to set up a class perfectly and gives homework at a very appropriate time. His lectures are very direct and he does not waste time. He communicates the subject extremely well,1
"Nice but seems unorganized and unprepared. Essay assignments make no sense. Unnecessarily repetitive. The class was online for me, so it could be different in person.",0
Such an easy class! Everything is laid out for you and she gives clear study guides. Easy A and lots of extra credit opportunities. not extremely interesting content and a lot of common sense information but otherwise a great class. No need for the textbook.,1
"Whigham is an amazing teacher. He doesn't skip steps, explains everything clearly, gives reasonable homework, fair tests, and does everything that he can to help his students.",1
Good teacher. Pretty fun. Just come to class because it helps your grade. You can't turn in work late but she lets you drop a grade so its alright. Quizzes and exams are open book. Cool teacher but you have to do the speeches and come to class.,1
"Smart, teaches economics and finance more than  marketing----but that's what marketing really is.  READ everything before class and you'll do fine.  More a class in strategic management actually than marketing.",1
"Dr. Heyborne's lectures are my favorite of all the teachers I've ever had. He's funny, engaging, and knows his stuff. You also go on field trips for this class, which are so much fun. He also really cares about his students and will do everything he can to help them succeed. Sometimes his grading criteria isn't super clear, but just ask questions.",1
LA is what most professors should learn to be like. She is caring of her students and genuine. Her method of grading made it very easy to pass the class with weekly quizzes as opposed to a midterm. One short case analysis and final exam. Love her and her method of evaluation. Would take her class again!,1
"Very good, knowledgable, nice. Long readings, but are pretty helpful. Class is what you put into it.",1
"One of the best profs I have ever had. Especially during the pandemic, she was super understanding and very lenient. Grades consist of 3 exams, 1 very easy project where you have the choice to work alone or with a partner/group and weekly quizzes. The exams were very easy just study the lecture slides and there's no textbook.",1
She is not a good teacher.  I would not recommend anyone to take her class.  She does not related well with her students.,0
"The experiments are quite interesting and I enjoyed working on them.  However, if you encounter some sort of issue, Prof Ho will be of ZERO help to you.  I dont think he spoke more than three times the entire semester.  Youll have fun working on his required 50 page lab reports - any less and he wont even consider giving you a grade above 80.",0
"I've never met a more dedicated professor at USC than Paul Young. He earnestly cares about his students getting a valuable experience from his classes, and provides a solid foundation setting every MUIN major up for success. Actively participate and you will get a comprehensive understanding of the business and feel empowered to start your career.",1
"I loved Kate! She was very supportive and professional, as well as very realistic about what it's like to be a professional actor. She really helps you to grow and have a deeper understanding of what you're doing and how to improve. As long as you show up and participate you're going to do well. Would 100% recommend this class!",1
afd,1
"Expects a lot out of students, but keeps students engaged.  Gives help when requested. Great Professor!! ",1
"Faith Lamprey was a great choice for this class, very easy and straightforward. Online assignments are not rocket science, she says it herself. Participation is 15% of your grade, but the quizzes are online, at home, open book, and not timed. Getting an A is extremely do-able. Business problems are only hard if you can't follow directions.",1
Yvette is a great teacher she teaches the class using her own personal experience and is very passionate.,1
Dr. Hansen is probably the most down to earth professor that I have had. He understands that your a busy college student and will work with you when something gets in the way of your work or a field trip. He's really passionate about what he teaches that help out with some of the boring lectures. But Dr. Hansen is by far one of my favorite profesor,1
Uniteresting,0
"Favorite professor. Took him my freshman year 8 am class. I thought I would dread going to an 8am class, but it was relaxing. Grades easily as long as you follow instructions and try your best. The quizzes are VERY easy as long as you memorize titles and pictures. I would HIGHLY recommend you to take him if you can :) it'll be worth it.",1
"He is definitely one of the friendliest professors at Pace, and wants nothing more than for you to get an A and understand the material. His lectures are packed with info and he teaches using a lot of different materials, movies, stories, etc. He bumped my grade up from a B to an A at the end of the semester just because I talked to him.",1
Very helpful. Gives a lot of analogies to help you with your work. Very funny and easy going. Good Prof. Highly Reccomended,1
"This class is an easy A, and I learned a lot about nutrition. Lectures aren't super interesting, but they're short and to the point. Hill knows her stuff and is very clear on what you need to know.",1
"I had several classes by Dr. Chris when I was at school. Easily, one of my favorite professors. His classes are challenging, don't come to them expecting easy ""A""s. You have to work hard for your grades, but you learn a lot of valuable information. He genuinely cares about the lives of his students. I would highly recommend him as a teacher.",1
"All grades are based off of homework, and tests. Once you get your test back you can correct it and get half the points back, you missed. He is helpful if you miss a class or just need help. He doesn't email back. Calling is how you get ahold of him. You can work on projects and homework with a partner. He posts all his stuff on blackboard.",1
"If you're concerned about getting a good Composition teacher, take Mr. Valliere. He offers a class that covers the basics, covers what you need to do, and tells you how to do it. He is super nice and works with his students on any questions they have. He is funny, kind, and understanding. If I could take him for every class, i would.",1
"Doug is awesome. He's caring and funny and this class was so interesting. There were a decent amount of assignments out of the textbook but I was able to find online PDFs of all of the readings and didn't have to purchase it. This is an awesome gen ed, Doug makes class intriguing. I definitely recommend.",1
I can honestly say that Coach Martin is my favorite teacher at ISU thus far. He's a genuine man who cares about his students. He will also have your name learned within the first two weeks! He's awesome! I highly recommend him!,1
"BEST TEACHER EVER. Super frinedly, upbeat, and always has a smile on his face. always willing to help,great positive personality. TONS of extra credit, can't leave this class without an A or B.",1
He's I really good professor and explains the concepts well. He won't move along until everyone understands the concepts. I would definitely take a course with him again.,1
"Professor Johansen is a very intelligent,capable,knowlegeable in the subject in which she instructs, learned a lot about myself and about the mental health profession, she is very encouraging about students continuing their education, absolutely loved her class, you have to do the work, nothing comes easy but she is helpful",1
Very supportive and inspires the student to give one's own opinion. Very understandable and pleasant.,1
She is a good prof for theology. I recommend her. She is very understanding and sweet. If something happens in your life and you can't get something done she is there to help and problem solve.,1
Really cares about her students.,1
"Great professor! The course in general is designed to be hard, lots to memorize. She gives all the powerpoints needed and on Zoom, explains them very well. Other than that it's up to you to study and memorize, don't just study the powerpoints, STUDY THE TEXTBOOK CHAPTER IMAGES, it on the practicals!! Great prof tho, good at explaining + answering!",1
"Very understanding professor. Class is difficult, but going to office hours helps tremendously. Tests are mainly based off of class powerpoints, but she may have a few questions about the textbook chapters. Tests are all multiple choice. 4 tests given and a 4-part project.",1
"If you like Cam from Modern family you will love Professor Humphrey! His lectures are so informative and interesting. He is funny, and so passionate about his job. I would take this class again in a heartbeat. You get 3 absences before it effects your grade. Assign: A book report, Relationship essay, 4,000 word journal, 1 group project and 3 tests.",1
"Dr. Zbeida is a true gem, she makes it possible to get an A in her class. There will be a lot of essays, but you can revise them and get as high as a 100 easily. The syllabus is always followed, and there is not a final, just a final portfolio, which is simple to complete!",1
"Ive taken a few of her classes, if you do the work you pass but she is a very frustrating professor. Since she is an abstract artist, she wants every piece to be abstract (regardless of the prompt) and will change your idea herself to suit what she thinks is good. She also plays favorites and can be rude at times. Worst art teacher Ive ever had.",0
"He is a relatively straightforward teacher, but some of the lectures can get boring and uninspired at times.",1
I had Dr. Gelderloos in the 1970's and I consider him to be a great teacher.  I am in my 60's and he had a real impact on me in regards to how important it is to preserve our environment. One of the best professor's that I ever had.,1
"Lectures were riddled with mistakes, annoyed sighs at any question, and a bad internet connection. Refused to acknowledge her poor internet connection even though her RECORDED lectures had plenty of evidence. Make sure you check your graded work because she's careless and makes mistakes on everything. Easy class if you read the text and practice",0
MY FAVORITE TEACHER Always so helpful and she turned a subject that absolutely bored me into my favorite class of the semester. It's a lot of homework and classwork but she's very fair with tests and as long as you keep up with your work its an easy A.,1
"Dr. Dean Atkinson is the best Chemistry professor I have ever met: His exams reflect the practice given, and he clearly wants his students to succeed. (Unlike many of the professors.)  If you are reading this, Dr. Atkinson, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR AN AMAZING TERM!!!",1
"Miranda is the worst teacher I have ever had. She is rude when asked questions, likely because she doesn't know the answer herself. Her slides are useless and incorrect (noticed an error in her slides and she told us to assume they were wrong). The only thing you will learn from this class is how to resent her and how neat she thinks diatoms are.",0
"It took me several weeks to embrace Dr. Weiner's style. Once I did, I learned SO MUCH. He's a radical thinker and very passionate about his role. It is advisable to get on his good side right away, by TAKING NOTES, participating in class discussion (when you can get a word in during his LONG lectures), and reading the assignments!",1
"I took Professor Wade for Summer 2019 Fundamentals of Networking and it was a great and easy online class. The structure was laid out perfectly and there was opportunity for extra credit. The book didn't help much with Subnetting in my opinion, some things I am more of a visual learner, but other than that great class and easy to follow! Thanks!!",1
Always seemed to be doing homework for his class. Most homework I have had in any class in my first 3 years. Considering this is a 100 level course I was not impressed.,1
This class is going to be hard in general so if you are going to take it take dr purser! He is a great teacher!! Very relaxed and funny. He is definitely interested in what he teaches and takes it very seriously. He does not rush through lectures and makes sure you understand the material. I would definitely take him again!,1
The biggest problem about him is that he does not give solutions to his HWs. This along with the fact that the TA's dont grade all the hws results in you only getting about a third of the answers to the home works. There just aren't enough examples in his notes to make up for this. ,0
"He is the best professor I have ever had, he values everyones opinion. This is the first professor that has ever made me feel comfortable to talk in the classroom. It is very discussion based and has made me learn a lot about myself. Take Mr. Reid if you can!",1
"He gives you a study guide well before the test/lab practicals and its pretty much exactly whats on the test. His labs are pretty easy and are VERY helpful to prepare for the lab pract. In lab you identify a bone, muscle, etc with a number and he'll just change the number for the test. For written tests as I said just know the study guide well.",1
ESL teacher hard to understand sometimes. He is very unclear with his assignment instructions. Even though he gives a hand out with instructions he renegs and modifies assignments week to week. His individual project is a time consuming task that is riddled with busy work. You will gain nothing from it. The group project is somewhat interesting.,0
"Unclear instructions given for projects. She is unwilling to help if you are having difficulty understanding. She taught a color theory class without using color, she would only verbally describe projects. She did not enforce any deadlines, so most students did not have their work done for critiques and she would critique unfinished projects.",0
professer Wider is an amazing professor who's passionate about what he does. his quizzes are very easy. He gives a quiz before every chapter so make sure you do the reading.,1
"Dr. Lanning was very straight forward in what he expected his students to understand for his exams. He was clear and concise during his lectures and utilized every portion of them by providing information pertaining to his exams and also what he thought was important to know about for future bio courses, pretty funny as well.",1
Great prof,1
Hands down best professor I've ever had. Pretty hard material but Professor Northrup was amazing at responding and helping you through at any time- even 2am. Hard tests but if you show you care about his class he helps you. I'm normally a B student but because of the amount of extra time he spent helping me learn material out of class got me an A.,1
"Professor Burrows is the best of the best. Take her class, you won't regret it. 10/10 recommend.",1
I DO NOT recommend her for Microbiology! She makes it very hard for no reason and expects you to just know everything. The lectures doesn't really help because it's pretty much the slides that are posted on bb. Exams are super hard! But she does curve at the end depending on the class average.,0
"Dr. Hollis is one of the hardest (but one of my favorite) professors I have had at Furman. His lectures are in-depth and fascinating, but his exams are equally as difficult. Be prepared to spend many hours making sure you understand the concepts AND the details that go with it. It is quite hard, but totally worth it.",1
This guys voice is SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND. I am Hispanic and I cant understand him. So bad. Everything is based off the PowerPoints but they are extremely long.,0
I am taking the hybrid course. The in class portion can be interesting because he has guest speakers come in every week. But the homework assignments are worthless busy work. You have to write about 1000+ words a week and you are expected to BS those 1000 words because you could get your point across for the assignments in about 150.,0
No Comments,1
The best professor I will ever have the pleasure to take at App. He's a perfect teacher who genuinely values everyone's opinion & takes advantage of the class to learn with you. Great conversation inside & outside the classroom. He works hard to make all material applicable to teaching & everything you learn is life-changing.  Take. His. Class.,1
"Amazing teacher, truly loves his job",1
She uses inappropriate examples in class and tries to push her political beliefs on students while teaching totally unrelated topics. This is very distracting and unprofessional.,0
"Professor AP is an amazing woman, you can tell she cares for her students honestly one of the best English professors ive ever had, just do all your work and you'll be fine",1
"She is great! She doesn't believe in paying for class material so she uses articles for the readings(so no expensive textbooks). She also knows its a gen required class, so she makes it easy & entertaining with contemporary issues. She is also really nice, helpful and caring for her students. Class discussions are key/fun/helpful for tests.",1
"Some would consider her class hard, but for me it wasn't too bad. She can be hard on the grading but only if you don't put in the effort. She is quick to respond to emails, and gives good feedback. There is a good amount of homework but it isn't very hard if you're used to it. The syllabus is very clear on instructions. Overall, good professor.",1
His instructions are confusing.,0
The best proffesor at UW I would say I was scared of coding but he made me like coding very apporachabke resubmission saved me the quizzes you could retake them as many times as you want before the deadline cant give me enough rating since 5 is too small. So sad for him to leave UW and take his career else where rare proffesor you would ever come,1
"You are graded with 25% online homework (difficult) , 10% written homework, 40% midterms (only 2 midterms, each having 2-3 qestions, hardest versions of problems), and 25% the final exam (difficult). The class average at the end of the semester is failing however he is scaling so the class MEDIAN is a B- but a class average should not be failing!",0
"If youre good at memorizing, take him. His tests are solely based off few things from the horribly boring book he assigns and random things he says in lecture. Pay attention and youll make an easy A. He truly wants you to succeed in life. Hes very awkward at times which is funny. Too bad you have to show up since his class is easy.",1
I never understood logarithms until Alisa explained them to me. She take the time to sit down with you and go over things until you understand. Very patient and breaks things down step by step. Great professor!,1
Her method of teaching is excellent.,1
In three years at BYU-Idaho Katie Derby is the best and most down to earth professor I have had. She gives great tips for the research work and then reviews different sources that were available and where to find them after the project is over. If this is your program I would seek out Katie Derby for any classes.,1
"Hauck is definitely the best prof to have for this class. His expectations are clear and he does not require much homework if any. He is helpful in the lab and often lets you out early for lecture and lab. Beware, he does talk very fast in lecture, but he does try to bring humor into class.",1
"I dont know why he has such a low rating, he isnt even that bad. I was worried about taking him cuz it seemed like he was hard but that is not the case. His lectures are clear and his quizzes and test are based off of homework. I passed with an A, and it wasnt difficult to do so.",1
I love his class! Very into the discussions and actually knows what he is talking about. He is a great advisor too. I have his night class and I don't even mind it. Take him whenever you get the chance.,1
"She was amazing, one of the best teachers or professors I've ever had. lectures make good sense and helps a lot to understand the material",1
Very enthusiastic and gave clear and excellent presentations. Young guy so he is able to relate well to the students. Definitely recommended!,1
"Amazing Professor, really cares about his students. Does anything he can to help.  The extra practice problems helps a lot, he even provides powerpoints  on how to use the calculator. Would take if again, if he thought any other math courses. Textbook not really needed but it helps, no homework.",1
"I genuinely felt sorry for him. Absolutely no one pays attention to him and he basically lectured to one person the entire semester. People sign attendance then leave. However he is soooooo sweet and so understanding. The tests are online with no lockdown browser. I would definitely suggest him, also suggest being nice to him.",1
Great teacher and also easy on the eyes!,1
"Assigns on average 8 hours of homework per week for a 2 credit course, and just rescheduled an exam to the day before it was supposed to happen, with 2 hours of notice.",0
She teaches VERY fast and you have to keep up with her. if you ask a question she absolutely will stop and listen and do everything to help you. if you get a question wrong on the board that she asks you she'll look at you like your'e crazy and single you out and make sure you get the right answer. Asigns a large amount of homework but never checks,1
"best professor ever!!! excellent knowledge about he is teaching, many years of experiences :)",1
I felt like I was in elementary school again in Tami's class. Graded on organization (I felt like I should have the best judgement on how I decide to organize). She also moved our seats around at one point- I haven't had that happen since high school.  We had a ton to cover and very little time to do so.,0
"Absolutely wonderful professor. IDE was the best part of my day, and Beato is very good at teaching it. Not only is he super helpful in labs, but he really cares about his students. I had a bad lab partner, and Beato was very accommodating even when I just needed to vent. This was my favorite class as a CE student.",1
"I really enjoyed Dr. JSC's intro to US government class. She cares so much about her students and wants us to be successful, academic wise she has high expectations, but will 100% help if you ever need it. Buy the textbook and read, it will make her lectures easier to follow. Overall I would take her class again!",1
"The amount he expects you to read is unrealistic, impossible, and actually humorous. He is obsessed with reading competency, very odd . He sends a 3 page letter explaining why he is such a hard grader. I am bummed hes the only on I could take for this course. Awful..",0
"i don't agree with the last review, his class is beautifully unstructured. there's no standard syllabus, but he makes clear the material to be covered in the course. as long as you generally keep up with the readings, you will be perfectly fine. he explains everything extremely well and is very open to questions. he uploads utube vids, gives notes",1
LOVE HER!! She is definitely one of the best at TCC. Super fun and easy going. Her tests are superrrr eassyyy!!! And she is really understanding! Take her. Dont take anybody else but her.,1
"She is a great professor i learned so much from her class! She teaches in a much more visual way than most profs, which is great! Her tests will kick your ass, but it's worth it!",1
"Very passionate, easy class",1
"This class wasn't too hard, but it wasn't what I expected. First half is about sociology and second half is about marketing. Every week, you have a quiz and a 300-word reflection. Readings are long. Wanted us to buy a book for the second half, but I found the texts I needed online. Found all the quiz answers online. Final is open now too.",1
"Very Great teacher, had him in high school. very thorough. Explains things to the T, highly recommended",1
During the class we gave a few speeches -- we did not receive any feedback and the grades were posted minutes after giving the speech (indicating there was no true thought process behind the grade). Mr. Gentry could be quite harsh with students and there were times I felt uncomfortable being in the classroom. It was an okay class but was not great,1
"While he may have +40 years of math experience, his teaching style is if he says it you should understand it.  Further, if you ask questions his answers will include a hint of you learned this in an earlier math class. He goes really fast. In class assignments are developed by him with errors and his problems don't lineup with the textbook.",0
He is extremely helpful,1
"Dr. Judson is such a nice teacher. Her class consisted of a presentation (super easy ppt you make), quizes that were only 10points that were on the readings she assigned the week prior, and then 2 tests with an optional final. She offers 10pts EC at the end. It was hard to get anything but an A in her class. TAKE HER if you want an A!",1
"There are a lot of homework assignments and quizzes. You can self-teach; watching video lectures is unnecessary. I received a C because I am not strong in math and did not take this class as seriously as I should have. As long as you put in the effort and do all assignments, you will do well. Some quizzes, homeworks, and poppers are dropped at the end.",1
"Great teacher! A good amount of quizzes and assignments, but they are spaced out so you aren't overwhelmed with work. It's an easy online course.",1
An amazing professor. I honestly wish he taught all of my courses. Gotta love Dr. Bob.,1
"make sure that you do the worksheets before coming to class; reading the chapters in the book helps a lot. The final is cumulative so make sure you study everything in order to commit it to memory. He rants during class, youll just have to tough it out. Not an impossible class to pass; I have a 98% as of right now. Study & Do the worksheets.",1
"Amazing teacher and woman. If you get her, you are a lucky guy. Just show up and show respect to her and you're in there.",1
"Fun class, easy grade.",1
She's inexperienced and it shows. She doesn't know how to give a good writing assignment or run a class. Her grading process is absolutely nuts!!,0
He is really nice and friendly. He gives everyone a fair grade. I had the class 4 times a week in the morning but it wasnt that bad. Gives homework and labs to help with grades. He is a very understanding teacher.,1
This class by far the worst class that I have ever taken at this college. Be prepared to stay up till 4 am 4 nights in a row studying for her quizzes and tests. I have seeked help from her and a tutor multiple times and neither were help at all. I feel she sets us up for failure. She takes forever at the beginning then goes physco at the end. awful,0
"WSBE is lucky enough to have him. Hassey adapts his teaching style & expectations to the level of the class, and even requests feedback on what went well and what he could do better.  Highly recommended.",1
"I really liked Prasad but I gave her a 3 because she doesn't explain directions, the tests and reviews are nothing alike, and before tests, she has students teach the test materials. The problem with that is half of the students don't care about teaching the materials so you don't effectively learn them. She's pretty good, but maybe not the best",1
Very hard course but he knows a lot about what he is teaching so you will actually learn. ,1
"I liked Dr. Perez so much that I'm taking another one of his classes even though I don't need the credit. He is extremely objective/honest. He might seem tough at first but he is super nice and is worth talking to outside of class. He assigns a good amount of reading but it's all relevant and helpful to you, no busy work. I highly recommend him.",1
hes not that good of a teacher. he cant teach at all,0
His lectures aren't exactly lectures he does I Clikers and uses those examples to lecture. The homework that is assigned does not go relate to the weekly Monday quizzes. Which makes it really hard to pass his class.,0
His Australian accent is awesome,1
"She gives you the majority of the notes and you never use your book. However, she will keep you late every class cause she doesn't have a concept of time.",1
Doesnt explain things very well...,0
"great professor, opens your mind up to being creative when its so early you think it is still asleep. people definitely take advantage of his niceness though, take him...go to class...participate...it will be a great experience for you.",1
"Amazing professor, if I could take one of his classes a third time I would! Very helpful and funny, makes sure you know the information and very helpful when it comes to being confused on things. He takes the time to help you and is willing to work with you on anything!!",1
TONS of homework. I felt like I couldn't really approach her because she seems kind of tough. Never took any quizzes but the tests were super long. Very detailed syllabus and she expects nothing less than the best. I believe she helped me out in the end to pass the class but I would not take again. I struggled in this class,0
"This was supposed to be about literary study and instead I got stuck with learning about love and hate and society which was weird. The books she chooses are dumb, she's a hard grader, she's very unorganized and I just didnt get what her point was.",0
Just so very very bad. Absolutely no pride or respect put into the course it will destroy your college career take somebody else stay away from Professor Thompson. So boring Not very informative pretty much one of the worst slapped together courses Ive ever seen. Just so awful its beyond words.,0
"Love that teacher, however it was the hardest class I've ever taken. Lots of quizzes. Lots of tests. Grades really hard. And he expects students to memorize everything just as he has, but he doesn't take into account that this is only a level 1 class. Wouldn't take it agai. ",1
He is very accommodating to the circumstances of COVID. The online format was very well done. He asks some tricky questions on the exams (you have to actually learn the material). He also gives an extra credit opportunity.,1
"One of the best professors at Rutgers that actually teaches. He is there to help his students through email, office hours, etc. He sends many emails. Make sure you read them because they are VERY helpful. His notes and practice problems are very detailed. Do his practice problems and you'll be guaranteed to pass chem.",1
I would take this professor and this course again. She's the best professor for CHEM111 that you'll ever have! I highly recommend.,1
"She makes Chemistry EASY. Print power points, read them before class, and you will have no problem following along and passing. Exams are easy if you study power points. She presents material in a way anyone can understand, builds upon material to the next subject which is helpful, and very laid back. Extra credit opportunities. Homework is rare.",1
"I came into this course very nervous, through what past students have told me. At first it was very easy and I thought I was getting the hang of it. She didn't tell me what I really did wrong on my essays and told me ""it was a good piece of writing"". She ended up failing my final portfolio, and told me I didn't fix what she told me to. Do not take",0
A gentle giant. You basically read the textbook cover to cover so you'll get your money's worth. Discussion questions assigned each class and fosters participation. Has a large paper and the end of the term which is standard. What's nice is he will give you the grade as long as you put the work in aka all the DQs and class participation etc.,1
"Prof R is great! Put in effort and it's an easy A. Lets test corrections, caring. Cancelled 2nd project because we were all busy. Super easy... HW due day of test and only graded for completion. Really cares about students, super understanding if you can't show up for class once or twice. Put in effort, you'll do great! IT'S WORTH IT! TAKE HIM!!",1
She helped me a lot on my papers out of class.  I learned a lot from the comments on my papers.,1
Was the class difficult? No. Was there work involved? Yes. Was it an easy 'A?' No.,1
"Gray is like that grandma that you kinda avoid because she pinches your cheeks. If you don't show up to class (attendance stated not mandatory), you will miss the in class assignments and cant make them up. Her tests are easy if you glance at the power point, book, and highschool biology, Mid term is a take home test during spring break. Forum too.",0
"Professor Wood is an amazing lecturer, she works with, even if you are a dummy, she pushes you,",1
"Professor Ikegwuonu is a very smart lady, who is very passionate about what she teaches. She gives good feedback and is always emailing the class. However she has no idea how to use technology and she forgets to give you assignments until the last two weeks of class. Other than never knowing when you have work, the work she gives is east.",1
"Class can be tough, but if you do the readings then you're fine.  The labs are definitely exhausting, but you learn a lot in a short period of time.",1
"The worst professor I have ever had. He does not care about the online class at all, does not answer emails or messages. Do whatever you have to do to avoid taking him.",0
"He will quickly scribble a list of ""how-to"" instructions and while your trying to catch up on writing he just explained 3 other things you have no chance of understanding anymore. He doesn't allow the student time to absorb. You may only see one example per topic. If you heard it one time and took your notes thats good enough for him. Sink or swim.",0
"Mrs. Langill is the WORST teacher ever. She is completely unorganized, she will tell you to study one thing and then test you on another, she doesn't provide any help to you, you either get it or you don't.The material is hard enough, and she is completely useless as a teacher",0
"Dr. Mason is the perfect example of what good teaching is. He is organized, intelligent, consistent, articulate, and very passionate. Not only that, he shows his students respect and extends himself to ensure that you know how to be successful in his class. For me, Dr. Mason has made the UW-Stout Sci Educ program a great experience.",1
"Looney is a super funny guy and this class was really interesting. It wasn't a complete blow off, but it wasn't too bad. Just do all the homework/observation sessions and study a bit the night before exams and you should pull an A. I would definitely recommend him for a science gen ed. There was no text book and no final.",1
All the other comments are wrong.  He's very helpful and there aren't any 100 slide powerpoints. Teaches the material well and I reccommend taking him again! Nice guy overall.,1
"There is a bit of reading (15 mins/week). Quizzes are written from readings. Speeches are easy to write and pass. Slow paced class, so there is time for other responsibilities. 3 individual speeches done in discussion section (25 ppl), one group project done in front of big lecture hall. Note sheets allowed on every quiz. No final. VERY easy A.",1
Senora Logue is an amazing teacher. You can tell she is very passionate about teaching spanish. She makes class time fun and interactive. I would take her again in a heartbeat!,1
U are the best,1
"He is one of those teachers that makes you go home and watch videos on the topics and learn yourself. Then after you do that he reviews it during class. I personally would rather have my teacher teach the criteria and then I will review it with the homework they give us. He is kind and can help with some homework, but wasnt the teacher for me.",0
"I really enjoyed this class. Dr Pittman was an excellent professor. She gave frequent feedback on assignments and in a very timely fashion. You can tell she genuinely cares about her students! The course load was not heavy at all, very fair. She had clear guidelines on assignments but also answered emails of questions were asked. Fun class.",1
Ryan is honestly amazing!! You can tell he is very passionate about geology. He's ridiculously cool and easy going... a bro of a teacher if you will. He gives SO many extra credit opportunities and posts all of his lectures online. 10/10 would recommend &&& he has sweet tattoos.,1
"Dr. Schmurr made taking statistics class more interesting than any other math class Ive taken. He is very knowledgeable, and is very accessible, in class and over office hours. His lectures are engaging and understandable, and he has a good sense of humor. Would definitely take another class from him!",1
"The work load is RIDICULOUS!!! I dont think he understands that we have lives outside of schools. We have familys and jobs! his class alone takes at least 4 days out of the week worth of work! He's a great teacher and person, very helpful. You can really tell he likes his students however its not worth the stress!! I do not recommend.",1
"She is a great professor she explains this very clearly and very well!! Any professor for a math class can teach you to crunch numbers but do you actually understand what you are going and why? Prof. Chambers explains this very well is is clear about how you will be graded she will actually say, ""here is how you need to write it for full credit...",1
"He REALLY likes to ramble about lots of topics that have nothing to do with music. It was a lot of ""talking at you"". I was annoyed and didn't feel prepared for quizzes. I passed them because he posts the actual quiz on D2L for you to study from but really you can just memorize the answers. Hes real political and a ""attack/blame the government"" guy.",0
She is a very good Instructor.  She is tough on the tests and tough on assignments but clearly is getting you ready for the next level!  She will make it easy to understand and uses great examples.  If you read the book and study hard you will pass!,1
Tom is the best professor and teacher during my 2 years in DUKE.,1
"This instructor was awesome! He really cares about his students success, come to class and you can literally pass this class and be sure to participate. His grading structure is very good, he keeps you updated on your grade status. If you don't understand something he will make sure that you do. I would highly recommend Mr. Ball! Excellent Teacher!",1
"He taught the special topics course at the University (typically small) and was such an excellent professor that they changed both of these courses to permanent (Env. Phys & Endocrinology). Extremely fair professor (25% weighting for all assessments), is very clear with information, and very helpful. Loved to learn in his classes. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",1
Long boring lectures that no one but a math genius would understand. If you are average or a below average math person do not take this professor under any circumstances! As others have pointed out she is never available during office hours and is extremely rude when you ask a question.,0
"Open book exams. The class is hard no matter who you take. His lectures are dry and were painful to sit through. I couldn't learn from his lectures but that's partly just my learning style, I rarely learn from lectures. Homework and quiz due every week. He's a nice guy but will def call you out if you're not paying attention. Would take him again.",1
"Professor Ball is a great teacher. Goes over math problems step by step ,and before doing so give you motivation to stay calm and not worry if we can't fully understand the problem and how it works. He is willing to work it out until everyone has full understanding. He is definitely the best Math Professor I have ever had.",1
"In regards to personality, Dewey does like to throw in jokes which may or may not work, but he realizes that and isn't afraid to laugh @ himself. He looks a bit like Paul Rudd too. He'll answer your q's, help you set up for a presentation, no homework but he grades hard on speeches. On the upside, you do peer evaluations which count for easy points",1
"I loved this professor, although he does grade harshly. He is easy to see outside of class and truly does care about his students. He is funny in class and has homeworks and small assignments to bring up your grade if you do not do well on an exam.",1
"s'good  Dowding is really funny and nice. He is a hard grader and assigns a lot, but I have learned so much from his class. Definitely recommend him for 331 if you actually want to learn, but be prepared for lots of assignments. 10/10 recommend",1
"I had Prof. Dempster my first semester here. The class was not that difficult as long as you did the weekly reading quizzes/assignments. Compared to several of the other economics 101 facility, he is the least strict, and it is easy to do well in his class. Always available and willing to talk about assignments and the material. Highly Recommended",1
"She is one of the smartest professors I've had at OSU. She is great to learn from.  Her lectures can feel long at times, but the material covered  in lectures are imperative for her tests. In my experience, she is a fair grader as long as you follow her expectations and rubrics. I would highly recommend taking her for WIC course requirement.",1
GREATEST CLASS EVER! If I could take his for every class I would. He is simply a fantastic teacher. He kind of reminds you of your grandfather that you star gaze with. Fantastic professor!,1
"I never really struggled with the content in this class, so I cant exactly say what a struggling student would experience with this prof. However, she seemed very willing to help her students. She always responded promptly to emails she sent, and she gave partial credit on exams/quizzes also. If you have an A or B, you can exempt the final.",1
"LOVE PROFESSOR OAKLEY OMG. Literally the nicest professor at UD, she's just like a mom. She understands most students who take her class are not GEO majors. She has power points which she explains well & also puts online. Her exams are online but the essays are written. There's no homework besides these models u can do for extra credit. TAKE HER!",1
Professor Perez is an amazing professor. Present information clearly and logically. Lectures reinforce reading. I would take him again.,1
Kelsey is a great professor. She went to ecu and graduated from the comm masters program recently. There is 2 group assignments and they're both fun and easy. All the papers are easy and she gives clear feedback so you can do even better on the next paper. Definitely recommend.,1
Professor Kegler is an all around amazing guy. I highly recommend the class even if you are done with your fine arts requirement. As long as you show up and show progress on the piano you'll definitely ace the class.,1
"Prof McMillen is the best COB 300 teacher in my opinion. Idk why but I want to do well in his class to impress him. DO NOT SLEEP ON THE TESTS, they're pretty hard. But, he tells you what to focus on and the best way to study and it works. Great experience for my only marketing class",1
Tests are easy if you do the take home test and review test (he only changes the number in class test) there are 2 easy assignments and like 3-4 homeworks and you need the textbook to do the homework. He is the best and easiest professor! Take him and get an A+,1
"At first I thought she was mean and honestly kind of scary, but after awhile you warm up to her. She is a hard teacher, but one of the better ones I have had. She really lets you experiment with your writing, which made the class really fun for me. Overall I had a really good time in the class!",1
He's is a really nice guy but his class is way too hard. The quizzes are doable but his tests are impossible if you are not a naturally born history person. I was a 4.0 student in high school and ended up with a C in the class (my only C). Avoid his class if possible but if you must take his class DO ALL THE EXTRA CREDIT OPPORTUNITIES.,0
"He glosses over a lot of basics, but he's happy to explain if you ask.  He tries to keep lectures down to the bare minimum, so definitely ask for more explanation if you need it.  He is extremely clear about what he expects to see 'show your work' wise on tests and quizzes, and he isn't too nit picky.",1
"I loved class with Prof. Walker. She knows the material, makes it funny, caring and, understanding of her students. Also, the material isn't that tough either. She is very accommodating of late work and deadlines but don't make it a habit.",1
"He is a great teacher. He has powerpoints available online for you to use. No quizzes or tests. The only work includes a journal, a group project, and daily discussion boards. He is VERY good at communicating. He will always answer your questions that you ask him.",1
Absolutely AWFUL professor. I have no idea how she still has a job. All she does is put her students down because we're not experts in microbiology. Lecture is pointless because you have to read the book if you wanna pass her exams which are extremely difficult. She is very condescending and no help at all. Do well in lab and you'll pass,0
"Elaine was clearly born to be an English teacher. She teaches with such passion and you can tell that she really loves what she does and that she cares about her students a lot. Her assignments were really easy to follow, we did read a few novels and short stories but the readings were very doable. I love her, I wish I could take her class again.",1
Mr. Battaglia is the best professor at SUNY Fredonia. He will teach you to be a professional bowler in no time.,1
Mrs. Holmes is a great teacher. She is more than willing to help you if needed. She is one of the few math teacher who can make math fun. The only complaint I have is I wish she would give extra credit.,1
"He is a current PHD student so this was his first semester teaching, over all a great guy and good professor. He knows the material and is willing to take the time to explain any questions you have. 3 exams, 1 project, attendance not mandatory. Passed with an A. ",1
"Best prof I've had so far at IU. She's really passionate and brings that to her teaching, but can be rude at times. You spend most of the classes watching special features and I found that a lot of fun. The hardest part is the final project. Do not procrastinate on that. I was up until 6 in the morning working on it.",1
"Two weeks into class I dropped out because I had no time to complete my other assignments whatsoever. Lots of reading, lots of writing, and shes a tough grader. She will call you out in class. She does less teaching, and more talking. Will cite someone for plagiarism without warning. Everyone struggled. She had 30 students, then dropped to > 15.",0
"Physics 140 is a weed out, so take it with dr, mike. He does care about his students and he is super funny. The class can boring and he knows that, he tries his best. He has alot office hours, esp. the week before an exam. It's really to reach him by email, he won't respond. There's no mwrite or flipit physics . for his section.",1
"Easy but boring class. Just sit in the front, laugh at his jokes and act interested and you'll pass. Hes a really sweet guy, though he tends to go on and on about Ghana. His lessons can seem a little scattered but he always gives study guides. No reason to get less than a B.",1
Great professor. Loved her classes.,1
"Basically it was like he was speaking a different language. Him and his ""games"" were a waste of time. I just stopped going and went off what I learned in HS and passed. Get Busch instead, the difference is like night and day.",0
Great teacher takes the time needed to make sure you get the material,1
helpful in improving writing skills,1
Due dates must be followed. very easy to talk to. Knows her stuff!,1
No Comments,0
Super cute. Super nice. Lots of boring text book readings but if you do them you'll get an A. Saw him a lot for office hours and he was very helpful.,1
"She is one of the sweetest and funniest women I have ever met. She knows everything and everyone. Listen to her when she shows you what classes to take in order to graduate/transfer. She is a great counselor! Yes, she cares and take about Puente a lot. I don't blame her, Puente Program is great and I'll forever be grateful for her and the program.",1
He posts very clear and helpful lecture notes that give you all the formulas and procedures you need. His tests rely on memorizing facts or procedures. Very nice guy overall.,1
"One of Queens College's greatest professors! Take his courses only if you are interested in the topic. Depending on the course you will spend great times in the field, which you should desire. Tests are completely fair as he fully prepares you for them in advance. He teaches biology at its most hands-on and humane, with a nice touch of humor.",1
Professor Lee has been a great teacher and is very cooperative but the only problem I faced was that he was not very much frequent with his replies to the emails. But otherwise he is a great teacher.,1
"Dr. Capper is by far one of my favorite professors on campus. He is extremely helpful, and genuinely takes the time to help out his students. I wish I could take every class he offers. We had several papers to write, but all were easy. If you show up to class, and try to learn, you will make a good grade.",1
AMAZING..... I am so bad at math. With the homework and extra credit he gives it makes it easy to do well in his class. As long as you are willing to do the work he is willing to help you along the way. He is always upbeat and greets you with a smile. take his class and you will get a great grade.,1
"I have never meet anybody like Ted Stephenson. He is truly the GOAT. Not only he is willing to help you succeed in his course. He is also willing to help students succeed in other courses as well. Any new students taking Financial Planning, Consumer Behavior, Financial Technology or Bank Financial Intermediates. I strongly recommend to take him.",1
"Professor Dominguez is a great instructor. He might be a little strict and a tough grader, but if you try your best and go in there ready to learn you should be fine. Many students dont recommend him because you have to read a lot or because of the essays but how else will you learn! You should want to earn you grade rather that just receive it!",1
"This professor was amazing this semester. She goes out her way to help you the best way she can for understanding the math problems. Clear and precise solutions, I would advice anyone to take her class, you will not regret it.",1
"I thought this class was hard, maybe because I didn't understand his teaching. Don't take him, he is a jerk. He is always right...according to him. He failed everyone in our midterm because we didn't have enough detail, I wrote paragraphs for each question!! Anyways, don't take me.",0
Exams are very difficult. Very hard grader. Not very understanding.,0
"Most of class time is correcting him on the math because he doesnt know it well. He does not explain how or why an answer was right or wrong. The professor would tell us to check the online the textbook instead of teaching us in class. The professor does not curve grades, even when all of the class failed a test.",0
No Comments,1
Erica makes you work for your A. Go to lecture and take notes. Do the readings. Clarifies very well during office hours. I enjoyed the class very much. Very interesting content. Makes exams from study guide she provides. Use them Don't be afraid to ask questions and for help when needed. Has a lot of common phrases that she repeats during class.   ,1
"The only reason students take Dr. Jones for genetics is because she is the only one who teaches genetics (most of the times). Nobody I have ever met has anything good to say for her at all. Her arrogance is all over her face, the way she talks, and the way she answers your questions. Why do I need to buy Tophat when I just spent $250 buying books?",0
Not very intresting. Reads off powerpoint. Often gets things wrong. Exams are difficult.,0
Very kind professor. Always willing to stay after class to help you out.,1
"If I had the option to describe this class in one word... it would be HORRIBLE. Tests are super hard, attendance is MANDATORY so if you miss three or more times, you're down to an 80% for attendance. She is not helpful and gives horrible lectures. I would NOT recommend her whatsoever. Save yourself and do NOT take the course with her",0
"Unclear, doesn't explain what he wants, then gets angry after the fact, not very helpful, seems disinterested in seeing his students succeed. Misses classes. All over the place in lectures, goes off on tangents. Biased with marking. Very knowledgeable, just not a good teacher.",0
didn't learn a thing!,0
Great professor!,1
He was great,1
"David is awesome, you will love this class",1
"Dr. Fontenot is a brilliant man.  However, he's incredibly intolerant when it comes to others' opinions and monopolizes the class discussions.  I don't recommend him, but if you must take him, just try to keep your mouth shut and do what he says.",0
"Her lectures are useless. She points at models and babbles off a whole list of anatomical terms leaving everyone confused. Her quizzes invoke anxiety because you have to answer 1 question in front of the whole class. The cadavers are cool, but she tricks you on the practicals. That makes her lab very hard to do well in, very frustrating.",0
"Professor Pangallozzi is a knowledgeable professor, but I felt the class was disorganized. She was definitely very busy and was not easy to get in touch with. This class was online, the course might be more organized in person.",0
"VERY unprepared - shows up a little late but the powerpoint he just reads off then has you do the example. The answer to it is not available online. Tells you to put everything in calculator in 1 go and wouldn't go over your work really. Homeworks are LONG, if you don't know how to use R, he don't either. Doesn't put in grades timely at all.",0
Professor Z is a good teacher but this class is definitely not an easy A. She is a harsh grader and can sometimes be too harsh of a grader. Do not take her course if you don't want to put the work in. I had an A for pretty much the entire semester but then it went down to a B because she started grading harder. Do not take her!,0
"MSE 260 is probably one of my least favorite classes, but it is taught by one of my favorite professors. He always tries to make what is a very useless and boring class fun and at least a little entertaining. He is clear about what is on the tests (though the tests are still fairly difficult) and does plenty of in class examples.",1
"Nice lady, but i didn't think she taught very well when it came to Math. I'm taking her again just because her time slot fits my schedule but i would much rather have someone else that fit my learning style. On the nicer side, math is math so if you dont learn from the teacher, maybe youll learn from a tutor. Best of luck! She's very nice though.",0
The best professor I ever met he not only professes the truth.. He has taught me about life. I learned about Sociological Perspectives and more.,1
"Prior to taking this class, I've never made a B in college. She doesn't teach during class but instead talks about world events like others have mentioned. Grades excessively hard on essays and isn't available for office hours when you need help. AVOID.",0
One of the most interesting history classes I've taken and she really cares about the stuff shes teaching.  She is really enthusiastic and spends alot of time with you outside of class if you want it.,1
"Professor Krusko is an excellent teacher.  She is clear, helpful, and that makes the material very easy to understand. She is very learned in the Anthropology field, and it is no wonder that she is the department head.",1
"Dr. Besing is one of the best professors I've ever had. He's always willing to help you outside of class, and while his classes are a lot of work, you'll get a lot out of them if you're willing to do it. His lectures are very high value, and really worth attending. His sense of humor is unique, but he can be funny. Occasionally.",1
Glenn is great. The only thing is that no one likes 3 hour lectures. He is funny and really good at explaining concepts. He prepares you exceptionally well for his exams.,1
"Terrible. Does not show you how to do anything. One of those teachers who tries to be your friend. Homework is all online. Makes you do packets in class while she walks around ""helping"". If you are in a MWF short class you will be lucky to get one question in. Overall a terrible teacher for physics and you are better off teaching it to yourself",0
"Caruso is incredible! He loves to make class fun and engage with his students. Participation is huge, but he makes the environment of the room easy to discuss your opinion in. 321's, Oral presentation, Mid-term and attendance are the only grades. If you show up and listen you will pass. I wish he taught more classes because I would take him again!",1
I love Dr. Burras and will take more classes with him in the future. He cares about all of his students and genuinely wants you to succeed in his classes. Willing to answer questions and willing to discuss grading on assignments and exams. A great professor overall.,1
"The irony of taking Sociology online was not lost on me.. She was really nice and instructions were clear. She teaches a lot of sections, so it takes a while to get grades. As long as you follow the deadlines, it's super easy to get an A.. Quizzes and textbook are through Norton, discussion boards on Blackboard. Exempt from final w/A grade in class",1
Tom is the reason I started to love math ;),1
"Dropped, do not recommend. You will not learn anything from this prof. How he became a prof is beyond me.",0
"Great professor, lectures are easy to follow. The textbook is only for the homework so you don't really need to buy it as long as you follow the in class powerpoints. Pretty lenient grader, Pay attention and study a little and you will get an easy A.",1
"Rachick is a really good professor. While he has an attendance policy it isn't strictly enforced, however, with this class, the more you show up, the more you learn. He seems a little mean sometimes, but as the semester goes on you'll see that he's actually a really great professor and a great guy.",1
"Best professor ever.  In the whole world.  I've been in university for 6 years and never had a prof even close to him in  terms of intelligence, clarity, sense of humour, making the course interesting.  Awesome all around  - just cancel the Prof of the Year award and give it to him every time (which I think he probably gets anyway).",1
"She's always nice, polite, and ready to help others. Marna is always clear in giving feedback. Very welcoming towards students willing to learn.",1
Seiously...easiest course and this prof returns your email ASAP and easy marker...GUARANTEED !!!,1
Hardest class I ever took! I dont know how people do well in this class. So much to read! I read multiple times and took notes on everything and would still fail tests. He gives so many tests!!!,0
Professor Wisner is the best! Make sure to participate in the discussions and turn in assignmentsessays in on time. Clearly states what is due at the beginning of the week so no confusions. :D I'm taking him again for ENGL1102. :-),1
would only recommend this class if you really enjoy journalism and I mean really enjoy it. The professor is very demanding of how he wants things done and there is a ton of writing for this class,0
YVETTE IS AN AMAZING PROFESSOR.  SHE KNOWS HER STUFF AND IS VERY ENTHUSIASTIC WHEN TEACHING. A VERY FRIENDLY AND APPROACHABLE PROFF. WHO IS VERY FUNNY AND CHEERFULL. I TOTALLY RECOMMEND HER!,1
"The class has about 12 labs, run by a different TA for each week. The lectures before the labs were very dry. Make sure you read the lab manuals to complete lab reports. The final exam was extremely difficult and no one expected it. Know everything about everything if you want to do well on the final and get an A in the class.",0
Michael is a great choice! He actually cares about you and your progress on your work. His lectures are amazing and explains things really well. If you have a question he can help. He also refers to the book you are suppose to get a lot. Attendance is mandatory for lectures so you know what to do.,1
No Comments,1
"Stop Reading This & Add Boyles's Class To Your Cart Now! Professor Boyles's main goal when teaching is to make student's better writers. His grading contract lessens lots of pressure because as long as you attempt to meet the requirements of the assignment, you will be given an A+. Best ENG 105 Professor out there!",1
tough class. Dr Anikovskiy wants you to do well if you're willing to work for it.,1
"Coolest dude. The topics He chooses for the essays are very straightforward. In class, 90% of the time there are group/class discussions. Sometimes he lectures but even if you don't fully focus on what he lectures, you will still understand the topic (it's true). the amount of essays don't even matter, he's a real easy grader. 4 pg essays minimum.",1
"professor Andrews , he is a good professor I like him and he is very easy .I like his class and I encourage other students to take classes with him.",1
Best ENC professor at BC!,1
"Honestly the most boring class i've ever taken, it may not necessarily have been all her fault as the materials are bland, however she doesn't make it interesting at all and it's very hard to pay attention to her.",0
"He is very helpful and makes chemistry understandable. If you are having any troubles with his class, he will help you as long as you ask!",1
"I love psychology with a passion but this has been by far the worst class I have ever taken. She is a sweet women but my goodness! I never even knew what my grades were because nothing was graded till the end of the semester, by that point I couldn't fix my errors on the next assignments. This was also a very unorganized.",0
"Expects brilliance. Pushes you to max if you don't let comments/grades discourage you. Picky. Cocky. Rarely gives compliments, but when you get one, you really earned it. Provides tips on writing you'll keep for lifetime. Writing papers (65%) is whole class. No readings! Still lots of analytical thinking. Ask for help even when he it's not offered.",1
"people say its hard to understand him , but for me it seemed like he was clear. Make sure you attend everyclass because if you miss one lecture u will be behind. His lecture notes matter because many stuff on the exam are from his notes. He also carves alot so make sure you do above average and try to do the home works on your own",1
Jana is a great professor! She makes the complicated concepts make sense and is always great at answering questions.  She is a very supportive professor and really cares about her students.,1
Class is essentially at your own pace. Easy A with minimal effort as long as you try. Content is not hard and you probably won't ever see/hear Squire now that the class is asynch. Great elective to take with harder CS core classes.,1
"Awesome- immense amount of insight, his classes are very entertaining- his study sessions are extremely helpful, his tests are reasonably easy (he gives you a full study guide on everything) He does not speak with a monotone- i have my own opinions about the person who said that previously- take him... he will give you an infatuation w/ sociology",1
"This guy is the freakin boss, man...He knows his stuff and he's a total bro. Unfortunately the class only counts as an I&E, but...man oh man. I learned so much. And if you're having trouble, just talk to him and his wife...they are so helpful and understanding. Def take this course if you're interested in the biz. You won't regret it.",1
"class is a joke, he gets side tracked on everthing but attendance is graded. Tests are easy, and he grades even easier. extra credit available on all homework and quiz points are also extra. you wont have to work hard but you wont learn anything either....overall waste of time and money",0
"Awesome arts teacher. He makes you work for your grade, and pushes students to critique each other so that we can all improve. It made me a lot more critical of my own work in a good way. Be sure to show up, you won't understand the assignments if you don't.",1
poor explanation,0
"Uncle Dennis! What can you say about Dennis, he really loves art and was very supportive and creative in the class. Never a dull moment. If possible I will take another course with him if possible.",1
"Dr. Hansen is the best- he tries to get to know the students which is great for networking. I took his soil science class and I loved how much passion he has for soil! Definitely do the reading and pay attention during lecture for your own benefit, but he doesn't mind if you fall asleep during lecture lol. Class takes effort, but not impossible.",1
His mid-term and final was hard!,1
Pretty easy if you do your work youll pass. Shes not the best teacher but shes not bad. Very flexible and nice. I didnt do most of my hw and passed.,1
"Also, pay attention to her previous semester's tests as she will base her exams on them, wink wink, nudge nudge ;) No way you can't get an A in her class ^__^",1
"Incredibly boring. I feel bad because she seems like a nice lady and she has an extremely good memory. She's very patient and always seems happy. Even the final was open book, answers come straight out of the text. The papers she assigns are kinda ridiculous, but again very easy.",1
"Dr. Jaja is very serious about her work and teaching. She is extremely knowledgeable and pushes you to fully understand soil science. Although, her class was difficult, I had a great experience learning about soil science.",1
"Well, she has an accent which makes it difficult to understand her at times but she is nice and helpful, so if you don't hear what she says, just let her know. She is sometimes a bit boring as well (or maybe it's the class that is boring).",1
"Awesome Professor. Replied to all my questions within a day. Willing to work with you to help you pass. Wants to see everyone succeed. There's a lot of homework, but it definitely helps you learn the material to pass the exams. The online class was really easy to stay on track with assignments.",1
I have a problem with him making us buy his book during class.,0
great professor! he explains the material very well and gives you chances to make up work best math professor by far,1
Impossible to understand. Rambles incoherently at times. Just read his slides and sign the attendance sheet and you'll be fine. Bring something to do in class though.,0
"This professor really knows what he's talking about when it comes to Theology, and I'm not going to lie, his lectures are interesting. But overall, for the average or even above-average student, you will have to work extremely hard to receive anything over a B. This is because he is a harsh writing grader, despite what most people are saying here.",1
Professor Wood is such a nice lady and Im so happy I took her class. She explains everything very well and makes class a nice discussion about everything. Do your work and try and she will reward you.,1
"Prof. Humphrey is excellent. Would definitely recommend taking his class. Lectures are long but very informative, you can tell he truly cares. A little goofy but it makes class interesting. 2 papers and 3 quizzes, plus the final. Also 1 group project that is fairly easy. As long as it's entertaining you'll get a good grade on it.",1
"A great professor, a professional software developer and a man of noble disposition. It was an honor to be his student.",1
"Attendance is important, tests are based on lectures and notes. Book was not required. Very little homework which means you have to do well on the tests to get a overall good grade. He is funny but his lectures can get boring if your not a soil enthusiast. I find the tests hard and the study guides are not very helpful.",1
"I took his class 4 years ago and this is my hardest class. It's not because the level is so high for me, it was teaching me how much I was recognizing and understanding the world and people around me. The greatest teacher, Mr. Lawson helped to open my mind!!! I am appreciated his smart and Stubborn sides.I WILL NEVER GIVE UP ON HIS CLASS..",1
"The soc class I took was ""Social Psychology of Inequality,"" a reading heavy, but fairly laid back course. As long as you get your work and reading done, it's an easy course. The professor does a good job of going over the material that we are required to read, adding to it. The homework and tests aren't too difficult.",1
"I think all of the comments have touched on the same thing with Hornsby. He is really nice. Tests were extremely hard as he tests items not covered in class. My suggestion is this, before and after each test and the project, go and visit with him. In class, he'll teach all over the place. In person, it's more directed. Nice guy and I learned A LOT!",1
Terrible attitude toward students. Unprofessional. Severely unorganized. I would avoid this professor completely.,0
Worst prof ever,0
Awesome professor. Highly recommend,1
"Dr. Ruesink is the teacher to take. He doesn't want anyone to fail his classes, in fact, he does everything possible to make sure you go great. There were 2 projects in his class which he helps out with and is an easy grader. ",1
The best professor Ive had at school so far. The nicest guy in the world and if you apply yourself he will go at great lengths to make sure you succeed.,1
"SOC 201 is interesting and, thanks to this professor, inspirational. I'm a conscientious student so I did a lot of studying to earn the A. There are good opportunities for extra points that actually help you study the material. Read the book, take notes, watch the videos, take quizzes. Can't wait for her SOC 222 as well. Join me!",1
"Professor Arranz is great. He is very passionate about what he teaches, he also talks about the Basque Country which sounds amazing. Please participate in the discussions in class or it will get awkward. He is very easy going and respectful. He wants the best for his students. Put in the work, participate and you will get a good grade.",1
"She does not communicate with students, does not give feedback, especially positive feedback. Will deduct points for ANYthing, and does not tell you much other than what you didn't do right. The topics and curriculum are very interesting but DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS. She is not a good professor at all.",0
"Amazing Professor. Cares about his students, grades fairly, and makes the class enjoyable.",1
"He's not very friendly, although great sense of humor and explains very well. Surprise quizzes that count as extra credit so make sure you read the lecture notes before going to class. Knows his material well. ",1
Young professor so he's really excited about teaching.  He tries to make it easy by having homework from connect online and the rest of your grade is tests.  Yu have to study for the test unless you know the material really well.  He's a very generous grader when it comes to essay questions but the tests are 90% made up of multiple choice.,1
"She gives great lectures, but be ready to have her political opinion shoved down your throat. Her hand writing on the board is unreadable, and unless youre willing to re-read the text book chapters in order to study, youll have a hard time doing well, as she doesnt give review sheets. If youre in need of an A like I was, look elsewhere.",1
Great teacher and really takes interest in her students. Workload is managable and she is a fair grader. There were a few writing assignments and quizzes and a discussion question each week. There was also a Proctored exam. You won't regret taking this class.,1
"takes attendance daily, you have two papers to write each week from the book but very easy, lots of extra credit opportunity. basically show up to class, do a few papers, easy A",1
"He's a nice guy, but his teaching style is super weird. No textbook, which means lots of reading of links off of BlackBoard. Complete every single question on the Problem Sets or no credit - just write anything in; he just checks to see you did it! All exams are open-ended. This is a course you really need to teach yourself.",1
"This teacher in her online class is relatively easy, there is just a TON of work that she gives out every week. Although I took the 8-week course, so maybe that's why it seemed so heavy, but it's easy work, just busy work. All the tests are online and easy to find and the book has all the answers. An easy A for your fine arts credit.",1
"I'm a senior and I had a 4.0 until this class. Take this class somewhere else. This is the worst prof I've ever had. She is low-key unprofessional. I have so many things to say about this prof... Just know her tests are crazy hard. On our second test the average was a 40. Good luck to anyone who takes her, you're going to need it.",0
She is young. Shes a good professor but shes strict on attendance and goes by the book. Dont expect to get let out early rarely ever. She explains pretty well but some things she explains are drawn out and then you get confused even more.,1
"Take notes everyday,pay attention when she is discussing what will be on midterm/final, use tutor on essays or have her proofread, read all assigned stories/poetry, great teacher! wants students to succeed, not a hard class if you take notes and write decent essays so get them done early and have her look at them.",1
"Very average math class. Not very exciting during class (you basically just go through long example problems), lots of textbook homework problems, quizzes on the homework and then a couple big tests. If you are good at math you'll be fine. If not expect a B. He takes a lot of points off for strange reasons.",1
"You will have to: A: Learn all material on your own, her lectures are not helpful, also a strong accent. B: Memorize the entire Calender: Her online scheduling is bad C: Not have any issues, Her email response rate is poor. D: Have the patience to do this for an entire semester, while worrying about your grade. Just find a new teacher.",0
"Dr. Norris is cool (for this class). There is a quiz each Monday but during his lectures, he will tell you exactly what is on it. He'll say, ""In the not too distant future, someone WILL ask you..."" There's a lot of information that you need to memorize but he makes it easy. Quiz every Monday, 1 midterm, 1 final & a paper... piece of cake.",1
Very cool teacher! Tests aren't too hard and she's very helpful. Her notes are all over the place though and it's hard to focus.,1
Easy class but tends to be rude and demanding when it is unnecessary. Just do the work and u pass easy A,1
"Tests are multiple choice pulled straight from quest with a few added questions thrown in, so lecture is actually insignificant because he often covers material that is not on the homeworks or tests. As long as you do the homework and review learning modules, you will do fine in this class.",1
"Lots of reading, and if you aren't good with structure his online class isn't for you. You have to be super organized in order to take this class, and be prepared to read  A LOT, material is rather hard and it may take you a couple times to read it to understand the material. Lectures are lengthy but make things clear. ",1
"The discussion posts are impossible. He has instructions that you can use ANY Source; Text, Videos, OR Outside source. But when he comments back he says that if you use an outside source you have to use the textbook too which makes no sense. Directions are super unclear. He makes the work more difficult then it needs to be. DO NOT RECOMMEND",0
"I want to love her, I really do. I can tell she cares about what she does , I appreciate that. However, the lectures are SO boring and she is the most disorganized professor I have ever had. She'll neglect to tell us something is due, and you have to try to throw something together at the last minute. Bought a $100 textbook, haven't used it once.",1
"If you are willing to work, hes willing to help. He makes his expectations known and is clear. Definitely take him",1
"Birkett is not very clear in her lectures and is kind of annoying to deal with. She's sweet but she's also a neurologist, so there's that. She is very helpful, going above and beyond to answer your questions, but make sure you study for exams, especially if they're make up exams. Clicker question days are random, also. Good luck.",1
He is an excellent professor. very fair and helpful.  Test are easy if you do the homework and the review.  4 test the lowest gets drop. Highly recommended.,1
"Dewey's a great teacher and was very enthusiastic about the class. He was very passionate about the topic and was big on making sure you were comfortable in class. He had us do group workshops to help write our speeches, where he was available for help as well. We only did a few speeches and a midterm which was a summary on a ted talk.",1
"Very clear instructor and very respectful of students and their work. Just show up to class, do the work and it won't be hard to get a good grade. The subject matter can be complex but she's always willing to help and reiterate. I learned tons and I feel like I hardly scratched the surface. Would definitely take her again.",1
"Great professor. If you're looking for a career in the sports industry and have any questions, you can go to her and shell give you the answer most of the time. Overall this class was fun and taught me a lot about what it takes to be a professional in the sports industry.",1
"Heyborne is, in my senior opinion, the best professor SUU has to offer.  He gets very engaged with his students and is very invested in his subject material. He was my very first biology professor my freshmen year, and I was lucky enough to have him again my senior year. He's the reason why I kept with it.",1
"Yea, what the guy below said. Stay away from professor nemat. he's ignorant, and he doesn't care about students learning. Everybody literally cheated, and he doesn't even know it. Dumb old dude.",0
"She is very nice, but too confusing and loves to go on rants.",1
Instructor Hebert is a very fair instructor. His course is very well put together. He knows his stuff and clearly explains everything. He makes the class worth taking.,1
"She has a very big pet peeve regarding students talking during class, but as long as you do well on papers and quizzes and stay on her good side, she's a good professor. She's almost always in a good, humorous mood which helps to keep students interested. Prepare to have reading assignments for homework almost every day and discuss them next class.",1
"This professor is way too hard to understand. He has a heavy accent and also goes way too fast for the average person, sometimes he even loses his self in the midst of the lesson. I do not recommend anyone to take this class. There is a good chance for an A if you can actually keep up with him, but other than prepare to fail.",0
He is a very kind and thoughtful teacher. He is so knowledgeable from graphic design to interaction design. I'm looking forward to take more classes with him.,1
"This class was super easy. There are two tests (both online with a lockdown browser, I took the test with friends from class) and two presentations (a 2 minute one and a 7 minute one). He lectures every class and it can be pretty boring.",1
"Awesome teacher! Really helpful, passionate about what hes teaching, and really wants to help everyone! If you can take his class you def should!",1
"He is the best! You can really tell he loves what he does, which is awesome! His lectures are clear and interesting. You have to read, but its helpful because he breaks the chapters up into about 10 pages per class. I highly recommend taking him he is an amazing professor!",1
"I am currently taking his course right now. Discussion boards are 2x/week, midterm, final and a paper. I did have to email him once about the weekly assignments which entails you reading the chap. and coming up with 3 questions and then answering the questions. The questions however cannot be surface questions. Overall I won't take him again!!",1
Bliss is tough but his classes are rewarding.,1
"Great guy, great class. Tests are extremely easy, you are allowed a piece of paper front and back to fill with information, and he tells you what will be on it. One homework assignment per week, only 150 words. He's funny and really loves what he does. Would definitely take his class again and wish he wasn't leaving Westfield :(",1
"The worst professor I've ever had in my life. There was probably close to 4 full books of reading for only a few questions on each test. He was really rude and immature during some times and was really unreasonable. Worst professor ever, do NOT take him",0
"Athar is a great guy, but terrible teacher. I don't want to be mean, but his accent is very hard to understand. He just hands out packets in class and expects you to teach yourself. He answers questions, but doesn't explain answers. His reviews for the exams are also lackluster.",0
"Very vague with grading criteria. Not clear whatsoever with grading and assignments. As a person who has never enrolled in a geography course prior, I would not recommend this instructor. Sobie grades hard and does not hold himself to the same standard. What a joke! This school should look into just how terrible their online instructors truly are.",0
"This was a class on The Bible and it's not very organized, but that's just his style. Classes are just huge discussions/debates on various Bible passages. The reading can add up, but there aren't many assignments. Only a few homeworks, a midterm, and a final. He's a funny and very interesting guy, but he tends to mumble so sit up front.",1
This was hands down the best class that I have taken here at Purdue. There are only 3 non-cumulative exams in the class that count for your entire grade and an extra credit opportunity during dead week. Shimko is an amazing teacher and I actually enjoyed going to class. Attendance is not mandatory but I attended as many classes as I possibly could.,1
"Took her in the summer and she was great! The enviorment and vibe is awesome in her class.  You do lots of class interaction and she makes it fun!  Do your work and ask quesitons, she's very smart and helpful.  She's also very understanding but at the end of the day you're in charge ofyourself. strongly reccomend! ",1
"Good teacher.  Very biased, very arrogant, but knows the material and expects you to know it just as well.  So if you're up for a challenge, he's the one to take.  If you don't like Organic, take someone else's class because you will suffer in his.",1
"Prof. Zaitsev is a wonderful! He is very passionate about his job and wants all his students to do well. He gives handouts for his lectures and is very organized. You know what to expect- no surprises in his exams. Labs are very interesting. Read his handouts, go to lab and show him that you are trying your best. You'll do great! ",1
"Professor Berry is responsible for the work. She provided a lot of information for us, and I just followed her instructions to finish homework and lab. She replied to the email as soon as possible, and she explained everything in great detail. Four exams are not difficult, and you need to spend some time preparing.",1
"Absolute best professor I've ever had. Professor Hunt goes above and beyond when caring about her students' success. During all labs she was constantly circling around engaging with students and even ""quizzing"" us independently during the labs to ensure we were on the right track for the next exam. If I could take every lab course with her I would",1
"He was very Clear and if someone didnt understand he would go back and explain more into depth, also he talk a lot about his personal experience as a fire fighter a lot which is good in a way, Awesome Instructor",1
Good teacher,1
"Dr. Hines's lectures are very confusing, since he often gets the questions wrong. I have attended every class and done all the homework and still do not understand the material because of his lectures. His office hours are during my other classes, so I recommend going to the Study or Mathskellar because his lectures/notes online are not helpful.",0
Awesome teacher!! Professor Gordon does a great job of making sure everyone understands the material. She's funny and keeps class entertaining. Would definitely take her class again!,1
"This teacher is great, he has so many stories as he goes along with the lecture and he's sure to make you laugh. I loved this animal science class!",1
"Judith is not a very nice person.  She plays favourites in her classes, and if you're not one of them, you can not do anything right.  I think that she teaches so that she has a captive audience to brag about her writing.  So she's a Canadian writer - she's not that famous - don't be starstruck. If that's all she's riding on, it isn't much.",0
Very helpful compared to other AP professors!,1
"Very hard tests! but he's a great lecturer.  Beware that problems on the test will be more advanced and harder than problems done in class and assigned for H.W. Again, his tests are very challenging. You'll need more than lecture problems and hw to get an A in his class.   He's very nice and always willing to help. current grade is at a B+",1
"Great looking guy, enjoyed looking at him more than learning the material - no wonder I got a bad grade?",0
"Plain terrible. She's very knowledgeable about the topic but is next to terrible at explaining the material. She talks about her personal life way too much and goes on tangents about her life, rather than the topics we need to learn. Expects way too much out of a level 100 class.",0
Talks really fast but really nice and helpful. Somewhat difficult.,1
"class was absolutely useless, so was the homework. Read the book in each and every detail, because it will be asked on the exam. HORRIBLE teacher, do not take Stats with him.",0
"He definitely keeps your intrest during class. I liked him. You have to pay attention though, and his tests are a little difficult to study for, but nothing major. Just make sure to do the homework which takes at most 20 min. I'd recommend him",1
"Lots of homework assigned- she only checks it if you're late/absent. Her tests are about 25-30 questions, but doesn't curve grades. Lectures are sometimes hard to follow. Don't miss class you'll miss so much, she covers a lot very quickly. She also only uses a chalkboard, so don't take her class if you have a problem with chalk noises.",0
We only meet once a week because this class is mixed mode and we often cut class short. I haven't learned anything that I couldn't just read out of the textbook and he makes the class way too easy. He will do anything to not give you 100% on an assignment even if he contradicts himself. I'm pretty sure he doesnt know anyones name and class is small,0
"Dr. Bachmann's online geography class was reall y easy going and welcoming this semester. Her assignments were super easy. All it is discussion boards, current event postings, and weekly quizzes to the chapters you read from the text. (But most of the answers can be found online. :) She's also really nice and knows her geography.",1
"Advanced Swim class was AWESOME! If you know what you're doing and know how to swim, it's a piece of cake. A couple online modules, but they're easy. Richard is an amazing swimmer too. Take this class!",1
"Myself as well as others in my class find her gradeing to be strict and her way of describing assignments to be vauge which then corrilates with our assignment grades. She makes you print everything out for the class and waste your own ink also majoritivly submitting online which allows for mistakes to be made which then ""arnt her fault""",1
"No sympathy on grading during the fire, despite the fact that no work was supposed to be assigned. Told me to my face, I wasn't ""affected enough"" by the fire to get any extensions or help even though I was displaced. His lectures were off topic and not related to the course work. EVERYDAY he'd literally pull up news sites and say ""talk about this"".",0
Dr. thompson really isn't that bad. You can tell he's not the most experienced professor but he knows his math and is able to teach it to you. Only people that lack basic calc 1 and 2 knowledge have a problem with him. ,1
"Gail is passionate,  wise, and engages authentically with students. In lecture, she augments the content by speaking candidly about her (many) experiences as a nurse, her triumphs, as well as her mistakes. Gail's honesty is both inspiring and refreshing in a field where  ego and pretense are often barriers to genuinie connection.",1
"At Ivy Tech APHY101 and 102 are basically the weeding classes prior to a lot of the health care majors.  They're pretty tough, and you have to study a lot and go to open labs.  That being said, Mr. B gives you all the tools you need to succeed, his lectures being simple enough for a layman and also as fun as can be expected.  Best teacher ever!",1
"Comes off intimidating at first. But I can now say she's a great, easy going teacher. Always willing to help. Be prepared to do some major research. Once you get used to it, papers end up easy to write. Easy A",1
"Great teacher, kept the lectures interesting and had a clear passion for the subject. Only annoying thing is he had us buy a textbook that doesn't have a binding, meant to be put into a binder. Literally never used it, everything was on Mastering Geology (online). Can't be sold back.",1
"Dr. Baumgartner gives the best lectures. He is clear and provides examples as to what he is talking about. He is a very good speaker and he is passionate about teaching. He is very smart and approachable. This course is very hard. Record the lectures, make flashcards, attend open labs each week, attend each class, study, and you will get an A. ",1
"He assigns weekly readings, which range from 20 to 200pgs, although you don't even have to read them, because he explains all of the important material during class. He provides a worksheet each class period, then uses those questions on the midterm & final. Several (4) papers throughout, including one group essay. Pray he likes your writing style",1
If you have this Professor RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!!!! She is by far the WORST professor I had @ Temple!!! Buy the book cause its more useful than her Notes. This lady is so careless it's not even funny. The only useful thing in this class is the homework which is extra credit towards exams. DO THE HOMEWORK!!!!,0
"A very good professor whos the only one Id prefer to teach me math thusfar. His lectures are amazing because of they he makes the lesson relatable to his students. He also interacts with his students & if we have questions about any types of problems, we solve several of those types together as one. Hes the ideal math professor.",1
"Tompson is hilarious and energetic (even in her 8am section). Her lectures give you all the information you need for the test, so as long as you attend class you don't need the textbook. There were 3 midterm exams (50 multiple choice questions), one paper, and a cumulative final. The tests are easy if you pay attention and study the notes.",1
"I took this because I am a nurse and feel it's important to be educated on social problems. He only focused on the perspectives of sociology, never actually ""taught"" anything. Discussion boards were all opinion based, but still never able to get full credit. Unless you are majoring in Sociology, I would steer clear of this professor.",0
Makes the lecture fun and interesting. Prepares you for exams and assists with Mikes Bikes. super laid back and here for your success. 10/10 would recommend!,1
"Zank was a wonderful professor! He is extremely knowledgeable of the Abrahamic faiths and works to facilitate discussions amongst the students. I loved this class in particular because of its universal appeal. If you have any questions about the current state of the Levant, this course will answer many, if not all, of them.",1
"His English is very difficult to understand Lab and Lecture are totally not relevant Youtube video, link on lectures are useless Regret going to KPU because of his class",0
"if you do all the work and practice, it will be a breeze.",1
Worst teacher I've ever had in my life. Completely useless. Does not know anything about graphic design and is horrible at giving feedback. He belittles his students and finds pleasure in embarrassing them in front of the class. Any good reviews on here were probably written by him.,0
"She's Good n easy, she make it interesting, if u go in class everyday n pay attention n online home work..easy grades...",1
"Prof Chambers is excellent ! Although she makes students participate in class, it is actively engaging, which helps students remember the material. She makes statistics understandable and helps understand the concepts behind the formulas! One of the best professors I have ever had!",1
Great class. Great teacher!,1
"Elena is amazing and she really helps you learn Spanish.  She brings her instruction to you through grammar, history, culture and world affairs.  And she is extremely hott!",1
The course material is not soo difficult but he makes it so with his choppy explanations. Only grades tests. Does gives around 20pts extra credit for every test; which makes up for his teaching ability. He does the 1st extra credit in class. 1 day I know he gave 5pts EC just for coming.I hardly learned anything but got a B in the class.,1
"Overall good teacher, one 30 question test on like the 7th(?) week. One personal presentation on topic of choice but have to get your topic first because no duplicates. No textbook, mostly go on the news and talk about topics like an open discussion. No FINAL.!!!",1
Easy grader and assignments for each week take under an hour.,1
"Not the worst professor I've ever had, but definitely not the best either. The lectures are very boring and dry. The quizzes and tests are over so many chapters that is makes it hard to study, but he does give hints if you attend the class. If you skip, there is almost no hope. Tax is a complex subject to understand, so it takes a lot of work.",0
"Dr. Kennedy was an alright professor, I've definitely had worse! He gave his students so many extra credit opportunities and he gives you the quizzes from previous semesters to study from (basically the same questions and answers). Awesome class, he is kinda awkward though.",1
"this class was my least favorite class. the teacher is hot but that doesnt make up for the total lack of personality, he is so boring i wanted to shoot myself in the face every class. plus it is some dumb experimental math class where they give you a bunch of stupid word problems. would never do this class over again",0
She is very interesting and funny,1
I recommend taking her Global Women in Leadership freshman seminar. You read 3 books (very easy). No tests or quizzes. No homework assignments. One group project. She is very sweet and friendly. Easy A. My class was all girls and we all got very close and could talk freely to one another. Very positive environment!,1
"Natalie is the best! I love her presence in the classroom and she is wicked smart and passionate about anthropology. Show up to class and take good notes, her tests are manageable and she lets you have a sheet of notes! I would for sure take her class again.",1
"Overall a really great professor. I struggled a little bit on the exams, but his end of the quarter grading system evens everything out. He is funny and makes math fun to do. He will re-open hw assignments if you ask him to, class was recorded so I was able to go back and watch lectures. Very approachable professor :) ",1
Heyborne is great. Loves the subject he teaches so he teaches it clearly. Always willing to answer questions and help students out. Class requires some work and study but not bad as long as you go to class everyday.,1
"One of the best teachers I've ever had. The material can be dry sometimes but he makes it interesting and puts it in context well. He's super knowledgeable, had a lot of experience in the industry, and it shows. I'm trying to take a class from him next semester, mostly just because he's teaching it.  If you care about music, take this class.",1
get ready to read a whole book but it is not too hard. easy essay grader always got B's on my papers. gives good feedback when you have a question. he is super chill. he likes when people participate in groups and when people talk in class.  i would def take his class again,1
"Tough lady and intimidating at first, but then as the class goes on, you realize that she's actually really cool! She's smart and really wants to hear your thoughts on things. Turned out to be one of my favorite professors. And definitely one of the more ""normal"" honors professors.",1
Took several of his classes and loved them.  They are all VERY challenging but very interesting too. He is passionate and its contagious.,1
"Very fair in regards to grading and course load. Has average expectations of his students. Not overwhelmingly difficult, but there is work. You can't just show up and pass.",1
"Fantastic teacher!  One of the best I had at Lone Star.  He is extremely knowledgable  and helpful.  I learned so much from Mr. Wiley.  As long as you are willing to work hard, you will get an A in his class.  It is not an easy class, but if you put the work in that is required you will learn a lot.  Highly recommend this teacher!!",1
"Not only is he a great professor and guest lecturer, but he has also written some great books that I have used in other classes. He is a master at military history and policy and it is so damn interesting. Plus, he's hot. :) ",1
"Ms. Pajer is a very kind lady. Only 5 essays in the semester and one is basically an annotated bib. She has a tough time with technology and Zoom. Sometimes class was boring and pointless, but in-person class had a fun dynamic. Uses peer review, rough drafts, and editing before each paper is due. Very flexible and helpful in office hours to clarify",1
"She is very passionate about what she does. I was very skeptical the first day of class because she was intimidating, but im glad i still stuck by the whole semester. Easy class if you show up and take good notes, study for tests, and complete the two easy papers that she assigns. Recommend !!",1
interesting material made a bit too dull and graded a bit too harshly.,1
"He's a great teacher, fair grader, and decent comedian all at once. He was relatively easy, but that's probably because I had a solid genetics background before I even took the class. His class was at 8 in the morning, but it was totally worth it. If you are going to take genetics, you absolutely HAVE to take Dr. Hauck.",1
This is possible the best online class I have ever had. His recorded lectures gave the in class experience.,1
"There are a lot of quizzes and assignments, which means lots of opportunities to get points. She makes you work, but you will get the grade you deserve for the amount of work you put in. She's very good at entering grades into Canvas as soon as she grades an assignment, so you always know how well you're doing in the class.",1
This class was so fun and I looked forward to going to this class. Enough said.,1
"I did more work outside of this class than all of my other classes combined. We had two textbooks. One for our weekly 500-word blogs + two 250-word comments on other people's blogs, and the other textbook for the online tests. Do not think that just because you get to use the textbook the tests are easy. No. Very difficult to take lecture notes.",0
Excellent Professor!! Very open to discussion and student perspectives. It was a wonderful exchange of ideas and concepts during the class that often made you forget about the time. Would gladly take another class with Professor Outlaw. ,1
Honestly the worst teacher I have ever had. She drags on everything we do. I would never recommend taking her. Incoming freshman beware she is heartless.,0
"I don't recommended taking this class with this professor if you're planning to transfer. She will NOT take the time to answer questions, go over exams or  review for any major exams. Her grading criteria is confusing to which makes you believe you'll  pass.  ""I don't know"" is her signature phrase.  I",0
Shes a amazing teacher! Mrs. Smith is very caring. Her name is spelled wrong Dolores,1
He really wants to help you learn. Hes new at teaching but knows that and makes the class super fair. Im not good at accounting but this prof is always accessible to help you through the class. He wants you to succeed and get the best grade possible. He makes accounting class better by using real world examples. Hes very kind and approachable.,1
Super great teacher. Her tests are just testing if you understand the ideas nothing really there to trick you. She is super nice and the lecture is not too bad. As long as you go to the class and pay attention you should easily get an A on every exam.,1
"She is prepared for class, but she is pretty hard to approach. I have taken online and on ground with her and she isn't very easy to ask for help from over email or in person, she mostly directs you to google. I never felt prepared for tests in on ground course. Very possible to make an A in the class if you don't slack off.",1
"He's a terrible professor. His transition from lecture to HW to tests makes no sense. I did so poorly in his class that he made me reconsider my entire major. DO NOT TAKE!!!! His entire class was a waste of time. If you have him, switch!! He has to curve ridiculous amounts and even admitted there were questions on the test none of us could answer.",0
"Good, fun teacher. Lots of homework and online confusion. Probably one of the better choices for this class. I would give her a B+; well worth the hassle.",1
"very sweet but very easy. if you like easy A's then take her, but if you want more of a challenge the I suggest you dont.",1
"Dr. MS is awesome, but he gives exams in pdf format so that all of his students are taking the same version of the test. Because of cheating, the averages are very high. Despite this, he hasn't changed the exam format, he has just made his exams harder. Unfortunately, it is more difficult for honest students to do well in his class this semester.",1
Dr. Hill is clear about her expectations. The Labs are quite a bit of work so get started early (they are a large part of your grade). She's helpful when you need it. It does take a long time to get grades back on PA and Lab work. I would take another class from her.,1
"she is the worse teacher i have ever had, Her course material is unclear, she does not reply to any of your emails, she does not post anything that makes sense or streamlined with the material she gives. does not keep in contact or even post your overall grade. forget about extra credit, there is none,  she just throw things online and not clear. ",0
This professor is not good! She wants everyone to rate her the best on here. Like who does that she just isn't good at all. I wouldn't take her if I were you.,0
Great guy who is passionate about music. It shows through his teaching. Funny and adorable too,1
"I've taken many online courses, and really do prefer them, but Taking this class was a mistake. If you struggle with math, please please please look for another professor or wait a semester. Your GPA isn't worth it!",0
"she has a really thick accent, so at first it is hard to understand her, but you get used to it. her tests are very straight forward, the study guide is essentially the test, but just in a different order. COME TO THE CLASS BEFORE THE TEST. she goes through the study guide and gives you all the answers, but only in class.",1
She makes learning a foreign language fun & interesting. I learned so much from her class through her teaching & study abroad experiences. I took an extra semester of Spanish just because she was the professor. She is AWESOME!!!!!!!,1
I  took this class and I didn't feel understand very well.,1
Chidinma Udezeh is awesome professor i took her class on fall and i got A+ ,1
"she is an alright teacher, so borring though and its 4 tests in all and she dropes the lowest garde. The clas itself is borringa dn she makes ven more  , half the time i text,",1
Professor Wiley is one of a kind. I made an A in the class but I'm still trying to figure out how. I think he does a huge curve based on classroom attendance and participation. Sit in the front and speak up. Read the powerpoints before class to be prepared. I would often research things in the powerpoint before class to be prepared bc he will ask!!,1
Stayed after class for hours helping me with my project.,1
"She was sweet and clearly knows her stuff . However, I found that she just assumed the students understood the topic. Hard grader yet she does give extra credit points. Overall , She heavily lacked clarity for what was expected during assignments . Without knowing what is being expected of you definitely makes it hard to succeed in this class .",1
"Michael Elliot is an awesome professor. Not only does he nail down on information that you need, but he also has plenty of useful advice to go with it. His group projects may seem scary at first but he's there to offer guidance towards achieving your project's goal. All of the effort he puts into the class is for your benefit, so take advantage!",1
"Absolutely brilliant. UT did a great job taking in Dr. Israel, as he is the best math teacher I have had to date. Lectures were inspirational, enjoyable, and at times fun. The tests were tricky and homework long, but overall, a manageable class. Dr. Israel is very approachable and doesn't mind a couple questions after class or during office hours.",1
Stubborn and unaccommodating professor. Not willing to help students who approach her. Doesn't consider student feedback at all -- 0/10 would not recommend,0
"I struggled with Anatomy 1, but Heather Hug made anatomy 2 crystal clear. Yea, I only got a B, but for me, that was like an A. Anatomy really isn't my thing. She is the best teacher I have had in the Health Sciences Department!",1
"Don't recommend his class what so ever unless you have time. If you have a busy schedule DO NOT take his class but if you think you are capable go right on ahead. Just know he doesn't give direct answers to your question and he advises that you memorize his syllabus. In class he has really long lectures, pretty big reading and writing assignments.",0
Rick's a great professor here at DePaul. He clearly knows his stuff though can be hard on some students. Never skip class (news quizzes every session) and do what is expected and you should be fine. Expect your homework to be covering stories around campus or the city and it being time-consuming. He's very professional and offers some great advice.,1
The class was interesting and she is willing to work with you if you need additional clarification. ,1
"WORST PROFESSOR I'VE EVER HAD! IF YOU HAVE TO DELAY GRADUATION TO AVOID HIM, ITS WORTH IT BECAUSE YOU WILL STRUGGLE & FAIL ANYWAY! doesn't show you how to work out a problem, just scribbles all over the board and mumbles/trails off, no structure to his lectures, gives problems on tests that you've never seen before. 90% of my class failed or go D's",0
I am in the process of taking one of his classes and so far so good. He is very caring and reachable outside of class. He wants us to succeed and will do whatever he can do to help make that possible. The class is very paper heavy but you should expect that in an English course. He is very clear as to what he is expecting on papers. Meet with him.,1
"This class is amazing attendance is and isnt mandatory he takes attendance but you can skip a couple of times. You write a total of like 4 -5 papers but they will be the easiest papers youve ever done. We had one quiz and it was analyzing a video. The class is fun, I would 100% take again.",1
"If you're going to get your students to buy a textbook about Brazil, assign more than 50% of the readings on Brazil, and spend 70% of the lectures time talking about Brazil and remembing all the good times you had in Brazil, DON'T title your course ""Latin America."" She is like a one-hit-wonder band from the 90's with nothing new to say.",0
"Find someone else to take. He is not helpful at all. DO NOT buy the book you'll never use it, unless you read it. But thats what Khan Academy is for. So save yourself the money and buy the ebook",0
"In the middle of a worldwide pandemic this ""teacher"" was nothing but rude and unprofessional. Would definitely not recommend.",0
he doesn't know how teach paragraph and which you don't  understand clearly what he want to do this rule that he gave you  I recommend don't take this class.... ,0
"Powers is very helpful, and the class was lots of fun. I didn't find the class too easy, but I'd gladly take another class from him.",1
"She is a very hard marker, but is extremely hilarious. She allows you to become engaged in the materials that are being taught. Overall great professor, I would highly recommend her.",1
"Mr.Riley nice man,gives you handouts/WS for each section/CH;long as you read CH & answer each question to full detail/understanding & use those to study w/ diagramss n CH. (to understand n class read & take own notes from CH b4 class!)has powerpoint posted on blackboard no take notes n class just listen all work graded/extra credit  study hard 4 A!",1
Show up for class and study hard.,1
"Jerome is a great teacher, everything is online and gives you 2 chances on everything. If you do the homework you will get an easy A. The best Calc teacher Ive ever had. He teaches business Calculus and knows his stuff! Very integrated teacher and respects everyone. If you struggle with math you need to take Mr. Caldwells class!",1
"He doesn't exactly know what he is doing I feel like.  He is an easy grader, even gives you partial credit on multiple choice.  so if you want to BS your way through a B, then this is a great class.  But everything is from the book, I didn't learn anything from his lectures.  He doesn't communicate what he wants to teach very well.  Hes a nice guy",0
"Tests are very tricky.  I thought I did really well on the final until I saw I got a C because he recycles old midterm problems, but slightly changes the wording so don't expect it to be the same answer. My advice would be to write out all of your homework and save it when studying for tests. He replaced our lowest midterm with our final exam grade",0
"She use's the socratic method to get students who are struggling with concepts to realize the answer. However, most people interpret this as her trying to make you look stupid. She is very generous with personal time to help students and is even willing to schedule personal office hours outside of the ones on her syllabus. Excellent. ",1
"I love Connie! She is the best! Very helpful, wants you to succeed in public speaking! Gives great criticism and feedback! LOVE HER! I highly recommend taking connie anderson for ANY speech class!",1
He's extremely condescending and you will not be respected what so ever in or outside the classroom. Often embarrasses and shames you in front of your peers for just asking a question. Mathematical errors happen more often than not even on study guides and tests.,0
"Very boring and long lectures, gives homework that is not interesting at all and makes you not want to draw. doesnt ever give As on homework",0
Professor Neva knott has time and time again has shown her inability to teach by not supporting her student when they excelled in something they previously struggled with. When you ever asked for her help she only responded with not only a rude manner but also more confusing then the prompt she gives. Do not take her class if you ever need help.,0
She doesn't remember what she has/hasn't told you so there's a lot of material on the test that she didn't go over or expects you to read in the textbook even though she didn't teach it. You really have to study hard to pass and make good grades.,0
He has no remorse. Doesn't teach anything. He just pre-records lectures and makes you watch them on your own time. Every class you have a quiz first thing and then he asks you if you have any questions on the new topic you were suppose to watch for the week. Simply you have to teach yourself calculus 2 while he watches you struggle.,0
"Fantastic Professor, look forward to being in another of his classes this next semester. He is not the easiest professor, but he is clear, and good at communicating the material he is teaching. And in these higher civil engineering classes I so often run into professors where half the work is figuring out stuff not explained properly.",1
"This man is painfully awful. He is super sarcastic and when asked a questions he will revert it and at as if it is a comedy club. Even though no one will laugh he still sticks to his act. Not very good at teaching at all, flies through content and the whole class gets low scores on quizzes. Awful professor, would not recommend.",0
"her first test you are going to fail it, the rest of the tests are a breeze, i hated her class but now i love it!",1
"Yes he is a great professor. I had him my freshman year. So thing you want to know about him is that, he love to assign paper about print and digital culture. If you are good at writing papers and love reading he is definitely your kind of professor.",1
"Dr. Costanza taught a hybrid course this semester. Overall the class went well. There were pretty much 2 assignments each week, which were not too difficult: Posting on the discussion board/replying to 2 other students and taking an open note/book quiz. The quiz questions come straight off the Powerpoint slides and the discussion questions. Easy.",1
"Someone needs to get this woman out of a classroom. She outdated. Her instructions are vague, her syllabus is vague. I didn't learn a thing in her class. She started class 15 minutes late every day, and always has to leave in the middle go move her car. She is very set in her ways with her 1938 budget!",0
Dr. Sweet-Cushman is one of my favorite people here at Chatham. From the moment I met her as my advisor she made me feel completely welcome. She is incredibly funny and enthusiastic about her job. She isn't afraid to express her opinions so if you get upset about little things don't take her class. Exams are quite hard though so you have to study.,1
"I partially agree with the comment below me.  I agree he is approachable, however he really does make the subject harder for me to understand.  & I do not agree with his exam method.",0
"He talks super low. Offers study guides for exams, however some questions are not what he provides when it comes to the real exam. Drops lowest exam grade. Homework must be done in green books, and are due the day of each exam. He is not that bad, but I would not take his class again.",1
Professor Nuneville is clearly educated when in comes to the criminal justice field. Her class consists of textbook info followed by memorable personal stories. She is overall an incredible professor and has even helped me in some of my other courses! 10/10 would take any more of the courses she teaches.,1
"Love Mrs. Fox. Take this class and be prepared to learn. Shes an amazing teacher who cares about her students, she can seem tough and intimidating at first, but shes a sweetheart. Get on her good side by participating and doing your work on time. Shes always available to help her students. Overall an amazing teacher.",1
Mr ward has been my favorite professor throughout all my years here he makes history fun and engaging. The class is easy if you show up and pay attention. Ask him for help with anything and he is more than happy to meet outside of class with you. Wish he taught all my classes.,1
"Professor Kuhlman makes math fun. He absolutely makes time outside of class if you need it. Yes, the class moves fast. It's his job to get through the syllabus set by the HCC math department. He has to get through the material (and there's a lot) in order to have the class ready for the exams. If you need additional help, you just have to ask.",1
Dr. Carter is such an engaging speaker. He is inspiring & thought provoking as he leads people in thought very effectively. Dr. Carter was very aware of his students' mental spaces; he managed a classroom with expectations & goals but at the same time he took time to lead us in meditation when we got burned out a bit. I see life differently now.,1
"Expected to learn much more in depth information in a 300 level class. Felt like an introductory class compared to the 3 other 300 level classes I have taken in ARH. Nice enough woman, but not a big fan of her teaching style. Covers lots of topics very briefly (like maybe one slide for an entire movement). However, tests were not particularly hard.",1
"Kelly Roe is a great professor! If you have the chance to take her, please do. She is young and fully willing to go every single problem for you. Her exams can be harder than other professors but the class average will be around a C+ so work hard and you will be okay. If you go to her office hours then you will learn everything you need to know.",1
"zubin austin is amazing to listen to in class. he's funny, helpful, and his classes are always thought provoking and entertaining",1
"Zeb is a great professor and very solid choice for INFO 300. He is very knowledgeable on the subject at hand due to his experience at VCUHS, and he sets up his students for a career in IT. Take him.",1
"Although I would not take his class again because the homework was too heavy when taking five other classes... I will say that he knows his stuff. I do feel like I learned a lot in his old testament class - but I think he struggles with being personable. If you show effort in your work and show up to class, you will do well.",1
"This was his first time teaching at Smith. He gave clearly written lecture notes each class. We learned R in class, not in a separate lab. Very receptive to feedback. Super knowledgeable in his field and has done some amazing work!",1
I enjoyed his class. He cares about his students and has creative assignments. All papers can be revised and turned into a final portfolio. He can make socially awkward comments at times but he is genuinely a nice and caring professor. If you have the chance to take him then go for it!,1
"His class is very enjoyable, interesting, and makes me want to learn about history. He's a very likable guy and is really funny. he tells the wildest stories that tie into the lesson. The exams are posted every three weeks and the reflection papers are easy if you pay attention and take notes. great guy and great class!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
absolutely wonderful teacher! I would recommend her to anyone. She is willing to put in extra effort to help students who are struggling. Great sense of humor.,1
Absolutely loved her. Learned a lot in her class and felt at ease. Truly a gem of a person.,1
"Professor Ross is an all around nice guy with an interest in the subject. Very passionate. However, the class is so unstructured that it is hard to even keep up. Only graded on 2 papers, which grading criteria is unclear as well. Had a zoom class at a different time than I signed up for, so I would miss every class. My lowest grade for a class.",1
"The class wasn't hard, the material was just dry. Powell was a great prof and always made himself available after class and answered his emails. He doesn't post notes online but if you read the chapter you'll be guaranteed at least a B-. 1 midterm, 1 final, weekly mini quizzes worth less than 1%, and a reflection paper with 6 1/2- 1 page entries",1
Easy to talk to,1
Dr. Ross takes time to go through several example problems for each concept on the projector. Homework is usually weekly and is entirely online. Expect to spend about 2 hours a week on homework. Easy exams with each having just 4 problems and no conceptual questions. Make a good equation sheet (you get one page for the exam) and you'll do well.,1
"Recently started teaching the course again and restructured his criteria. For a breadth course this class makes you really work for the grade. Also, there were so many readings, but they're all provided. Course stressed me out more than my major courses. I wouldn't suggest if you want an easy A, but if you're going to PNP then go for it.",1
"These previous ratings are ridiculous. She is a great teacher, and she tries extremely hard to help you out. Yes, there are clicker quizzes, but why be in college if you're going to complain about coming to class? Most of the questions, she practically gives the answers. And the tests are easy, just study the slides.",1
I took her Intensive Intermediate Spanish for Heritage Learners and it was intense! There is a lot of work that goes into this course. She is really clear in her lectures though so I learned a lot. You really have to prepare yourself and manage your time for this course. There was a group project which was easy and the final paper was easy as well.,1
"I took him for Biodiversity of the Caribbean and he is a very caring and sweet professor. The class is graded only by 3 midterms and a final, but one exam gets dropped and each test has 8 points added automatically. It is very easy to pass if you study the lectures and come to class to do the clickers. He gives a lot of extra credit!",1
"Professor is outstanding!!! Totally take him!!! Attendance mandatory, but you don`t want to miss a class anyway because we learned something new every class session. Very engaging, interesting, funny, smart, do your homework, ask questions if you don't understand something. He is awesome!!!",1
He is really smart and can be really funny. Five books of Moses was one of my fav. Bible courses of all time!,1
"She's super sweet, and even gives the class a few laughs each lecture. Lectures are long, take a LOT of notes. Tests are the majority of your grade and can be extremely hard, especially if you do not study days before. Overall, she is great at teaching.",1
"Hes not a bad professor, if you pay attention youll pass. If you participate youll get an A. My problem was with his lectures hes very encryptive. But when it came to the midterm and final he it was a lot less confusing, and its one of those finals that youll pass if you have been doing the readings.",1
She is the best teacher alive. She helps when you need it and will stay after class as well. I also had her for chemistry 104 and made an A in there too she is by far the best teacher at Gadsden state,1
Terrible teacher . Be aware she holds grudges. She gives a lot of notes but doesn't tell you anything about any of her tests. She expect you to eat breath and live the subject  and doesn't help you with any questions all she says it look through the notes. I would recommend staying away from her for many different reasons.,0
Dr. Field is the BEST professor at UNL. Tom is a very unique guy who really cares for the students in his courses. He really wants to cultivate a great future for everyone. His classes are very fun and exciting to attend. All information is very practical and relatable for the REAL world. Take as many classes with him as possible. Hes a GREAT guy!,1
"This is A & P the class is not easy due to the nature of the material. However, Mrs. Smith is a wonderful professor. She will make every effort to make sure you UNDERSTAND the material. Do the reading, study her power points she uses for lectures, ask questions, and study and you will get a good grade.",1
"This course was made up of group projects, class discussions, and student participation. I'm glad I took this during winter intersession. It was a fun class and we discussed very interesting topics. Professor is reasonable, very friendly and knowledgeable. Grading criteria is also very clear. You will learn a ton about gene manipulation.",1
"Brilliant man, experienced educator - but if your not a deep thinker,class is not for you.   Be ready to synthisize divergent thinking - Must be able to connect theory, apply.  Exams were essay.  Presentation style a little flat, which made some sleepy.",1
Very caring and respectable teacher. She is easy to relate to and understand. She made me understand why public speaking is an important and useful class to take. One of my favorite classes that I have ever had. She is one of the best teachers ever. Would recommend her to anyone and everyone!,1
"Just save yourself the headache and take someone else. Not that the class was extremely difficult, but she definitely makes you work for the grade. Very nit-picky about things that don't really matter and is a harsh grader, although most of the work was graded by Connect. Without the Connect assignments, this class would be unmanageable.",1
"What a guy! Cool head! Smart phys. ed. professor, been around the block a time or 2 or 3 or 4.knows his s#*! When it comes pitchin! Only 1 thing... he's a Cubby fan!! oooooo Jus kiddin Great Coach!!! Keep on Truckin! Newport! Rock On !!!",1
"This was an online class and assignments were done through MindTap. We also had discussions through BlackBoard.  The MindTap assignments had 3 tries, but the questions were way harder than what was learned. Professor is easy to get in touch with. I wish there were more work graded other than the MindTap. Grades were posted very late.",1
SHE IS TERRRRIBLE!!!!!I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND TAKING HER FOR ENGLISH..EVER!,0
"More of a hybrid class. You need mymathlab. the subject is harder for me than most but hes a great teacher, funny and laid back. practicing the math concepts is a must. Hes Not a fan of extra credit so do well on all exams for good measure of your grade.",1
Be on time and do your work and you will get an A,1
Professor Burman was a very good teacher. She is really passionate about the lessons and cares if you understand and wants you to improve no matter where youre at. She will ALWAYS take time to explain assignments. There is a lot of reading but it is fun. Lots of extra credit options. No late work but she offers some *passes* you can use in advance,1
"Professor Hercules is the first professor to help me understand Calculus 2. After taking this class with other professors, I finally understand it. All you have to do is ask questions. GREAT GUY ALL AROUND!",1
"She is a good teacher, but it takes a lot of effort to get an A in her classes. She grades pretty hard, but she also does a good job of explaining and leading you to the right answer",1
"I really enjoyed this class! I had never had Dr. Capper before and was not very interested in religion beforehand, but he changed that! His tests are not hard, just study the material and read the textbook. He always encourages discussion and will happily answer questions. He's a great guy and a lot of fun to talk to.",1
Dr. Baddar taught me more about writing & conducting research than any teacher I have ever had. She cares about students & if anybody has any problems or needs extensions due to personal issues she is more than happy to work with the student to make sure they succeed. Many of the bad reviews are from students who did not attend class or participate,1
Awesome experience with this instructor. Focuses on fundamentals and won't baby you. This is exactly the type of instructor that we need!,1
No Comments,1
Professor Lawson connects his life story to the lesson which makes it easier to understand.,1
"The class was kind of a joke to be honest, but she was pretty good and cared about her students. If I had tried harder for the tests I would have gotten an A+",1
"just dont waste your time, the good reviews are outdated, its time for him to retire, he does not know how to teach an online class. The class feels like a punishment . never answers emails and has always seems like he doesn't know what's going on",0
"I genuinely loved this professor. She really wants her students to do their best. One thing though I must say, keep up with the readings and take notes during the movies because they will show up in both the midterm and final. Also, keep the phones away, she does have a problem with phones, but come on guys, we spend hefty money for school!",1
"Great teacher! Very knowledgeable, you will learn a lot if you are interested. BIG group project for the second half of the semester. Overall his class is fairly easy, but pay attention because it's useful information for any business/management major.",1
There's never a dull moment in Professor Warn's class. He always tells awesome real life stories and somehow relates it back to what we're learning that class. I never missed a class last semester just because of how interesting Warn's lectures are.,1
"It sounds like a certain student just needed a lot of hand holding and is angry it wasn't handed to her. If the program is so flawed, why are the majority of students doing excellent. Be an adult, take responsibility for your own failure, don't blame the program. Prof Waller has been nothing but helpful to me btw",1
"It was an interesting class that covered interesting topics. Gildenhuys is a little hard to follow at times, but has interesting ideas as well. Definitely must stay up on the readings, and although most people didn't attend the second class of the week, you definitely should.",0
good teacher.,1
"She is a good teacher, but also a very hard teacher. She makes the class enjoyable, though!",1
"I thought Dr. Richmond was a nice professor. Only problem, quizzes are only 10 min. and it just wasn't enough time for someone who prefers to use their notes. She does provide you with PowerPoint notes but you cant even look over since its 40+ pages and each question is pretty much under a minute. Discussions and essays were fine.",1
"Falcon is one of a kind I would say. His class is hard and requires a lot of reading but I think being able to hear him lecture is worth it. He presents a lot of different perspectives and isnt afraid to get controversial. Im glad I stumbled across his class and didnt drop it, he really has impacted my perspective of the world",1
"He was a great teacher. He is always willing to help students on homework problems before class. He does not have a deadline for homework, but I suggest to do homework every night in order to ask questions the next day before he begins a new lesson.",1
take her Class if ur PASSIONATE about reading a bajillion pages of history.,0
Professor Marlowe was one of the best professors I've had. She goes out of her way to help you and help you do very well in her course. There are many opportunities she gives for points in class. She makes lectures very understandable and study guides were a great help prior to each exam. I would take her again if I had to. She is a must take!,1
SHE IS VERY GOOD AND UNDERSTANDING.,1
"Ms. Laughlin is as helpful as an online instructor need be. I did this class in a short session and there were plenty of assignments each week to keep you busy (typically 2 or 3 worksheets from the textbook and a discussion board assignment). As long as you take the assignments seriously, you should have no problem earning an ""A"" in this course.",1
"This professor was an overall great professor. My only complaint was that this class was a flipped classroom style class. This means you are required to study before showing up to class, because in class for the majority of time all you do is problems. Tests are not similar to homework, but they are not to difficult.",1
"Down to earth and funny although she is kind of an sjw. Teaches what you need to know and lectures are very lax/chill. You don't need to go to lecture at all really, but sometimes I went just for fun. Quizzes/tests word for word from powerpoints and very easy. Free A if you have half a brain cell.",1
"A really hard guy, but clear and helpful. The best I had during all my years at university here in England and France",1
Knox can be hard to hear but sit close and it won't be a problem. His TA Keely takes attendance and WILL mark you if you're absent (10 pts off a test grade). There are 3 online tests that are right out of the study guide (typically 11-13 pages) so buy the textbook and find the answers in there (you have weeks to do both luckily). 20 pts EC offered,1
"This woman truly has one of the most kindest hearts ever. She truly cares about her students and is willing to go out of her way to make sure that each of her students are on the right track. She plans and literally goes through with you step by step your educational plan. Not to mention, her personality is so energetic that it's contagious!",1
"Scott is a super nice guy who will keep you awake during class! If you do the readings, you will do just fine in this class. He has no tests, but a few quizzes to make sure your reading. He likes to keep the class involved during class and his lectures are super interesting. Strongly recommend taking him if you get the chance.",1
"He's a sweet guy and a great professor. You'll learn a lot from him when you learn how to follow his lectures. He subtly mentions important things, so take good notes and do some research after class. He knows a lot and has a lot of great stories",1
Great Professor! very knowledgeable and passionate about his field. Class requires connect. He is always available and is always willing to help. Makes sure you understand the info without beating it to death. Take his class! gives formula sheet for test!,1
"A very good professor. He cares about the students, he is fair, he presents the material in a clear way. Absolutely recommended!",1
Great,1
"This was an online class and each week, there were anywhere from 2 hours to upwards of 3-4 hours of lectures you had to watch. This is added on top of the weekly lab assignment you have to do. There is a quiz every week, but they're all open note. Tests aren't open note and make sure you study or it's gonna be pretty difficult.",1
This Professor is very helpful.You have to read the chapters and do the worksheets he gives out.Exams are easy and he reviews with you before the exam what other prof.does that?You'll love him!If you don't pass something is wrong with you not with him. Take him you'll learn a lot!,1
"Paoline was great! There are 3 test and attendance which make up your grade. He passes around an attendance sheet and everyone has to sign in. As long as you go to class and take notes and STUDY, you should be fine. I ended the class with an A-. He is very helpful and down to earth. He made the class very enjoyable. MUST TAKE.",1
"Her concern for all of us truly makes me feel like she actually cares about the human beings we are. The way she teaches this class, audio lectures coupled with her personality toward me, made all the difference in completing this course.",1
"He is terrible. The class is fairly easy, but overall he is really rude and mean. I turned in an assignment that had 2 parts. I turned in the first part and emailed him the second part because it was a picture. He then told me to submit through canvas after I had already emailed it to him. A month later, he tells me to email it to him NOW. so rude",0
"NLP is a great course. I've never taken a class from a professor so genuinely interested in the topic they were teaching. Lectures are very interesting and the assignments are challenging without being ridiculous. Overall, not too difficult.",1
"Professor Udezeh's class was tough, well i guess the course was tough as a whole. If you are planning on writing the CGBP exams, you most definitely need to take this course. Overall she is a decent teacher, but dont expect her grades to come cheap.  Oh yeah! Loads of group assignments. Dont sign up for her class if you dont like working in groups.",1
"He's really laid back and the class is almost entirely participation based, other than a few presentations and 2 or 3 6-8 page papers. Not at all a difficult class, but  unorganized. Doesn't give rubrics, and he doesn't grade anything. Out of the 3 papers I turned in, I got one back. You won't have a grade until he puts in your final grade.",1
He gives a study guide for every test. Just listen to directions and use the resources and you will do fine. He cares about teaching and is is accessible to all students.,1
Really nice guy! Very helpful and wants his students to do well. I took him for summer session and it was great. Makes every effort to help you get the best grade you can. Loves to talk about himself but makes class interesting. I really learned a lot from him. I wish I had taken him for E1 also. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!,1
"wonderful teacher. He makes English fun to learn. He gives too much assignments, but the assignments are interesting; moreover, you will love to do his assignments.",1
"He is a very intelligent teacher with lots of interesting examples, and a willingness to help. Judging by the comments, it sounds like students take that for granted.  Either that, or they aren't smart enough to follow him.  (probably the latter)  Anyways, he is a good prof and I learned a lot.",1
An amazing professor with a great personality. Learned about my personality and planned my major and learned about 4yr universities. Workload varies depending on how much of ur college plan youve already figured out. Textbook is VERY straightforward. Weekly meetings not required BUT u should definitely attend them to fully understand hw questions,1
"Professor Judge teaches at Trinity College now, but I felt that it needed to be said, how great of a professor he is. His lectures were super clear and if anyone had questions, he would go back and explain in detail (sometimes, he even emailed a summary of the question in confusion). I would definitely take another class with him; it was enjoyable.",1
"Great professor, need textbook to pass class",1
"She has like small worksheets or questions to answer at the end of each class to record attendance. There are 3 main speeches you have to give, one being a large group research speech. Grading is done by TAs, so it's a easy A",1
"Sara is seriously one of the best professors I've had at Iowa.  She clearly loves her job and social work, which helps students learn easier.  The class was really easy, but definitely enjoyable.  Can't wait to take more of her classes",1
Literally a fitness god!!!!!! KEEP UP,1
Once a week Friday class (3 hours is a long time...) VERY easy and straight forward (just do the easy homework and prepare for the debates). Great  instructor!,1
"Class was ok. Had an option to complete a certain # out of total assignments. Was always pushing deadlines back. He did tell me it was ok to take on a topic that has yet to be researched, went thru ideas for the paper, told me i needed to find research on it on graded last edit? that was a bit annoying. Nice guy. not very interesting. dont avoid",1
"Solid professor, nothing truly special but she is a good lecturer and keeps you engaged in the class.",1
"Professor Ortmann is very understanding and sweet. The book is only used for in-class analysis, so make sure to bring it to class. She provides word lists to study that will be on the tests, as well as the essay questions. A very easy and informative class if you attend regularly and participate.",1
"Dr. Pannell is a phenomenal teacher for stats. Go to class, office hours, and stat lab. Tough class but if you do well on homework, quizzes, projects, etc. the exams are not that bad.",1
"Overall I don't think this prof cares about your grade. I initially was excited for this class, the prof also seemed excited & interested in the topic but that changed. Directions are not clear for most of the work. The research paper instructions were very vague & then harshly graded. Class was harder than it needed to be.",0
"Prof. Carr is professional, knowledgable & compassionate. Very passionate about leadership. His lectures are quite informative. Exams are done online, in class quizzes & 1 group project. You will definitely work for your A, most importantly will haved learned so much from this course. AWESOME professor! Sets you up to win! I definitely recommend.",1
"Dr. Scanlon was one of the most helpful professors I ever had.  He expects you to work, and he is not easy.  If you work hard you he will take care of you.",1
Easy class but you are 100% on your own. She never responded to any of my emails or phone calls. I even emailed the administrator trying to get ahold of her. She sets up her online class with automatic test results and does nothing else.,0
"Mrs. Elfring is very passionate about what she teaches. Her assignments are all on D2L, so it's all for your reference. She is clear on what she expects from you. There isn't much homework, no tests and only 4 papers. The final is an 8-10 research paper, but you work on it for a couple months with her help. Very nice woman and I highly recommend!",1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!! He lacks a lot of professionalism, a lot of material all at once he's not organized with a curriculum whatsoever. Test are over 125 questions Long, very hard on attendance he has you drop his class after the third absence. No communication with students, very high standards HE CANNOT TEACH! You will learn nothing!!!!!",0
Great teacher. Very easy class. He explains the stuff very well.,1
She's a good professor who gives good feedback and is accessible outside class. She prefers to be notified if you won't be showing up to class. There is a lot of homework and writing to do but that's because its an english course.,1
"Mrs. Smith is, by far, the kindest and most caring professor. The course itself involves a lot of work because of the amount of material but Mrs. Smith is always available for questions or advice. She will be retiring in December and will certainly be missed by all of her students! I'm so glad I decided to take her class. She's a real gem!",1
Don't take this class if you have no business learning about marine biology. Tried to reach her many times regarding my grade and if there were things I could do to better it but she was never any help. She loves to talk about herself and is always making rude comments about perfectionists and ppl with OCD me. Not very nice and voice is annoyin,0
"Dr. Hansen is a great teacher! He understands that a lot of different kinds of people may be taking an intro-level PWS class, so he tries to make it applicable and interesting to everyone. He has a passion for soil and helps students get excited about it. A very reasonable teacher, and it's not hard to do well in his class.",1
"Professor Eda Persampieri cares about her students. It is an easy A if you show up, complete your homework, and her two projects. There is a individual project, and a group project which is 60% of your grade combined. Her lectures are easy to understand, and she offers extra credit and her homework is mostly based on a textbook chapter.",1
This guy likes to talk a lot about his personal life and likes to retell boring anecdotes repeatedly every single lecture. Apart from being a strict guy he is extremely rude. If you are trying to get your GED done do not take him unless your really into poetry. Also be prepared to waste money on useless books. This man also takes attendance serious,0
"The way the professor set up the discussion boards. Rather than just asking us to regurgitate the information back to her, she asked for our perspectives about each subject we were learning. It created some great discussions between classmates.  It was on line, but I loved this class.",1
"She is kind and very smart, but demands a lot from her students and is a hard marker. Her French is beautiful (Parisian French, not Quebecois French) and she is very calm and supportive of everyone. That being said, you need to work really really hard to get a good grade in this class.",1
"Good guy. Quizzes daily, but not too hard if you do the readings and you can makeup a quiz through a rewrite, so don't worry about missing a quiz or doing badly. No midterm, just quizzes, one group project and a final. Not too boring, just basic history class. Get one sheet of info for the final- pretty lengthy, but not too bad. Good class, overall",1
"She is a very nice lady who is obviously very passionate about her field. Her section of the IMIN371 exams were more or less fair (in that she tested from what she taught), but expect to study A LOT for her exam just due to the sheer amount of material to memorize. Every detail counts.",1
Awesome professor! He builds up to speaking in front of the class that by the time comes your nerves are no longer an issue.,1
"This prof is a little scatterbrained but her enthusiam shines through her lecture, especially when we learned about fungi and protists and diatoms. She is a so-so prof, in the sense that you will either love her or hate her for her teaching style. Her midterms and finals were easy but it will still take a decent amount of effort from you.",1
"Excellent professor with a lot of energy and many jokes to keep you awake. Thus far my favorite professor in Hofstra, do not be intimidated by his demeanor the first few weeks of school, he's just trying to crack you. He will make a song out of important concepts and is very very inspirational for someone his age. ",1
No Comments,1
Amazing class- material and professor- wise.,1
"Went into the class thinking it was going to be an easy A for credit.  It was not as easy as I thought, but with all the extra credit he gives you you'll be fine.  Class isn't really mandatory, but you will benefit from going to class as he gives you information that could help you with tests.  3 tests, a little on the harder side, but manageable.",1
"After reading the other reviews here, I think we can all agree on the fact that she's absolutely horrible at answering Piazza posts. She never actually answers your questions, she only dodges it, asking you to find the answer yourself (I wouldn't be asking you if I didn't need clarification!!) Lazy and very rude with her comments. One of the worst.",0
"Maureen speaks VERY quietly so sit in the front row. Meet with her at the very beginning of the semester even if it's just to say hi. If you do so, she'll bend over backwards for you. Shes not always clear on what she wants you to do so ASK QUESTIONS. Participation is very important if you don't want a major assignment. Didn't really like the class",0
Dr. Sikora does not know how to teach Calculus. I have already taken Calculus in high school and the credit would not transfer to UB. He will not accept on tests the way the book explains or another equally right way. His lectures are repetitions of the reading and he is completely unorganized and hard to follow.,0
"Lots of extra credit on tests and quizzes marks leniently, best computer science prof at nipissing.",1
"Dr. Heyborne is awesome! Very helpful and clear in lecture and on assignments. Could really tell that he wanted you to succeed, and was willing to help in whatever way. Tough grader, and really makes you earn the grade, but he makes it enjoyable. ",1
"Professor Wood was awesome! I felt like it was one of the more useful classes from Chaffey. Not only has the class tremendously helped me in my future endeavors, but it was an extremely enjoyable class. I started off avoiding and disliking group projects,but the class taught me how to become a better group member, and best of yet, a leader. nothard",1
"This was by far one of the worst teachers I've taken during my college career. She's unruly, rude, and makes you feel less than adequate if you don't understand the material. The labs were extremely hard to do online and not in person. Most of the time the material she said was ""going to be on the exams"" in fact weren't. Please take another teacher",0
"She's an amazing professor! Its psychology, so of course you're going to read, don't be lazy because it'll only get harder for you. She helps you out a lot and is very open to new things or any concerns you may have. Shes very inspirational and motivated to help you try your best ... the work load isn't hard at all! Just read & study!! ",1
An amazing professor!  I wish there were more profs like her!  Very clear expectations.  No surprises.  Clear and concise.  Personally I think you have to have an IQ below room temperature to fail her lecture class or just truly not care...  ,1
"The class design makes grades heavily reliant on timed exams, which unfortunately are on applications of the assignments which no student would understand unless a student has taken the course or some equivalent before.  This places students who don't have the proper background at a disadvantage.  I learned a lot, but I'm worried about my grade.",0
One of the most Amazing professors i have ever had!! She is so caring and has a positive attitude every day. She helps you with anything you need. Barley ever any homework. I 100% recommend her.,1
"great teacher, highly advise to take this course with him. makes the class very interesting.",1
"Keeps things interesting, cares about students learning. Classwork isn't too hard at all. Attendance is optional, but you get 10 points participation for showing up. Tests are easy. Provides powerpoints, don't have to buy the book if you don't want to. I opened mine once.",1
Professor/Dean Lanham is amazing! Love her!,1
"I was so excited to take this class but the professor destroyed the passion I had for the subject. The material is choppy and there are no class discussions. The provided materials are stale, outdated, and unconnected. The test questions are confusing and conflicting information is in the materials provided. Do yourself a favor, pick another class.",0
He is a great man TAKE HIM,1
He shows up about 5 minutes late everyday.,0
"Great Teacher. Some of the math work can be challenging, but he helps you understand it and he won't let you leave until you get at least a 90 on your work.  He is very passionate about his work,and easy to get along with. I highly recommend him!",1
"Great class if you hate to do math by hand.He teaches you on the computer to do the stats.  He tends to ramble sometimes, but if you pay attention to the main ideas and read the book you shouldn't have any problems.",1
"Professor Johansen  makes the class interesting, considering it's 3 hours. She has an odd sense of humor; however,  it doesn't detract from her lectures. She is knowledgeable, and she won't let you forget it! With that, she tries to motivate her students to strive for more than just a grade, but that's important too! She's a good fit for LACC.",1
She is a wonderful teacher! Tells interesting stories and really wants to help you succeed in the class. She answers any questions you have and gives you powerpoint presentations and study guides to help with tests! I would definitely recommend her!,1
"Worst professor I've ever had; doesn't know how to teach; you will learn nothing from him. Just stands in front of the class and mumbles incrompehensibly. The class is so useless; less than 20 usually show up out of 140. He is also very mean and not willing to help students either. If you have to take this class, please find a different professor.",0
"worst prof ever. i got 60/61 required outcomes and he gave me a B. this guy is rude, curses all the time, and is straight up mean to all students. dont take him if you cna help it",0
"LOVED this man! Class was enjoyable because Saas made it enjoyable! Literally follow every thing in his rubric and you will get the grade you want. NO EXAMS. Just speeches. Very laid back, makes lots of corny jokes, and tries his best to keep the class engaged. Saas is a must for CMST 2060!!!",1
This professor was amazing!!! No lockdown on the exams and most quizlets help in studying.,1
"Susannah Richards is the reason that I will be a GREAT elementary school educator. You will learn more in her class than any other class you take here at Eastern. She is intimidating, sometimes mean, and ALWAYS tells you how it is, but she is an INCREDIBLE professor. Work hard. Participate. ASK QUESTIONS! SHow her that you want to do well! ",1
"Great prof. Had her for a fourth year lab class and I can tell a lot of the other replies here are from first-years who are more alarmed at the way things are taught at university (very fast, info-heavy lectures) rather than objectively speaking on her as a prof. She is smart, kind and always willing to help. Awesome role model for women in STEM!",1
"Dr. Foster is fairly average professor, in my opinion. The class mostly covered French history and other cultural topics, but I found it genuinely interesting. The work might become too much and her tests were some of the most difficult I have ever taken outside of math. However she gives clear directions and if you do what's needed, you'll be fine",1
"Mostly do-your own work, 3 hr class and most doesn't help with exams or homework, very nice and funny likewise.",0
"Dr Hart was the worst teacher I had in first year. Lectures are useless and very unorganized. She touches on topics briefly and expects you to know the rest from the text. Her exams are confusing and taken fully from the text book. The only redeeming quality is her enthusiasm. There are great BIO profs at UBC, so avoid Miranda. Your GPA will drop.",0
No tests but there are quizzes for the readings and critical reflection papers. Lecture can be pretty boring but the information can be interesting. He doesn't post grades but its an easy class.,1
"She was really cool and chill. You read ALOT of articles in the semester, its what the class is based on and you will be lost if you dont read. But its only one per class so its not hard. START YOUR RESEARCH PAPER ASAP. She only gives one paper and a 5 question quiz every other week so you have to read. The articles are interesting though.",1
"Very knowledgeable in English, but a very hard grader. If you do not apply yourself and/or are already an excellent writer, you will not receive an A. Very understanding and personable, I would highly recommend meeting with him 1 on 1 to discuss any problems. Challenging course, so don't take it unless you really WANT to improve you English skills.",1
Mr. Huff is one of the best professors on this planet. His extraordinary knowledge and outstanding good looks makes me want to go to class every day.,1
"Dr. Heilman totally influenced my view on drugs in this course. I took this course because I was interested in drug politics and why drugs are so bad, but by the end, I realized that drugs aren't the villain -- rather politicians. Her lectures have been so interesting and engaging and I feel so much more open-minded. You're in for a good time.",1
"Dr. Bushey is a good guy and is very knowledgable in his field. He explains things clearly and tries his hardest to get to everyone's question. There is homework and quizzes every week. I learned a lot in his class, but the one thing that was bothersome was the amount of time allotted on quizzes, it was not nearly enough for me.",1
"I really liked him as a person and a teacher. He taught me more about grammar than my high school teachers had ever taught me (and I still don't know much) He is funny and really wants you to learn. I took an online class with him, but the in-person one was much better! ",1
Probably the worst professor I've ever had. Very inefficient and unclear lectures. Don't think he actually knows the material very well himself. Test questions seem easy but it's impossible to predict what he will demand in terms of answers.,0
"To sum it up, Vannozzi was the absolute worst professor or teacher that I have ever had. He expects you to pass everything in on time, or you will lose 50% of the grade, but it takes him more than a month to pass back homework. He is impossible to make meetings with, he is unclear in his lectures and just does not know how to teach. DO NOT TAKE",0
"Jim and I got off to the wrong foot. At first I hated his class but after the midterm things got better. His assignments are time consuming and there's a TON of them so be prepared. He's a sweet guy and I like him as a person, just not as a professor.",1
Great Prof!!  will take again  The one rater is right.  Dont just sit there.  Helps to speak up in class for sure.  But GREAT discussions.,1
"Fuentes is very funny and nice, but he moves through material very quickly. The labs are fairly boring most of the time and nearly pointless-- just study the packets for practicals. Lab practicals are VERY tough. He gives you a blank sheet of paper and shows you a powerpoint where you either know the answers or you dont.",1
"Dr. Schittjer is extremely difficult.  I had him for an online class through Liberty University.  His papers are very demanding. He is a VERY tough grader. All his instructions are completely different from EVERY other professor at LU, and if you turn in assignments incorrectly you lose LOTS of points.  I'm an A student and got a C+ bc he is RIGID",1
"Great professor. Very friendly and open minded, which is very important  attributes for any sort science professor. In other words, he has no bias point of view. Plus, he's very logical, and at times he shares his personal information as examples to educated the class. One of the best CCP professor's I ever had.",1
He is absolutely AMAZING! A complete riot and wonderful professor. Class is NEVER boring and something new is taught daily. Online homework is a breeze and tests aren't horrible. Studying is necessary for them though.,1
"He's not a difficult prof. but he sucks at teaching and likes to hear himself talk. He'll go off on tangents that have no real importance to the subjects and its unfortunate he's the only surveying lecture prof. I don't know what he's like in labs, but be prepared to deal with a lot of nonsense in his lectures",0
"Pretty chill professor, gets to the point and remember what he says by the way he express his lecture haha. Impossible to fail unless you don't pay attention.",1
"At first, her class was interesting. But it became boring, and she gets off topic quite often. The class ends up being nothing but a debate room. People started skipping more and more as the days went by. She puts people on the spot, and don't expect her to grade you work right away. Overall, her class was so-so.",1
"Mr. Lovell is a very good, consistent, and interesting teacher. I'm glad he's not boring, because class is long as it is. He's seems pretty cool and he teaches great. Keep it up!!",1
This is a wonderful teacher with a beautiful heart .. I highly recommend her because she is very inspirational what she is doing..,1
Great professor. I loved the homework part with the instructions clearly stated online. I particularly loved the online forum.,1
"Dr. Kerber's lectures were hard to follow as she just spewed random facts and she DOES NOT post any lecture slides. Her tests made you recall random, minute details that she mentioned once in one of her unorganized lectures. This course was way harder than the other first year English courses I have taken. Tons of material, too much to remember.",0
BEST PROFESSOR EVER make sure to take his classes.,1
"This guy is outstanding! He really cares about his students, he's very helpful, and he makes the class fun and easy. I highly recommend him to everyone.",1
"He knows his material and he's a personable & friendly teacher. He's a lil oldschool. Do your readings, stay on top of even the small assignments. Grading system is really weird & weighed oddly, so don't come in expecting the normal kind of grading scale or that you know your grade w/o asking him.",1
Had him for lower plants. Feild trips were a blast! I've retained so much from his class for almost 20 years. I've taught my kids all the things I learned from his class. Really freaked out my kids by getting diatoms from goose poo. And I never go hungry when day lillies are about to bloom.,1
I MUST SAY HE HAS BEEN THE BEST TEACHER I HAVE TAKEN AS OF KNOW I WILL MOST DEFINITELY RECOMMEND HIM IF YOUR TAKING 0308 TAKE HIM PLEASE YOU ARE DOING YOUR SELF A FAVOR HE IS AWESOME!!!!!!,1
"At first, I thought I liked Professor Nelson. Her lectures were good and easy to follow. But then when it came to the paper, an article review, she wouldn't listen to criticism about the rubric and didn't post a sample of what the paper should look like until the week before it was due.",0
"Great class. He's a former mayor of Philadelphia and City Council President, so he knows a lot about local government. He doesn't assign much homework, and what he does assign is just a certification that you read something. He does tend to go off on tangents, but they're interesting. Budget simulation at the end of the semester is fun, but hectic.",1
"Fun online lectures, flexible dates on the online class. Probably the best Professor I'll ever have!",1
"Grading contract, so if you do the work, you will get an A+. The class has tons of group discussions to help you towards writing papers, and he will always give feedback to improve. He is an activist himself, but he won't shove his ideas down your throat. You can tell what he cares about by what he gears material towards. I loved this class!",1
"Dr. Chris was my favorite professor. His classes were challenging and lecture heavy with time consuming projects, papers and reading assignments, but he effectively taught the material. His classes were worth investing in. He had a lasting impact on the students who actively participated. I learned more from Dr. Chris than any other professor.",1
"Amazing Teacher, Grades very fairly based on understanding of material and will take half points if he can tell that you know what your talking about but just used the wrong word or something like that",1
"Ok, kids. I had Mrs. O'Donnell back in the 80's. She was tough, but thank god I took her class. From day one after graduation, I was totally comfortable in front of large groups giving presentations. Think she's tough? Late to work like her class and you'll be fired. Learn from her- you WILL use it.",1
"bella is the absolute best. she's so clear, will take time to make sure you don't fall behind, and let's you correct papers to get full marks. she even bumped up a friend's grade to help her get into nursing school. this was my second class with her and I couldn't be happier!",1
"Professor Condray is amazing! She is clear about the notes, she is always there for you when you need her and she gives you the notes all you have to do is study!  ",1
"Professor Gray is an amazing professor who truly cares about student success. She is well informed when it comes to international politics, thus making the class so much more interesting and enjoyable. Lots of extra credit opportunities, straightforward assignments and simple exams. Would definitely take another one of her courses!",1
"This is the most arrogant, conceited, awful prof I have ever had. I only attended class because participation matters, always dreaded going. Make sure you are paying attention, because the second he notices you look away - he will put you on the spot. Don't even think about disagreeing with him. If you are shy and don't like talking in class AVOID!",0
"Dr. Carr (he received his doctorate in Fall 2020) is truly a leader of future leaders. His class is helpful on so many levels and can assist anyone. He makes you read for sure and there are many assignments to help reflect on yourself. He requires a lot and sets high expectations, but it only serves to help you. Dr. Carr is inspirational.",1
"Pay no mind to the below ratings.  This professor is seriously awesome.  The classes are a little boring, long and well dry, but all you have to do  is sit through the class, do easy homework each week and take 2 online tests.  The professor is incredibly smart, nice and hot!",1
"If you struggle with math, I'd highly recommend her class. She explains things throughly. She provides her own lecture notes so make sure you have a printer! Lecture notes are easy to understand. Textbook not required. Typos here & there but we all make mistakes. Super passionate at what she does & cares for her students. Best professor at ELAC!!!",1
"A true gem, she definitely cares about her students and their success. She makes learning fun, but GET READY TO READ!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"Great Professor. She's fair, keeps class interesting, and always willing to help students.",1
"Gail is amazing. After the experiences I had with her in lab, if I were sick and scared in the hospital, I would want her as my nurse. She is very candid, caring, and committed to her student's success. I was intimidated by her at first, but I truly cannot say enough good things about her. She is very accessible and helpful outside of class.",1
"Okay, this man is amazingly funny during his lectures, and makes great analogies along the way. This was my first online class since corona, and this class blew my mind with how funny, interesting, and education it was all thanks to Professor Hazell. At the end, he even bumped my 89.6 average up to a 90 for the A! Helpful, kind, caring, GREAT!",1
"This guy is the most dry, boring professor I have ever had. He makes me dread going to a class that is supposed to be more interactive and hands on. He has 0 personality and speaks with the same monotone voice the whole hour and a half. Zzzzzz...",0
Very open minded and deep lectures; I would recommend her as a professor to everyone willing to become more educated on gender studies.,1
"Hilarious! Great at grabbing your interest. Text was great for first 2/3 of instruction, but last 1/3 is fluency. Text isn't needed if you're trying to save money but was helpful for additional info and some assignments (but you could get that info online if you are good at researching). there's 4 exams and about 5 10pt assignments.",1
Took his IQL class and haven't gotten below a 95 on anything. Take his classes he's the best,1
Great teacher. Very funny and made things interesting,1
"She is friendly and to the point.  If you do the work, you will get the grade you deserve.  This is not a ""cake"" class.  She has real life experience that relates to the coursework.",1
"this class's material seems very difficult, but if you keep up with the ppts and reading, its not all that bad. dr.self is VERY nice,fair, and knowledgeable, not to mention funny. go to class bc he does random iclicker 'quizzes'. USE THE STUDY GUIDE FOR TEST STUDYING (after having read the chps). overall,its a v do-able class, but you MUST study =)",1
"This class is extremely easy and very interesting. She is very sweet, understanding, and smart! Love her and the class.",1
"An amazing professor, you will not regret taking his class. Even though his class was online, he makes it fun. He throws jokes in his writings and he gives good feedback. You will be graded based on you quizzes, exams, and assignments. One extra credit opportunity.",1
"Dr. Hill is there to watch you succeed and she will move mountains to make sure you understand the topics. There are discussion forums, labs, quizzes, and extra credit opportunities given. She also looks into her student evals to improve things for her next class and takes them with pride. Loved her as a teacher",1
"I took him fall 2019 and he was an absolute nightmare. I tried reaching myself from the book like i did with him for orgo 1 but couldnt. Not clear test grading it has nothing to do with lectures/hw, basically you are never prepared. I retook it again this semester with Dr. Proulx and got an A+ if that says anything about him vs a good prof.",0
"She is absolutely amazing! She makes math so easy to understand and if it's not working for you, she will try to find a different way to help you better understand.",1
Doesn't know how to teach or do the examples he shows. Jumps all over the place. Constantly says umm and uhh.,0
This professor is amazing! His lectures are funny and engaging. His workload is not heavy only a few assignments. He provides a study guide for the two exams in his class and has a couple of quizzes due throughout the semester that are super easy. I highly recommend taking this course to get an easy upper division done.,1
"You have got to be kidding me! Ridiculously boring lectures, all class, every class (this is a liberal arts college!), difficult to understand, and a horrible grader. Expects very much from students taking a 100 level course.",0
"He makes simple topics very difficult to understand; you're better off teaching yourself. He is kind of rude when approached with a question, and isn't clear.",0
Great class to think critically about basic beliefs.,1
"Best math professor ever. Cared more about some of the students grades than they themselves did. Committed to your success. Lectures are crystal clear, I now have a new passion for math. Most importantly, I learned a lot and felt challenged to do better. Definitely taking her in the future.",1
"Engaging lecturer, absolutely brilliant thinker, and astonishingly helpful in office hours. Brimming with poise. Her class will push you; whiners need not apply. I learned more in her class than any other so far: new words, new  appreciation, new approaches to lit.  Challenging, but clear and patient when you need help. The next gen. of great profs",1
Valerie is great. She tries to make lectures interesting and always has group activities. You need to show up or you will not pass. All of the assignments are straight forward.,1
"For this being an online course, it was straightforward and easy going. Anything that is to be expected, its on the syllabus. The assignments consist of current events, DBs, & weekly quizzes(textbook is needed for this).  She replies to emails pretty quick. I like how she gives feedback.  As long as you do all the assignments, it can be an easy A!",1
"Best math teacher at LC! He is very in-depth (sometimes too much and you'll zone one a bit) but he is funny, young and relatable. Kept an A in his class all semester.",1
One of my favorite math professors ever!! Kinda awkward but in a good way. He is very clear on what the tests will be on and explains everything extremely well.,1
"Absolutely a wonderful professor!! Mrs. Calkins gives excellent feedback that helps you grow as writer. She gives out quite a work load but it is manageable. She really cares about her students and wants them to achieve great things. Plus, she does not primarily grade on grammar mistakes but rather your paper's content.",1
"His lectures are great and you can just tell he is passionate about the readings he assigns. He takes time to type out notes on the readings and sends it out to the class. He is very accessible over email. He isn't a tough grader if you listen to the lectures and look over his notes. However, do not take if you are not interested in the subject.",1
"Although going to class isn't REQUIRED, I'd recommend it - lectures are useful and Professor Davis shows you how to do problems step-by-step. Don't make the assumption that doing the problems in class is enough - go home and practice. Professor Davis loves to make cheesy jokes in class, and usually the crowd is not receptive, so try to laugh a bit",1
"Dr. Mike is the best! Everything was clear, his exam reviews are very comprehensive, and he's actually pretty funny. The class is five days a week instead of four but so worth the exam review days. Dr. Mike spends tons of hours in the help room during exam week and is willing to move around office hours to help. Highly recommend him for physics!",1
I thought we were suppose to be refining what's in our minds and not what's in her mind. He assignments felt like she was mining her students for info that would help her next book of criticism. She gives a lot of work and very little valid feedback. I'd look for a more generous teacher whose easier on your grades.,0
"Alynn was a great prof for KIN! She is very enthusiastic and her lectures are actually engaging. I found the material for this course not to be hard, it just definitely takes some studying.",1
"I actually took this professor for HRM 444. I was really nervous about the amount of group work, but it actually wasn't bad. There is homework every week, but it's a reasonable amount. Gives good feedback, but isn't a super tough grader. Do the work and you will do very well in the class!",1
She provides not enough feedback on papers so it is hard to know where to improve to get it to where she likes it. Everything is in her perspective and if you offer a different view-point she shuts it down immediately so there is no chance of your opinion being taken into consideration.,1
"He's a decent professor, but you're going to have to take really detailed notes in order to do well. Really tough paper grader. He's all about respect, expects you to almost worship him in class - kind of old fashioned in the way he runs his classes. The final exam was absolutely brutal, hardest exam I've ever taken - his study guide is insane.",1
Many of Dr. Hines' lectures build upon one another. Skipping class is not a good idea as you will fall behind on these lectures. Attendance is graded by REEF polling questions. Go to class and keep speed with the lectures and it's an easy A.,1
"Professor Easterling is a great professor! She wants you to do well in her class. She is helpful if needed and you should get an A if you complete all of your reading assignments, questions and case study.",1
"His Philosophy of Science class is tough material, but he's a great guy and very nice. Majority of class is discussion, and there are only papers for assignments so if you do bad on those you're screwed. He's very willing to help though. I'd take a course with him again for sure",1
I definitely do NOT reccomend this professor. his quizzes had nothing to do with the material learned in class and his loud teaching style makes it hard to comprehend,0
"Boy oh boy, I have zero clue hoe this man has been a professor for so long. This man intentionally fails his students. I spent 3 hours doing a homework assignment for his class to only receive a 2 out of 10!! I've never met a professor who does this. I'm happy he's retiring, he definitely won't be missed. Definitely appealing to get my money back",0
"Dr. Avila is a great professor.  The A will not be handed to you, you must work for your grade.  You get a quiz almost every time you meet. She is a more than fair grader.",1
"Sensei is so awesome...He is very clear..Have I learned more Japanese in one semster the taking 8 years of Spanish...He makes it fun and easy to learn the language...Highly recommended and cannot wait til next semster...Warning: Class is fast passed, very quick....",1
Nico is a great teacher that is willing to take the time to explain material in detail to students that need help. Don't take the class if you're not ready to study.,1
"Dr. Chalk has been one of my favorite professors at Manhattan College so far. She is funny, very easy-going,approachable, and extremely knowledgeable. She does assign quite a bit of work and reading, but nothing unbearable. Participation is key in her class, and she is a very fair grader. Essays can be difficult but do help you absorb the material.",1
"She's such a cool professor. She's very down to earth and willing to do anything to help you understand the material. She gives a lot of essays, but she isn't a very hard grader. She likes to really get to know her students, she doesn't just see you as an obligation.",1
"This teacher uses positive reinforcement to help students feel comfortable. I get nervous when I sign and she helped me overcome that. Enjoyable class, learned a bunch.",1
"Robert Scherbaum taught my online CIS class. Communication was superb, instructions clear, syllabus complete, and grades were posted promptly. He was super helpful and I highly recommend him as a teacher.",1
Really great teacher and fun class! take it if you can get in.,1
He keeps this fairly interesting. Not a challenging class by any means. He is big on textbook reading and the book is definitely not small.,1
****er droped me from his class becasue he had a retarted senior who needed it,0
"For my class he had a tendency to go over the class time by a few minutes, so that was frustrating but overall he really cares about what he's teaching and has lots of good stories",1
"She is so great! Her lectures are the perfect length, and then you do group work after. If you dont understand something, shell take the time needed for you to get it. Theres a quiz everyday, but its only 1-2 questions. Her style of teaching is so amazing and easy to understand! The tests are long, but nothing to avoid the class for. Awesome!!!",1
"As a result of her ""ramblings,"" I considered an alternate career path- which I have never regretted.  In addition, when I met my then future spouse, he echoed my opinion that she was one of the most influential people in my life.  An incredible, intelligent person.  Sometimes it takes years before you recognize someone's role as life changing...",1
"She is very clear when explaining questions in class, and cares if students are actually learning. She is helpful and when there is clearly a problem fixes it fairly for students.",1
"This guy doesn't know how to explain anything, he is a harsh grader, and doesnt know how to speak English, dont take him.",0
"Buckle up, and enjoy the ride!",0
Hes devoted to physics,1
"Professor Woods was a terrible first choice. She over explains way too much, gives enormous amounts of homework that barely count for anything, grades HEAVILY on tests, and thinks the entire world revolves around her class. Had to drop her to save myself from miserable failure.",0
"I took him for all 3 Calculus classes, and he was amazing. Even though his lectures took forever, it was due to him trying to answer every question and trying to clarify as detailed as he can. Homework is optional, but the quizzes have multiple attempts, and the tests are fair. He is also a hilarious guy.",1
"Very Helpful, Wants her students to pass .",1
"Ive taken all of the calculus sequences and passed with an A in all of them. Hes a great lecturer, but often his lessons are not as structured as you may expect. He always told us that he lectures off the homework, meaning he will display the homework problems and base his lecture off how to solve that problem set. Hes a great and funny teacher.",1
"Lisa was such a comprehensive teacher. She asks for your own input on the assignments given, extra time, etc. She is not such a harsh grader either and her comments are always helpful. However, her class drags. It can seem like forever until it is time to leave. Have to constantly keep waking yourself up.",1
"Excellent professor. Interesting, intelligent, and a wonderful sense of humor. The class isn't the easiest, but her lectures are clear and the tests are very straightforward. Highly recommended!",1
"Do all of your work, otherwise, you won't pass. Just like any other class. Accounting is not easy. Don't take this class yet if you're not savvy with Excel, she'll leave you in the dust. If you show her you're working hard, she'll be lenient with your grade. START THE COMPREHENSIVE PROBLEM EARLY (IF APPLICABLE).",1
"This is a case of a guy that thinks he is good and that he knows stuff. Yet, once you finish your degree you realize that he was one of these profs that have done very little in their academic life and they just put up a big act. Pathetic!",0
"I was very excited to have Rachael as a teacher due to all the good things people say about her. However, she is completely unorganized, expects participation but doesn't give engaging lectures or ask good questions and then blames it on the students. BUT 505 is insanely easy course with her.",0
Such a sweet lady. really patient with her students and takes her time with whatever you may need help with. Easier than all of the other A&P lab teachers meaning no hidden tricks or surprises on the tests!! everything is straight forward from what she gives you and its all the easy basic material. Easier class to pass!!,1
This prof is funny and sets up lectures that are interactive and don't put you to sleep. He cares about his students and that they learn the content. His course helped me learn skills that I am using in my business placement and in other courses as well. Thanks for the great semester.,1
"Not a good proff!!, very hard marker if you disagree with his opinions,which happens often!",1
She grades very hard on your writing.  You could be an awesome writer in you whole school career but with her your writing will suck.,0
"If you're going to take chem 101, take it with kieswetter. One of the hardest classes at this school, but she explains everything very well. Very caring and accessible. Pay attention during her lectures and do the homework and you'll be fine.",1
DO NOT TAKE. I repeat: do. not. take. 90% of our class is struggling big time. I am a straight A student and currently fighting to pass... The material is hard enough to understand and his lectures are of no help. I have never experienced something like this.  ,0
prof rodriguez is a great professor. there is really only one concern i had. He doesnt really answer his emails promptly which can cause alot of confusion. overall it is a good class to take. The final project is a little tough but as long as you show some effort youll get the credit. ,1
"I would never recommend takeing her she doesnt teach well enough, if you are one or two minutes late she will mark you absent. i learned absoulety nothing in her class.i should have drop her!!",0
"There tended to be confusion on the grading scale often. Rogers course was simply laid out, PowerPoint then group quiz. There was a research paper at the end of the course. She is a difficult women to get ahold of. On the plus side, she is incredibly good natured- she jokes and allows for discussion within the class.",1
"Wonderful! No words can describe how great she is. When a student falls behind or doesnt understand, she will make sure the student understands before moving on. Great help and she cares about her students. If you can get her as an instructor, then do so.",1
"One of the best professors Ive had. I had her at Epcc and loved every class. Shes compassionate and caring, willing to work with you. Not a stressful class. She knows how to laugh, isnt tough like a lot of other professors.",1
"Best math professor I've ever taken in elac, he's helpful,learn a lot,homework and quizzes are online, love this class",1
Loved this teacher. Would definitely take again. Super nice and knowledgeable. Definitely a teacher who cares about her students and their success.,1
"I REALLY enjoyed her course ! It's clear from the beginning what she expects from you during the course. She provides excellent feedback. She responds almost immediately to emails and questions. She's very timely with grading, so you know where you stand academically in the course. If you are looking for a dedicated and caring professor, she's it.",1
Professor Higham is very intelligent when it comes to mathematics. If you struggle with math he's your guy! He is very fair and when you pose a question or request he will consider it and be fair with his answer. He is very goofy when you get to know him. He could spice the class part up as he just teaches problem after problem. I liked him though,1
"I took this class for my major for fall semester. Hes really funny in the beginning like what all Professors will do. When he lecture, someone ask questions, he would somehow answer it but the student still dont get it. I would rate more but the characters are limited. My advice is that if youre majoring math and want good grade then avoid him.",0
Class is easy enough. Lectures are clear. Do the work and you'll be fine.,1
"I loved her class.  I have a good math background, so it wasn't that hard for me.  If you do have problems though, she'll help you as much as she can.",1
Great teacher. Extremely helpful and super energetic. She enjoys teaching and it shows. She doesn't like late work .  Show up to class because that's where most of her assignments are given and completed,1
"Love this guy, he's makes sure everyone is following, lectures are very thorough, and he's very nice and supportive. If you get stuck and email him about a project he will provide links to additional info that's very helpful. Makes data structures easier.",1
Awesomeness.,1
"Chemistry is by no means an easy subject, but Dr. K made this class manageable. If you have to take chemistry, TAKE IT WITH DR. K!! She is brilliant and her lectures are clear and to the point. Also, willing to help you out outside of class if need be. A very fast paced course, however I learned a lot from her. Would absolutely take her again!",1
He is an ok teacher. He gives a lot of oppertunity for extra credit. His main goal is to have everyone pass the class. There is a lot of reading to be done by yourself. Tests are easy if you know the bold faced terms and trend on maps. I am sure there are much better teachers but he is not horrible.,1
I would not recommend any student taking his class unless you are majoring in sociology! He is a very tough grader and doesnt work well with his students.,0
"Great teacher, good communication",1
"In my opinion, she is a very caring teacher and is very good at teaching the material. She would have live weekly sessions where she would go over the chapter and would explain the material that we should know from the test. I did feel her tests were challenging and to get an A on the tests seemed hard. Her labs seemed pretty simple.",1
"Not a good prof...teaches orgo straight from the book and if you don't understand it there, you're screwed.",0
"Professor Schlortt isn't a normal history teacher, he is not date heavy, and unlike other professors' he understands that life happens, so he is flexible with due dates but don't take advantage of it.",1
"Easy A if you show up, and even if you dont, he sends out ALL the info you need for the final. Your grade depends only on the final so you can never come to class, study the guide he sends out and pass- but I suggest actually going its FASCINATING if youre interested in Philo.",1
One of the best professors! Attendance and participation are not required. He takes tough philosophical concepts and breaks it down very easily for everyone. He is clear on what he wants and he reviews for days before the final. Take him if you want to get a solid education!,1
"David has one of the strangest, most effective teaching methods. There are no exams, textbooks, and simple assignments make up most of your grade. This leaves most of the 2-hour lectures up for class discussions and actual real world applications of marketing. David knows his stuff and isn't afraid to show it - just brace yourself for a LOT of sass",1
"Fantastic Prof.  Very passionate about what he is teaching.  Readings are a little on the heavy side, but really interesting.",1
"Super fun professor. He always tells a ridiculous joke at the beginning of class. I never opened my book or did the homework, but he gives take home quizzes that let you know what to expect on the tests. Made potentially confusing material very clear. Aweomse professor!",1
"Honestly just feels like he doesn't care about students and receives a lot more joy from getting to take points away from students than seeing them succeed. Terrible lecturer, decent slides, understood nothing from him talking, most things from the slides when he didn't use 500 slides to make a simple point.",0
"THE worst. He is so unprepared, inconsistent & unorganized for every class. The syllabus he uses is from about 10 years ago and never matches with whats actually going on. He has high expectations yet doesn't teach the information well, and makes it like his job is not a priority of his...very disappointing all around",0
"Lectures were a bit boring, and the readings covered basically the entirety of lecture so I found there wasn't much need to attend except to learn the answers to extra credit questions on the test. Discussion covers anything that they reading may not have had in regards to the lecture anyways.",1
"This guy is great. Honest and funny. He gives valuable real-life advice/information along with class material. Knows his stuff. If you have a chance, take his class.",1
This class was not what I expected. this teacher is all about journalism and he should stick with that only. MCOM 63 was about new media and all we did were videos. very disappointing class. He's helpful when one on one but very rude if its in front of the class. take a different teacher for MCOM 63,0
"Great professor. Loves the subject. He is very helpful and you can tell he wants everyone to be able to pass. If you don't study for the tests you will not pass this class. It's not one you sleep through for an A. He takes attendance twice. Overall, great class. I would take him again.",1
"Really nice guy. Sometimes isn't great at explaining things, but he is good enough. Homework is easy and the tests are based off of it. One group project. Pretty straight forward. If you want a class to enjoy, this is the one.",1
"He's a great teacher not to tough but he will make sure everyone participates, He has some interesting lectures and is pretty informative.",1
The class was split in three parts or times in literature. We were tested at the end of each part. As long as you read and participated in discussion you will pass. exams consit of object exam and written essay exam.  The end of the class a research paper will be due. You have about two weeks to complete. Teacher replies to emails within a day.,1
"At first, I was dreading this 5:30pm class, but Dr. Heske made the course exciting and bearable. He is a great professor and is always available to give feedback and help with topics. His tests are fair and only cover the written notes. If you work hard and seek help when needed, you can get an A or B in the course. PCHEM is not that bad!",1
"Hard to summarize this course because Carter makes it a kind of overwhelming total experience of intellectual life. Nice balance between being really demanding and also being really chill about how demanding the class could feel. I'll remeber this class forever. Tibetan bowl meditation wa so good. A few short papers, long readings, and final paper.",1
"Richard Drake is not a good professor if you want to learn about what you actually signed up for. Much of his lectures do not actually have to do with the course material, and many of the quizzes and tests do not actually apply to what he is talking about. Terrorism in Modern America is the most frustrating class I have ever been in.",0
I thought Michelle Hunt was an amazing professor. She's so friendly and enthusiastic about anatomy. She is very helpful and cares about the success of her students. Her tests are tough so be sure to pay attention in class. If you're struggling  with a concept in the class don't hesitate to go to her office hours or email her.,1
"I ended up having to drop this class. During the lectures he would continually get off topic and when I would ask a question, it wouldn't get answered properly. He would assign us 200-400 problems a week of online homework, which I was never able to complete, even after spending five days a week in the learning lab. I would not recommend taking him",0
"good, easy if she likes you",1
Lovely prof he is very caring and willing to help. Gives good study guides for exams and the final. Lectures are not super boring like many math lectures. I highly recommend Professor Kuhlman!,1
"Took it online. Was available, had everything ready on time and split it into digestible chunks. Took an online teaching course beforehand and it showed. Really tried hard to help us succeed in the pandemic. Hilarious dry humor.",1
"Completely disagree with other comments.  Great teacher with true concern for the students.  A study guide was given for each exam and the tests came straight from the guide.  The powerpoints were posted on her website prior to lectures.  Many animations and other aids to help in learning were provided.  She was tough, but very fair and caring.",1
"He was new I am assuming by the way he taught. Tried real hard to get discussions going. When it comes to politics he didn't show which side he was on which was a plus. I didn't read the book but did the study guides he offered. Lots of notes, take pics of his PowerPoint slides. Tests aren't hard. Class still had my interest in Criminal justice.",1
Go to  class,1
Un des meilleurs profs d'HEC !,1
"Phenomenal professor. Take his as much as you can, as often as you can. While the readings are complex, his explanations in class make them simple to understand and extrapolate from. He is, self-admittedly, atrocious at email, but is readily available in office hours and to meet by appointment. A fascinating person inside and out of class. Take.",1
"Such a sweet and intelligent man! He is always willing to listen to comments in class, is very punctual in answering emails and will work with you to get a good grade. A little monotone perhaps, but as long as you're willing to try and answer the random questions he throws at you--it stays interesting! Great class & material. Go Professor Lawrence!",1
No Comments,1
"Ian Green is by far the best teacher or professor that I have ever had. He definitely expects a lot out of his students, but he always keeps his classes interesting by making his students actually think. If I could take every class from him for the rest of my college career I would. Plus, he's funny and an all-around cool guy.",1
"He's a really nice guy. He's much nicer than most accounting profs. He is strict about being there one time, so please just come on time. Class isn't too difficult, just a lot of homework.",1
I'm currently talking his 100 level class and it is a wast of my money and effort. He give no slack and I'm trying my very hardest. They way he gives his test makes it very hard to pass. He teaches as if it is a 300 level class. I don't recommend him unless you are really into geology.,0
"Dr. K is great and makes the lab super simple. Very laid back, all you had to do was listen and follow instructions. You can tell Dr.K enjoys what he does and it really shows. Highly recommended to those who need to take microbiology.",1
"this is a research writing class so prepare to write like all the time. she gives good feedback and wants your papers to be good so that helps, if you go to class and just listen to her instructions on the different sections you will understand. Sometimes the class meetings are pointless, but its the not worse thing",1
Online course was extremely difficult. Dr. Melendez was not available for any study sessions or help. No video lectures or meeting. He would unlock the week's chapter and you were on your own. Took several days to respond to emails.,0
"Very good teacher! Took his land forms class in the spring and liked him so much I took the weather and climate part in the fall. Very helpful and friendly and easy to talk to and get along with. Super funny and nice, even though some of his jokes are kind of corny.",1
"Professor Jones is the best you learn she does not sugar coat and she does move fast. Do your homework, be an active note taker and read over the lecture notes prior to the lecture.",1
"Very thorough in his explanations, but he moves pretty quickly through his lectures. Willing to help during office hours. Would recommend for Micro. Read material and do the homework. Attend class, because his lecture notes are crucial.",1
I don't think I've ever had more fun in a class. The rock and roll material was so interesting and she teaches it in such a great way. Shes funny and her tests are amazingly easy. WOULD TAKE AGAIN!,1
Such an amazing teacher. Definitely my favorite. Sghe made class so fun. She does this cute little head twist when.... Well you'll see lol.,1
"He's a really nice guy, will try to work with you if you meet him during his office hours, is a bit tough with grading and gives heavy assignments. Lots of reading but if you don't get them you can just pay really close attention during class.",1
"Just an awful class, if you want to see how to do a class wrong this is it. None of the work that he goes over in class has anything to do with the tests. Thompson is very lazy when it comes to being a professor he puts an absolutely the least amount of effort anybody could possibly put in. All of his tests that trick questions",0
"I hnonestly can say that Leslie Looney is the only reason I go to class (that, and the iclicker credit). I can't say that I've actually learned anything in this class, though Looney is fairly entertaining.",1
"Professor Lawrence is my favorite professor. Incredible! He really cares about his students. He grades based on improvement, which I really enjoy. He gets the class involved and teachings in a way that sparks growth and improvement. Incredible teacher! I'm taking the second half of the class next semester.",1
"Take this instructor! Worth the drive to whichever campus she's teaching at. Does not skip steps in the problem, explains everything, gives points for attendance, tests come straight from reviews. I love this instructor.",1
"Don't know much about him as I took the course online. Seemed pretty vanilla, just basic computer stuff. Class was moderately difficult but routine and pretty much existed within the SAM program.",1
"Gives good instruction, really helpful hints and critique, and fosters a positive environment.  Is respectful to all levels of painting skill, encourages deeper thought. Would like her to accomodate students whose focus isn't painting (i.e. don't require so many expensive supplies, spend so much time on non-basic info.",1
I wish Id have rated Professor Epstein back when I completed this course in 2017. His class was extremely enjoyable and though he over-elaborated at times it always related to class topics. He was always ready to answer a linguistics question and was very kind. I wish that I could have taken another of his classes.,1
"She's uninterested in helping students & ambiguous in all of her communications. She will berate you at her discretion without taking the time to understand your communication. She's a terrible professor who takes ""jumping to conclusions"" to a whole new level. She grades inconsistently. I learned nothing from her class; it's all busywork.",0
"Dr. Kelly is hands down the BEST prof I have ever had. He is hilarious, extremely smart (he's a freaking M.D.) and is the most caring individual there is. Tests are fair, so make sure you study and take notes in class. There's not a lot of pts in the class, but it's easy enough. 100% 10/10.",1
"Greg is my favorite prof at Highline. He isn't a prof who seems particularly invested in his students, but his appreciation for good work and good participation in class is admirable and respectable. I have taken multiple classes with him and work with him on projects even now that I'm not in class with him. Excellent prof, hilarious too.",1
"funny professor, tests are easy if attend lecture! however, the powerpoints and recordings are posted online! his grading scale makes it difficult to get A's, but he does offer make up essay for missed questions on exams. very interesting class!",1
"Prof. Perez is a very nice and helpful teacher. Super easy A, if you love writing.",1
"She is very tough, her grading method will hunt down your grade. She says that she is tough, and the test will be tough. You study very well, and you know the material, but the questions in tests are so specific that you don't know what she is talking about. Be ready for a lot of tricky questions. DON'T FOLLOW HER STUDY GUIDE, just study everything",0
Maureen is the <b>best</b> teacher I have <i>ever</i> had. I know I can speak for all her students that she is very understanding and helpful.  I have learned so much from her in 2 semesters!,1
He was the highlight of my freshman year! He is encouraging and always lets you know what you should study in order to succeed in his class. He is funny yet is serious about his love of genetics. Respect this class and he will respect you!,1
"In the beginning the class may seem difficult, but it eventually gets better. He has quizzes open for only a 24 hour period on a SUNDAY. Which is pretty inconvenient. He is nice and will try to assist as much as possible, but he can also get pretty defensive. Not too hard of class in general, lectures are just extemeley boring! Attendance matters!",1
"Midterm is 45% and final is 55% of your grade, so pay attention. Textbook super helpful, lectures even more so. If you're thinking about law school his classes will let you know if you want/can/should go to law school.",1
The book is mandatory and youll have to lean heavily on it in order to study for lab practicals. He will come around and help; if you ask. If possible come In outside of lab to look at your cat. Make sure you know how to correctly spell everything. Always work on something during lab(its 4 hrs) hell get upset if you arent doing anything.,1
"Scanlon is a very funny, but sarcastic person. He might come off as stand-offish sometimes, but he is a very good professor. It just depends on your sense of humor. Overall he is very good at explaining things, but you are required to put forth a lot of effort too if you want to pass this class.",1
Professor Swift is a great guy that wants his students to succeed. The class was one of the easier maths I've taken and he's very clear about his expectations. ,1
Probably the most undeserving B+ I've ever received. He's aware that he's a difficult grader and blames the students for how boring the class is when the material he provides is extremely uninteresting. He has a monotone voice and a very awkward and quirky sense of humor. Could appeal to some but not worth it.,1
"Lots of reading, but not a tough grader",1
"Madness. This teacher took an incredible subject such as ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY and made it mind numbingly boring. Shes an incredibly nice person and she means well, plus her kindness can not be over stated but this class is SO BORING.... it should be a class that stimulates a psych student to thirst for more!!! But, I regret taking this teacher!",0
"Not a terribly difficult course, but you need to not only do the questions and sample exams that are online but also listen to his lectures posted on iTunes U. The exams itself are a bit more difficult than the sample exams posted and there are questions asked where there are no examples. If you study and put in the work, the class isn't hard",1
She is kind hearted and hard working. Not well organized. She knows the subject well.,1
"This is by far the most confused I've ever been in a class while at CSULA. She is very nice but these topics can be very boring. you have to do a 30 minute group presentation. midterm, and 3 final essays three pages each.",1
Online lectures and textbook did not provide enough information to complete assignments. Instructor not as accessible as needed.,0
"I've taken 2 classes with Brian McKenna-Rice, and I'll be taking another one with him next semester. He genuinely wants his students to succeed and makes himself available to assist them, as needed. Brian is very knowledgeable in his field and has a lot to offer his students. His method of instruction is very laid back and interactive. 2 thumbs up!",1
"Professor Endlich is such a sweet professor and really caring, she gives you a clear criteria of what and how she is grading, also the work in class is really easy, there might be a lot of work but it's really simple and as long as you keep up with it and put commitment to the class.",1
"A good professor, sometimes difficult to understand, and tests were extremely difficult.  Luckily, he had practice tests in the library that were modeled off of his actual tests.  I did learn a lot from his class though.",1
Participate weekly and you will succeed. Follow her feed back verbatum and you will not have a problem passing the class. Really helpful.,1
"She is by far my favorite prof. so far! She gives good lectures that aren't boring because she does so many examples and scenarios. Would definitely recommend the class as well, you learn SO MUCH about relationship maintenance.",1
I was a bit scared since I am not a photo major. But i do really enjoyed her class. Her canvas is very organized. She sent out weekly reminders for your to-dos that week and she gives big extra credit assignments. The tests are a bit heavy and require you to learn a lot of information. But all other assignments are pass/no pass! Take her !!,1
"Jesilow uploads powerpoints and audio of the lecture, so if you miss a class you can catch up online.  There are attendance questions on the test that are based on his thoughts  or on certain subjects.  You really have to read and study hard to get a good grade in this class.  This class is not for people looking to get an easy A.",1
"Not accessible outside of class. She rarely answers emails, missed many office hours without giving notice, and does not post most grades. The tests and quizzes were very error prone so make sure you check all of your assignments. However, she makes it extremly difficult to do so. The class was much easier before we transitioned to online though.",0
"I have always loved History Theory but Rob ruined the class for me and many others. He puts down students publicly, wastes our time when we have group assignments that need to be finished within 2 hours, and grades unfairly. He gives the same grades to students in group assignments that do nothing or do everything. He needs to fix this class.",0
Great guy,1
Easiest and best class I've taken at UO. He gives the answer to every class clicker quiz so just show up. The tests are exactly like his lectures... sometimes you get out early. Go to tutoring for mikes bikes. There is literally no reason anyone should get below a B in this class. He's very helpful and the homework is easy.,1
"This was by far my favorite class at USC because of both the material covered & Paul Young himself. The guys an absolute legend who truly cares about all of his students. If you have the chance, take one of his classes.",1
"Listen-DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH ALINA. She is inconsistent. This professor will say one thing (especially at her office hours) and do just the opposite.  She will say attendance is NOT mandatory, but then publicly embarrass you.  DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH HER. you will REGRET it!!!! If you can avoid this class, take it with another professor.",0
He knows a lot about Eastern Religions and in Comparative Religion that is what we mainly focused on.  I was very disappointed that we did not spend more than a couple of days on Judaism and Christianity.  Also his lecture on Christianity was very skewed and would not give a non-Christian any idea of what Christianity is about.,1
Amazing man. Caring and  very helpful. Statistics is not easy and he does everything to assist. Thought I would fail this class but got an A. He really wants his student to do well  .,1
"Great teacher, uses every resource available to help teach!!! Keep up the good work Brett!",1
Im so happy I took this class this semester. She is absolutely one of the best teachers I have had in saddle back. I learned alot.,1
"Yes, she's a great human being, but she's arguable the worst professor. She does not stick to the syllabus at all and is the most subjective grader there is. She doesn't allow for any creativity because it goes against her beliefs which I think is counterintuitive to an ethnic studies course. Almost impossible to get an A in unless you are her BFF.",0
"Took her online 8 week course... I loved it. You need to commit to it. Keep in mind this is a Rhetoric and Composition class, so you will need to write. If you are proactive, she appreciates it and really works with you. You can't wait last minute to turn stuff in. I stuck to a schedule and got an A.  I loved her class.",1
He's really sweet and wants to make sure his students pass. He was willing to hold extra office hours on Saturdays the week of an exam. However it was really hard to understand him because of his heavy accent. It's hard to get what he's saying the in class so I recommend recording his lectures and listening to them when studying.,1
"Patty definitely does love the subject she teaches, and is a very nice person.  However, her classes are very dull and boring, and usually cover material that never appears on tests.  Her marking is also really hard! I would avoid taking a class with her at all costs!",0
"Her class was teh best one I took at NYU.  She's brilliant and interesting, not at all just rote versions of theory.  She's original and interesting and helpful.  Take her class!!",1
He's good at explaining concepts and making chem easy to understand. It's very possible to get As on his tests if you go to class and study for them. I would recommend taking his class if it's important to you to actually learn chemistry but also have a fair chance of getting an A.,1
"Garbage! Should be thrown out of teaching entirely. No piazza, no slides, nothing but his snide, long-winded lectures and demeaning jokes about any student that asks a question. I'm disgusted that I had to pay to take this guys class. He thinks he's god gift to man, constantly preening himself, but he never actually provides any value to my degree",0
I have taken several classes with Prof. Pave and am registered for even more in the fall. He is very type A (So am I) so it is helpful when you receive daily instruction. He responds to any questions via student email very quickly and goes above and beyond for his students to make sure you understand the course work. I can't wait for the fall!!,1
"Dr Sam is a good lecturer. He knows his stuff and he makes the class interesting and easy for everybody. He explains things if you do not understand and he does not go out of the syllables for his exams which are good to take. Although i don't have an A yet, bc we just took the practical exam, i am pretty confident of one.",1
Mr. Randolph made Honors Leadership fun. I really enjoyed his lectures and he was always helpful if I had any concerns about anything on campus. He's one the sharpest dressers on campus too. Definitely a role model to look up to. ,1
"Truly one of the best professors I've had. He does give a lot of homework and it's a hard class, but he genuinely tries to make it as easy as possible for students while making sure we are still learning. The exams are just like the HW. He interacts with the class during lecture a lot so its engaging, he's funny, and very approachable. Great prof",1
Overpaid,0
She failed to teach things well to the point I learned more about U.S history in my Africa class. She spent two whole days going over Indians in the new world and spent maybe five minutes on the American revolution. Her class is random crap she decides to talk about. She repeats things differently and goes too fast. Powerpoints were useless.,0
She's truly amazing. She was very kind and caring. Accounting Was Very Difficult An Dry. She seemed understanding An was always willing to help. She made herself as available as possible for any help students needed. She suggested tutors math lab anything that would help the students. There is a lot to remember so learn how to study accounting,1
"Easy class, but he is rude to students. Doesn't answer questions well, and is very short with students. If you are confused, good luck.",0
"Just say no, and stay away or youll be sorry. I dont even know where to begin on how bad this course is. You will need to teach yourself because what he tests on has nothing to do with the lectures that He drones on about. If youre trying to get into a limited access program then definitely stay far away Because this course could ruin it",0
hardest class I've taken by far... He is intimidating. He leaves you guessing on the homework assignment will just expect you you to know how to do it. ,1
LOVED this class & loved bens lectures!! such an interesting class & he is very knowledgeable in the subject. easy A if you show up & pay attention. amazing & low stress class 10/10!!!,1
Professor Liao is good but he goes a little too quick. Expects you to know your Math125 when you come in. Does not explain step by step but if you ask he'll come up to you and explain until you understand. Homework is due on the day of the test. Test questions are easier than homework ones. Drops one test. Will provide formulas in exams.,1
"He allows you to bring one page(both sides)of notes to the exam. Second, homework are really easy; if you just finish it and there are some mistakes, he will still give you full points. I'm taking his class this quarter and I got 138 out of 150 for the first chapter exam. Plus, English is my second language.",1
This professor is willing to explain things and he explains it articulately. Very kind me analytical person. I would definitely take the class again. Not sure the e,1
"Dr. Capper is an excellent teacher but his tests are downright cruel! He believes that when students come to his class, they will have no other classes. His tests do not reflect a student's learning and they are highly unfair.",1
"Really despised this class. The textbook was awful, had a lot of useless information that you HAD to read through to do well on the quizzes. You basically need a LOT of time to do well in this course. The final exam had 80 MCQ and one hour and a half to complete which was not enough at all. One of the worst grades on my record.",0
Best HR course ever taken!,1
She is the best! Take her class and you will not regret it!,1
"For an adjunct. teacher, I really enjoyed her class. This was a law class, so there were no hands on but she makes the topic interesting and fun to listen to. Her quizzes and tests are super easy and she only has 2 or 3 the whole semester. DON'T BE LATE TO CLASS! If you show up to every class and get an A, you don't have to take the final.",1
"Professor Bachmann was really good. She is really corny but hilarious. No tests or hard worksheets. There are 2 essays but fairly easy. Attendance is mandatory, but you'll pass if you miss 2-3 lectures. Just pay attention and take notes. Overall, an easy A.",1
"Kumu Keao was amazing.  His lectures are a little redundant because he sticks with the same story over a period of a few classes, but that's just to help reiterate the lessons that are being taught   You have to turn in assignments on time, ONLINE on Laulima, but he is very understanding if something comes up.  Communication is key for this class",1
Lectures can be hard to follow. Really nice and will always help you.,0
"Funny, but lazy and class was an insane waste of time after the first test. If he didn't feel like teaching he'd just pop in a movie. Sounds easy but his tests were intentionally tricky to make it seem like his class was harder than it really was. Wouldn't take again.",0
"I gained a lot of respect for Dr. Prasad as a professor because she knows her chemistry. She ensures the students understand the course work through project based learning. Showing up to class is very important, as a day missed can be costly. Her method of teaching ensures we read before we come to class, making her lectures a walk in the park!",1
"She is a tough grader, during lectures she does give out good ideas that you wouldnt normally think about. There are about 1 inside the class essay. I believe overall she is narcissistic and no matter how hard you try; it still isnt good enough for his standards.",0
"""Fatbody"" If you pay attention you will do fine, but this guy is so unorganized and out to lunch it's unbeleivable. some of the stuff he says will just make you dumber, he likes to make up his own words too which is kind of funny.",0
Professor Williams is really passionate about what he does. I think it was just the fact that it was a Tuesday and Thursday schedule that made this class a little bit of a drag. I can genuinely say I learned a lot in this material and I enjoyed it. Cool dude and gives many opportunities for extra credit.,1
"I was absolutely terrified to take FIN, but Dr. Bliss made it SO easy. The exams are based on the study guides he releases about a week before the exam, it's easy to practice with the weekly homework, and we also had weekly extra credit. Best professor for this class, hands down.",1
"I think he's a good teacher, you are given the chance to do very well in his class, but he does the most with work and grading. He grades homework like its a final. Even if you get the right answer you can end up w a 70. He also has you take a final +quiz after + write a final paper. Also picks favorites with no jurisdiction- easier on favorites.",1
I love Christine. Favourite prof in CYC by FAR. She is so knowledgeable and always challenges and pushes her students. She really cares about her students and their personal lives and takes this into consideration. She is super reliable when you need help and works so hard to make sure she's available to her students. Amazing seminar too.,1
"It was difficult for me to understand his lectures. He has some resources that may help his students on blackboard, but his study guides did not help me at all. I would study early for upcoming exams and I would barely pass it. What saved my grade was the lab assignments, lab tests, and the homework.",0
"I signed up thinking this would be a fun French film class. He has taught it before and made that clear, heres the catch... it was a new book. He gave insane amounts of homework for absolutely no reason then we spent the whole class GOING OVER the homework. I learned nothing at all. Grading criteria was switched two weeks before the final.",0
"My biggest gripe about this class was that the assignments were incredibly complex, often taking even the most adept 20-30 hours of work, with little margin for error. Often the labs and assignments felt like moving targets with key information and corrections in assignment requirements changed the night before due dates or mid-lab",1
"This professor was the absolute worst I have ever had. She gets off topic almost daily; you forget what it was you were supposed to be discussing. Her idea of ""teaching"" is having students discuss with no help or input from her.  Critical research paper halfway through the semester but gives no help on it. Everyone in my class got a 1! Sanity? Nope",0
Tough grader. Rude. Stubborn.,0
McGurr is boring but pretty straight-forward with regards to exams and homework. Gives good study guides and extremely helpful homework sessions.,1
Amazing instructor! Very enthusiastic and took the time for study groups outside of class. I wish he taught every subject.,1
"I took her Communications class for food, agriculture and natural resource majors. Dr. Swenson is very clear on what she wants for assignments and very willing to help, you just need to take the initiative. The textbook for this class is a joke & much of it is common sense but read it ALL, she loves to tie the book concepts into lectures & quizzes.",1
"I struggled w/ Math my entire life until I took Prof. Ball. He's accessible & cares that you understand - allows you to ask all the questions you need answered. Absolutely the BEST math teacher I've taken in my life! He breaks it down until you comprehend the material & is patient with you but most importantly, will not judge you for not knowing.",1
"JAMS 505 with Rachel was great! Her lecture were interesting and she threw in some extra credit very often as long as you showed up. Her passion for research was very motivating. Although slightly disorganized, she will make sure you pass her class and is always ready to help you out. Will def be taking her again!",1
"Rick Brown has been in TV News for a loooong time, which means he knows what he's doing. I heard a lot of scary things about him, like how he was mean. However, he's very nice and gives a lot of constructive criticism. You can tell he's so passionate about his profession and really cares about helping students get jobs in TV News. 10/10",1
amazing teacher. take his class. hes def done some crazy sh*t in his life. goes off topic but it is usually entertaining. very easy class .. highly recommend him,1
"Cutler will make you work for your grade, but will be there for you every step of the way for any help you need. She strongly believes in building responsibility and setting students up for future courses.",1
"Super kind, extremely helpful, and really cares about his student's success. Dr. Knapp teaches multiple music classes, and is very knowledgeable about the material. He is excellent at accommodating his students to give them the best possible chance to succeed, and is always available for extra help if you need it. Definitely take his classes!",1
"Quiz every class makes you focus on the reading; outlines of quarter-term and final exams help in studying. Lots of PPTs, complimentary to text. Not an easy subject but he works to help you pass, and occasional ""freebie"" quizzes don't hurt (don't skip class, esp. Fridays). Grade updates every exam. Extra credit available. One of the good guys.",1
"never take this class, we learned things in class, and BAM they were not on the exam. very one sided and did not care to hear her opinions.",0
"One of the very few things I learned in this class, is how to say the word ""terrible"" in Spanish and this teacher is exactly that.",0
"Ayland was a great Strength training teacher! The in class days are mostly group discussion about hot topics in the health world, with a few days of boring lecture. Overall a very fun class that I learned a lot it! Quiz once a week that everyone should pass. Honestly the book for this class is not needed though.",1
"Had him for 153 and 181. Really good guy and professor. Hes very clear when lecturing and always asks if hes alright to move on. Gives lots of study tools and exam study guides. Hes always accessible and replies to messages promptly, and is always willing to meet via Zoom if you need help. Would HIGHLY recommend.",1
"Amy Fountain is an excellent choice for Public Speaking. She is a fair grader, and her feedback is extremely helpful. She truly cares about her students and she gets to know them as individuals. The material for the regular exams are very easy - taken straight from the slides, which are posted - and the speeches are not hard at all.",1
I've taken Mrs. Dodson for several math classes.  This review is based on her statistics class which I feared going into.  She is very helpful and explains things in a manner that's easier to understand than most textbooks.  She's also easy to work with.,1
"Dr. Baddar is amazing! You will read stories that deal with different types of people and then discuss them in class, and write papers on the human condition elements that were the most meaningful to you. If you read the few short stories, do the hw, and pay attention in class you'll pass easily. Best professor ever!",1
"The lectures are scattered but helpful, however his tests were usually too long and he values the conceptual questions more than computational. I feel like we had fewer concepts than other Diff Eq classes but we had to go much more in depth. He was a good lecturer overall and gave good curves at the end.",1
Prof. Cutler had done nothing to help her class. half the people dropped out after the first exam and lies about what will be on quizzes. She does an awful job at explain questions that students have. It seems as though she is setting her students up for failure. I would NOT take this ever again with her.,0
"For me personally, I came in already fascinated with the topic of French History & Culture so the class was pretty enjoyable. Sometimes the homework and tests could be a little too difficult and time-consuming though. I thought the end of the semester cooking project asked way too much for a Gen Ed course. But overall decent instructor.",1
Joe wasn't very helpful throughout the class.  Also his test were very hard.  I wouldn't recommend him to anyone.,0
"THe most amazing person ever, kind, open, pleasant.",1
"Be prepared to complete a lot of drawing projects. Teacher is very motivated and will inspire you to do well in his class. I can honestly say I learned a lot in this class. Lectures are clear and are related to projects. You will need to complete a drawing portfolio to showcase your work. Overall great guy and very understanding, always helpful.",1
"In 1 week, you take notes on written/video lectures, do 1 quiz, & do 1 discussion. 3 projects in Weeks 2, 10, & 14 have their own discussions. You do not need to use the textbook at all. It's optional & free. 1 midterm & 1 final, same format: they take 20 Q's from past quizzes, then you write 4 essay questions. Very kind & laidback grader.",1
"Overall I really enjoyed this class. It was very easy and she was really up front and honest. However, she did offer extra credit 2 times but then counted it as a regular paper. Not sure if she just got confused or what happened. I still received an a in her class though.",1
"She is very nice and well organized. All of the work adds up to the research paper, some quizzes and discussion posts but only once every two weeks or so. She could be a harsh grader only when yo arent clear. Overall a good professor. Just do your work",1
"Professor Heilman is a super passionate and very knowledgeable professor. I learned a lot from her class because her lectures were interesting and attention-grabbing. For a 100 level class, this course had a lot more homework than I expected. That said, all the homework was graded very fairly and it is easy to do well if you watch lectures",1
"Mike is my favorite prof so far at the UW. His grading is very lenient with re-submissions, which saved me in some instances. He is very helpful during office hours and on slack as well. This course content is difficult especially if you are new to coding, but with hard work a high score is possible.",1
She is by far the sweetest teacher! She not only cares about you passing the class but she genuinely cares about you as a person. She makes learning fun and has great teaching methods. Easy to understand. Everything about her and her class is amazing. I aspire to be like her everyday.,1
"The best professor I have had in my nearly 5 years of college. He is a caring, funny and understanding person who is insanely educated on anything he teaches, works with you both in and out of the classroom. He has an ability to get you into anything. Usually has a midterm and a final, nothing more, though split between takehome and inclass.",1
I hope he teaches forever,1
"if i had to guess, the worst physics professor at this school",0
This professor taught us nothing. We were left hopeless and confused for the final exam. His quizzes and exams were completely unfair and so was his grading. He was rude and unhelpful. I wish I went and complained to someone about him because his class was really unfair.,0
First off if you don't pass this class... you really didn't do anything. He's a good professor that makes it very clear on what he wants while not really asking for much. Do all the assignments and study for the test and your guaranteed a B minimum.,1
She's incredibly mean and selfish.,0
She was by far the best chem teacher I had. She actually teaches step by step with plenty of examples from her survival guide. If you have a difficult time understanding chem. Take her course!,1
This was an easy class. As long as you do the work you will make a good grade.,1
(online summer) He is a very nice guy but I feel like the exams were harder than the actual problems that we were given in Mastering Physics. Heard both good and bad things about him but more recently heard to take Physics 2 with him because he has quizzes and exams that are straight forward.,1
"Zank is cool, not as bad as previous reviews make him out to be.  Very passionate and knowledgeable about his stuff. Expects students to be prepared in class and work hard, lots to read daily! Only silly rule is mandatory attendance, like many other CAS courses this is a bit ridiculous. Otherwise this is a good professor, great class to take.",1
"Out of the 20+ graduate courses I have taken, this has been the worst class. A lot of (outdated) readings (especially for an instructor who insists materials for the course paper be no more than 5 years old). Minimal work for a grad course. Not challenging for a graduate course either. And who gives tests at the graduate level??",0
Best Professor Ive taken so far!!! She really caring and she helps her student to succeed not only in the class room but also outside of class.,1
"Miller is very eccentric. However, he's a very sweet man and loves interacting with his students. He loves to talk so BEWARE because he WILL go off topic. Gives assignments every week to read poems, which you have to discuss next class. Very minimal work, almost no work at all. Show up, talk, you will pass.",1
"I had her for students with special needs and, although she is really nice and helpful, there was a lot of work for the class.  Everyone was confused and stressed out throughout the whole process.  She's a great teacher and really accommodating, but be prepared for tons of work, and be on top of it!",1
"She provide us with clear powerpoint slides and lecture videos, just read them and do the homeworks on Mindtap then its an easy A, she even give out extra credits and there are so many ways you can succeed in this class.",1
"Very sweet and funny lady. The first test I failed heavily on it, but the rest of the exams was a breeze. Quizlet will become your best friend in this class. There is millions of quizlets for this class. The reviews she gives are exactly going to be on the exam word for word. She always goes off topic but she really cares for her students.",1
"Uncle Denny... Super talented, brilliant humor, master of color, a human encyclopedia of technique, deliciously demented, invested in his students progress, easy to play practical jokes on, particularly ones involving limburger cheese, makes fabulous t-shirts, lost in the caves of his own mind...Take the time to rein him in... it's worth it! ;)",1
"Amazing professor for teaching, lengthy/difficult hw and exams",1
"AMAZING PROF, If you can definitely chose a class with Adelle. She's always making jokes, making us laugh, very knowledgable and loves what she teaches and makes it very easy and fun to listen too. She gives lots of examples and stories, not dry material at all",1
"I loved this class, I only rated the class a four on difficulty because the subject is hard but he makes it fun. You just have to be sure to put in the work. He is super fair and understanding and i always felt like I could talk to him about anything. I would highly recommend taking his class!",1
"This class is completely awful. Three papers assigned for a history class is absolutely ridiculous. It's not even about history as much as it is him trying to teach us how to write in useless styles such as Chicago and Turabian, like why?? He always goes back and changes what he wants and there is no real structure. You'll regret taking this class",0
She is pretty good teacher. There are times where it does get confusing when she is explaining a lesson. And there is always a presentation to do in the advance Spanish classes.,1
"All STAT 201 classes take the same tests & are supposed to follow the same powerpoint notes. Dr. Pannell didnt like the powerpoints so he skips a lot. Which is really frustrating bc you have to go back & learn it yourself. My roommate is in a different STAT class and she got a review for the test, but we didnt get one.. but its the same test?",1
The Best. Period. He makes a subject that to most people would be dreadful very fun! He lightens up the mood with jokes and goes over exactly what will be on the test. He provides study materials and hints. I definitely recommend Baumgartner. He will keep you interested throughout the entire 2 hours.,1
"Professor Campbell was amazing in his lectures because he shares his personal experience a lot, and teaches the material well, using case discussion (light) and getting people to participate. He kept classes short (online) but perfectly covered everything we needed. His notes and online book was good material for all projects/exam. Would take again",1
"Extremely caring, goes out of his way to make sure you get a good grade.",1
A very caring and lovely person all together. She really understands people and loves her job. Remember to leave your phone off or in your car. And don't forget to support SASA by buying a snack or 2.,1
No other professor has devoted so much time to drafting and helping us with our work in progress.,1
"Fun projects, lots of opportunities for extra credit, he's super cool and also very attractive :) Great class!",1
"Her tests are about 25-30 questions, but doesn't curve grades. Lots of homework assigned- she only checks it if you're late/absent. Lectures are sometimes hard to follow. Don't miss class you'll miss so much, she covers a lot very quickly. She also only uses a chalkboard, so don't take her class if you have a problem with chalk noises.",0
"Dr McGee was a great teacher. She make sure that she reminds everybody to submit all their discussions and finish their concert critiques. Her class involved attending a concert and writing a paper about it. She lets you know how she is grading your paper and what she wants to see. Expect to read her book from cover to cover. It was a good course,",1
"No matter who you take for Bio 111, it will be a VERY difficult class and you still most likely struggle. HOWEVER, Hollis is a great dude. Don't be intimidated, go to his office hours, he is very helpful/honest. He got me through this course and is honestly a pretty funny guy. Take notes on his specific lecture examples they'll be on the exams",1
"Dr. Costanza is TRUSWORTHY Professor. He is God fearing, and even if you were an Atheist, he welcomed you. He was not biased at all. He did it by the book, if you get an A in his course then you must deserve it. He is very polite, understanding and he cared about his students. There was no such thing as ""an easy A"". ",1
"All of her exams were online - including the final (which was not cumulative). The textbook for ""reading"" was also online, but her lecture notes were all written in the notes of her downloadable powerpoints. The only reason attendance is mandatory is because she uses Tophat and takes attendance electronically. She's a nice lady overall.",1
"Not a bad teacher, he just needs to explain in more detail about assignments and get his point across.  The class is strictly writing papers so beware.  Very opinionated, its either his way or the highway.  Can be a little  much at times.",1
Lectures are useless but random assignments count for 15% of your grade.  Layoun likes to preach ideas that are painfully obvious or that are way too out there.  Lecture consists mostly of putting up passages from the reading and having her read them.  Lots of reading if you actually do it.  easy overall.,0
She is a very lazy and boring professor. Her power points are packed with information and it is nearly impossible to remember everything for exams. She does allow unlimited notecards on the 2nd and third test. Despite being difficult she took our input into consideration and tried to make the class more fair after the 2nd exam which avgd in the 50s,0
don't take this class,0
"She isn't very friendly and is difficult to communicate with. I found her to be really judgemental. She is a tough grader, so even when you put your 100% effort into an assignment, don't expect to get an A.",0
"Prof. Bush definitely knows math, and if you're already good at the subject then you'll be fine. However, he doesn't provide examples in class that can help on the homework. He only uses a ton of variables - no numbers. Go to office hours if you're struggling: he's much better in 1-on-1 meetings. The hw isn't mandatory, but still do it. It helps.",1
"He is a good professor, He just has to organize better the examples before going to the blackboard.",1
"The workload felt like a six credit course and I was not prepared for all the reading. You have to read the very difficult textbook to do the weekly quizzes but don't need it for the final, which is annoying. Studied an hour every day for the whole summer while working full-time and got an A so it's not impossible, it just won't be easy.",0
One of the gems on howard's campus! He works with you and want you to learn not just pass.,1
For PHYS270: 1) You read 2-3 sections of a chapter from the book 2) You take a 'reading quiz' on the sections due every Monday and Wednesday an hour before class (basically just like the examples). 3) Homework through masteringphysics due every Wednesday at 11:00PM. This class is incredibly straightforward. You work every day and you barely pass.,1
"Professor Bermudez is the best. In her class, you get one paper for each unit (3) and, you do a rough draft for each. If you want, she will conference with you and let you know what you need to change. You will receive an A in her class if you do all the work that she assigns.",1
"Wei is not a good ""professor"" and is too full of herself. She is spiteful towards her students and does not give a crap about them, uses them as a means to an end. Lectures are unclear, not very helpful outside of class, and is an unpleasant person. She also loves to complain about how UW students are lazy.",0
"The best teacher ever, make sure you are on time because you will have random quizzes on materials but those quizzes also gives you a easy A to boost your grade point avg. in the class. She also uses a text messaging system so anytime I thought i would be late or miss class I could easily shoot her a text . great teacher",1
"Very good prof, thoughtful lectures, interesting stories. There's a lot of reading and the essay tests are killer, but I think it was worth it.",1
"Started out the class warning us we wouldn't pass which made me study my butt off and if you do that too, you will pass especially because he curves grades. He speeds through lectures, so I spent a lot of time outside of class studying. If you don't have time for that, I recommend not taking him. He is VERY helpful and available outside of class.",1
Don't waste your time going to his office hours. He won't hep you and will tell you to learn  it yourself. Better off memorizing the textbook than doing his assignments. Will tell you to drop out if you don't pass the midterm (over 55% will fail it). Breaks the rules every year.,0
"Very unclear of what she wants you to do. You will never have the right answer for her. No matter how hard you try in her class it always seems like it isn't good enough. Can be rude at times. Not interesting. She will lose your papers and then tell you ""oh well"" or give them back you a week later. I would not recommend to take her. ",0
"Andor is great and I really enjoyed his class. I wish he would show fewer films in class, though - I work full time and missing work to watch a movie was really frustrating, especially when it was on youtube and could've easily been just watched at home instead of wasting valuable class time. Not a very challenging class, but a fun one.",1
Smartest teacher I've had,1
"Poorly organized, graded by few things for a semester long grade. Very book heavy. Most students are confused with what is going on in this class so everyone just does their best. Other profs are worse so just take this for your gen ed and get through it. Cool, funny guy but isn't the best teacher. I could see him being a good upper division prof",0
"Très bon prof, cours agréable! Mais il y a quand même une pas pire charge de travail (c'est quand même du français) Ça se fait très bien !",1
By far the worst teacher. dont expect to get more than 70 percent on the essays. Will literally mark you down for the smallest things. ,0
"He is very confusing and talks way too fast. When you ask him a question about the material, he laughs at you and won't explain it. His tests were pretty easy if you understand the material. He's not very friendly either, I felt like I couldn't go talk to him during his office hours. ",0
"Passionate about teaching. If all professors were as dedicated as Asbell, we would all succeed. Made learning fun and inspiring. They broke the mold!!!! Thank you!",1
"JingJing is a cool lady outside the class, but inside the class, she is a whole other person. Lab reports are super hard, tests are even harder and no multiple choice. You can turn in a test and think you got a solid 80, sike... probably a 50. She grades super tough. Oh and the homework takes forever to do and she'll give you like a 35 on it.",1
"Had to get a tutor because this professor is dry, boring and scattered. Gives lots of homework and quizzes which is great for learning- except he gives one or two question quizzes where the questions are much more difficult than anything he went over. He changes his weights at the end of the semester - I went from a b+ to a C. Horrible",0
"Easy A for science students, arts students? Not so much. You HAVE to go to class, you MUST study the material. Arts students aren't used to this, I've heard them complain in lecture. Honestly, just show up, ask questions, take pictures of the figures and maps, stop watching The Bachelor and study instead. If you do, the 45% midterm is a breeze!",1
"I had to retake this class after completing it in another program with another teacher and revived an A but with Nella she gets personal grudges and if you give her the wrong impression she will set you up to fail, Im shocked I even passed as she goes back and changes your grades if she feels you no longer deserve that grade. Horrible teacher.",0
Awesome teacher!The best online course ever.Mr.Narin and his TA respond to emails immediately.The textbook is very easy and clear.The online quizzes and tests were not timed and contained only material that just have been covered.You simply can't try hard and be dropped or fail this class. I higly recommend this class.,1
"He has his agenda like so many others here. And though he appears to be erudite, he cannot help but be married to his radical politics. Well this is UMass at Amherst. I cannot wait to get into classes about reality.",0
"this guy is a freaking moron, and it is a shame that you must take classes with him...he doesn't teach **** and expects you to know everything..should be fired",0
"admirable, knowledgable, funny instrutor. She is so emotional that she never hurts anybody by giving a lower than C grade. easy midterm and final. she was busy grading papers during class section, so you are free to do anything.",1
I loved having Professor Mejico as my teacher for PSY120! He is so passionate about what he does and it shows through his teaching. Lectures were great and did not occur in every class. He did a lot of hands-on activities that were super eye-opening and inspirational. He made class online on Fridays so we only had class twice a week.,1
"Such a hard time explaining what he was doing and solving. Students usually correct a small mistake it does. You literally have to practice more hours than the syllabus tells you too. He show a little sympathy for my class and gave notebook extra credit to which I thank god for, but I wouldnt recommend this class if youre not that good in math.",0
"I thought the class was easy, he explains everything multiple times which kind of gets boring at times. I read the chapters from the book before the test and got A's on all my tests. Hes a really great teacher.",1
"she is the nicest poerson ever, so helpfull she will even walk you through your first scholarship and help plan out your school plan",1
Very passionate professor. There's only 4 essays but the prompts are so specific and he practically addresses them in lecture. Easy A. It's REALLY hard to fail this class.,1
Correction: I believe she will return to Berk. Spring 12. Any serious English major should take this Theory course and any other lit course she offers; it would simply be foolish to pass them up. Enjoy.,1
"Workman is a predictable teacher. Will confuse you toward the beginning of the semester, but once you warm up to his teaching style, you will understand that he is a lovable guy. He cares about your knowledge of the field of psychology and is a pretty easy grader. He takes attendance every class, so show up to class if you don't want to lose points",1
My absolute favorite professor! He explains the material extremely well and if you take notes and work hard you won't have a problem in the class.,1
He is the best prof I've ever had. Period. I can't wait each week for his class. He keeps the whole class on the edge of its seat. He is an amazing lecturer with an enormous brain. And he seems lIke a really nice guy too. Funny too.,1
Tons of work! She has misguided priorities about what is important to teach.,0
Teachers like Ms. Bailey are hard to find! She is very caring and went above and beyond to help me. She was happy to explain something to me that I didn't understand in detail and her response time to my questions was very prompt. She gives a lot of homework and makes you work hard for your grade but I learned a lot taking her class.,1
Dr.Houston grades unfairly and she is not helpful,0
No Comments,1
Awesome,1
I'm gonna get strait to the point. Lovely woman but definitely do not recommend taking her class unless it's mandatory. I often find myself showing up to class and doing other course work during her lecture and getting all the info I need from the slides come exam time. Her labs are incredibly convoluted and barely relate to course material.,0
He is an awesome professor. He makes Tech writing a lot easier than it is. If you follow his outlines and go to him for feedback you will* be successful in the class. His attendance is kind of mandatory.   ,1
"She is incredible! I would recommend taking her for any of your chemistry labs. She is super caring and gets to know her students. Quizzes are difficult so you should study before attending class. She is a fair grader so if you half ass your job, it will reflect in your grade.",1
Very clear and easy to follow. Classes were easy but if you need more help Dr. Jon doesn't mind answering questions after class.,1
"If you're an art major, take her for ALL your painting classes. Oil is her medium. You will learn so much. She's an amazing instuctor, but she is also very strick. Attendance is mandatory. Don't skip class it will have an effect on your grade. She only teaches painting 1 every other semester, so find out when she's teaching.",1
"Love the course content, found content I didn't attend lectures for to be difficult to catch up on. It was also difficult to obtain a great grade on assignments due to how broad the rubric and criteria were- however, this depends on your TA.",1
"He is a great teacher! He teaches math so nicely and makes everything easier. His class is hard though if you aren't in the right course you should be in, like I was. I wasn't prepared for that course, but even then, he made it very understandable. He is an all around great guy!",1
"I took his online class. 2 Minor Speeches and 3 Major persuasive speeches. Quizzes every Sunday, based only on textbook and after 2 lowest grade dropped. 3 Exams based on selected chapters. The textbook was expensive and the access code is required. His lectures were based on the quiz after it is taken, which was repetitive. Overall, easy grader!",1
Take this class while you can. He is so good I doubt he will be around forever.,1
VERY VERY work heavy. I would recommend the class to start a group chat because the class gets confusing. VERY LECTURE heavy. He can talk the whole hour and a half. He grades the paper essays easy but just be prepared for lots of work. Hes a very cool guy and cares for his students. Just participate and talk or else he will get angry,1
"This instructor is terrible.  She expects you to know everything, which is impossible.  Print outs are useless because they only list general terms with no information so you never know what your surposed know. Has good intentions, but not a good teachers.  Lots of essay questions, be prepared if taking this class.",0
"The best professor I have ever had in my life. By far the best engineering professor on campus. Willing to help anytime. Laid back, if the class doesn't want homework to be due that day, he'll just move it back. Take him whenever possible.",1
"Took this class a while back and honestly if you put in the work it's not bad. Office hours always help, and Dr. Sandlers is willing to help outside of class. Definitely an easier professor of OCHEM 1 so take advantage of that. Final has repeats from past quizzes and tests. Overall, good professor who has extensive knowledge and informative slides.",1
"Wish I had the experience some of these other reviewers have had, he is awful! Didnt grade a single thing until the first week of April for a class that started in January! No feedback, takes forever to respond to emails. Just does not seem like he cares at all about graduate students",0
She is absolutely amazing. she grade fairly and will help those who want it more then those who dont. You will learn in her class it also helps that the classes are small,1
Tests are really hard and there are quizzes every class,1
"Pretty good guy and knows his stuff. Grade is just 4 exams which are open book/note, but the exams are still difficult, and a research project/tax return. Pay attention and easy to get at least a B.",1
Dr. Hargett is great! Expect 2 tests and a research paper that she gives you plenty of time to do. Interesting course and the reading is very life applicable. Quite a bit of discussions each week but it is engaging and relies on your perspective more than text. Great class!,1
My favorite professor that I've ever had. He's very structured in how he organizes class and he's such a nice guy. Super encouraging and I wish I had taken him for English 1301. He gives you every possible way to receive an A in the class and lets you revise a ton. Definitely recommend taking him,1
Average prof,1
She is awesome !!,1
"Dr. Braun is the best professor that I had in my time at UA. Her class is work, don't get me wrong, but it is so enjoyable that you won't care. She is passionate about everything that she teaches, and it compels you to feel the same. She cares about her students. I took 3 classes with her in 3 consecutive semesters. I just wish I could take more.",1
"Comes off as condescending.  Very loud, very abrasive, somewhat intimidating, does not relate well with students, very aloof and arrogant.  I could have gotten a suggested reading list, gone to a library on my own time, and gotten the exact same results from this class and saved myself the tuition and aggravation.  The class is redundant.",1
"Super nice guy, he is always available to help and is nice about it. Not too much work and the assignments are explained well. Lectures can be boring but he tries to bring his instruments for entertainment so it is not all lecture.",1
"Not a difficult class, just lots of work. Reading, bi-weekly essays and quizzes, one midterm and a final. Midterm is easy and essays are not difficult to get As on. The TAs pretty much do everything in the class). Espo is such a terrible professor. He spends 80% of class just reading the book and doesn't say anything relevant. Will fall asleep.",0
"Very inattentive professor, extremely lecture heavy, doesn't make eye contact with students, horrible at explaining content, very strict grader, tests have nothing to do with textbook reading or what he presents in lecture. He expects you to be an expert before having taking this class. I strongly advise you to find a different physics professor.",0
Josh Loar was an excellent professor. We met weekly to discuss the project and he gave great feedback on the progress we had made. He would also go out of his way to research issues we were having between meetings. His extensive industry experience really helped me get the most out of this class. ,1
"Not a good lecturer at all. He mostly faces the board, and goes really fast. Homework is worth a lot and graded for accuracy, so make sure you're getting all of those problems right. The tests are based off old exams and the homeworks, but are generally still really difficult.",0
She's nice and sometimes willing to adjust due dates. Class is boring and I did a lot of hw for other classes in there. Group projects are frequent if she thinks yall aren't paying attention. Some quizzes too. Not very clear about her grading criteria. She'll say what she wants in an assignment and then grade it depending on something else.,1
"Calm, cool guy. He explains things in detail, always answers questions and makes the occasional corny joke. Doesn't expect you to memorize random data, but expects you to understand the purpose behind the experiments. Really good professor. Also, he lets you call him Dr. K because he knows his name is hard.",1
"He thinks he knows everything, he kept interrupting me when I was doing my presentation. I felt embarrassed as he kept interrupting and he I ask him a question, he wont' answer it right.",0
Show up to class and email her with any concerns you have. Make sure you read the stuff she gives you.,1
"There are 3 big papers due that are really big but very easy, just putting the class notes into your own words. write a lot and you'll get an A",1
hella funny...hella cool...,1
One of the best teachers I have had.  He was very organized and informative.,1
"He is by far the best teacher I have ever had ever. My god. Amazing. He is funny, very smart, and very knowledgeable. He knows the struggles of being a college student and has the best stories from his life experiences. I can't believe he's even gotten one bad rating. He gives A LOT of extra credit. I wish he was the professor for all of my classes",1
"Really boring lectures, really quiet speaking . . . half the time spent in class is awkward silence while she waits for someone to answer the question she just asked.  If you don't drink a cappuccino before class, then bring a pillow.",0
Really mean for no reason,0
"There are many negative comments about Professor Graham's class. However, after taking his class I disagree. He won't give you an easy A and makes you work for your grade but he has a really good handle on the material, explains clearly and thoroughly, and is more than willing to meet after class. I wish I could take him again for Calc 4.",1
"Public Speaking can be an intimidating class, but Ms. Rhodes does a great job of making the class enjoyable. I learned a lot in the course and I am much more confident now giving presentations. She is always willing to help outside of class and does not make you feel dumb for asking questions! All around an awesome class and teacher.",1
Not a difficult class. Tests are straightforward. Basically the whole class is lecture of pictures from ppt and then tests from the book,1
"I was a little apprehensive taking an online ""communications"" class, but I am so glad I did. She kept chapters short and simple and quizzes were straightforward. Definitely recommend!",1
"Text is an easy read, esp. for people not fluent in lawyer speak. Discussions are 2-3 questions per week, easy if you do the reading. Mid-term & Final are indepth, multi, T/F, essay. Prof is SUPER helpful and stays on top of everything. Would recommend him.",1
"Steve is great! He gives a ton of opportunity for extra credit, gives weekly quizzes (drops the 2 lowest grades) and had an open book midterm. He's very fair in his quizzes. His pet peeve is talking during class...and for good reason, don't do it! Attendance isn't mandatory, but it helps if your unsure of the material. I recommend him!",1
This instructor is a joke. E-mailing for help is pointless as she is very rude in her responses and unprofessional in comments on grades. I dropped her class and re-registered submitting the same quality of work I did in her class and getting a full letter grade higher. I am an A student and very careful to read instructions which she doesn't.,0
Professor Nielsen was very kind and sweet every single day in class. The one thing that I would criticize is the somewhat difficult to understand criteria for submissions and projects- a lot of the directions are difficult to understand and the portfolio submission process was very confusing because of the confusing directions she gave us.,1
"-presentations sound like the announcer for 'The Price is Right', very annoying -takes 3-4 days on average to respond to forum questions -poorly narrated 1-2 hour slideshows, run them at 1.5x to bypass dead-air and slow speech -slideshows are recycled, you can HEAR older errors prior student reviews, ""he's fun!"". gee, this ain't middle school",0
"She's such a sweetheart! The class is fun and enjoyable. She gives reviews before the test, but it's not thorough so read the book, you'll need it. PAY ATTENTION to the lectures if you dont have the book. THe projects are fun, she's very chill and has a nice sense of humor.",1
"Overall, Cleveland is a good professor. The course is a bit difficult and there is a huge reliance on the textbook. Classes are somewhat engaging, and he is far superior to many of the brutal MOS professors out there. A relatively new professor; the course is quite well structured. If you are good at memorizing textbooks you will get a good grade.",1
"He offers a lot of extra credit, do it! He is VERY PARTICULAR about his notes. Instead of using his book make sure you are present in order to write what he says.",1
"If you want to learn, take his class. He is a really good teacher who is always willing be happy to help students. You will see he put his effort to his work. You will learn and improve a lot from his class. However, if you look for an easy class and easy grade, do not take this class.",1
"I can't imagine the amount of information Jan has in her head, and she really knows what she's talking about. She teaches A&P and Zoology, both extremely information-based fields. Jan's very friendly and willing to help you but teaches very hard classes and expects you to do the work.",1
"I wasn't really into the material of this class but Prof.Shimko is really awesome at giving lectures. Passionate and interesting. three tests each with 33.3%, no attendance, no quizes.",1
"If you are interested in German, take her class! She makes sure that you understand and won't move on until you do. I've already signed up for her class next semester because she is such a great instructor.",1
"This class is an easy A but I really cant stand Frazier sometimes. Hes rude and arrogant and he gets butthurt quick He doesnt like to take responsibility of his mistakes,when he does its snarky and shady. Discussions always go left because he interprets things weirdly. Quizzes have trick T/F questions but pretty easy. Exams are online though����",0
"She really cares for her students. I was in a small class for 2 quarters and made it fun and interesting. Essays are super easy, she lets you write rough drafts then does peer review before turning them in. She gets really into the books you read in class which makes it easier to understand. And she bases the course schedule around the class needs",1
"One of the best teachers I have ever had. Challenging but only because the material is difficult. I left this class with a deeper appreciation of software and computers as a whole. Lenient grader, warm and open in class discussion, wants you to succeed.",1
Topic: Women in German Culture. Agatha was truly great. I didn't know what to expect from the course but she is very kind and helpful and really wants everyone to succeed. I would love to have her again.,1
Adam is great. I actually enjoy going to his classes. He makes learning fun and talks to his students like they are equals. He expects greatness but won't reprimand you if you don't get the best grades ever. His class isn't necessarily easy but it is definitely worth taking. ,1
"Generally, she was a good professor. Lectures were interesting. But she is very strict with grading. Make sure you READ THE SYLLABUS FULLY. She had important information on there about grading of assignments that you could miss if you don't read it.",1
"She is a very nice lady, but the class is spent going over problems. Tons of extra credit is available. Her tests always seem so much harder then what was gone over in class. And she loves fractions..",1
"She did grade harsh, but when I needed help she was there.",1
"Love his classes and personality, which is really interesting, however it's just way too difficult. I think he tries to prepare us for the real LTAM exam difficulty, but the pace is just too fast. Exams are usually a lot harder than HWs and quizzes, which can be a shock attack to lots.",1
Very helpful - just ask for help!,1
"She's great! She was very sweet and taught us practical things we could take away from class. She wants you to show up to class and participate, so if you aren't doing that, you're really not doing yourself any favors or making a good impression. Tests are easy, the material is interesting. Good class and good professor.",1
"This was one of my favorite classes at UC Davis. Dr. Wolf not only teaches about family, but also about all the other issues that impact the family. It was a super interesting class and I learned a lot about the family as well as societal issues surrounding it. Tests are straightforward if you put in the work (readings and attending lecture).",1
"Wildly interesting! He explains things in a wacky way that is extremely clear. Embraces any idea or concept and helps refine it. Keep you independent, yet help is there when you ask. So far, best teacher i'v had here.",1
She's very clear and makes the content easy to understand. The exams are a bit difficult.,1
Her class is very challenging and rigorous. Lots of quizzes and homework. But she responds to email quickly and is a fair grader.,1
TWO HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS. TWO GROUP PROJECTS. MIDTERM AND FINAL. Read the book and do exercise problems or you will likely not pass. Is willing to help with exercises is you ask him enough.,1
"This is what college should be. Lectures are challenging and policies are straightforward. Emails his notes - study those, pay attention in class (legendary lectures), and you'll be fine on the final (the only assignment)  essay questions that he gives 1-2 weeks in advance. He is brilliant. He is hilarious. Maybe my all-time favorite professor.",1
"I think she is a really good professor. The class itself is a bit difficult but everything she talks about in class is important to take notes on for the test. The book is helpful in the beginning for definitions but other than that mostly focus on her lectures. Go see her in office hours to review your tests, she is very helpful in explantion",1
"You have to be ready to participate in Dr. Duque's class. He will call on you at random. He gives everyone the same grades for compositions, but he steadily increases your grade throughout the semester. You have quizzes after every class and a weekly discussion board. Both exams were take-home and you have a 10 minute presentation with a partner.",1
love SAM such a solid guy who genuinely cares about what hes teaching,1
"Lectures can feel a bit long, but theyre interesting. Get ready to take a lot of notes because a lot of information is covered and slides are not uploaded to canvas. Readings are mandatory and there are reading quizzes (easy if youve done the assigned readings). Exam grading is fair and she lets you know what you need to do to improve.",1
Anyone who brings their brain to her is lucky to be alive and at NYU.,1
"Dr. Spiczak is genuinely such a smart man. That being said, he struggles interpreting the information to students in a clear and orderly manner. One - on - one he is much easier to understand, so I'd make sure to check his office hours. He's a very generous grader, the curves on his tests and overall class is favorable. ",0
He's the only professor at coc that has said bring all your questions and concerns to me. He does have a strong accent but knows exactly what he's talking about if you listen!! You learn from him just by watching what he does. He'll stay hours after class helping students in anyway possible. One of the nicest most genuine professors I ever had.,1
"I took him for INBS 347. He's really not a bad professor at all, he has real life experience and often shares his experiences with the class so he gives everyone an idea of what it's like in the business world. 8 case studies that are in sets of 2 (4 case studies in February and April) and one term paper which is an export plan. would take again!",1
"At first she seemed like she wouldn't be very nice, but actually she is very sweet and knows what she is talking about",1
"I really liked her at first, but she sometimes gets an attitude and if you dont agree with her then it is almost impossible to get a good grade. She grades very hard too. English is my expertise, but I somehow didnt do too well in this class even though I worked very hard. I just honestly think you would be better off taking a different professor.",1
"He was a really easy teacher because as long as you did the readings (which typically weren't long) and the weekly online (very easy) quizzes, you would get a good grade. He gave study guides which really helped for the tests and graded the weekly quizzes really easily. EASY class but actually still interesting.",1
"He gave hard tests. However, my biggest complaint is that he went on tangents instead of teaching o-chem. To make matters worse, he tested on the tangents. One test question asked about the 2010 nobel prize. Also, the quizzes took time away from practicing the problems in the book; the problems in the book provided more benefit than the quizzes.",0
"Martin is not a good prof, he glances over important topics and goes in deep detail of things that should not be covered in the course(Like putting Riemann integrals on a midterm, this is not MATH 261). His practice problems he posts are terrible half of them are applied topics which you don't need to know. Get ready to teach yourself some math.",0
"She is the best professor I 've ever met before. She always gives good feedbacks and always available there. She is patient and gorgeous. She has broad-mind and she is professional in Journalism. Always give extra credits. I would highly recommend her JRN102. Be free to ask her questions, what you gain will be more than what you expected.",1
"She is a great teacher. If I had her for an algebra teacher in high school I believe I wouldn't have to take developmental math classes in college. She is patient, she gives great examples. She understands that everyone is not a mathematician. I recommend her class for everyone.",1
"Professor Williams really cares about her students. She teaches from an afrocentric view, and I have lots of respect for her. There is no ""I think and I feel"". She encourages you to speak out of research and facts, not emotion. The best professor EVER",1
It seemed like he made the material a lot more difficult than it needed to be. He didn't cover enough examples in lecture and the book was useless. The exams were very tricky and were nearly impossible to prepare for (the average on the final was a 39%) But he does curve the class generously.,1
Worst experience in NJIT! Avoiidddddddddd! A lot to read! Boring lectures! Do not take her at all!,0
Professor Smith is extremely caring. Study the lab exercises for the practical. You MUST make sure you put out time to study for this class. Attendance is mandatory ( there is a grade for that) Study the objectives for anatomy and physiology for the practical too. DO THE HOMEWORK. HINT HINT for practicals.,1
"I don't understand how she is better at Anatomy than Physio. She talks too fast while going over detailed slides and diagrams. It was just overwhelming. She's pretty picky on the short answers on her exams. She doesn't let you know what DIAGRAMS will actually be on the exam. To be on the safe side, you need to study everything on her study guide.",0
"Lectures are dry and quite boring honestly. As a required class, you'll have to deal with it. Maybe just don't take it as an 8am class and the lectures would be more enjoyable. He seems like a genuinely good and funny guy. I just don't enjoy his lectures.",0
"If you struggle in math and need a teacher that will break it down and make the process simple, this is the teacher to take. She is very laid back, funny and willing to help students that want to learn. The only thing that makes her mad is if you use your cell phone in class while she is teaching. I took her 8 week fast track class and made an A!",1
"WONDERFUL! Ms. Chambers clearly knows how to teach stats and makes it easy to understand. I had no problem at all figuring out the material. She can teach rather fast, but its not too overwhelming. She can be slightly snarky with comments, but other than that she means well and knows whats she's doing!",1
"She is very clear when explaining questions in class, and cares if students are actually learning. She is helpful and when there is clearly a problem fixes it fairly for students. She also is refreshing and easy to pay attention to. Classes are important to attend :)",1
"He's a cool guy but the class is basically power points. There are only 3 tests, random days he decides to take attendance, and a final exam, so you have to get a good grade on all of these. he will drop your lowest test score though. he gets mad about people being on their laptops and phones.",0
"All topics discussed were extremely detailed & unorganized, covering far too much than what should be expected of students immediately entering the MBA program. I would not recommend Jagpal for students starting their core MBA classes. This nontraditional prof does not give graded work throughout the semester: participation & a final only.",0
"Lectures are very straightforward and clear but they often cover things you will never need to know. A lot of this class is just being good at math, but it is a light work load and the tests are reasonable",1
"While he can be very stern, he is fair. He gives students the opportunity to earn majority of the credit through showing work (even if incorrect answer). Earn his respect through your grades and/or effort and you'll be fine. Long tests but questions are just variations of previous quiz questions(that you can take home) so no reason not to pass.",1
"He's a very entertaining and smart guy, and if you listen to him you will learn a lot. Quizzes and tests are unbelievably easy. Pay attention in class and take decent notes and you'll ace them w/ no problem. He digresses and tells stories a lot but it won't hurt you or your grade. Just be respectful, listen, and participate.",1
Had Dr. Klosterman for ThermoFluids lab class is pretty easy you do 4 labs over the course of the semester and a presentation on one of the labs as a final.  Grades fair and give you a chance to make corrections on the first 2 labs.,1
"This professor is kind. Although the assignments are more, you have any problems with the study, and she will help you. as long as you do your jobs, this course will get good grades.",1
My tailoring class with Ronda has transformed my sewing hobby into a total obsession! The techniques she teaches ranges from practical to total couture. Ronda provides excellent drawings and written material to assist you outside of class (and in the long term when you've forgotten how to use a certain technique). I look forward to every class!,1
"Like below, nice person, god awful teacher. Although she is willing to help when needed, she's not clear on anything during class. The subject is hard enough. The first test she gave a sheet of about 200 anatomy terms to know and about 30 were on the test, its like that for every test. Waste of time studying and guessing whats on test. FRUSTRATING",0
Dr Allen is one of the best professors at auburn. Many students don't like him because they don't show up for class and don't do the worksheets he assigns. The work is easy stuff that you learned in elementary school. He does assign a good amount of worksheets but they are easy and take less than 30 mins to finish. And he gives extra credit!,1
"Yifan was adjusting to being a TA, but he was great. He was so funny, tried to learn everyone's names, and stayed after class to talk to students. He didn't know many answers asked by students, but he always tried to figure it out. He was not a hard grader, but really made you work for anything above a B+. Overall he really cares and is considerate",1
"Best teacher Ive ever had. Matthew is passionate about what he teaches and it shows. He always asks students how we feel about material and how he can better it. Discussions can get VERY heavy, but he handles it with grace and compassion. Take Matthew if you get the chance. You wont find a professor who cares more about their students success.",1
"Very boring lectures. No tests but pretty difficult quizzes. She uses tophat for lectures and to ask questions, which she uses to determine attendance.",0
"One of the best professors I've had at USC... Chem 322b is a tough course but he makes it very understandable and ""fun"" in a way. Go to his lectures, understand what he says, take all his practice tests (he gives A LOT of prac materials), and you should be fine. Tests are fair/reasonable. Also provides extra credit opportunities.",1
"I took him for group comm and if you aren't working on the group projects in class he is lecturing reading STRAIGHT from a powerpoint presentation. WE AS STUDENTS CAN READ TOO. I felt like I was back in kindergarten... Easy class with some homework, but boring!!! Most of the class (lectures) other than group work is common sense... A drag, beware.",0
"I think a lot of people misread her because they don't put forth the effort to really pay attention and talk to her. She can be confusing and unclear (more so in the Research class) but seriously she has been one of the kindest, most inspirational and helpful teachers I've had here. And trust me, she's a good teacher to have on your side!!",1
"She is by far the BEST of the BEST! I graduated from Trade Tech already and she came to my mind & I realized how she haves been the most passionate, caring, and greatest math teacher I have ever had. TAKE HER! Her style of teaching will make math easy! I took 105 & 115/125 with her! Thanks her I learned math! Now I'm in higher level maths chilling!",1
"He's a really nice guy, and knows the material well but as far as explaining it, the message won't get across. You will need to go to the lab because taking the class alone won't help you. He reads off the PowerPoint ",1
Man is awful at teaching i dont even want to rant. believe me or not but get ready to read the book,0
"Awesome guy, very different than a lot of professors at Franciscan. He worked as counselor for at-risk youth for 10 years, so he's a little rough around the edges, and he brings a lot of his experiences into lectures that make for good examples. His tests are easy if you study, and he loves it when you go to his office hours. Take him.",1
Easiest class I took! If you just do the assignments and show up to class you'll pass--the class is only pass/fail anyway. Professor Summers is so kind and realistic. He offered to take students on tours through the Nurse Learning Center. He also will add 10 people on the first day of class so go if you don't get in and you might have a chance!,1
She is just the best. She really knows what she is talking about and she's there to help you. Very responsive to feedback and easy to talk to.,1
Maybe online wasn't the best way to take this class. I still enjoyed it and he was easy to reach out to and gave the BEST feedback. Always willing to connect if you needed or wanted to. Tough grader on the essays but the rest was simple if you didn't fall behind.,1
"Professor Perez  is amazing. If your dreading taking a speech class, fear no more. Sign up for her class!   Attend every class, don't be late, prepare and deliver all your speeches - you will pass her class. Warning - you will be learning in a positive environment!",1
"If you're looking to take an Astronomy course, well then you better keep looking. He's a tough grader and the tests are hard. This is not an easy A, so think again. Hes very strict on attendance as well. If you don't study then you have no shot at passing, and even if you do study, then you better study harder. Go to his office hours, he likes that",0
Mike is one of my favorites professors in umich. He cares about students and willing to help outside of class. This course really needs hard work especially do a lot of practice questions. When you stuck ask for help right away. Go to the help room! Mike is an amazing professor. Take it with him! Less pain!,1
"All I can say about Professor Thompson is lazy, save yourself time energy and aggravation and take a different class.",0
"The best choice for EE205. He is excellent at explaining difficult subjects and concepts, his exams are very fair, straightforward, and similar to the review packet he gives out. He readily accommodates student's needs, and doesn't really give that much homework. He is also very available outside of class and happy to help and answer questions.",1
"Ms. Jackson Is a great Professor and the best Com teacher of all time, all you have to do is take the weekly quizzes, do well on the speeches and you'll get an A.",1
"VERY BORING. class moves very slow even though material is easy. Could do the lecture in half the time but it drags. Allows one absence. Does a lot of group work during class that is pointless. Discussions, no textbook, essays, group projects. SO BORING and she is kind of confusing ",0
"Funny professor, keeps class entertained. You have a 12 page paper as the midterm and final. Paper is easy to write, its based on his powerpoints. Definetly take if your a sports fan. Most of the time its guys arguing about sports but its a fun class to take. Its typically a 3 hour class but professor lets you left after an hour.",1
"She is a fantastic teacher. She is kind, caring, funny, and very helpful. The class can be challenging if you don't come to class or don't pay attention in class, but if you do those everything will be fine. She engages with the class and gets them to practice speaking, and you practice listening and comprehension when she teaches in Spanish.",1
Hawkins will be late for almost all the classes. Will bully students by calling them out infant of the class. Half of the class got a F- on midterm. Started the class with 25ish students probably 12 by the end of the semester. Avoid her class unless you like regurgitating her thoughts and being swimming in homework and readings.,0
"I took this class spring 2020, so we switched online half way through the semester. He did an amazing job with switching to online and made himself even more available to help students. He would sometimes jump on zoom with little notice to help a student having trouble on the current assignment. He also has an amazing late policy.",1
Shimko is probably the best lecturer I've had. Lectures are well prepared and interesting. The class is graded on three non-comprehensive tests. If you show up and listen you should be able to pass the class.,1
Class is not impossible. Do the homework. Study like she suggests and you will have an A. She is a different breed of person but she cares.,1
"Not helpful at all.  Don't even think about asking questions, will react to you like you are stupid. Very boring teacher. Not recommended at all!",0
She prepared me for the bar exam in such a way that I scored in the 96 percentile on the Feb 18 Bar. By far the best professor I had in law school. She ran class in such a way as to create a learning environment without distractions. Her professionalism was unparalleled in comparison with other professors.,0
"Easiest CGS2100, I'm not sure he even looks over the assignments and gives everyone an A. Took it online but still very accessible.",1
"Good overall teacher. He's helpful and is easy to contact outside of class, and the best part is he does a lot of hands-on activities to make sure people understand the content. He uses a lot of real-world examples in lectures, but can get boring over time.",1
"I spent a lot of time navigating broken technology. I emailed the professor about issues (the website being down, the links being broken, not having access to the library database). She did eventually respond to my emails but my grade still took a hit for things that weren't my fault. Very frustrating class at times. May be better in person.",1
"Professor Jassen is the best professor I have ever had for Biology in my academic career. She takes her time to explain things when they aren't clear to someone. She drops lowest 3 quiz grades, uses online HW via blackboard, and has quizzes every week. The quizzes actually help learn information! I cannot wait to take her A&P classes!",1
"I personally have enjoyed all the classes I've taken with Dr. Bartl. He's obviously very intelligent and well rounded in his courses, and is very encouraging from my perspective. I would take him over and over again. Of course it doesn't hurt that he's attractive ;) ",1
The professor teaches outdated material and is rather rude at times. I wouldn't recommend taking this class if you can avoid it.,0
"I don't think Dr. Self is a bad professor because I did get an A in one of his tests, but Dr. Schroeder made the class a lot harder than it needed to be and that is Dr. Self's responsibility since he is the head instructor. Record lectures (for Dr. Self) and learn all the pathways that exist. I wanted cellular metabolism :/ this class was veryhard.",1
"omg, this class is a lot of work. We had to do Pearson activities (Short Quizzes, Chapter Quiz, etc.) and then either write a 2-page single-spaced journal or a discussion post. We also have a final exam and a 5 page single-spaced paper. I know it's a writing-intensive course, but it was just too much. She gives good feedback, though.",1
I took this as a Distance Education  course in the Spring semester 2015. Profssor Chidinma Udezeh was very helpful.,1
"She rambles about her personal life most of the time. Pay attention enough to answer correctly and she lets you do what you want. She doesn't answer questions well at all, so you're probably better off getting a tutor.",0
The best teacher ever!!!!!!!!,1
Really mean,0
I had Natalie for Anthro and she made it super fun! Shes a little quirky and sometimes it can be a little boring but take notes anyway. You can use those for your open book tests (multiple choice)! Take advantage of all the extra credit opps (there are enough) and attend all classes to get in class group work credit. Shes amazing!,1
Professor Kaufman was hands down the worst professor I have ever had at RVCC. He is a stingy grader and his tests are unbelievable hard. He doesn't care if his students fail and he is not flexible with grading. I highly recommend anyone to not take his courses. He truly made anthropology an unlikeable subject.,0
in my opinion she really isn't clear on what she wants from your discussion board post or essays until she has gave you your terrible or good grade. very good communication lots of reading and lectures fail a test and your grade will drop like a bad habit.,0
Alisa is a wonderful professor. She is extremely helpful and goes out of her way to make sure that her students succeed. I was afraid of Math until I got into her class!,1
"This guy is the best teacher in PBU! His quizzes and papers are really easy, but his exams are MONSTERS! You will have to EARN your grade in this class, but its the most rewarding class in PBU, regardless of your major.",1
"I took phys 2 with Mr. Burt over the summer. He would get numerous example problems wrong daily and refused to demonstrate the correct way of doing them. He wasnt capable of setting up the labs or answering questions. It was as if he did not even know the subject matter himself. Started out funny, but wasting 4 hrs daily is no laughing matter.",0
She is hands down one of the best teachers I have ever had. She can come off as intimidating but many of grew to see her as a mother figure. The writing assignments can be a little hard but if you can find a topic you are passionate about it all comes easy. Show effort! She will quickly get to know you. She cares about you and wants you to succeed.,1
"I thought she was a good teacher. Some students complained of her accent, but I had no problem understanding what she said. Her tests can be difficult, but if you go over the powerpoint slides AND your textbook (read every single thing in the chapter) you should do fine. I enjoyed her class and I would take her again.",1
He is amazing best teacher I have ever had. He is very helpful. No Homework or Quizes only test that are very easy. very kind and sweet. Easy A. Very understanding also.,1
"Morris straight up didnt care about teaching this course and all he talked about was his job at iRobot. Didnt look over the lectures beforehand, and lectures were a week behind homework for most of the semester so you were learning what you needed to do the day you turned in the homework.",0
Dont be fooled by the fake charm. Mean in her core.,0
She is awesome and super laid back,1
"Excellent in lecture, readings were helpful. An easy grader, but helpful as far as evaluations and how to improve your work.",1
"She goes REALLY fast through the class so it's hard to take notes in class, but everything is on Tegrity. She is very knowledgeable about art history but overall is a little boring. As long as you attend class, you'll be ok.",1
"Thorough and passionate with a clear presentation that includes super helpful demonstrations with manipulatives to enhance understanding.   Hes a demanding professor and tough grader but if you came to learn, learn you will and then some.",1
Okay let's begin. 1. She uploads the notes (if you're lucky... up to a week after they were covered in class) but without the pictures which she tests you on. 2. Not one soul on the planet can memorize every archaeological site in the world to put it on a map! 3. can't hear you! 4. memorize ALL of your notes for exams or you're screwed!!!!,0
"Believe only the bad reviews, impossible to get an A, no makeup under any circumstances, narrow grading scale, doesn't give full points only partial and fractioned points ie 3.25 pts out of 5, focuses on irrelevant items on exams, lectures are weighted more than quizzes and exams. Shall I go on...? Avoid taking, will ruin GPA. Unhappiness :(",0
I would absolutely take this class with Hassey again. He is a great professor and really cares that the students get it. He always says grades don't mean anything to him and I'm pretty sure most people got an A in the class. He's so funny and makes the class very interesting and it is also really helpful for any business student!,1
"Fantastic attitude. Simplifies anatomy in words you can grasp. She will take the time to explain it until you fully get the concept, no judgement. Personable, 10/10 recommend",1
Dr. Sankara is an excellent teacher. He has very high expectations and is not an easy grader but he does grade fairly. He is always willing to answer questions or provide any necessary help. ,1
"Ken is a great person who wants the best from his students as well as himself. He is prepared for class and his teaching is clear. Its not a dry lecture class becuase of in class group work and worksheets. Ken is very helpful, making sure students are tracking with him. I highly recommend him especially if you've never taken accounting before.   ",1
It is usually difficult for her to articulate exactly what she wants you to work on. She is caring and personable.,1
"BEST English teacher out there. She has really simple assignments and as long as you complete everything on time and correctly, you will receive an A! HIGHLY recommend!!",1
"Dr. Shartin is a very nice guy, but not a very good professor. He was very unorganized. The class was pretty difficult, because of the readings, and he did not help very much. The class wasn't impossible, but very frustrating.",0
One of the least caring professors I have ever encountered. He. Does. Not. Care. He is downright rude to students. I once mistakenly addressed him as Mr. instead of Dr. and he replied very rudely. AVOID!,0
"Great Professor! There's not enough of them any more. She kept it simple and made you focus on what was important. If you are not ready to study don't take her class. But she motivates you to want to do well in her class, she is not out to fail you. You earn your grade. Would take her class again any time.",1

Professor Nevitte's class was my favourite during my time as an undergrad. I learnt so much and actually had the opportunity to reflect on what I learnt during lectures. He prompted me to learn more and expand my knowledge. He is also quite approachable and is interested in seeing his students grow. I would definitely recommend the course! ,1
"Meyers is young, spirited, funny, and overall an inspirational professor. Her lectures are truly entertaining and they make you WANT to participate(even though you may not usually). EVERYONE should take this specific course by her as well, seriously changed the way I see things, which is rare to say about other courses.",1
"Well what can I say , I honestly think he could use some lecture time . If you come to class just know that you are coming for the clicker points and that is it, there will be no lectures you are on your own in this class and the sample exam have nothing to do with the real exams given. Good luck ",0
Lectures were so monotone. It was very unclear what he is looking for on exams. Take this class with a different professor if you can.,0
"I saw how crappy her reviews were after starting her class, but after taking her for almost 4 weeks now, she's not as bad as everyone says. She's boring, and grades toughly, but she's definitely not the worst. She won't be your most fun class, but she's not the worst option",0
"Professor Swenson is one of the most helpful professors ever! She is extremely understanding and a great educator. I really enjoy her presence in class, and her work is very straightforward and easy!",1
For those who dont know John Street is actually the ex Mayor of Philadelphia so you will get more of a background of what it is like working in local government because of him. This was only a GenEd course but I thought he was very funny and extremely helpful. However the simulations got old real quick ��,1
"350 characters is not enough space to list all the good things about this professor. He's extremely caring, knowledgeable, interesting, gives good lectures. I could go on and on. He's a gem at LAGCC. Very lucky to have had him as my anthropology professor. It is a lot of reading and you do write but it's not so bad.",1
No Comments,1
"Prof Vannier is a great guy. Hes super funny, and really understands the life of a college students. Not going to lie, this class was tough for a 100 level class. The exams could be tricky, and in the in class assignments were very confusing. However, he offered over 100 points of extra credit because he truly wants his students to succeed.",1
The best prof in drama - hands down.,1
"Celia is very passionate about ASL. However, she does not provide much constructive criticism. There was weekly homework and tests worth tiny amounts overall. Has obvious favourites and is not super approachable. You may feel like your efforts are not recognized or you don't gain as much as you put in to the course. Be prepared for tough feedback.",1
"He gets very off topic and loses track of time. He's an easy grader, but the exams are difficult. He is very passionate about his job and teaching.",1
"He is a good mathematician, but it's really hard to follow what he is trying to say. He can't understand your questions at all, so basically u will use your book a lot. I knew the material, but i definitely learnt something new too. Overall I liked this guy, despite his flaws.",1
She's my favorite spanish teach so far. She is really good at explaining grammatical concepts. You have to go to class to practice speaking the language. She grades relatively easy which helps because learning a new language is not easy and you will make mistakes. She speaks very clearly as well.,1
"Marvyn is great, he really cares about his students success and will go above and beyond to help you. I thought I hated math until I took his course! He tries his best to relate concepts to everyday life which really helps.",1
Mike is AMAZING both as a professor and a person. Lecture may not be mandatory but READ THE BOOK! The structure of class is lecture in the first hour and exercises/try-it-yourself is the second hour and it's really helpful. Exercise solutions are also posted.,1
"Dr. Mark is extremely passionate about her Human Resources, and very positive. If you need any help she (and her GA) are more than happy to help. Make sure that you participate in class, otherwise it will hurt you in your 'participation' category. Stay ahead of your online discussion posts (called Yellowdig) and do your work.",1
Awesome professor! Very nice and caring and wants to help you succeed! Highly recommend! 4 novels but nothing too long. He likes to talk but encourages you to as well. I would take his class for all English's if I could.,1
"I enjoyed him and actually still think about him. I had to take Physics 2 with another guy, and I instantly regretted it. His lectures are not magical, but the simple way he explains things made everything clear.",1
I dreaded taking English but Professor Boyles keeps the class engaged and he won't bore you to death. Do the work and participate in class and you'll get an A.,1
"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Dr. Curtis as a person. As a teacher? Not so much. She rarely lectures on the topic at hand and instead tells stories of her family and her time in the field as a sex anthropologist, which would be hilarious if not so off-topic. Passing the class is doable, but you have to do the work yourself to memorize the textbook.",0
"The kindest professor, truly cares about her students learning and understanding concepts. What you learn from this class will help you tremendously in other classes where you have to write and research.",1
"Vannier is a cool dude, but makes you work for your grade. 3 exams total, all pretty hard but gives you a serious amount of extra credit (like around 40 points) so makes it pretty fair. Takes attendance by having you do worksheets during class so don't skip a lot. Our homework was online quizzes, time consuming but easy (a lot of answers online)",1
"He is amazing, and I would recommend people to take him. Very understanding, and works great with his students. Lets you use notecards on tests.",1
Talks about how much he cares for his students and wants to see you succeed... But in the same breath will disrespect you and make you feel dumb for asking a question. I've had him 3 times as a prof since I came to Humber and he's never changed. Good luck if you have him.,0
"Prof. Quinlan is the sweetest professor I have ever had.  He genuinely cares about his students.  On the first day of class he said do the assignments well and get an A, just ok get an A-, and don't do them B+. He doesn't care if you show up or not, just that you're doing ok as a person. The assignments are rather tedious, but the films are great.",1
"Podewell is the worst Professor I have ever taken.During a three hour class he spends about 30 minutes lecturing basically outlining a chapter or two. Even with reading the book it's VERY hard to do well on an exam, no one can memorize 200 pages. No feedback or help. If I could do it over again I would not take him.",0
Professor McDaniel does not make this class interesting nor teaches enough on the material needed for the test.,0
"Very poor experience in her online class. She took a week to respond to emails, posted an exam ten hours later than promised, and tested us on very obscure details from our course notes. The final assignment (worth 25% of our final grade) was based on calculations about mining that we had never been taught in the course. Would not recommend.",0
do not recommend her,0
"Prof. Koehlinger was great. A decent amount of reading, but not an overwhelming amount. Quizzes were exclusively on the readings. She is a fair grader and very responsive. The only thing I didn't like was for weekly discussions the responses to other students had to be done on different days, but other than that it was a good class.",1
"His lectures are very clear and concise. The quizzes and exams are based off of the homework, which I could usually knock out in a few hours every week. Get a study group.",1
"Very good professor, he is the ECE department chair, and for good reason. Genuinely cares about students, puts effort into both classroom and research, not always personally available for office hours (because of his other duties as department head), but has excellent TAs to make up for it. Tough grader but gives extra credit to make up for it.",1
she is really all over the place when lecturing. notes are hard to take and hard to understand because she goes so fast. I had to find a lot of outside help in this class. she is pretty good about extra credit and letting you turn things in whenever you want though.,0
So bad I dont even know what to say. Exams were hard. We had 2 exams and one assignment. The midterm was worth 40% and the final exam was worth 50%. The questions on the exam were to specific. She gives favouritism and Only likes to help those that she likes.,0
Professor Andrews is amazing! His class is very slow paced and easy. I was worried about English but he turned me into a greater writer. Just apply and receive an A.,1
"Mrs. Thrasher is a very nice lady. Her class is very laid back and easy. My only complaint is that her class can get a tad dull, but other than that, she's great!",1
"Just horrible. Confusing, goes off on rants, awkward. I wouldn't recommend this professor to anyone. I can't believe there's such a horrible professor at USI.",0
Do not take this class online. His tests are about 75 questions each worth 0.15 points. His weekly participation assignments are multiple questions that EACH have to be answered with 150-600 words depending on what he says the minimum is. The exercises arent always answered using the text and his lecture slides aren't always helpful or available.,0
WAY to picky!!!!!!!!,0
Great class! The modules were due every two weeks which was a great help during the pandemic and included a quiz and lengthy discussion. The content was really informative especially with the current political climate. Very kind professor :),1
"If you want to learn more about Engineering, don't take him. If you want to get an easy A, don't take him either.",0
"Teacher is knowledgeable on the topic of microeconomics, but her ""english second language"" accent can be distracting. Class was hard for me, but then again my interest in the subject is zero. All quizes are online, but final is in class. Two group projects to present to class throughout semester. Overall, meh.",0
"Speaks far too much in class, making it almost impossible to understand what information is necessary to know. Although he makes small talk by referencing his love of comic book heroes, he hardly stimulates the class to think critically. Far too much outside learning had to be done after his lectures to decipher his notes. Would not take again.",0
"Dr. Ortega is an excellent professor and very knowledgeable about the material. His lectures are fascinating and trust me you will learn a lot from the Caribbean!! This is an upper-division course, thus you need to study and be responsible. He is a caring professor that will drop the lowest exam and is accessible during his office hours.",1
"The professor knows his stuff, its just a hard class because not everyone is in the same level some topics you might talk more about then others depending on how the class is. He does give an excessive amount of homework about 50 or 60 problems a week. If you get the homework the test would be a breeze because thats what he uses to make the test.",1
"This class is not an easy A by any means. Your grade is determined by 4 tests and 13 quizzes so there is little margin for error. Professor Burdine reads off powerpoint slides the entire class which can get dull, and the problems that are used to practice for the test rarely contain the actual answers. Very average, but not great.",1
"Very hard course, but thanks to his big curve I was able to get a decent grade",1
"I took 4 years of Spanish in high school, and I learned more in 10 weeks with Marks than I did in the past 4 years.  The Wiley Plus (on-line assignments) is annoying at times, but I do not mind going to class.  He explains everything really well, and although he is a tough grader at times, you will still learn a lot and do good if you actually try.",1
"This class was for academic probation. She teaches one class a semester, and is absolutely phenominal. I've developed a relationship with her outside of class as well as in, and she doesn't yell at you. She grades everything easy. Out of 500 points, I have 499 for the semester. Take her over anyone.",1
One of my favorite professors,1
"Do not take her ONLINE class. I was expecting her to be teaching the class. It turns out she uses lecture videos from Prof. Crandall, so in reality Prof. Crandall is teach you the class not her! Furthermore she uses the Lockdown Browser for the main exams for integrity. Give credit where credit is due!",0
Inspiring,1
She teaches class like a middle school teacher.,0
He was the best professor I had all semester! He was funny and will make fun of students (sometimes). He uses real life examples in his lectures and made his own online textbook! Notes are taken daily and quizzes are about every two weeks. You will have two major test. I would love to take another one of his classes!,1
I don't even understand how she is actually employed...,0
"She's very helpful and caring but at the same time will go off tangent and spend a lot on proofs. Gives out a ton of homework that will take up a lot time. As with any class, if you put in the dedication and effort you will pass. There will be quizzes every week.",1
"Dr. G is hands down the greatest professor I have ever had. He knows his stuff, and by that I mean he knows just about everything in his areas of focus. He is a legend on campus. He is an overall great guy and an amazing professor, take a class with him if you get the chance! You will learn a lot. He makes you work for your grade but it is worth it",1
"Graded essays are a big deal in her class, so make sure you really pay attention to grammar!! She goes by checks, so participate, even if it's just a comment. She doesn't like people talking all at once or while she's talking. It's not that bad of a class.",1
"Mr Wickert is truly an angel, I am the worst when it came to writing papers I would always get C's or lower on papers in high school but with his help I passed his class with an A so that said's a lot about his teaching skills. I took him for 101 & 102 I always enjoyed coming to his class he is the BEST. I've learned a lot just show up.",1
"He talks way to much during the lecture on something that can be easily summed up but he means well, there's quizzes almost every Monday and he gives a lot of homework, and he gives some assignments that are totally useless but still impact your grade. The quizzes are not difficult to pass though.",1
"Dowding's class looks hard when you get the syllabus, but it's not as terrible as it seems. There's a load of reading and writing assignments, but he gives opportunity to rewrite and raise your grade. He gets more helpful as the semester progresses and tells you exactly how to edit. You'll learn valuable skills needed for the real world from this.",1
The group project for this class is very time consuming. That's just the way it's run for everyone though. He's a very good professor and a pretty funny guy.,1
Awesome teacher!!,1
Easy A! Her grading is straight forward. Just follow her outlines and you'll do great. Can get by without the book.,1
Great Teacher!!,1
If u r taking this class read everything in the sylabis! You will need it! if she gives u notes b prepared to take a pop quiz next class. Her notes are all over the place bring a recorder. Her tests are hard. STUDY THE TIME LINES! and yes she has favorites.,0
"I'm a history major so I thought this would be an easy class being that I have finished most of my upper level division courses and for some reason skipped this one. I've never in my life failed anything history related and I failed all three tests that she gives. Her tests are all essay, and she expects you to almost quote her verbatim.  ",1
"My average math grade in highschool was a 76. My grade in her class is a solid B (85). She gives a good amount of homework, but it really helped me understand what she was teaching. She teaches quick and simple ways to do math equations. She is funny, good sense of humor and reasonable with grading. I would recommend her to anyone.",1
"She's extremely kind, outgoing, and inspirational.  She is very passionate about her field and is always more than happy to help. Literally one of the best professors i have ever had. The one critique i would have is that she can wait to put things off until the last minute.But if you point this out to her, she will fix her time schedule.",1
"She is a very nice lady with a laid back teaching style. When writing essays, just follow all of the directions provided in the packet and you will get an A. Very easy class and teacher, take her class if you have the chance.",1
"Professor Wolverton is really good, not boring as a lecturer either.  She's helpful outside of class and the requirements for this class aren't hard, 3 very short essays.  Here study guides for the exams were straightforward and if you do the readings this class isn't hard.",1
She goes right off her powerpoints which teaches you NOTHING: you can obviously read. she gives you chapters to read each night but does TEACH you anything. she gives reviews for exams but then SURPRISE: only a few things she went over is actually on the exam. Papers are easy. Exams are hard. POP QUIZZES!!!,0
"To anyone who is serious about a career in communications, TAKE THIS CLASS. Dowding trains you to be a PR professional. His class is not easy, but you will leave knowing so much more. I came in a good writer, and I left his class an even better writer. Put in the work. Do your assignments. Ask for help. Honestly, truly, he cares about your success.",1
"The best professor that could ever happen to biochemistry. Biochemistry can be very challenging with the material, but he makes it very clear what he is expecting and is very passionate about making the material understandable. He is so sweet and makes time for study sessions and office hours so you can get the extra help. 12/10 recommend",1
"A challening, but interesting class! I learned a lot as a non-accounting major! His class was closly related to current events in Wall Street! Student were encouraged to ask questions in class! Great class!",1
She is an ok teacher.She very big on writing detailed papers.Doesnt like you to miss class and if over 10 min late you are absent! overall not that bad I passed!,1
Best professor! Wants his students to succeed ,1
"I sat in his class and felt lost the whole time. He is all over the place, he does not follow the quiz/test dates, his review sessions are useless. Tough grader, be prepared to read and self study !!!",0
Roxi was actually very respectful and hilarious despite all this bad mojo I see in the earlier reviews. This was my first quarter of college out of high school and I was frightened about writing. This was definitely an essay and journal heavy class but the feedback about readability and context helped me out SO MUCH. I would take her class again!,1
Professor Van Horn's class is great! She is very thoughtful and helpful. Would highly recommend this professor!!!,1
"Really disorganized, although he tries really hard.",0
"I Love this class,I recommend taking it! You have 2papers,a midterm and a project/paper as a final. just do the readings and pay attention in class and the her examples.",1
Sit back and be ready for open note tests. You'll be aware of what you need to know so its all about applying it. Easy grader,1
"I love Dr. H! She is by far my favorite professor at WKU. Her classes are well constructed, promote learning, and interesting. She's informative and responds quickly with questions. Even if you're not interested in Anth she makes it so if you try (which you should be doing) you can pass.",1
Professor Doubleday is an amazing professor and is perfect for teaching russian. Her conversation class is well organized and great for facilitating speaking skills. It was a fun class that definitely benefited my learning of a language.,1
"While obviously brillant by any standards, Nelson should not be teaching freshman composition. Lectures were not helpful and he was never clear about what he wanted in a paper, although he likes classical litterature more then modern stuff. The class was the bane of my existence this year.",0
"Dr. Hansen is a great guy, but the lectures are on the boring side. For someone not very interested in environmental science, I had a hard time paying attention during lectures. However, I know that he is great for people that have lots of questions about the topics of discussion.",1
Dr. Hinton is the best instructor! Hands down! She really helps you if you go to her office for office hours. She gives you a great review! She does go off topic really easily in her lectures but she presents the information in a way that it is really easy to understand. She's so funny! I would definitely take her again! :),1

If yoy take her class. You better lean on my math lab and be good at teaching yourself because she does not lecture and not good lectures when she does.,0
Dr. Berger is a terrible teacher. His lectures were beyond unclear which means you need to teach yourself everything. The class was fair because he does curve the exams but it's still quite frustrating. Quizzes are a great buffer for your grade at the end so try and do well on those. Take sepinsky.,1
Overall one of the best professors I've had for any class.  Loves the subject and can teach it well.  Student participation is crucial but he makes it interesting.  Do the homework and you'll get an A.,1
"She is by far the best teacher I've had, she is very patient and caring. Asbell does assign a couple of group projects and essays but she is whiling to work with you on due dates. She also expects you to participate in class and turn in the assignment on the date the class decides.",1
"His course is very simple, you have the skeleton notes and you can fill it in during class. There are weekly online assignments that are simple, and weekly quizzes that are simple. Overall straight forward class, Tom himself is a great person.",1
"Wow, Kubota is something else.  She is a tough teacher, but she keeps it entertaining.  I love going to class, but she makes it easy to skip because of daily homework and boring ""practice with partners"".  She also has a funny lazy eye :). but she's a good teacher, I signed up to have her next semester!",1
"There are a lot of reading but they come into play during the lecture. New to teaching so he can be rough around the edges. He also wants all students to engage in class. Also a very nice guy, easy to have conversations with.",1
"Dr. Ghosh is truly a great prof. She is caring, kind, & helpful. She is accessible by phone, email, Skype, & FaceTime. Her online course is very organized with clear instructions. You will have 1 on-campus exam, 12 quizzes, 4 reflections, 1 project, & extra credit. The book is required. Honestly, this class is an easy A.",1
"He's a pretty good professor.  MAke sure you do the reading, because he doesn't cover everything on the tests in the lectures.  He keeps your interest with films and CD's, but doesn't really involve you in the class.  It is more like he is talking at you, and not with you.  The material itself is interesting, but the class is 3 hours.",1
"This class in general is very difficult but this professor didn't help at all. Limited office hours, no extra credit and your grade is 75% exams.  homework is 25%. He expects you to read each chapter 4 times, and come with questions. Wont tell anyone what is on the exams. If you don't ask, he doesn't tell. Will make you feel dumb for asking ?'s",0
"Best professor I've ever had. Made learning really fun, and made me laugh a lot. I was always interested in going to class every day, plus he was an easy grader.",1
Dr. Hansen is great guy and this was a very interesting class. Attendance is non mandatory but you should go. There are reading quizzes but they are easy. Also has a couple projects but they are easy to get full credit on. The material was more difficult for me to learn but Hansen and the TA's are great.,1
"If you ever get a chance to take a class with them, do it!",1
I recommend everyone to take her for ENG 1O1 or ENG 102 if you can. She's literally the best English professor I had. All you have to do is attend class and do all the papers she assigns and do well on the exams and you'll pass. She really cares about her students and tries her best to make sure everyone can get a passing grade.,1
"Former mayor of Philly so he has cool guests. The class was very easy and there is a lot of opportunities to really participate and learn about local gov. You truly just have to show up and complete assignments, which are rather short. He gives a unique perspective which I feel is valuable. Definitely very interesting to say the least.",1
Great professor! She works you out at your level and I also enjoyed the individual attention that she gives. She is also a great motivator!,1
"Very good philosophy professor. Attention to the class is a must, as he teaches rather fast (and sometimes the topics can be very confusing). This is not an ""Easy A"" class, but it is very rewarding.",1
"Sam is a nice guy, his class is a joke, and he knows that. Nobody pays attention in class, everyone is on their phones or doing something else; it's kinda sad. He is very passionate and if you pay attention you will learn something new every class. He gives pop quizzes pretty often, but they're just for attendance purposes. Assignments/tests  easy",1
It is easy to get an A in and he will help you to make sure you do.  It isn't a lot of work but he does teach the material and on the quizzes he gives you will have to study.  failing a quiz won't affect your grade though.  If you show that you want to pass he will pass you.,1
"Attendance is not mandatory but it's just so hard to miss his amazing lectures. If you like discussions, hands down Professor Scott is the best to form a healthy interesting discussions. I never saw such large numbers of engaged excited students like his class. His grading could be tough but I just feel that he gives you the reality. Defo Recommend",1
"Mrs. Thrasher is a very nice professor, however, I can't say I have no complaints about the class. Her class just isn't engaging. It's very dull, and it can make something as cool as ancient Egypt seem boring. She says attendance is mandatory, but she only took it on the first day. Her class is really easy though for those looking for a GPA boost.",1
"Daniel Proga's class is super easy. He only gives out 3 test and one final. He'll tell you straight up that you can find his Quiz Review answers on quizlet. Study quizzes and you'll pass. Trick to his class is that he takes 5 random attendance days, and it will effect your grade if you don't do well on test.",1
"Takes into consideration adversities students endure (i.e. stress, anxiety). She does not tolerate stupidity - check your emails, don't pretend you know what you're doing and come to her later in the semester about to fall apart. Utilize your resources (i.e. writing center & tutor).",1
"When they said the best, i almost laughed. She was, at first, the nicest person ever. I started off stong, and she made me believed that i was doing excellent even at the end. Then when i received a NP i was shocked nun the least. The books were interesting and easy to follow. As a person, she is awesome... as a teacher,Never Again!!!!!!!!!!!",0
"Unbeleivalbe how he can be a teacher. Absolutely incomprehensible lectures. He likes to make the students feel stupid when they ask questions. The guy has to realize that we're there to learn the subject; that's why we're asking questions. Never in my life had I been subject to a more useless, confusing-for-the-sake-of-cunfusing teacher in my life.",0
"Dr. Ghosh is excellent and she is organized, and the course is very useful. She answers her emails usually fast. I learned a lot. The book is kind of expensive. Need to watch the deadlines. But she is a good teacher.",1
"Lectures mainly consist of powerpoints with the occasional group project. She is very nice and always willing to answer any questions you have. She tries her best to always find a book that is also free online. She has four tests a semester, reading is important but you can get by with skimming as long as you pay attention to the lecture and study.",1
I love RIT,0
AWESOME Teacher!!!! EXTREMELY helpful and always willing to help!! UNDERSTANDING too!!! I RECOMMEND ANY OF HIS CLASSES!!,1
"Professor Laucella was probably one of the best Freshman seminar classes Kennesaw has. She is so caring and understanding and I don't know anyone who could dislike her. You do take a quiz every day in class but she tells you exactly what chapter it is over so textbook use, YES. Its not hard at all to finish her class with an A.",1
"I thought the material for this class was interesting. Quizzes on the readings every meeting time (fairly easy if you did the readings) and some group projects. Very nice man, and very willing to help you",1
"If I could give this professor a zero rating, I would. He has absolutely no care in the world for his students and if you go to him with personal concerns he will send your email to the entire class and then tell you to drop the class. STAY AWAY IF AT ALL POSSIBLE. He tends to ramble and not actually stay on track to what he's teaching.",0
"This was an 8am class, but she was one of those teachers who reads the powerpoints to you. The material seems common sense, but when you get the exams, they are tricky and ask random statistical questions. The first exam average was a D that had to be curved 20 points. The worst part of the class is that you are required to take ""clicker quizzes.""",1
"THOUGHT THIS CLASS WAS GONNA BE GOOD BECAUSE HE WAS SUCH A NICE AND LAID BACK TEACHER. HE DOESNT RESPOND TO EMAILS AND HE TALKS TOO MUCH DURING LECTURES, MAKING IT UNCLEAR ON WHAT TO STUDY FOR THE CLASS. VERY CONCEITED, TESTS ARE HARD. ITS NOT WORTH THE GEN ED.",0
"Chris has very valuable in-field experience.  This class had the potential to be extremely boring and tedious, but Chris made it enjoyable.  He mixed things up and still taught all the material.  Even though he gets tongue tied occasionally, he knows his stuff and is fair.  Great teacher. ",1
"Mr. Abutayeb was, and still is the worst teacher I have ever had. He kicked me out of the classroom because another person kept turning around and talking, then he thought it was ME he was talking to. I tried to explain to him the what happened, but he just called security on both of use. WORST TEACHER EVER!!! GOOD LUCK WITH THIS GUY!!!",0
Professor is very knowledgeable on course material and fair in her grading,1
Great Professor. His expectations were very clear since the beginning. I would take a class of his again!,1
"DO NOT take this class if you expect to learn anything. I took A&P 1 with him...Very good class if this is a repeat for u and u only need the credit. self taught students should b fine. Dont email or call him, he wont answer. He will lower ur grade for missing classes, study and memorize ur practice tests and u will ace this class.",0
"We had homework every class, quizzes every week, and lectures were definitely quick and required you to pay close attention and take careful notes. If you're not afraid to stop him to ask clarification questions and put time into understanding the homeworks, the class & exams are straightforward. He's also SO funny.",1
"He's there to help you understand the material, but your final grade depends on how hard you work. Definitely cannot skip this class, missing one day can be crucial.",1
"Never rude but speaks very loud, has several catchphrases which get annoying to hear over and over again over time, very much of a rule stickler.",1
pam does a nice job with examples of what she is teaching.  she gets you excited about what you are doing and realizes we have lives outside of school.  she is tough on grading but it is worth the work.  i recommend her if you really want to enjoy your class,1
"2 tests, 2 debates, 2 Easy projects. This class is so easy.",1
No Comments,0
"I loved this prof!!  He took his time explaining every concept thoroughly. The questions on his midterm were very similar to the assignment questions there are no surprises on the quizzes, midterm or final. If you're good at math attendance is optional, if not his lectures will definitely help you.",1
"If chemistry and mathematics are not your strong suit, I wouldn't recommend him. He is very smart in his field, but with that comes skipping the work and math in problems. This course is very math based so it does take some patience and practice to get a good handle on it. He is very good at explaining reasoning and theory which is helpful!",0
"i got a 100% in this class...i got 100s on everything in the class, ofc i studied and tried to understand the material. he is the collest prof ever",1
"This class is for people who understand Algebra or have just taken it a few semesters ago, unlike me that hasn't taken a math class in 5 years. She doesn't bother to explain a problem she makes the students explain it. If you're behind it feels almost impossible to catch up. I do not recommend professor Flores if you have trouble with math.",0
"Super enthusiastic with good lectures, homework gets exponentially harder but it's not bad if you start earlier in the week. Lots of help available from tutors, CLUE, TAs. Will have to read a textbook but is available online and is helpful.",1
"I had professor D'Angelo for the Spring '09 mythology and folklore session.  If I ever had to give a teacher a good rating, it's this guy.  He is more passionate about this subject than any other professor I've encountered.  REQUEST HIM!!!",1
"Dr. Goldenbaum is excellent. She is a fountain of knowledge. Her strong German accent may make her difficult to understand at times, but she is a genius, a fair grader, and an excellent instructor in general. I wholeheartedly recommend Ursula",1
"She is very boring, has surprise quizzes so you have to come to lecture, and is very unhelpful.  Quizzes and tests suck.",0
"she requires many books that you have to order online because some are not available in book stores. Although i highly recommend to not buy all books she does not even use them, also her syllabus was not clear on her grading, i got a 74 and she gave me a D which dropped my GPA by a lot unfortunately. I thought as all professors a D was 69 or 70",0
"One of the best professors you will ever have. Not only will she be there for you for this class but she will mentor and help with any other areas. SO nice! VERY sweet! Down to earth! Very fun class, easy A if you apply yourself and attend class. DON'T miss out on this professor, you'll regret it!",1
"I love writing but based on grading criteria, I always followed the guidelines and have always aced English courses prior. She is a tough grader and you will need to take all extra credit opportunities to pass the class with an A. She does give opportunities to revise large papers after being given a grade. HUGE paper for a final grade- mine was 40",1
"Took terrorism and Contemporary . Amazing lecturer and kept me engaged and interested. Work is really not that hard if you go to class and pay attention to his anecdotes on the readings. Honestly,  I skimmed the books and got A's in both classes since he goes over books in great detail in class. Very interesting classes. Pop quizzes but small %. ",1
"Anita Disney is truly everything you could want in a professor. She's brilliant, caring, engaging, and reasonable. Her class isn't needlessly difficult and I found that I learned more in her course than any other I've taken because I was willing to go above what was asked out of respect to her and interest in the subject. Cannot recommend enough.",1
Takes forever to get graded work back to students but is flexible with deadlines and assignment criteria. Very understanding but also is very picky and likes things her own way.,1
"He's going to try to scare you like he's this tough professor in this not so easy to pass course but its all a front. He wants you to pass and as long as you put some sort of effort into the class and ask him questions from time to time, he WILL pass you. Talks about himself a lot but he's very caring and intelligent. You'll learn a lot.",1
Awesome!!,1
DO NOT TAKE HIM FOR BIODIVERSITY. I had him for bio 2 and he was fair so I thought this class would be a good one to get my ecology credit. NOPE biggest regret. He tries to teach us everything he knows which is very overwhelming and we end up not learning anything. About to graduate as a bio major and this is the hardest class Ive taken.,0
"Nice, funny, super interesting lectures, but exams are a total guessing game.  However, everyone is pretty lost and he does his own sort of curve.  The project is extremely tedious and kind of disorganized. His disorganization is what makes it difficult, not the material.",0
"I took Botany, Plant Bio, and latin and greek scientific terminology from Christine. She is a tough teacher if you don't have any interest in the subject. She is an amazing teacher if your are interested. Sharp as a tack, witty, and just sweet and caring. She doesn't have patience for slackers though!",1
"He's a funny and nice professor. There are going to be times where he would sign pop quizzes. Overall, a good professor for History majors out there.",1
"Well respected, tough on the outside but truly cares about his students. I love Wofford classes and the knowledge I get from them. A great professor.",1
"Frère Dalton really loves the French language and while I am not a huge fan of the language, he made this class enjoyable and I did learn a lot from him.",1
"She is a good teacher, but does like to make you work. The work is easy enough if you keep up with her.",1
Jose was a great and caring professor. He explained the lessons thoroughly and was always glad to help out students. One of the best professors I've ever had. I would take him again.,1
Attendance is mandatory. Class wasn't bad the tests are just extremely hard compared to what you learn in this class. Wasn't the best at answering questions or helping you out,0
"I am about to take my 4th semester with Tokunaga-Sensei. She is easygoing and makes a genuine effort to gauge conversations to each student's skill level. I enjoy that she only speaks in Japanese during class. I wish the level of difficulty was more consistent with her written tests. She teaches 4 semesters, your only option for intermediate JPN.",1
His class was thorough and very easy to follow he explained everything perfectly and answered all questions when asked. He does have random quizzes Which threw me off at first and he won't announce test so check the syllabus in advance also on the Note of quizzes he allows you to partner quiz almost the entire quarter.,1
"Has great energy and does a good job keeping things interesting. Not a fan of the letting peers grade your speeches, doesn't seem fair because some people are just nicer than others regardless of how you did. Also, for some reason her grading pg in moodle factors in speeches which you have not done yet, making your grade lower than it actually is. ",1
"His lectures are AMAZING! I had him only for half a semester for General Studies, but the class was so interesting and really grasps your attention. He is crazy smart and is understanding if you can't make it to class. Whatever you do, DO NOT walk into class with your phone in site; PUT IT AWAY. Anyways, Dr. Bartl is great and attractive as well ;)",1
"One of the easiest classes I have taken! She is one of the nicest professors I've had and will take time to help with any questions/problems. I ended with an A+ both semesters I had her. She posts her lecture notes online, but you get extra credit if you attend. Gives reviews similar to the test.",1
Best prof I've ever had.,1
"I highly recommend takin this class with Wei-Chiao. She has an obvious passion for the subject and is committed to ensuring the experience of the class is effective. It was valuable to receive feedback from her for each assignment. The textbook is a good guide, but most of the content was lecture based. It's all about the interview assignments.",1
"Professor Perez is a great teacher, who is extremely passionate and knowledgeable about what he teaches. I would definitely take his classes again if I get the chance. His lectures are amazing and the readings he chooses are actually very interesting. All readings are posted, so no books necessary. He gives you the prompt for midterm ahead of time!",1
She is such a great professor! I would take this class again.,1
"Darin is the worst professor I have ever had. He never gave me any feedback on any of the work I did, which makes it hard to do well on tests if you don't know what you got wrong on HW. Very confusing, never made anything clear.",0
"Easiest class I've ever taken at BSU, show up to class and do homework for other courses to fill the void of how dreadfully boring this course is. He's a nice guy, but not a suited professor. Very lenient when it comes to homework. Minimal homework as it is, it'd be impossible to do poorly in this class. Gives exact answers to midterm/final",1
"I'm really dumbfounded by some of these poor reviews, Miles is by far my favorite professor at DePaul. I would highly recommend taking one of his classes. He's a great professor and I always found his classes interesting and thought provoking.",1
"She is hilarious! The class will keep you listening. there are quizzes everyday in class so you have go to class. I liked my TA. TALK!!! everything that is asked, reply to, it gets you points, especially if you dont go to class often. Only 1 exam in the class, 5 speeches, 5 essays, 1 big video project at the end.",1

"I loved having him for World Religion! He's laid back and down to earth. The assignments or quizzes are not hard! If you take notes and do the assignments, you're sure to get an A!",1
"Well, the class in itself was easy. She was very hard to understand, would not give good feedback or review tests. Would not recommend. Even though I got a B, the class was more self taught than taught by a professor.",0
I took Research Methods over the summer (3 week class). It was pretty difficult and I'm surprised I did as well as I did. He really does want you to succeed and my class worked hard to impress him. You want to get on his good side,1
"This class is a lot of fun and really not that much work. It's pretty helpful if you have stage fright. You can't really be sensitive or lack a sense of humor, Val is unfalteringly honest, funny, and somewhat intidimating. The key to this class is SHOWING UP and DOING WORK, she gets pissed otherwise.",1
"The best professor Ive ever had... he cares about his students and he tends to get off topic, but everything he talks about... is helpful and helps me remember what we went over in class. I recommend taking his History 1302 class, it was super easy to pass.",1
"You have to be a certain type of personality to both enjoy Nelson's teaching style and to connect with/appreciate him as an individual. He totally intimidated me for the first month, but I came out of his class feeling very glad that I took on the challenge. If you won't be willing to refine your writing style and skills, do not take his class.",1
"This was the best class ever.  It was extremely hard, but so awesome, and Nancy really knew what she was talking about.  Plus she totes her Australopithecine bones around in a J.Crew bag, which is funny for some reason!",1
"She is passionate about chem and wants you to succeed. Her ""Chem Survivor Guide"" condenses all pertinent and tested info into one manual, which is also the basis of her lecture. She is extremely approachable and caring, and clear about what she wants on the test. No surprises: pay attention to lecture & take time to study the guide, you'll do well.",1
"Great professor but this class involves little more work than average. You have one paper that is reviewed by people in your class, and you are responsible for making either a Ted Ed like video, Ted talk, or podcast. You are also responsible for reviewing other classmates papers. Not hard assignments by any means but take some time. You also have a test that you will take 3 different times, and it's the same test every time. He's a little unorganized and changes the schedule as you go. Overall though very unique way of teaching, great teacher/person, and I would recommend this class. It's easy assignments and he' an easy grader but will take some time/effort so be prepared.",1
"She doesn't email back, the tests don't make sense most of the time, and the whole ""flip the classroom"" thing is super confusing and doesn't help with actually learning.",0
"Absolutely ludacris that this class is allowed to be taught at a University that prides itself on innovation and intelligence. Khalsa attempts to use modern physiology to explain the benefits of yoga (mostly erroneous claims) and teaches in a rather cultish fashion. If you have any respect for the advances of science, DO NOT take this course.",0
"This dude is awful, has a thick African accent, lacks modern teaching techniques. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS .  Should go back to tutor school. ",0
"Katey is by far my favorite professor at UMD so far. She is so enthusiastic about teaching and she applies what she is teaching to real life situations. She makes class interesting! She teaches with power points, and taking notes is crucial since she doesn't post them. If you go to class and do your work, it's an easy A. Definitely recommend her!",1

"Dr. Graham is one of the best teachers I've had. He explains things in a clear fashion, often explaining in a "" how I would do it"" fashion. Never shoots down students ideas or questions, but explores them. Lots of pop quizzes, but you are able to opt out of them if you want. He does not assign homework either. I highly recommend that you take him.",1
Wouldnt have passed w/o my smart boyfriend. Lectures are just him making something complicated when it is simple & he only lectured once or twice a week. I hardly attended class. Only days of quizzes/exams. Gives many assignments that are tedious & not helpful. You are better off getting tutored at the learning center than going to his class.,0
"Don't get me wrong this class is not hard at all. If you do all the chapter reviews, online quizzes and papers you will get an A in the class. The midterm and final is easy. I never went to class because the professor was mono tone and not engaging at all.",0
"Berkson was a great professor! Class is all lecture based, and is always behind schedule, but understandable. Every night there are readings, but most are not mandatory. As long as you pay attention in class. It can get boring at times, but Berkson tries his hardest! wants all students to succeed and will help you In anyways possible!",1
"I took Dr. Ponce for counseling 150 & 160, all I can say is that she is truly is amazing and extremely knowledgeable. If you don't believe in yourself in the beginning of the course, you definitely will in the end of it! Just make sure to show up, do your assignments, participate and you'll do great! I am truly grateful for her, si se puede!",1
"Very unprofessional woman. Never stopped bragging. If u want 2 learn something productive in her class, just buy the book and teach yourself. Doesn't empathize with the difficulties of her students. And apparently doesn't put in practice the Ph.D. in ""psychology"" she has for she only acknowledges her life, her struggles, her Ph.D and finally, HER!",0
"He is just my favorite professor, got you scared a bit at first) but then ou realize that he is very kind hearted)extremely funny and helpful if you need him! U'll have lots of fun ) take him)",1
Dr. Ben is great. He has good sense of humor so lectures arent boring. Info is thorough and hes very accessible if you have Question during or outside of class. Do the readings and assignments youll do well,1
"Dr. Ghosh is an okay professor. She puts EVERYTHING expected on the first day which is nice but she posts too much information. It's quite overwhelming. It'd be better if she made it to the point right away. Also, she says she will get to you through email.... which is not true. She responds late and doesn't fully answer your question.",1
"She is super nice and helpful. She gave an insane amount of work, but was very understanding and explained the material well. She is dedicated to making sure students know the material!",1
I took this class asynchronously and it was mostly about getting your work done. She waited until the end of the semester to start grading everything but is an easy grader. When you sign up for a group at the beginning of the semester you will be doing several assignments in that same group. Start the assessment assignment early it is a long one!,1
"Awesome preceptor to have for clinical, she really cares about you and your learning! Wicked easy going too and is willing to bend the rules of the syllabus to help you",1
"shimko is a pretty well organized and easy to follow in lectures. He is quite competant overall. However, beware his tests/essays. The essay part isnt that bad if you study beforehand, but i consider the fill in blanks hard - some simple questions you didnt think needed studying for and get wrong thus getting only an average grade. Good overall :)",1
"Chris is the nicest guy you'll meet. Problem is, he has no idea how to teach and no idea how to get the right words across to you. You can't just sit and listen to him. If you want to get anything from his lectures, you have to pay extra close attention, think a little bit, and ask lots and lots of questions.",0
"Dr. Brown is one of the worst professors NC State has to offer. His lectures are absolutely useless in which he emphasizes stuff that does not matter I would extend a whole semester than to take a class with him again If you are unfortunate enough to take him, I would suggest treating the class as an online class and learn the concept from YouTube.",0
"I took him for 389, which is one of the most difficult classes for a history major. He was really great when it came to helping me write my paper. He even offered me an extension when I was 1000 words short in the last week. Really great guy and super helpful if you go to him. ",1
"She doesn't teach us anything. Every weekly class session she talks about her personal life, berates us for not knowing the material she isn't teaching us, and then if we ask her to explain the topics we are supposed to be learning she says ""that isn't her teaching style"". I'm changing majors because of this professors incompetence. AVOID HER",0
"matt is so sweet! while he only does the lab instructing for stats psy230, he is a major factor in helping people pass! attend lab every week to get the most help, e will always help (in class, over email, etc.) try to get him as your lab prof if you can!",1
"Dr. Simms is very knowledgeable of the subject, but he is not good at explaining things to people who do not understand the subject. He's hard of hearing, asking questions during class is kinda hard unless you literally yell. There was a paper to write, and there was no clear idea of what he wanted, AKA no outline.",0
"She is a very nice lady that is always willing to help. Essays and readings are quite hard, and I don't recommend procrastinating on the research. There are four total essays, but she explains everything pretty well. The last essay was around 8-10 pages. If you don't get at least a C or higher on these, then you will fail.",1
"Dr. Ortega is amazing! He has an accent, but you get used to it! He is a caring and a sweet professor. His lectures are interesting, and his exam questions are clear and direct. His exams are solely based on his power-points! Also, don't miss the chance of taking the Fair Child tour with him! He abundant knowledge and is passionate about plants!!!",1
"Her lectures are helpful but you need to really pay attention. It's like any other math course. If you don't pay attention don't expect to pass. The material for this course isn't very challenging, so, if you spend at least 2 hours a day studying, you won't have an issue. She does assign homework but doesn't collect it, it's just for extra help.",1
"I took Dan's class in 2018-2019, best professor ever. Was very helpful. He does not skip steps, very through with his work. I miss his class.",1
"Do you want to feel humiliated? Do you want to cry after class and be stressed out? Do you want to have crazy high expectations in assignments but 0 teaching/guidance? This is your class! For real, stay away.",0
"Dr. Leikand words his exams and quizzes in ways that do not follow the text or his lectures. I find myself constantly confused, and I have read the textbook cover to cover. This class is structured where you read half of a chapter, take a quiz, then you have lecture on what you read, after you've already taken the quiz.",0
Good class,1
"I recommend Professor Baumgartner to anyone taking ANP 101 he is the TRUTH. You will pass ANP 101 the first time, so as long you come to class, take notes, study materials given, and ask questions.",1
Ms. V is so nice and helpful.  I have never had such a pleasant and interesting science instructor.,1
"Very hard, lots of reading. Lectures are really boring...he tends he go off on tangents alot. Thought I was in a history class, not an english class half the time. Very critical when grading essays. Take another teacher if you can.",0
"Arka was a great teacher, and his tests were VERY similar to the sample tests he provided.  The homework is reasonable, and he is more than willing to interact and help his students.  Take his class!",1
For humanities she never ever lectured. The whole class was reading and then taking notes to present in a group discussion. We also watched documentaries that she herself had never even seen. When grading she was kind of unfair about it. I had an A in the class the whole time then with the last essay on the final she screwed me over with a B.,0
"He seems chill as a person but I wish he made the class more fun and have us really practice our speaking skills more in class. It seems like he rushes through all the speeches he assigns us and doesnt give us much time to really prepare for it. Also, his lectures were kinda boring and I felt like it didnt really connect to the subject in a way.",1
She's a pretty awesome professor! Her notes are always on point with the test. The notes are easy to understand and study. She tells funny stories that relate to bio. She's very funny and an overall pleasure to have as a teacher! If your taking bio definitely ask your advisor if professor zeman is available !!!!!,1
Although his jokes are lame and he tends to give facts/side notes about mathematicians he makes the class understandable. He gives plenty of time to do the hw and ask questions on the hw. Knows what he's talking about and wants you to understand too. HW assigned basically every class but not a lot of quizzes/tests and no final. Take his class :D,1
"He's a good guy. This is a great class to take if you just need to get your gen ed math requirement out of the way. You still have to do the work assigned and put in a little effort, but all in all it's easy. May want to consider a different professor if you'll be taking higher maths, though. Doesn't let the class drag on-- teaches what's necessary",1
Love Kathy! She actually cares about her students and is very understanding. Offers a lot of extra credit. The classes are pretty repetitive but not hard. Book used for weekly online quizzes.,1
"The first day of class professor brooks told everyone that he teaches every class as though he were teaching his own children ""and I want my children to succeed"". He gives 3 to 5 quizzes a week and a lot of reading. Just do the work and you'll do fine.",1
I loved her class. It's not easy but it's not impossible. She is strict when it comes to grading but I found her class really helped me and now every time I write an essay I keep in mind her tips. There are lots of reading and class discussions but she is very kind and open if you need her help. I would take her class again because she is very good,1
No Comments,1
Mrs. Jimmerson is an amazing teacher. The work is difficult at times but what in life isn't. She is a bit of a grammar freak when it comes to writing essays but overall I thoroughly enjoyed the class.,1
Dr. Cox is an incredible teacher and really cares about her subject matter. She is also very caring and was very understanding of both medical and emotional issues that affected my ability to do school work. I took another one of her classes the next semester because I loved her teaching style so much.,1
"The best teacher/professor I've had to this point, he makes history fun and easy to understand with his absolutely stunning and electrifying lectures! And surely, this professor rating website is a Monumental Moment in Media History? Grading wise, just pay attention and take notes, and you'll be fine. Highly recommend, great experience overall!",1
"Her workbooks were very clear but she taught very very fast. In the beginning, she emphasized that she welcomed questions but then seemed irritated when students asked questions. It was too embarrassing to say if you fell behind but you can keep up with the workbooks! Overall a very nice woman, but taught too quickly!",1
He is amazing. Honestly. Yes he's tough because he expects you to work for your grade. This is college. Honestly I'm a lazy student but this subject is just so interesting. I changed my major because of him. He is so inspiring and thoughtful. His three hour lectures make me pay attention because of how interesting they are. But be prepared to READ!,1
"Dr. Fetter is the man. He genuinely cares about all of his students, and wants them to succeed. He is always willing to help if you need it, and makes so many tools for you to understand stats. I'm not a math person but I had a B/A the entire semester.",1
She was a decent teacher but without my prior knowledge and amazing TA I don't think I would've done as well. She gives random extra credit assignments and points which is a big plus.,1
One of the best professors at CSULA hands down. Amazing lecturer and great guy all around. Very knowledgeable.,1
In my entire collegiate career (15 years) By far the worst math teacher ever. Goes entirely too fast for those of us who are learners by doing. Skipping steps is not a good idea for calculus (the algebra is just as important). Be ready to teach your self the course. Exams are nothing like the book or his lectures. He gets a zero from me!,0
"Amazing professor, super helpful if you ask for it. Nice lady! Her tests are very hard though, but it is worth it to take this class",1
"Biomedical Image Processing is not an easy subject. However, Dr. Okada makes it easy to understand. He is always reachable to answer your question even during this pandemic! Very lenient grader and a lot of extra credit so don't feel bad if you didn't do well on the midterm!",1
The professor makes the class so easy for us.,1
"Prof. Thana is one of the best teachers in Peralta. If you really want to learn something and challenge yourself, Thana is the one. Thana wants his students to be prepared for the tech industry and explains all algorithms and concepts in detail. He doesn't really care about deadlines as long as you're working hard.",1

Great prof! Make sure to attend all lectures and do all assignments and ask questions when needed! The material is not the easiest.,1
I took this class online and it was a great experience. She was very easy to work with and made all of the expectations very clear. She was very good about responding to emails promptly and when Myaccounyinglab was down for maintenance she was very good about allowing us extra time for assignments and quizes,1
"He is an amazing professor who has your interest in mind. His tests are easy and straight from your notes. Listen and recognize the music. There are descriptions for each song that help a lot. Extra credit is easy. You can sing, play an instrument, or hit pots. Easy A. Attend class in-person/online and you'll get the grade you want.",1
"He is a good teacher.  He really knows what he is talking about.  He is funny, and really helpful. I reccommend Dr. Nikkel for a religion class.",1
"THICK accent. I'm Asian and I couldn't stand the high pitch voice. Your grade is based on attendance/participation & 3 exams. Study the textbook unless you miraculously can understand and stomach her voice. We're in college, but she had us read the syllabus aloud in class, line by line.  Dropped her class, I do NOT recommend this prof.",0
Take this class for your GenEd! It is super easy but also a lot of fun. He makes the class interesting and throws in relevant artists like Beyonce. There are only a few assignments and tests which are all really easy. He takes random attendance so make sure you are there everyclass. He is really nice and caring and you should take this class w/ him,1
"she rocks! show up, take notes, she tells you what is on the tests, do the 3 papers and do the final, EASY PASS AND UNITS!!!!!!",1
"Travis is a great math teacher! I would recommend him. Yes, math is hard, and you will have to put more time trying to learn it yourself throughout the semester.",1
"STAT 212 is the absolute worst class I've ever taken at UVA.  The way the class is run is terrible... it seems as if Ted Chang and his TA's WANT you to fail.  Tests are extremely difficult and nothing at all like the homework.  The only reason I took this was for my Econ major.  For an intro course, it's unnecessarily painful.",0
"HE IS A GREAT PERSON! HE IS AMAZING, I RESPECT HIM SO MUCH! TAKE HIS CLASS, YOU WILL NEVER REGRET!",1
"I love this man! Gorgeous, Gorgeous, Gorgeous!!!",1
"His exams are open note, so if you take good notes you're golden.  He is one of my top five all-time favorite professors.",1
"If you can take Ross I would highly recommend him. He responds to his emails very quickly and comes across in a way that is relatable. His lectures are relaxed, yet informative. He normally divides class into lectures and group problems. Pay attention to in-class examples and group problems because they often show up on tests.",1
"Dr. Tops has taken over EGRE 206 and its an improvement from previous professors. Hes very interesting, you wont be bored. But time can be spent more so going over concepts than doing practice problems when in a class like this practice problems help the most. TAs can grade harsh and somewhat unfair, but will give points back. Good class overall",1
one of the best economics prof in thsi university...,1
"Elena is one of the most engaging, encouraging professors I've had. I took her course on the cinema of Latin America, and she covered all the bases: the sociopoliticalcontextual, narrative, and aesthetic aspects of the films. There was something for everyone in the class to grab onto. Elena is amenable to each student's needs and interests.",1
"I took the Honors course and it was fairly easy. There are quizzes every Sunday, but the questions come right out of the textbook so they are never difficult. There are 5 speeches you have to give and the major ones are weighted pretty heavily, however, they aren't that difficult to get an A on. Downsides: hard tests and drags out the class talking",1
"I'm in Dr. Hauck's class right now and it's my favorite class. It's an 8 am three days a week, but it's not that bad at all. He's funny and very specific on what he wants, but he also makes himself a good resource to pass the class.",1
"Great at teaching. I have never learned so much in math as I have with him. Easy to learn, explains everything clearly. ",1
Prof. Lane helped me succeed. It isnt a good idea to Miss classes as all the notes will matter. Every thing he warned us about was on our Exams. Go to office hours if youre struggling. The patience he has to teach is priceless.,1
"The prior rating is not true. Prof. Is caring and if she doesnt explain is cuz she want us to be pro active between classmates. I honestly have to say that I probably not pass her class but was my fault for missing so many homeworks to turned in. If I have to take this class again I will do it with her. Shes very patient, helpful and fair. ��",1
"I did not take statistics during HS and felt that his class was definitely doable. He's a really nice guy and always willing to hear any suggestions from students but there were times when lectures were a little messy. Overall, tests were straightforward, TAs sometimes picky about the HW, but not a hard class.",1
"Not a bad guy. It's a tough subject for most, but he does a good job explaining it. 3 quizzes which are easy, 3 group projects that you do in class, and 2 exams that he practically tells you exactly what’s on them. Make sure to put every question from your slides onto your study sheet.",1
"Professor Peter is really kind and considerate of his students. His quizzes and exams are easy if you study,the exam's questions are sometimes verbatim from the exam review. He encourages students to ask questions, and is a great teacher. I did not like the group projects however, they are VERY long, our most recent lab was 11 pages long.",1
"She is kind of uptight, but I think she just didn't like our class because everyone was so disrespectful. Kind of boring, I once fell asleep on total accident! Just study the notes and it's not hard at all. Gives pop quizzes and in class assignments that you cant make up, so go to class!",1
"Easy class for biology 2, no anatomy of physio stuff at all; recommends using openstax free text but exams are based on simple powerpoints and are straightforward, mainly multiple choice very easy, & some open-ended q's a little harder. Plenty extra credit weekly. Overall lovely professor and person, you will miss her at end of semester. I love her",1
Prof Engelke was thorough and expected greatness from her students. I felt like she expected us to know the content that she was responsible for teaching to us before she taught.  She ran hot and cold...,1
"Dr. Hale is a great professor! Very helpful especially if you take the time to go to office hours. Truly interested in getting to know his students and helping them succeed. Not an easy A, but will definitely take another class of his.",1
The exams were tricky and there were some questions on the exams that were not in the readings nor in her lectures/ppts. She doesnt like to help others when they have a question about a concept and when she does help the explanation is no good. Avoid taking her class!,0
"Good teacher.  He retaught me Pre-Algebra and Intermediate Algebra.  Very interactive with the students.  Very fair grader.  Just do the the HW & you will be fine.  PS bring back the ""giving points"" it made the class fun.",1
Dr. Record was an amazing teacher considering that he was teaching a completely online format. He was extremely well-organized and made sure due dates were very obvious. As long as you keep up with the assignments the class is an easy A. Would highly recommend!,1
Best BU Psych 101 professor,1
My first semester at Wayne State and Professor Reyes was so far one of the best professors Ive had yet.,1
"She uses the socratic method to get students who are struggling with concepts to realize the answer as said in another comment. She doesn't mean to single students out, it could feel that way. Personally I would take her class again because she will go out of her way to help you and answer questions. Also do not be afraid to ask questions in class.",1
"I enjoyed this class. I reference what I learned all the time. We read two books and many excerpts, but it never felt over whelming. Participation was not required, but everyone wanted to join the discussion. 8/10 would recommend. 10/10 with rice.",1
"Professor McKnight is a stellar professor who ensures his students grasp the fundamentals of German. Homework every night, but it is very doable. Group projects were enjoyable and rewarding. Participate in class and attend most of the lectures, and you will be in good shape. Would definitely take this class again.",1
hard grader,1
Took the course with him early in my Business program. One of the best profs for sure!,1
"The class is more of an art criticism class. Most class periods were not painting. We listened to her slideshows for many class periods, and when it was time to paint she wouldn't let you start painting unless she liked the idea herself. Made me feel bad about myself as a painter. Pushes her agenda on you. Take if you like abstract art.",0
"I didn't put hot because i dont really care about my professors looks, she's cool and fun ive taken her twice already for spch 121, and spch 120.She's also the debate club cooordinator and she rocks!",1
"Lectures are fantastic- Tompson is animated and engaging. She has lots of funny anecdotes but can get off track sometimes. This PS101 class has more work than the other sections: mandatory paper, 3 midterms, and a final. However, the lowest midterm score is dropped. However, she is very clear about what'll be on the exams.",1
"This is the perfect example of people hating the professor for not being able to understand the material themselves. Programming is a new concept for most, so people blame him when they're struggling in the class. His lectures are very helpful, he goes over the labs (often giving you the answers as well), and has a funny and personality. Take him",1
"Russ knows his stuff. However, his course requires a lot of work as you have a chapter quiz every week and he picks 5 questions for each quiz. So you need to know the entire chapter for a quiz that's worth 1.8%, but when midterms and finals are here, you only need to review the material as you should know most of it from his weekly quizzes.",1
"J564 was an interesting class and Prof Mcleod gives great lectures, but there is quite a bit of reading and the tests were pretty tough. There were 5 exams, several papers and also a group project. Also beware if you take this class online that the lectures are very long. Good class overall, but be prepared to but in a decent amount of effort.",1
"He is a very intelligent teacher. If you do your homework, you will get a good grade. There are about 4 papers you have to write, but he is extremely helpful. He really cares about his students. He likes telling stories so class isn't always dull. I recommend him!",1
"Won't provide any keys, will ask questions you haven't seen in homework or in class, will not curve, lots of useless POGIL, writes on board often (cannot read his handwriting). Recommend taking lab at the same time because he will ask stuff in lecture that you've only learned in the lab. Only positive thing I can say is that he's pretty nice.",0
She will not hold your interest.,0
"Excellent teacher. being a physics class, the course work was never easy.  but he was a great help, always willing to go in depth and explain everything, which he usually nailed the first time he would teach.  humorous in a physics-nerd kind of way, made the class interesting. highly recommend this professor!",1
Once of my favorite professors of all time! Dudrick makes you want to show up to class because he's utterly adorable. Motivates you to read and learn the material. 4 papers (he's a fair grader) and a slightly harder final. I'd recommend him to anyone- truly a pleasure!!,1
"Not a bad teacher, and super helpful and kind, but his class notes are SOOO disorganized. He always seems to be skipping from one spot to another, doesn't indicate when notes are not in on-line notes, and they seem fragmented and choppy.",1
"Awesome, awesome, awesomeeee!!! He loves math, it's his passion. He's funny, understanding, and knows what he's teaching and helps the students 110% HIGHLY RECOMENDED!!!Not too bad to look at either",1
"Took as many classes as I could with this lovely professor. She is brilliant, beautiful, and a woman of color. She is also responsive and helpful after graduation - I hold her in the highest esteem as a role model, human being and as an academic.",1
nice guy but not a good teacher. His lectures are boring and very confusing. Does more explaining theories and ideas rather than doing example problems. Tests were very difficult with the average between a 40 and 50%. I do not recommend this professor.,0
HORRIBLE. One of THE worst professors I have ever had the misfortune of taking. All she does is read from a PowerPoint. Does not teacher. GOD WILLING TSU will hire another AIS teacher,0
"Professor Veliz was my introduction to Computer Science, and it was a great one! He really helped me develop my skills and encaouraged me to be involved in more activities. He is really good at explaining, and accesible outside of class. His grading is also very clear and he is alwasy willing to help. If you can, take him! You will learn a lot :D",1
"This professor is tougher than she looks. The course seemed to good to be true, and it was exactly that. She would provide me with feedback that really made me feel incompetent and discouraged about my writing, especially since I received a 4.0 in both my English comp classes. Vagueness seemed to be attached to all of her assignments too.",0
"Mr. Burt would just read off the slides. He doesnt give a straight answer to any questions whether it be regarding course content or grading. In labs, he only gives about 15 minutes to do them them and spends most of it trying to set it up. He curves at the end of class, so you dont really know what youre going to make until the very end.",0
This is the only class I am actually excited to come to school for. She cares so much about the kids and does everything she can to make sure they succeed. She has previous exam keys as practice and is always available for office hours. She makes everything so easy to understand and the tests are very straightforward. I love chem because of her.,1
The class is almost 100% lecture based. Most of your grade is based on a few short essays and tests. Professor Goldman has extremely interesting lectures and is willing to go above and beyond to answer student questions. The non-textbooks are necessary for test questions and the essay. Foner is really only needed if you have issues with concepts.,1
"Honestly it was more the class teaching him. Hes pretty old and gets things confused. He does give you good tips and shows how things are done, but he says he gives points for setting up problems on tests and he doesnt. If you dont do great on a few things, scores make you fail.",0
"The best! Really cares for his students learning. It makes the class interesting. Slides not available online but all in the book! SUPER EASY. The grading is on the usual but also, attending other school concerts, and writing mini-reports on them. Also 1 research report on a musician and reflection on 15 pieces of music. Grades lightly.",1
Prof was okay. She's never at her office hrs though. Class was interesting but the TA who does the grading is an ass (will kaufman).  Who counts #of incorrect comma usages and deducts it from your grade?  It's not even an english class!  Isn't content more important than a few grammatical errors?,0
"Most pointless lectures ever. He ranted once that it is our fault for failing if we have jobs/kids. We were graded by 3 tests, meaning the final could be worth 70%. He kept delaying material because he thought it was too much for one test, and yet saved ALL reactions for the LAST WEEK and that made up 100% of the final. I have nightmares.",0
"Her learning and behavior class can be fairly tricky. She has very interesting extra credits and her pop quizzes can be a little confusing. Her class consists of pop quizzes, group projects, workshops and two tests. Her tests are SUPER EASY. Just make sure to come to class, do well in her quizzes and complete the extra credits!",1
"Random quizzes to check if you read, usually two easy questions, no funny business. Reading list is very fun, out of all the readings, I didn't enjoy two. The rest are great and I've recommended friends to read for fun. Class consist of three essays and an in-class final exam (passage ID & close reading essay). Fav class so far at Cal.",1
Greatest professor at Seton Hall.  Not only teaches you about managerial accounting but also valuable life lessons.  Murtuza is a must take as he is striving to make seton hall great again,1
"as long as u go to class and take notes, pay attention, & review the listening a lot before test but super easy",1
"Dr. Kennedy is a must have professor. His ability to make one of the most challenging college courses understandable and enjoyable is astounding. Taking the course during a four week summer course, he understood how difficult that was and made himself readily available on multiple platforms to provide help.",1
"Elle est vraiment très gentille, ses examens sont long mais assez facile puisqu'elle n'est pas sévère dans sa correction. Elle écrit toute la matière dans ses powerpoints mais ses cours sont quand même intéressants. Elle pose des questions sur les lectures à chaque cours.",1
i previously had assumed that professors needed some degree of intelligence. khalsa taught me never to assume anything.,0
"Don't buy the books, rent them just get copies of the Leopold articles it will save you some $$. Attendance is not mandatory but you will miss some important notes. The group activitis, the bus tour and the game are fun. I learned a lot. Exams are hard. Lots of reading and must be organized for this class.",1
He is a great professor and i would recommend him to everybody that i know! As long as you dont miss the deadlines his class is an easy A. He is very clear as to when the dead lines are and the Projects and Tests are easy as long as you listen.,1
This professor is the most awful professor in this college. I totally don't understand why this college doesn't fire him. He frequently is too late to come to class and absent all the sudden. He is terrible as a professor and a business person. I am regretting to take his class. He can't care about students.,0
I took his CSIS 115 online and it's a straight forward class.  You have an assignment or two due at the end of everyweek.  Teacher is easy to work with.  Would highly reccommend!!,1
"Homework is completely irrevelant to the exams, but it does help boost your grade. Exams are straight from lecturers, you're allowed to have a formula sheet double sided but his exams still seem to stump everybody. Willing to help you but he expects you to know everything. You sink or You swim.",1
"You need VERY strong Java programming skills for this class. Don't take this class, if you feel you lack Java programming skills. This class is easy up until you hit MVC models of design. There are no study guides for the midterm, or final. Couple this with the way he teaches, & class is really hard. Book doesn't help, lectures barely help. I pass",1
"A lot of work!  He is not hot, the girls like him b/c he is mad flaming.",0
"Ugh, biochem is hard but there are other professors you can and should take than him. I understand that teaching through zoom is not his thing, but he rushes through his lectures very often. This class is only based on your exam grades and that is something you should look out for. Fail one exam, and you're out from the race of getting an A.",0
"Really great professor who truly knows his stuff and wants to share his knowledge. He is friendly and encourages participation. But even if you're shy, you can turn extra article every couple of weeks which takes place of participation. Homework about once a week but very easy. We look at current events and he teaches through stories and experience",1
No Comments,1
He is seriously the best teacher I have ever taken. His in class lectures are so clear and right out of the book which makes it easier for the students to understand what he is talking about. He is very helpful either it's in class or outside. He will meet up with you for any kind of help you need. His tests are multiple choice and you get to use a 3x5 index card. If you need to take a math 81 class TAKE HIM. You won't regret it.,1
"A lot of fun. Quirky, and very amusing. She's very helpful with work and goes at a relatively slow pace so that everyone can keep up. There are problems that can be done much simpler ways, but the way she teaches sometimes take 1 or 2 pages just to solve one problem! Otherwise very enjoyable teacher!",1
Oh my God where should I start. Stay away Professor Thompson is so very terrible. If you like sitting through long boring lectures that have nothing to do with what youre going to be tested on then this is your class. His Tests are made up as riddles and have nothing to do with the material gone over in class. Stay away very far away.,0
"Honestly the worst math professor I ever had. Over complicated simple subjects, ridiculously difficult tests which were also long. Did curve but it didn't help much. The class is already a hard one and he made it even more difficult to manage. Don't take him.",0
"Terrible professor. Extremely unprofessional, pushed off big assignments for ones that didnt matter as much. She has a lot of experience to share with you, but is very close minded & not open to other view points. IMPOSSIBLE to contact outside of class and not very accommodating. Inconsistent grading.",0
"I am learning absolutely nothing. He is rude, inconsiderate, and heartless. Luckily he means absolutely nothing in the real world of show business. If you have him just know that.",0
Dr. Curtis was my favorite teacher during my first semester at Salve! Her tests are VERY tough but get a tutor and you will get a great grade in the class. This class with her should be mandatory for everyone at Salve Regina. I wish she was my mom because is the coolest.,1
This class is so hard. I know its online but you really have to teach yourself EVERYTHING. The weekly homeworks have nothing to do with weekly tests and either have anything to do with the midterms. She curves the midterms. She uses an app called Piazza for extra credit where you can ask your classmates questions,0
"Professor Freeman is one of the best professors I have had at UW. He is clearly passionate about data science, he cares about the students and their learning, and the assignments/projects have all been relevant and interesting so far. We are using the textbook that he wrote, and it is very easy to get help from due to his knowledge in the subject.",1
"I am currently taking her summer class and let me tell you, this is the worst teacher I have came in contact with thus far. when you copy the answers word for word from the lab manual she still finds a way to mark you wrong. You can't come to her and ask her questions because she will brush you off and have you ask someone else. AVOID her",0
Really great professor and made the class super easy to pass.,1
it is near impossible to get more than a B in this class. He taught the material poor inna more complicated way then need. He gave an extraordinary amount of homework that barely pertained to class and his test problems where kinds of problems we have never seen before. He let us use our phones (yes our phones) and were all still failed. DONT take,0
"Honeslty she is very disorganized, she is a nice teacher though. Now, the lectures are very different than the tests, which throws you off, she is also a tough grader on lab papers, will take points for everything.",0
"Be prepared for confusion on almost every assignment. The only thing he gave us a written guideline for was the final essay. He knows what he wants from you, but cannot communicate that clearly to students. Very nice though.",0
"This was one of the most interesting classes I've ever had. He's intimidating at first but all he asks is that you come to class ready to discuss the reading. He wasn't fond of testing and only had a midterm and a final, and made both pretty simple. Very interesting and engaging; recommended if you don't mind reading!",1
"I would say average professor. He'll explain things, but will also often go on tangents & not really teach. His organization needs work and makes sense to him so that's what matters to him. Also, restricts you report topic to your field of study, doesn't let you branch out and choose. He's enthusiastic, but his grading is abstract and not clear",1
Dr. Kellman is a very fair professor. She is very knowledgeable and presents interesting topics in lecture.,1
"Never met him but he sounds nice in his email. Taking this online was a piece of cake. The textbook he used is crystal clear. He even dropped the final, I don't know if he does that all the time but he did when I took it.",1
There is so much i can say about this professor. to make it short and sweet i will never take him again! lectures a lot yes but cant understand him. if he makes a mistake in grading labs he will not correct them. he does not help students during class and all he does is read from a power point that students have access to. not helpful at all!,0
Emily is an awesome professor! She cares a lot about her students and if you are struggling in the class she is willing to work with you in her office hours. She does give quite a bit of homework on the online workbook as well as the actual textbook but it is manageable. I really loved taking her class and would take her again in a heartbeat.,1
I liked this class.  It was easy and had hardly any take-home homework since we did it all in class.  Final exam was super easy.  Friendly guy.  Definitely take him.,1
Honestly this wasn't a bad professor at all. She does not follow the syllabus because she asks the students their opinions on when tests/homework should be due. She teaches quickly but is open for questions and use the chem extra help center!,1
"I cannot stress how horrible this professor is. He will leave you hopeless and confused. Even with the copious amounts of tutoring I attended nothing could have prepared me for those horrid exams. Save your money, save your time, and save your enthusiasm for an actual professor. Avoid at all costs, even delay your graduation. Its worth it.",0
Must attend lectures in order to do well. In this class he assigns some pre-reading for quizzes that are based off of instruments but if you take your time to read it once you're good to go. Understand all topics to be able to succeed or ask him questions.,1
"Great class, pretty fun.  This is not a difficult class, but there is a lot of work.  The work is not hard, it's just the amount of it.  There are 2-3 semester long projects, not including a group project towards the end of the semester that is a 20 minute presentation.  There are canvas discussion posts every night needing 1-2 paragraphs as well.",1
"Krazewski is awesome!  Honors Lit for both semesters had to be two of the best classes I've had at Kings.  Gets off on tangents about ""evil and satanic"" technology (such as the computer), and many other issues.  He knows his stuff inside and out too.  If you want an interesting time, take Dr. K!!!",1
Took 4 week class. Somewhat challenging since it's new material. Need decent algebra skills and very good reading comprehension skills if you want to excel with just reading the book. She doesn't really teach at all just manages the class. Great option to get this over with over the summer.,1
"AP is one of the best professors Ive ever had at Reynolds. She makes you work for your A bit if you show up to class, be involved, stay motivated and respect her the way shell respect you, youll get an easy A. Shes always willing to help and give feedback, she makes English class fun and hands on. Please take her while you can.",1
"Tags i wish i could add but ran out of tags: LECTURE HEAVY, caring, kind, passionate, understanding, INSPIRATIONAL!! Falcon was an amazing professor. He makes sure you understand the material. He genuinely cares about his students and is there for them no matter what. He assigns a crap ton of readings that can be boring, but his lectures are great.",1
Awesome teach wish i could take every class with him,1
LOVE ALL OF MR.GOODMAN'S CLASSES! HE'S GREAT! JUST MAKE SURE YOU GO TO CLASS CAUSE HE IS NOT PLAYIN ABOUT ATTENDANCE! HE DROPPED ME A WHOLE LETTER GRADE FOR MISSING TOO MANY,1
You work for it and youll get an A. This is not a class where you can kick back but also shouldnt be your most tough class either .Honestly its fairly average. Everyone who hates here just didnt want to do the work. Do it and youll be fine. I promise,1
This guy is the hardo of all hardos,1
"most awesome professor.  Really cares, links topic to real life problems and situations. very relatable",1
You haven't seen a great professor until you have had this guy! I had him back in 2011 and here I am writing a review to let everyone who's reading this now to know that his class is fantastic! I miss having him as a professor! Love you Mr. Martin!,1
She is a very nice and understanding professor but her class was so boring. It was so hard to get through but she uses tophat and asks questions for participation so you have to go to class. We had no exams just a lot of quizzes that were difficult. I am not interested in the topic but her lectures just dragged on and you also have to take a lab.,0
"He is a great professor!!! Real easy to get off topic... That is always a good thing. He is really fun, but papers due back to back so be ready for that.",1
"Great professor, very understanding, need to participate in order to earn your A.",1
"I took a class with him at UFV, and I see students from SFU and KPU have the same opinion. Changing schools has not changed his teaching style. Good Luck trying to get him to respond to emails. I'm still waiting for a response from ;6 weeks ago. I would NOT recommend his class. For a first year course, he expects too much",0
"Read 2 assignments per week and ask AND answer 3 of your own questions per reading. Midterm and final paper are 3 or 4 questions which require 3 or 4 paragraphs a piece. Do the readingS, watch the films (2 or 3), pass the class. No lectures, no test, no gimmicks and you will learn in the process. Highly recommended",1
"Easily the best professor I've had so far. He's extremely understanding of students having lives outside of his class and school, has an incredible talent for remembering student names, and he's great at splitting up lengthy lectures to keep us engaged. I'm going to try to take as many of my INFO classes by him as I can if I get into the major.",1
"Look him for music appreciation. The work load is insane. 3 concert reports, a 6pg paper, 22 pages of listening logs, 4 exams, etc. Class is out of 1000 points, and something like the 22 pages of listening logs is only worth 50 points. Seems like a nice person, but the class itself is way too much work for 3 credits.",1
"Hated this class first half we did scripts and I couldn't ever get them to work so confused. Last half of semester was installing VMs of Linux. Ultimately I passed and glad I took it with Wade otherwise I really don't think I'd had passed. Quizzes weekly, labs weekly, very helpful will show up to school 2 hours before labs just to get more lab time",1
"One of THE most difficult classes I have taken in my career as a student. While the information is very interesting, she has a certain things she wants to hear, and to do otherwise results in a loss of marks. Bonuses if you are a Feminist. Her classes can go from funny to dull in no time flat, and the otherway around depends on her mood.",0
"Dr. Bob is one of the most awesome psychology professors i've had. The first half of the semester was lecture and discussion--and the discussion always takes prevalence which I find awesome. There is one big project/presentation at the end of the semester, but it's pretty simple if you actually do it. There's also the midterm, which is about 30 qs.",1
"Suann was a good professor, she tends to go into detail on topics because she is very passionate about the material. Lectures are powerpoints mixed with group interaction that tend to be fairly engaging. Definitely a fair, and overall solid professor. Getting an A is not easy but not impossible if you pay attention and study.",1
"Dr. Batman knows his stuff, and is willing to help those who are struggling in his office with a homework problem. I would highly recommend this class to anyone.",1
"Dr. Nguyen's class is structured around four tests, which are the only grades. If you want to pass, you MUST, absolutely must read the textbook and attend class. The exams are structured so that it's all from the textbook, his lectures, and the extra notes he gives out. Overall, I really enjoyed his class, but the exams were certainly difficult.",1
Mehmeti was magnificent. I took this class as an elective and because I figured it would be an easy A. I took a lot out of the class and actually learned about Music History. I enjoyed taking it in the summer because there are many free concerts the city offers and attending 3 concerts is mandatory for this class. Take him!,1
If you take this class make sure this is the only class you take that semester. That's how difficult this class is! If you are working a full time job and have several classes this is not a class to take. Her assignments disappear after mid night even though she saids the assignment is due next class. Gives so much work even on test days.,0
"Although the class is lecture heavy and sometimes boring, its definitely easy. Only 2 online tests and 2 simple presentations. Mr. Dotts is also a really nice man who wants to see his students succeed!",1
Professor Hillman is so sweet and funny! She makes Geology 104 so easy and is very clear on directions. Your only grades are your labs which is out of the workbook and your tests. ALSO she lets you use a full 8x11 paper for notes. I love her :),1
Sara Is by far one of the best professors at Iowa. No one else cares like she does. lectures went by so fast because she talk like we were her friends. Tests were super easy and you can get up to 30 points extra credit in the course. ,1
"I WILL DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PROFESSOR. I LOVE THE WAY HE TEACHES MATH, HE IS VERY NICE AND WILL MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND. HE MAKES U PARTICIPATE BY DOING GROUP WORK AND PUTS YOU IN GROUPS SO YOU CAN HELP EACH OTHER. HE LOVES MATH AND MADE ME LOVE MATH TOO. YOU CAN GET AN ""A"" IF YOU PASSED HIS TEST WHICH ARE NOT HARD. YOU WON'T REGRET TAKING HI",1
Had an amazing time being her student. Class isn't very difficult if you study 1-2 days before midterms. Be very very creative in your sequences and you will do very good. Prof is extremely helpful and you'd be surprised how much you could learn in this course.,1
Horrible professor. Might as well just be a full online class! i just found the class unorganized  and felt lost throughout the class. thankfully i passed.,0
Good teacher who likes what she's doing. The labs she gives are interesting but long. Cool class with good lectures.,1
Had Dr. Bland at USC. Shes really nice and personable. She will work with you on essays if you did poorly and gives you another chance. Go to class always and always do the homework. Great prof and cares about her students. Only down fall is essay instructions are always clear.,1
"This was the second semester I've had this professor, and I'm very pleased with my experience. I recommend her to anyone taking a Spanish class.  I like her teaching style and I feel I actually improve my Spanish while in her class. She is very a sweet woman and I look forward to possibly taking her again.",1
Not Hot!!,1
Professor Murphy was a great instructor. This class inspired me to add a GLBT minor. I would definitely take another class with him.,1
"He is honestly the greatest man you will ever meet. Unless you dont like fun! Yeah he gets off topic sometimes, but hes honestly crazy and its awesome!",1
"HORRIBLE professor. She's very unclear, hard to follow her lectures. Tests are hard & she purposely tricks you, its NOT type of problems on the study guide or classwork. Im great in math & had a very hard time to keep an A cuz of her teaching style. I had to teach myself almost everything & went to other professors for help. DO NOT TAKE HER",0
"I have taken two courses with Professor Meyers, and although I like her character,  I did not enjoy her courses/teaching method. English 101 was lecture heavy and the midterm + final involved key passages that she discussed during her lectures + 2 short essays. Defiantly, be prepared to take notes & show up to class",1
"She is absolutely wonderful. She cares so much about her students. She goes into deep subjects like politics, love, death etc. You have 4 essays to write, and the subjects are super easy. Other than that, it is all about class participation. Also, in every class, she will bring snacks for the students to have because she doesn't want anyone hungry.",1
"A little boring, but she was nice.",1
Best math professor so far,1
"You need to do the discussions, online quizzes, and show up everyday. If you do that and take notes, you should be fine.",1
"Wells is a knowledgeable professor who knows her material well, but she has ridiculous high expectations for her students. Her exams are confusing and sometimes go beyond the scope of her lectures. Hardest class I ever took, I spent so much time studying for every exam and when the tests came along it looked like I never studied.",1
"Mike is a sweetheart. I took this class with no previous knowledge of Informatics or CSE and he made it very easy to succeed. It is ABSOLUTELY possible to get an A like 100% if you work hard in this class. He is fair. He grades you based on the weekly assignments and some quizzes/participation. The final project is easy, just choose a good group.",1
"Dr. Green is an extremely caring guy. He is always accessible during office hours and willing to help. He makes everybody feel as if they matter in the class. You have to participate and you have to do your work, you work for your grade but it is well earned! He has a New Yorker accent and is humorous, plus, admiring to look at.",1
Peggy is a pretty solid teacher. She makes her expectations clear and expects you to stick to them. She does mumble sometimes during lectures but it doesn't really matter because if you show up and do the middle school like assignments you pass.,1
I LOVE PETER! Peter is amazing. His new dog is so cute.,1
"Dr Gueye is an easy-going man. He is lenient in his marking procedure and he listens to his students unlike other professors who like to assert their authority on every matter. He does have a slight accent but it is very much understandable. Mr Gueye hardly uses the textbook to teach and, in most cases, his notes suffice.",1
Dr. Curtis is very funny and made class entertaining. She always let us out of our hour and 15 min class early which was nice. Easy A if you pay attention and go to the study groups before the tests. She also offers extra credit which is helpful. Overall a fun and informative class.,1
"Very funny, gets you interested!",1
"Surprisingly difficult, and Prof Khalsa isn't very understanding.  Pay attention to the syllabus - we weren't allowed to miss a SINGLE class, and that gets tough after a while.  I was so excited to take this, but have ended up hating it.  Unless you're REALLY serious, I'd stay away.",0
A very clear professor with very good powerpoints for every lecture. Takes attendance and participation matters. Tests are fine provided you thoroughly understand the book and powerpoints.,1
"The worst class I have ever taken. All the lectures were very boring and I found it very hard to pay attention. His mid-term and exams are crazy, he gives you a study guide and if you prepare off of those throughly you will be okay but they are a lot of work. He is very arrogant but does try to relate to students. If you want a good grade must try.",0
"Not concise- takes several different tries to get one thought across. Talks way too much. Be afraid getting caught in a conversation, it'll go on for way too long. Cares a lot but not a good teacher.",0
"Great teacher! wish he taught other subjects, he teaches everything so clearly and he's very approachable. He cracks jokes and tells us about his day which he calls story time but still manages to teach everything he needs to.",1
She  rambles about things that are not even remotely relevant to the class. she also gives A LOT of pop quizzes about material we have not discussed yet. her power points are vague and doesnt put them up online and what she talks about is not what the power point says. i get As in all criminal justice classes that ive taken but her class i got a C,0
She is one the best Professor I have ever had. She is really takes the time to give you great feedback on your essays. She manages to be very thorough with his explanations. You can get A easily if you take this class. She is nice and a good friend.,1
This professor genuinely wants her students to succeed and be the best they can be. She cares about their success inside and outside the class. Dr. Lemoine is easy to talk to and has a very versatile teaching style which facilitates a more personalized approach for each student. She is fair and lots of fun when you get to know her. 10/10!,1
"Great guy with a great sense of humor. I went into this class expecting to toil away for 10 weeks and get out with a passing grade, but November had other plans. he gave multiple chances for extra credit through attending poetry readings. He really wants to see you grow. I went from hating writing to writing poetry outside of class.",1
"She is the worst teacher I have ever had. Courseload was ridiculous. Multiple projects due at the same time, over a course of a few weeks. She is not afraid to make you cry in front of the whole class. You get one thing wrong and she BLOWS. I am afraid to participate now. Told us we didn't have an exam, now we have a project & essay final. RUN!!!!",0
She goes over things fast but very fair when it comes to tests and grading. She is willing to help you. Tests are easier than quizzes are easier than homework.,1
"Kirk is kind of entertaining, but he likes to call students out a lot. He is willing to help students after class, but he does not fully teach the material in class. He also does not give a lot of homework, but that is harmful in Calc II.",1
"Ms. Johansen is very fair and professional. She prepares you for exams that are based on both the lectures and book material. If you come to class, do the work and study you'll do fine. She's available for questions and help in class, or email her your papers and she'll help you! She's very smart and wants you to succeed in her class.  Take her!",1
"Of the four teachers I had this past semester when all my classes went online, she was easily the best at using zoom and canvas to put class stuff online so students could still access it and her. Def not an easy A but not unreasonable either. She was super flexible about deadlines and stuff because of the coronavirus outbreak which helped.",1
"She's funny, absolutely approachable, and very helpful. I really look forward to her classes. Definitely take her if you can.",1
"AMAZING. Super interesting guy. Very helpful if you go to his office. He knows the material very well and reads literature to keep up to date. Got an A, but studied a lot. He's very nice and doesn't just ""read to teach"", he draws diagrams, shows powerpoints, videos, etc. He's very intelligent and funny. do every homework(4)+ 3 exams/1Final (1 drop)",1
"The best professor I have ever had, and I have now attended three separate universities.  Very helpful, no reason not to receive a perfect grade in her classes as long as you attend them, pay attention, and do your work.  She is a sweetheart willing to listen, give assistance to those who need it and truly inspirational when teaching.",1
"One of the best professors at Sage. Always nice and truly cares about the students. Full of knowledge and endless facts. Highly recommend taking his classes. If you don't like history, you will after you take an Andor class.",1
Her main aim is not only to make you understand math through practice but also to pass. She knows we all make mistakes. She helps correct them.,1
"Examens les plus faciles que j'ai vu de ma vie : dans les 90 juste en relisant tes notes 30 minutes avant l'exam. Elle est d'une gentillesse irréprochable et offre énormément d'aide pour le projet qui peut être parfois pas très clair et ennuyeux par exemple. Mais n'écoutez pas la critique en dessous, elle est vraiment cool sur la correction.",1
do not take this class if possible,0
"I enjoyed my drafting class so much. Professor Zaykoski was super helpful whenever anyone was confused. His teaching style is clear, concise, and thorough which I appreciated.",1
"Dr. Zietz is extremely nice but doesn't teach the material well. She doesn't use all of the class time to cover the material and leaves students feeling lost and confused on homework, quizzes, and tests. Make sure to read the book and take notes because there are many questions from it on tests that are never mentioned in class.",1
"This course was not easy, the quizzes and tests were really hard.  The professor was great to learn from, he encouraged us to use the right terms and was always fast to respond to questions and grading.  I would take another course with him again!",1
"The class is pretty easy, the quizzes are based off of the readings and the answers aren't found online. She also uses top hat.. Try to find a friend in the class so if you need to miss they can get your participation points for you",1
"He is a very sweet teacher, he brings everyone food all the time and bakes cookies, its adorable. Hes nice and wants to help you. This is a hard class though and it requires effort, put final was a project not a test, which was nice. He was awesome though and he wants you to do good so take his class.",1
he was the worst. he would not bump me up 1 point to pass the class,0
Loved ENGL1101 with Wisner. He was so nice and I got an A with ease! As long as you do the work you'll be fine! Highly recommend.,1
"Great teacher, very sweet and outgoing. Makes math easy. Explains very well and offers to help outside of class. Expect homework. Would recommend to everyone. Gives great math examples and has clear grading outlines, but is an easy grader. I would take her class again!",1
"gives quite a few lectures and gives a lot of handouts but is clear and concise- lectures are easy to follow. Tests based on lectures. Extremely helpful and understanding. Best professor I've ever had. I have taken him twice so far. NEVER any homework and usually lets you out of class early. Got an A- last semester in PSY112, hoping for an A again.",1
"He is a very funny and caring professor. He wants everyone to succeed and makes a bunch of funny jokes. He makes it very easy to understand the topic (however, I was clueless for one or two). As long as you follow his guidelines for the papers, you'll get at least a B. I recommend taking him if you are new to philosophy.",1
She is awesome. She makes you smile when you are feeling gloomy. I would recommend her. Really nice person. Does not confuse you with many information only gives you the important information.,1
Prof. Buhler is one of the smartest guys you will ever meet.  His classes are hard but he will teach you what you ened to know.,1
"patty patty patty, what a woman! she's incredibly smart and i love her lectures. you can tell she really loves what she does. she's super hard, like, over the top hard, but she's just trying to give you the necessary tools to proceed with your degree.",1
"Show up to class and take notes, the classwork is easy with good group members so pick your group wisely, study guides are allowed on tests and they are on canvas from day 1 so do them in advance, and take advantage of EVERY homework extra credit! Start working on the business presentation with your group in advance to save headache at the end.",1
"He is great at pushing you!  He was very mean, but I liked that he was honest and reflected how unkind some professionals may be.  You will take away some things and completely discard others. Overall, I feel like I learned a lot; Pearson is just difficult to deal with.",1
"Lisa is one of the most amazing professors I have ever had, she really cares about all of her students work and wants to get to know everyone in her classes. She was very caring and understanding and the way she taught class always kept people intrigued. She is funny and incredibly smart and I would recommend her for any English class.",1
"Passionate lecturer, knows his stuff, three easy exam each takes 33.3% of the total grade. No attendance, no quiz. Cons: he doesn't like private conversation with students",1
"Inga is a nice teacher. The class is a little bit hard, but she push you to learn. She makes a perfect work as a teacher.",1
"I have never had a math teacher who has been able to break things down like Joanne Myers does. Trust me when I say, you need to get in her class if you have the chance! She has so much respect for her students and genuinely cares for her profession and students. She does her job very well everyday! I wish I could have Joanne Myers for math 121",1
moderate,1
"she knows what she is doing, one of the best. she is too good to teach there.",1
"I was in his ukulele class. He knows people are taking the class for fun and focuses on teaching a wide array of uke texhniques and teaching us basic music theory. The music theory can be a little confusing for those who don't know it, but he's patient. Easy grading, few assignments. Show up, be respectful, and have fun.",1
Super nice guy. Took him for 305 and lab 306. Got a A in both and I'm not a science person at all. You need the book for the hw assignments in 305 but in lad 306 you don't need because you are in groups and can just copy off your partners. One presentation at the end in 306. Definitely take his class.,1
He is really smart. Lectures are informative about everything not just the course. Respects students even when they can be rude or disruptive to the class. He changed some dates on the syllabus but it was for the better of the class and we have more time for final projects.,1
"Brian is a really great teacher.  He makes the projects interesting and relevant.  You can tell he really wants us to do well, and he has really interesting hair!!",1
"I loved Mr. Smith. He is very specific about what he expects, but he will help you reach the standards he sets if you communicate. He does expect all students to read & PARTICIPATE in the class. I thought Comm Law would be boring but Mr. Smith made it awesome. If he sees potential in you he will definitely help you develop it!",1
I really enjoyed the group discussions in this class. She was always easy to reach and answered all my questions when I needed help.,1
"4 exams, 2 project, all incredibly easy!!",1
"Taking a summer Micro course was tough, but Cesar has become my favorite professor. I thoroughly enjoy his lectures, and he truly inspires students with how passionate he is.  I absolutely love his accent, and have always been able to understand him. The only disappointing part will be not having him again once I'm done with my prerequisites. ",1
"Dr. Macdonald is only good for reading off the slides. She wont discuss midterms or how many questions they contain, she wont look at chat, she literally will do nothing further than giving you the slide info. She also doesn't have basic computer competencies, failing to even start the lecture at times. Rip to anyone that takes her 325 course",0
"He knows his math, but can't teach students. Most of the time it seemed liked he wasn't even aware that he was teaching a class. He just went up to the board and did math. He pretty much tells you what is going to be on the exams, and he drops the lowest exam. If you already know calcus, he is fine, but I wouldn't take him if I didn't know calculus",0
"He's not a bad teacher by any means, but he's also not a PHENOMENAL teacher which is disappointing because the subject matter was fascinating. He loaded all sorts of baloney projects on us throughout the quarter (after week 5) and they were all group related, so if you have trust issues like I do, steer clear from Newsom Kerr and this class.",1
No Comments,1
"Worst professor ever. Her lecture videos are completely useless. I learned better through reading the course notes. Kept making mistakes in quizzes and penalize students for her own mistake. She has never ever admitted that she made a mistake, even when it's very obvious that the question had an incorrect solution or worded ambiguously. Avoid her!",0
Great Teacher who really knows his stuff. He has very impressive work and is enthusiastic to share his knowledge with students in the class. This is not a blow-off class the work is hard and time consuming. Great class if you want to really learn about Graphic Design!,1
Adelle knows what she's doing. She is very direct and is really helpful when you need help understanding things. So refreshing to have a competent teacher!,1
"Read the book, do the online anatomy revealed homework, and come to class. Study for the test, and you will make an A. Mrs. Langille is very passionate about biology, and that makes this class worth taking. There are no trick questions only straight forward you know it or you dont.",1
Great teacher show up listen take the test and map. He is very interesting and laid back,1
"Literally the best professor in MDC. No doubt about it. I've taken both german one and german two with Herr Morales. It is with him that I have realized that loving an afternoon class is possible. If you really, really want to learn either german or any other language that he offers teaching for, be sure to take him! Herr Morales is simply THE BEST",1
"Prof Harding is like a ham and cheese sandwich. Very average. His lectures aren't the best ever, he does allow a bit of discussion to hold your attention. Most of your grade comes from two papers, two tests, and a big project. He grades decently easy, and may allow a chance to look at notes during the test. I would be willing to take him again.",1
"HORRIBLE communicator, never answers emails and is very unclear is specifying what he wants for assignments. Never take his class if you want to keep your sanity. The workload is huge and he is far too particular when grading. No creativity at all in the assignments because if you don't do it to his liking, you will get a bad grade.",0
This class requires basic skills in following instructions and attention to detail. If you belong in healthcare - you should enjoy and do well in this class. She made me laugh almost every lecture. She's a great teacher if your intentions are good.,1
I had Steve for Calc 3. This class was probably the easiest math class I've taken since algebra 2. Our grade is based solely on 4 exams and a final (each worth 20%) but he will alter the weight of each exam to bump you up half a letter grade or so. Exam three was take home and extra credit was offered twice for watching a math-related documentary.,1
"Dr. Walker is amazing, her teaching style allows the content to stick. She relates the work to real life experiences. She grades very fairly and is always willing to work with you as long as you are acting putting in the work. to top it all off she is willing to listen to any problems you might have school related or not. she is all around amazing!",1
Amazing professor who was very considerate. During the semester my grandfather was very ill with cancer and due to hospital visits and medical emergencies I missed a discussion and he allowed me to make it up with no problems. Very fair grader and provided good class materials.,1
"Prof. Frazier is so uptight, and just takes things way too personal. He only has a 3 minute grace period, and after that you are considered absent if you came in late. He takes out of your grades if you answer a question wrong, he does not have a good teaching strategy. doesn't know how to use icollege. his quizzes dont tell you right/wrong answers",0
"careful! she reads everyone's comments lol. the only bad thing about her was she didn't tell you what was going to be on the test... she just tells you to study, but everything that was in her handouts was on her test!",1
"She is awesome, replies to your emails, she is very helpful.",1
"She is very nice, however a very tough grader. She is hard to understand(strong accent). The labs are worth only 3 points each, and lab attendance is mandatory(taken for points). The average on the tests are 52-56 percent(for the entire 85 person lectures)&she refuses to curve them. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO TAKE A DIFFERENT TEACHER!",0
Lectures are not effective at all! I took all exams without following the lectures and I got an A-,0
"Professor Wisotski is an awesome human being however, her discussion can be very tedious and slow at times. She really made me work for my essay grade and I never did as good as I did in HONR 101 surprisingly. Sometimes it is difficult to understand paper grades but she's available at office hours to explain",0
"I took English 2332 with him online which most people expect less work because they cannot go to class either working or no transportation.  He gave 3 assignments everyday which is alright, but his tests were confusing and too little time on the online test.  If you're not a reader do not take it with him.!",0
Really good and entertaining,1
Brent is the most talented professor in the Interactive media department... seriously look up his reel. He's so humble and nice that you'd never guess theamazing things he's worked on. If you talk to him one on one he's got great insight about the industry. Best teacher ever!,1
"Max makes some good jokes in class but he is hard to approach for help. He'll make you feel really dumb when you're asking for help. He doesn't use a textbook or post any practice questions. There is no clear guideline for tests, the average for the midterm was 23% curved to 46%. He calls on you in class and gets mad when no one answers him.",0
"Dr. Hoffman is such as nice, eccentric professor. He clearly loves teaching, and his lectures break down complex topics into clear, manageable chunks. He is very helpful during office hours after class. His course was one of the best courses I have ever taken.",1
"wow, an awesome prof! he always showed tons of visuals and also requires a very helpful text book so that no matter how you learn best, you will understand the material--that's the definition of a great teacher! He was also very nice when asking questions one-on-one and the paper he requires was graded very fairly. I recommend him highly!",1
"ONE OF THE BEST PROFESSORS AT KU! So kind and understanding. A true gem. Be prepared to write a lot of papers, but she lets you work on your assignments in class and offers a lot of help. No textbook, no final, just papers and attendance/participation. Easiest A ever! Any opportunity to take Dr. Hartman, do it!",1
"Dr. Ba is a fairly descent professor If you don't mind reading alot. He is fairly easy on grading if you do yoUr homework and study for tests he gives you sample test there is no way you will walk out without a B or A. However his lectures are dry, read off power points, and he has thick accent that sometimes is hard to understand.",0
Heather hug is the most helpful teacher I've ever had. She really helps you learn and understand the material.,1
"I have never had such a caring professor. He was always there to help, and even met me on a day off to help me with my resume for a job I applied to! There are a lot of participation and group projects but Dr Conway is great at creating a friendly and fun atmosphere that everyone feels welcomed and able to share their views. 11/10 would take again.",1
"There is busy work, but not difficult at all. Keep up on your assignments and submit ON TIME. Easy A. The textbook was ""mandatory"" but I never opened it.",1
Assigns homework she doesn't bother to collect. Then docks points because we didn't watch YouTube videos about an obscure filmmaker. Assignments are often unclear and she is angry is you ask her to repeat. Gets angry at class for not knowing all about Italian geography.,0
"Starner is the best, most computer smart, prof at UST. very funny, very real world. he knows his stuff, and gives everyone a fare chance.",1
"She is a wonderful professor. I never liked history, but I really enjoyed her class. You should go to class because she takes attendance and a lot of the lectures end up being helpful for projects. She gives extra credit!",1
I had him last Fall and he was a great guy to learn from.  I spent a lot of time after class looking into virtualization technology thanks to him.  (He's huge on it.) The tests were not the easiest but if you go to class and listen you'll do just fine.  It also helps to make sure you write in good English.  He's a stickler for that.,1
"Dr. Sullivan is a nice person, but just not a good prof. His expectations are too vague, he never responds to emails, and his lectures are incredibly boring. He only grades you by two exams and a four-page paper (and on a HUGE curve). The only reason I took this class is because it was required. I wouldn't take him again.",0
"Greg's creative writing class is the most fun I have ever had in a college class! It was engaging and interesting and taught me a lot about creative writing, which is sorely lacking in most other classes. The final, group project was a little tricky, but overall well worth it.",1
"Never went beyond the material, but if you are lazy it's not easy.   I was a procrastinator (and still kind of am) but her breadth of knowledge and helpfulness really fostered an interest in biology/science for me.   Great teacher, always many steps ahead of you without being condescending...and would come back to any of her classes!",1
"Great dude, focused on helping freshman adapt to the engineering environment.",1
Dr. Peruyera is amazing. He is so good makes you think if you should change your major to Law. Everyone should take his class because is so helpful. You learn things that will help you for life. I will take LAW 2 with him no doubt.,1
"She is a great professor. She does not give out tests and there is no final exam. She gives out homework quizzes every week that contain 30 questions. There are only 2 papers she assigns, they both have the same question and it's easy. I enjoyed her class. She is always making jokes during lectures. I highly recommend this professor, easy grade.",1
"His grading criteria is unclear, yet strict. I know, that doesn't make sense, but if you take him you'll understand. He marks you off for NEARLY everything you do ""wrong"" in your lab report. If you take him, just make sure you know EXACTLY what he wants on his reports.",0
"Prof vraiment super ! Je l'ai présentement et wow ! Il ne fait définitivement pas l'unanimité, mais vierge facilement offensable, s'abstenir ! Un excellent motivateur, très exigent, mais également très reconiassant. Selon lui, il s'agit de sa dernière session, très décevant, car il était un très bon communicateur. 10/10 mon Decoste",1
"As much as this class can be difficult, it prepares you really well for A&P. Things move really fast so make sure you have the extra time in your schedule to study. Alison recommends at least 10 extras hours a week.",1
"Ms. Pajer is super caring and nice, a great professor for freshman English class. You are require to write 5 essays throughout the semester. It might be too easy for people that are good at English, but since I'm an English as a second language speaker I feel like the class is very useful. Now I can finish an 8 pages essay in 1 day.",1
"McMillen is a great guy. You can tell he likes to relate to students and cares about teaching. His lectures can be long and boring sometimes but he sometimes adds in a funny story, whether it's about the material or not. Tests were not hard but I also took it online because of the China virus so that made it easier.",1
"Excellent Professor! If you engage with him, you will be fine!",1
math classes never been fun before I took class with professor Lee. She teaches it so clear and as easy as possible. Math is not boring but fun with her. And she is the fairest teacher Ive ever met. She will always praise you if you do good which makes you feel proud of yourself.,1
He is the worst teacher.,0
"Great instructor. She really makes the course interesting. You will need to spend time studying, but she gives you study guides, study questions, and preprinted notes. If you study using these three assests, you shoudl do good on the test. Way to go Barb Wilson!!!!!!!",1
I loved her class.I took it as a Deck course my freshman 1st semester nd by far my faorite class...the acting techniques and exericses we do are fun and interesting...it helped me come out of my shyness..fav class at Stony,1
"Dr. Fontenot knows his stuff. He's not the easiest professor, but he's very approachable. If you read the text,take good notes,and participate in class discussion, you can make an A.",1
"I took this class online and the textbook was not absolutely needed as everything on quizzes, assignments, and tests was in the notes provided.",1
"Lydia Palma teaches her lecture well. She writes her notes on the projector, and explains the step by step process for each problem.  Her exams are fair and easy as long as you study previous homework problems. She open to change, and always tries to engage with her students. There should be no reason why you shouldn't pass.",1
"Most incoherent prof I have ever had, and I regret taking him. He just shows videos, can't teach. He has no degree related to what he teaches (check KPU faculty). Do not take him.",0
She was very understanding and was a great help in completing my assignments. I couldn't have done it without her help. She provides a lot of help to help you understand the course and is way more than fair in grading. She's a great teacher and I truly did appreciate being her student. I would definitely have her again if I could.,1
Debbie is my home girl and an excellent facilitator,1
"Absolutely amazing instructor! Her only goal is for you to become a nurse! She is real-world oriented. She wants her students to know what nursing in the real world is like, not just in the classroom. She is very talkative and hilarious.",1
Mrs. Lisa is the best English instructor I have seen in my life. Just do the assignments and follow her feedbacks and you will be fine. I took her for a summer (online) composition class and my final grade was 95. Very kind and respectful lady.,1
"Not structured at all, But he does that on purpose. Classes are discussion you do learn a lot. No textbook just readings that you NEED to read. Really nice and laid back guy. short essay for midterm and take home final. Overall great class!",1
"Amazing teacher, wants us to be interactive and enjoy the material. Only have to do worksheets and discussion boards in this class. You won't regret taking her.",1
"This is from Longridge: ""Q: Is there a way to view my Final Exam to verify which ones I answered  incorrectly?  A: Your FINAL exam is a TEST and NOT a learning experience. As such permission to review finals is NOT given."" Her reasoning is terrible. She's not giving students opportunities to learn where they went wrong; she must be right.",0
"Nice teacher, knows a lot about photography. All tests are based on his lectures so pay attention. He does challenge you but does not grade give you grades on your assignments so you never really know where you stand other than his verbal comments. He does let you resubmit assignments but does not accept late work.  Do not expect an easy A.",1
No Comments,1
New nothing on the topic before coming in but was interested. I think he was able to work with all levels on student expertise. Assignments were interesting. Schedule was good. Loved the course and professor overall and would definitely recommend.,1
"Great guy. Average professor. You can fall behind fast in this class, so prioritize it over others. Plenty of EC. Main downside, taught in Java!? C'mon it's 2018. So beware, this class is more difficult than it needs to be because it is taught in cavemen language. Teach JS or Python based stacks. More job opportunities and it'll be easier to teach.",0
"I would recommend, anyone taking accounting to take his class. I had never done accounting before and this was my first class related to accounting. He gives a  lot of homework for each chapter he does. If you wanna succeed in his class attend all his classes and do the homework and you are set. Great teacher. Explains material really well. Helpful",1
"Dr. Schnittger is totally one of the best professors I have ever had!  If you get the chance to take him, do, you will learn so much.  I took him for Pentateuch and had almost no interest going in and came out wishing I had a whole semester with him instead of just J term.  His exams are really hard, but if you study alot, you'll be fine.",1
"I don't see why anyone could complain about him.  He knows his stuff, he is enthusiastic, and best of all, he makes class FUN.  Imagine that.  Anyone that wants a good grade in MGMT, take him.",1
"She is a wonderful professor. Policy is a lot of material to cover and she goes at the pace of the students so that everyone understands the material. She is really helpful and understanding that we have other classes also. Three tests that are heavily graded, lots of studying needs. A few papers, but overall easy class. Just read chapters.",1
"Great guy.  Show that you care and are trying and communicate well with him and you'll likely get an A.  He does not communicate your grade well with you, but he is always available to meet with to discuss anything.  In his first semester teaching MG 101, one of his classes won ""Top 'Dawg""...that should tell you something.",1
"Not everyone like Prof. G, but I did. He's a nice guy, and he's pretty funny because of the way that he rambles sometimes. He's definitely passionate about what he teaches, but admittedly, his course isn't the best organized. If you're trying to choose between FYSs, I'd definitely recommend this one, because it's crazy easy.",1
"Dr. Schmurr is such a great guy! The material he teaches is hard sometimes, but hes open to helping, and also allows a lot of corrections. I would highly suggest choosing him as a professor. Also, as long as you go to the class 50% of the time, youll be fine. He doesnt take attendance.",1
So nice and friendly. I hope she teaches other classes I need.,1
Ervin's a good guy but he is challenging. You will have to work and re-work his problems before the test and he likes to throw curveballs in there. Homework is worth 28% of the final grade though and is pretty easy. Managed to get a C in the class without killing myself,1
Difficult professor. Hard exams hard lectures everything is confusing. Failed this class.,0
"Dr. Knox is a great professor. The subject matter is very interesting. He has 3 text tests which come straight from the book and 1 notes test which is on all the lectures. Each absence is 10 points off your attendance grade which is worth 1 exam. The tests aren't bad but if you plan to skip, do not take this class.",1
I highly recommend taking Calculus 1 with Professor Kuhlman. He's a great guy that really makes the class enjoyable and his lectures are easy to follow along with. He's made the transition to online learning seamlessly compared to other professors. He's also very flexible in terms of assignment due dates and gives various resources to help you.,1
"Honestly, he is amazing for a TWU prof. He manages to integrate gen z humor and not make you cringe which is extremely rare. If you took history in high school you will do extremely well since this course scrapes the surface of western history. He is very clear in what he wants and wants you to succeed. However, there is quite a bit of reading.",1
"Good class, actually learned a bit...grading is tough, but fair. Would recommend for future classes.",1
Professor Vannier is a great professor. He's a really nice guy and very encouraging. He tries hard to make Geology interesting to all students no matter their major. There are weekly online quizzes based off the lectures he puts on Blackboard so they're easy points. To pass you need to show up to class most of the time for the tests,1
"Mr. Goodman is very monotone, but he is an alright professor. There is quite a bit of course material and it can be confusing at times but Goodman will try his best to clear things up for you.",1
"Dr. Fetter is an absolutely amazing professor and I highly recommend taking him for accounting. His class is straight forward, easy, and he does not assign a lot of homework. Nevertheless, you still cover a lot of material and he really ensures you understand the concepts before moving on.",1
Loving this class thus far. Dr. Parker is genuinely interested in listening to us and in improving our writing skills.,1
"He is so wonderful.  He gives you all the notes in a basic outline...there is a ton of information, but it is easy to study.  He always has little tidbits of extra info to give freely and he uses visual and audio examples in class so that class is not always so mundane.",1
"Great professor. He really cares about his students and wants them to be successful, but you have to put in the work as well. The tests were somewhat difficult but if you study the study guide and homework (he gives a short hw assignment a week before you have a test), then you should do well on the tests.",1
"To all my non-music majors needing to take Music40 to fulfill their Arts & Humanities G.E., TAKE THIS CLASS. Mr. Knapp is a great Professor. The class is work heavy, I wont lie, but it is truly effortless. All the exams given (7) are based on lecture/online assignments. If you study, theres no way you will get anything but an A.",1
"Avoid if possible, unhelpful and beyond arrogant, very vague with everything in my opinion.",0
"She's loves math. She even has easier techniques other than the book's way to solve problems, be prepared to take lots of notes. Make sure you keep your binders up to date with notes and redo test, b/c she checks and gives extra points for that. Go to tutoring because you get extra points for that as well. Be prepared to buy 150$ TI-84 calculator",1
"Very unorganized, the whole blackboard site was very unorganized and professor didnt post some of the information that was supposed to be on there. When students asked questions in class she would say she didnt have time to answer, yet went on tangents about her personal life and stuff that had nothing to do with the material.",0
"Tests are 75% of your grade, if you are willing to go to him for help then you will be okay.  He does want his students to pass, so ASK questions.  Really do not be afraid to ask questions, and do the additional problems he puts on myclasses.  He does do like one extra credit event.",1
"He barely knows what he's talking about it seems like, students are constantly correcting him. This confuses the students and makes it hard to understand. He seems to not care about failing students and probably thinks he's doing his part in helping explain the material which he isn't. Don't take him, you might as well teach it to yourself.",0
He is a very sweet teacher. He very quiet and shy. Attendance isnt mandatory for lecture or recitation. Make sure you go to lab though. Weekly hw but he opens them up at the end of the semster if you miss one. He also gives all his test online but the final is in class. I love him and would totally recommend,1
"Dr S is the sweetest, but her criteria and wants were a bit confusing sometimes. She's new at Carroll so I can excuse that, and I still highly recommend her. She really makes you think about the injustices in the world and she opens your eyes to. various ways to solve issues. Lots of papers, but theyre relatively easy and interesting. I reccomend.",1
DR. K RULES!! Extremely intelligent guy. I learned a lot. I loved it-of course you gotta read. If you don't like reading I suggest not taking him. In the end it is worth it though. Super relaxed atmosphere. Just do your work and you'll get a good grade. He's the man. One of my favorite teachers.,1
"easy online class, just one discussion board a week and you reply to one student. no tests or quizzes. the final is a one pg reflection of the course. we had really interesting topics and readings, easy class and you actually learn a lot. solid professor for online. take him!",1
Very easy class. Get the book!,1
Heyborne rocks!!! One of my favorite teachers. He is always there to help with anything. Take anything you can from him! you won't regret it,1
Matt is amazing,1
Pam is a good prof. She is very helpful and knowledgeable. I learned a great deal about reading strategies and literature. Recommend her!,1
"I am in her class this semester and LOVE it. It is hard enough that I feel motivated to study, but easy enough that it isn't scary. She is so funny and gives a lot of real world examples. She doesn't post the lecture slides online but she does give out  A LOT of material to make sure that you are ready for your exam.",1
Very laid back and a joy to have him as a teacher,1
good teacher,1
"Dr. Moore assigns lots of homework, but it is not without purpose. Every assignment she gives helps with the required papers, overall developing what would otherwise be an extremely difficult analytical argument. She was sweet and caring towards her students and was extremely helpful. I am most definitely a better writer because of her.",1
"Professor Ladon is very caring, but she can be a bit off. She is very disorganized and often misplaces a lot. I really enjoy how she handwrites all of her notes on a projector, but her handwriting could be better. Just study for her exams and do the homework and you should be straight",1
She really isn't the nicest lady. Pretty rude as well. Leaves class mid lecture to take phone calls for what? I don't know. There are days where she's pleasant and then days where she's so nasty you can cut the tension with a knife. If you just go to class and do your best you'll be fine. It's just not a pleasant experience though.,0
Great teacher.  I took her spring 2010.  She is the teacher that I compare all my professors too.  She sets you up for success.  Truly the greatest professor I have ever had.,1
"Superb prof.  The best ever.  Be careful though on exams - he can be pretty tough but usually fair.  If you go to all his classes - and why wouldn't you, they're the best classes ever - you'll be fine.  He's so easy to listen to, so inspirational, so funny.  He's ADORABLE.",1
My man. Best math prof.,1
"He's young and new, when he walked in we all thought he was a student. The class is SUPER easy, he seems to know what he's talking about. Lab was the best part, lecture (his part) was very boring, only 10 people came to lecture the last 5 weeks. What's important is the CODE for online not so much the book. Do the study guides and tests are 100%.",1
She doesn't answer emails. She gave me a 0 on an assignment that I completed. Only gives two tests a midterm and final which are take home. Never get any quizzes.,0
"Although he was very intimidating at times and the majority of his test questions were a bit hard, I would absolutely take Dr. Nguyens class again. I must admit, I slacked on studying since this is a gen ed, so thats why I didnt do great on exams. BUT the class was worth it! If you genuinely take his ideas to your heart, youll be fine.",1
"Dr. LaBelle is definitely a solid choice for research methods. She can be a tough grader, but if you just sit and take time to do the assignments properly, you should be fine/pass. Her grading criteria is clear and she's accessible outside of class in her office hours to help. She's also pretty cool when you get to know her outside class.",1
"Best teacher so far. You will have to work in this class but you'll also learn.  Very willing to help if you're willing to work.  Responded to emails in timely fashion.  Lets you submit work early for critique so you'll have a chance to revise before final submission.  If you fail this class, it's because you don't listen to what he says.",1
"Unless you are familiar with complicated high level mathematics, do not take financial economics. Math skills aquired solely from economics courses will not be helpful at all in this course.",0
"Fantastic teacher! Easygoing, but he expects a lot and is a tough marker! Then again, he is funny and sociable outside of the office!",1
amazing prof honestly she is amazing,1
"Has a funny sense of humor, and keeps class interesting. Not too hard of a grader. Gives you all the information on everything you need to write about, alot easier than other teachers who teach English 1002 g.",1
He is really nice. You really have to study the textbook and participate in class those are the keys to getting a good grade in his class. The class is very difficult. He doesn?t really write on the board. So you have to be a good note taker. Good luck and make your Spanish textbook your best friend.,1
Professor Nelson is a great professor and is really understanding if you clearly state a problem you have. Her lectures are straight-foward and she is reasonable with her grading. She can be a bit tough towards the end but she isn't a rude professor. She will answer questions as long as they're respectful.,1
Dr. Guerriero is really nice and her class is easy! She assigns only a few quizzes and many group projects. She gives you a lot of work days to do the project so you won't have class those days which is great if you have her at 8am like I did.,1
"right off the bat, you can tell that he has a unique sense of humor, can easily relate lectures into real-life situations. Really easy going professor 10/10 would recommend if you are looking to take a psychology class",1
Worst mistake to take this guy... absolutely clueless,0
"Dr. Shartin is the man. I've taken several classes with him and he gives you the tools to succeed. His door is almost always open and he is willing to invest a lot of time in any questions you have. Hell, he holds extra help workshops for logic 3 days a week at the end of the semester. There is no reason for anything other than an A if you care.",1
Amazing professor that really cares about her students and wants them to succeed!,1
Ms. Fujimoto was my first English professor in college and MPC and she was the best. She's really caring and teaches the class material very well. She also gives good feedback and takes her time to explain how to better your work. I would totally recommend to take her class as you won't regret it.,1
"She is a fantastic professor. During my freshman year her class was the only one that kept me sane. For the exam, study the notes and then read about the notes. Her exams are always multiple choice and her ""essay"" is probably the easiest one you'll have in college. It's super easy to get an A in her class. If you have a problem just talk to her.",1
"Hands down the BEST professor I have ever had. He's clear with his lectures and knows what he's talking about. Not to mention he keeps class fun in his own way, AND he explains his content VERY thoroughly and clearly to where it CAN be understood. He makes his own jokes and puts it into the material. And not the kind of jokes you would expect. diff",1
Fantastic personality! So funny! Makes coming to class exciting and interesting. There is never a dull moment. She makes you actually enjoy what you're doing. Best professor I have had thus far.,1
This teacher is not good i dont know how his reviews are high. Its a 101 class but he expects you to write like a person who majored in writing essays. He trys so hard to find things to mark you do with. ,0
"Overall, an okay FSE 100 professor. He is difficult to understand due to an accent (and very unclear on expectations even when coherent) but is lenient on grading. My biggest issues are with the class itself, not the instructor (e.g. one person ends up doing all the work in a group).",1
"This one separates the wheat from the chaff. If there ever was a professor/course combo that gave you an idea of what electrical engineering is all about, its this. Extremely difficult, but if you manage to learn it you will be a god. He understands this fact and decides to hit you hard and force you to learn rather then give you a rubber stamp.",1
"This course was taught by an awful TA. Unfair grading and little help. If you have the chance, just take Physics at a community college. It's insane that UMB charges students so much money, just to be ""taught"" by graduate students who are grumpy because they miss lunch during 11am lab and do not care about the students.",0
"Absolutely a great teacher, by far one of the most fun classes I have ever been too.  For the actual work though, be prepared to show a lot of effort and growth, show up to every single class without being late, and writing two easy papers (one a minimum of 6 pages long) and about a page worth of homework every other night.",1
"Never take this class as an elective. Forget about the online component, It's way too much work (readings, assignments). You are supposed to read the whole, 300 page textbook, as well as watch hours of lectures. Every now and then you are supposed to buy the newest version of the textbook (which she was an author of) that costs $100+. Ridiculous.",0
"Absolutely loved her! Took her for 111 and 112 and the labs, and she was great. If you did poorly in her class, it was by no fault of hers! She gives you everything you need and more! Great professor and I actually wrote to the Dean requesting that she be allowed to teach 113 as well!",1
"Professor Wood is one of the few math teachers that I've actually learned from. She is a specific grader but only to teach students the proper way to solve equations and inequalities. If use utilize the workshops she generously sets up in combination of attending class, doing assignments on time and engage you'll only be set to succeed! 10/10",1
The best professor I've had at UT yet! His exams are fairly difficult but there is so much extra credit available its not a big deal. The lectures weren't always the most interesting but the subject matter is something he's passionate about which makes a big difference. Easy recommendation from me for anyone needing this class.,1
"I took his hybrid class and it was a breeze. The class was on Pearson but we took the tests in the classroom on paper. You really have to teach yourself with the Pearson homework but it is set up very well. All the test were straight off the homework except the final, the final was a little bit hard. He is a strange guy but is very approachable.",1
Amazing prof overall! He really cares about what he teaches and his students. He's understanding of things that go on outside of class and is genuinely wants you to succeed. I highly recommend taking economics with him if you have the chance.,1
"Mr. Lovell is an awesome instructer.  Class was never dull, discussions were great.  Take notes and read your chapters, you'll be ok. Excellent reviews before a test :)  Three exams, one final paper.  I loved his class. :)",1
A great professor that is flexible with grading and wants students to do well. Definitely recommend him.,1
Great Professor.,1
"he is really a terrible professor. His class is boring but not very difficult. However, he won't give your marks in the exam for some ridiculous reasons.",0
This was by far the worst class I have taken Its her way or the highway Super tough grader she has a certain way she wants you to do everything She uses weird formulas that are hard to find outside of class if you try doing a problem with the book it uses a different formula If you dont use the specific formula she wants she docks points for it,0
"She is very nice and caring. She is very helpful especially if you need ideas for the essays. The homework is heavy at the beginning of the semester but towards the end, its just projects and stuff. I don't like the group projects where the people in the group were chosen based on the book we choose to read. She also grades the essay hard.",1
"Dr. Storslee is absolutely the best teacher I've had at PVCC. I love his teaching style, he's incredibly helpful, and he genuinely wants his students to succeed. He's always available to help, he's easy to talk to, and I love how he's so proud of his students. He's just an awesome teacher.",1
"great class, and a great teacher, just got screwed over by the TA's because they lost my homework and extra credit ending me up with a B+ and teacher didnt do anything about it",1
GREAT PROFESSOR MY FAV.,1
Great class. Great Professor. Highly recommend ASTR 330 (Extraterrestrial Life) as a gened!,1
He is extremely knowledgeable about what he teaches. He tries to make the class as entertaining as possible with jokes and real world examples. Usually a written assignment due every class. Hands down my favorite professor at CSU.,1
"I thought Ning was a very good teacher.  There was a language barrier, but he was always willing to explain Physics concepts to willing students who wanted to do well.  He is very enthusiastic and breaks things down to basic easy to understand concepts. He seems very committed to his job and Physics as a field. I thought he was good!",1
"An extremely nice professor, but marks very hard. I did well in the course without trying too hard only because of my previous knowledge of french. She is also very organized and meticulous, which is reflected in her marking!",1
i knew more about her family than i knew about biology.  Her past quizzes did help me from failing...Curves were crazy,1
Klatzke is a great professor. She is very enthusiastic about her topics and always gets you involved in class. Never boring. Easy grader. Only a few very east quizzes (you can use your book)and a midterm and final that are only moderately tough. Speeches are easy and you learn to love it. I would recommend her to anyone.,1
"DO NOT TAKE. He over complicates the simplest of concepts. We spent 30 minutes trying to solve one problem. He does not seem prepared for the ""lecture"". I put lecture in quotes because he makes you watch Kahn Academy videos instead of using class time to teach us. I would consider this an English course instead of a math one because of reflections",0
"If you've taken an AP calculus class before, go ahead and take him as a professor. If this your first time ever seeing calc before, stay away.",0
"This guy is the worst guy you can take for 330, he doesn't care about,  and he thinks u're only taking 3 credits per semester because you have to constantly study for his pop quizzes.  Avoid it at all cost.  When I took this class he gave us the pop quizz in the second of class .... like seriously ?  u have not time to warm up with him ",0
"Ms. Hudepohl is very brillant and knows what she is talking about. She is very humourous and interesting and a very good teacher. Her tests are straigtforward if you have read your course material. It was a 200 pt class, so taking the quizzes (which she announces) and doing well on the tests are a must. I'd take her again.",1
"Brett took a dry course, Accounting, and made it bearable. I enjoyed his lectures and his humour. I highly recommend him for anyone who is required to take accounting and not overly interested in it.",1
"not easy but the information is useful, if you are going into the field of theater or film.",1
Dr. Capper is one of the best teachers in the department. I've had him three times and he really cares about his students. He makes religion interesting and makes you want to learn more.,1
Lover her. Best Professor EVERRRRRRRR. And she's totes easy on the eyes (;,1
I thought I was not going to pass at the beginning of the semester but gradually started to get the feel of things as the semester went on. She is tough but it was a good kind of tough. I enjoyed taking the class and would take her for 1A if she taught it.,1
"She's a great professor, make sure that you are attentive to the different assignments that she is handing out and their due dates. Great class and Great professor.",1
Loved her. She is very kind.,1
"She assigns homework but you don't have to do it-, no online work. She explains everything but you do have to pay attention.  If you pay attention you're fine but if you don't you may struggle.  She is always there to help you- if you're struggling just ask and she'll take the class time to make you understand. I hate math & she made me love it!",1
"Students generally either love or hate Maureen. Her classes are a lot of work, but are very rewarding! Make sure to follow her 'pet peeves' handout, or be prepared to fail miserably. It's an English course, so read and follow all the handouts and you will do great! She will do anything to help you excel in her course.",1
"Without a doubt, the worst professor I have ever had in my life.  I got an A, and I have no idea what I learned...I only remember Gen Bio immunolgy after taking her rambling and disjointed class.  Impossible exams and useless lecutres...crazy stories and theories: she called the bio soc-bio med students ""useless brain-dead idiots of Rutgers"" hahaha",0
"Prof. Bannow is not a mean guy, let me get that out of the way. However, he talks down to students because he doesn't understand that a student doesn't master a concept by seeing it once. Do not ask questions, do not miss class, basically teach yourself. He ends up giving so much extra credit the class seems pointless. Not recommended at all.",0
Great professor! Even though the project s are a lot harder than the midterm and final.,1
She was a really great teacher. I will be taking her again for ENG 112. Loved her class. It was a Hybrid!,1
"Great Professor. You will have about 3 papers per class with him that range from 3-8 pages in length. He grades papers tough but if you get them revised early on, you will make a good grade. Although he takes a long time to get feedback to you on your papers, he gives you many opportunities to re write if he does not think its good. No tests",1
"One of the best profs in the department. Works through obscure and often difficult material methodically, constantly stopping to make sure the class is following. Feels as though she genuinely cares for students and wants each of them to succeed. As with all phil classes, make use of office hours for best grade.",1
"Smith breaks down 5 paragraph essays in a unique way. First you write one paragraph summaries of an article of your choice. Summaries are then applied to your introduction paragraph. Then he teaches you body paragraph ""structure."" Which is built with a topic sentence, explanation of the topic sentence, personal example, and going back to you idea.",1
"There are three assignments that are due throughout the semester, but he lets you fix them until the end of the semester. You don't do anything else in the class.",1
She knows her stuff but she is too hard.  I have lost my interest in anthropology because of this class.  But she is very informative and a great resource for those who really like anthropology.,1
Good teacher but needs to take a breath during class he never stops talking.,1
"You actually have fun while learning stuff. Really sweet guy, also pretty funny. Glad I got to work with him!",1
"Do all the readngs, be on time, and participate.",1
"Dr. Chisholm has been such an incredible resource for me in my journey through the UofL education program. He is not only enthusiastic about the subject matter he teaches, but he is also incredibly effective with his feedback to every student. He demonstrates his care for each individual student and & always available to talk outside of class.",1
"3 tests that are all online, but not easy by any means. He comes off as nice, but not approachable at all and not helpful. Boring lectures. I wouldn't recommend.",1
"Professor Brown is a very genuine teacher.  He provides power points which makes note taking significantly easier.  His tests are a combination of multiple choice, definitions and short answer and he's very lenient with partial credit for the definitions and short answer.  The textbook for this course was a bit hefty (some chapters were 50+ pages)",1
Clear explanations and course objectives.  Willing to help students at any time.,1
"Mr Butman is probably the worst teacher ever, drop out before you regret it .",0
"Very helpful, makes class easier to understand, professional at her job",1
"Attendance isnt mandatory, half the class stops coming after a few weeks. She made all of our test/quizzes online after a few weeks so you didnt have to come to class on test day. Her lectures are interesting and she makes cheesy mom jokes. She puts all her slides online .",1
"I did not like this course. At all. Everything was very complex, and no matter how many times I considered her critique my work was not adequate enough. It was incredibly frustrating and her comments about your work were vague. I do not like her teaching style and I do not recommend her to anyone, psychology major or not. ",1
"Professor MacKenzie is a gem- the nicest prof you'll find at McGill. Always makes time for students to see him after class/during office hours. Exams are straightforward with no surprises. An A is v achievable if you keep up. Sometimes he needs organizational assistance, but keep in mind he has to handle 3 sections of the same intro course.",1
"Lots of her ""stories"" were full of inaccurate facts. She is not the sharpest tool in the drawer...likes to talk about herself too much...boring.. teaches diversity class too, as if we need that info any more.  It's 2010 Ms. Rogers...we know their are other races, we just all want to be the same now...",0
"Professor Kendall definitely knows his stuff. Unfortunately, he seems to have a hard time teaching it. He does relatively well, but isn't your typical university professor. He takes the entire class explaining the assignment, after which you'll be expected to do it as homework (which is difficult with no drafting machine or drafting software).",1
Seek him out when you get to Coventry..he will help you in almost anything.....The best. Without his help I would not have my degree its that simple,1
"great professor, funny and helpful",1
"Horrible professor. Might as well be an online course since the only learning done is through youtube. Lecture isn't worth attending, since all he does is grunt and mumble in lecture. Take literally anybody else but Kelm for any calc class he is eligible to teach. And this is coming from someone with 2 years of calc experience.",0
"He is a great guy, but study guides are useless. You have to really understand his material. Lots of homework and you have to really work to even make a B.",1
"I found Dr. O to be knowledgeable humble. She shared past experience,current and relevant events every week which made class relatable to real world. She was a tough grader but provided feedback so one wouldn't make same mistake in future. I said she is humble because she is Program Chair but she related with us as class instructor so we learned.",1
"Honestly shes great , she is very understanding and is always there to help you. I highly recommend her class if anyone needs a lab class for 101",1
"Howell expects a lot of work for a one unit course. He isn't very helpful and gets fairly hostile when irritated. Most of your grade is from lab reports, which are quite long (expect to spend several hours per week writing these up) and minor mistakes will lose you a lot of points. The tests are easy but don't make up much of your grade.",0
"Orgo is going to be a hard class no matter who you take, but MS is a solid choice! He makes jokes that really aren't funny but let you relax a bit in class. If you want an A, be prepared to study at least every other day & go to GSS - it's so helpful and way easier than teaching yourself; I probably put in 10-15 hours a week for an A. 80% was an A",1
Kraszewski is by far my favorite professor at King's. He is hilarious and absolutely brilliant. I always looked forward to his class; he made it interesting and you could tell he was very passionate about what he taught. The work load is not that much compared to other classes but he wants you to have an opinion about the readings. ,1
"Susan Kelly is by far the best professor Ive ever had. I learned more than I have from any other class. Shes a person who has inspired me tremendoualy career wise. Shes incredibly caring, one time she talked to me about family issues for over an hour when I went to her for advice (cant believe I even felt comfortable enough to do this)",1
"Terrible teaching ability, nice guy, but the class was a huge frustration, I learned little and there is no lecture just presentations, he needs more organization and teaching ability, he thought he was making the class easy but was making it more difficult.",0
"I took her class during the pandemic, so it was online, but I had an amazing experience. She really cares about her students and tries her best to make sure we learn the information. She gives great feedback on rough drafts and is also open to suggestions for her class. Prentiss truly pays attention to how the class learns and adjusts accordingly.",1
"A real caring professor. Offers students to come to him for help, will read your work and offer advice on changes to be made before he grades your work. Wants everyone to do well. Solid in his teaching, experienced teacher. A",1
"Every week you will have one quiz, discussion, and 2 discussion comments due. You basically teach yourself. Do not take online if you actually want to learn something. One research essay is due, but it does not even seem like she genuinely takes the time to grade it. I got my grade 5 minutes after submitting it.",1
She is very caring and wants her students to succeed. The main downfall was this paper we had to write which needed to be 4000-5000 words AT LEAST. If you take this class you would need to start at least a week before its due. You also have to love writing because if not its hard writing that long of a paper on something youre not interested in.,0
Not a good grader. Office hours do not help.,0
"I have taken this professors class online for summer 1 (5 week course). The good news is if you're taking another class you can put off this class until Monday becase that's when everything is due. The bad news, her tests are HARD she does give you an outline and review questions for each chapter but those won't help you for the midterm/final exams",0
awful...seems nice in class but not helpful at all! NEVER responded to emails regarding my grade on a test. tests were so random and you had no idea what would be on there..awful!,0
"I took this class online and he had no idea how to use the technology. We went through an entire lecture without being able to see his screen. His exams are extremely difficult and he had to end up curving the entire class. He might be different in a traditional course, but I would never take him online again.",0
"He's a cool dude. He calls on everyone around the room during class, so you have to pay attention. The papers you have to write are really long and brutal but the exams are straightforward and he gives partial credit for everything. Go to class, read the assigned papers, you'll do fine.",1
"I was nervous going into Behavior Stats or PSYC 258 at Miramar College. Never had a solid foundation in mathematic, however Professor Lawson does his best to give everyone a shot at moving forward from PSYC 258. You will have to do your reading on the Chps. however he gives you in depth info on what to expect on the test and reviews every chapter!",1
"If you want an easy A take him!! Also, it helps if you're an attractive female. I went to about three or four classes the whole semester, failed just about every test, and somehow received an A. It's almost impossible to get a bad grade in this class. And he gives a lot of extra credit just in case you feel you may need it.",1
"My main issue with this professor was the delay in the grading process. I understand needing time, but returning assignments two months later does not help me understand what I am doing wrong. If assignments were graded in a more timely manner students would be able to use the feedback to perform better.",0
"one of the best, most passionate professors on criminal law. expect a B if you come prepared to class and do your reading.",1
"This lady is not only awesome because she gives you many opportunities for a great grade, but she also genuinely cares about her students success. Replies quick and offers bonus points which can increase your grade by 2.5%. Ask questions if you don't understand, she enjoys questions! Retake quizzes for easy points.",1
"hard class but worth it prof is  mean, not really student friendly",1
Lecture is pointless but go anyway and get attendance points. Lecture/lab really bring up your grade so make sure you do well on those. When in doubt...go to office hours. She is a terrible professor but I went to office hours once to discuss my grade and ended up with 10 points added to my last test grade.,1
The best teacher ever.,1
Mr. Pierce is an amazing professor! Gives lots of quizzes but they are directly from the PowerPoints. He makes reviews for every test on the concepts that will be tested. I had 0 idea about animals and I got an A. TAKE THIS CLASS AND PROFESSOR do the work and get an A,1
"Dr. Nikkel was great. Very helpful in making sure we understood the nuances of what he wanted in our discussion boards. It is really nice to have a professor who actually participates in the discussions and gives feedback and lets us know exactly what he is looking for. He was beyond fair and had I worked harder, my grade would have been higher.",1
"This class was one of the easiest classes I have ever taken in my entire life, but the material was ridiculous. Professor is much more likely to give you an A if you agree with his stance on issues, even if your work is of much lower quality than those who disagree. Take him for the easiest A of your life, but don't expect to learn much.",0
"Professor Smith is one of my favorite professors at UCSD! He literally wrote Constitutional Law for Dummies - there is no better professor to take a course about constitutional law. His courses are detailed and difficult, as he teaches them like he teaches is law school courses. If you are a POLI major, I would highly recommend!",1
"I took Professor Thompson's summer course of Micro and it was easily the hardest class that I have ever taken. Does NOT give out extra credit, claimed that he did and at the end of course, never gave it out. Tests were timed 1 minute per question. Lectures were unrelated to the material. I was unemployed during Thompson's class and still got a B.",0
"She's a great professor, very organized, and gives clear lectures. She doesn't give any homework, so all you have to do is pay attention in class. The tests are extremely fair, and she gives extra credits depending on participation. I wish all my professors are like her!! Will take her for every class if that's possible.",1
I love Dr. Nikkel! He is super enthusiastic and has interesting lectures. The homework is an easy two questions per week. He reviews for the tests quite thoroughly so if you go to class on the review day you should be good for the test.,1
"Great professor who actually cares about his students. He connects his lectures well to the real world and makes content easy to understand. Tests are a bit tougher than other journalism classes and only have about 30 questions, so not much room for error. You can make up for it by doing the extra credit though.",1
Totally awesome. In 2 weeks I was honestly speaking in Japanese.  Prof Garrisi starts speaking in Japanese the first day of class. Awesome Awesome! She takes attendance for every class. You want to be there. Daily homework from the workbook. Quizzes and test super easy as long as you attend review classes and study. TAKE HER YOU WONT REGRET IT.,1
"He was a great teacher. Had him last minute  because  our teacher got injured in the middle of our semester,  he  did a awesome  job. The whole class loved him.",1
"I'm in love with this teacher and wish he would ask me to marry him. He is an amazing teacher and is extremely smart. He will answer any questions you ask him, and he doesn't sugar-coat the facts.",1
"The most amazing professor I have ever had and one of the best people I have had the privilege of knowing. Dr. Monroe truly cares about everyone, and will do anything he can to help you. I had his class for 3 hours at night, but it was the highlight of my week. He makes lectures fun and interesting. 15/10, I do recommend.",1
"I had an A until the last two weeks of class. Only the auto-graded things were graded and given very little weight like 10%. The term paper wasn't graded before the final exam paper was due so you have no idea how she grades. The things she has to grade (essays, short answer) counted too much and weren't graded until too late to apply feedback! Ugh",0
"Started on Ch. 9 on the first day in a difficult subject for first-level math (complicated statistics). No intro, nothing. Horrible, said on first day she didn't care if we ever got sick and to not ""bother"" her with emails. Withdrew within the second week. Waste of time",0
"She is a cool professor, her lectures are very interesting and she definitely knows what she is talking about. Hardly gives homework and when she does is very easy. Do recommend taking her",1
"He is very passionate about SOC, very lenient, and very caring. Strongly recommend. The midterm and final are online.",1
Would take classes with him again to this day!!,1
She takes quite a while to grade assignments but is very helpful and quick to respond to emails. There are assignments available for extra credit. She certainly cares about her students passing.,1
"Anybody who takes her class will love her. She is very funny and caring. She is not a hard grader, and you can expect at least a B if you turn everything in on time. I highly recommend her, she is the best COMP teacher at Kutztown.",1
taking his ornithology class and it's amazing.  he is a polymath in every sense of the word; a true naturalist. got me and my little 5 yr old boy hopelessly addicted to birds and nature. the man is a treasure and his students are among the luckiest on the planet!!!,1
"Professor Felber set the standard for what feedback should be in an online course.  I've only taken 10 online courses so far, but Felber was by far the most helpful professor that I've had.  Her work isn't the easiest, but she is very fair and consistent with her grading.",1
For the Leopold book just copy the 4 articles in the back thats all you will need. He is an awesome person and extremely understanding if you cant turn something in on time. Keep up on the readings he will stop reminding you to do them so the syllabus will really help. ,1
"Lazy students are complaining! He is strict but a good teacher. We are at college level, no longer kindergarten or primary school. We study the materials and do the homework. You are guaranteed will pass the class with an A. Stop whining!",1
Love this teacher,1
"Great. Easy on scoring paper esp classwork and hw ->chance to get full credits. No stress in her class even when you're in a short term or summer session. Class: very comfortable. A lot of group discussion, which really helps in writing your papers bet",1
"This professor is extremely difficult. Genetics is a difficult class through and through but Dr. Jone's makes it ridiculously difficult. On our past test, no one made A or B and the average was a 58. She thinks we are doing well though. Do not plan on taking this class and coming out with a good grade even if you study at least a week in advance!!",0
"Professor Liggin teaches a gateway class that converges Architecural students and Construction Management students. If you cannot read a set of blueprints, you should not be in that industry. He teaches the fundamentals that will help you succeed on your first day on the job. It is a super neccesary course and he is the best professor for it!",1
"Pretty good, even though I am not native speaker, the class is every easy",1
"I loved Prof Merdian's class, but for many, he's an acquired taste. He comes off a little harsh sometimes, but the guy cares about his students deep down and he knows his stuff. Just pay attention, be active during class, study hard and you will be fine. 4 lecture test and 2 lab test. No textbook needed just get connect",1
"His grading is terrible, most of the people in my class are complaining already. Honestly feels like he lacks the compassion because he marks everything off even if your answers are right. I wouldn't recommend taking him.",0
Very nice and an awesome teacher with a great attitude!!,1
"The last two reviews hit the nail right on the head. Lectures can be 4 hours long sometimes, and the time allotted to finish tests/quizzes is unreasonable. I don't believe this Professor would flunk anyone, which is the only good thing, but I would NEVER take a class like this again.",0
"Awesome teacher, really knows her stuff.  Listen, read, take notes and study this class is not easy but it is doable if you put some work into it....Then again if you don't want to work for it maybe your looking at the wrong profession.",1
"What an icon! She is known as the ""theatre mom figure"" around campus for a reason. She is the definition of caring, compassionate, and laid-back but passionate about what she does. You'll learn a LOT of valuable information, just be prepared to do a lot of homework.",1
"reads straight from textbook for lectures, very monotonous",0
"Dr. Cutler is one of the most caring people you will ever meet. The content of her class is hard, and sometimes I needed to look up YouTube videos to find another way of explaining a topic. She is a good teacher who will slow down if you ask her to. However, she does not baby you. In order to get an A in her class you need to be self-motivated.",1
Excellent professor! Very insightful comments of current events. Interesting materials related to what is going on in Wall Street.,1
"Professor Walker is experienced, educated and a very respectable person. Show up on time, participate in your group assignments every week (they do get graded), and make an effort on the group project/presentation. The exams don't require excessive studying, if you've ever held a job/career, you'll pass the exams without ever opening the book.",1
"Shes very nice, helpful in class and outside class, quizzes are open note so was final exam,attendance isnt mandatory but she does count it as grade to help your grade.",1
This class is by far my favorite that I've taken so far. Each class was a new experience and discussions were always interesting. Garneau also has lots of real world experience with the topic. The class isn't too hard as long as you do the readings and are ready to talk about them. There aren't any tests and the other assignments are easy or fun.,1
"Definitely enjoyed the content of the class but she was not a good professor. She does know what she is talking about but a lot of the times, it seems as though she is talking to herself. VERY disorganized!!! She is all over the place and is not clear on what she wants on assignments. Very contradictive. Also takes a while to give grades back. ",0
"I loved this class, I love the theories he taught, In fact I still know them. I hate the fact that his Exams are THEORY BASED though. What good theories only for engineers. What good is to memorize with very little applications. Its easy to pass his class. But hard to get A because he takes of A LOT of points for little things. Like wrong sign, -20",0
"He isn't the worst professor but his methods of teaching were sort of confusing. I am really good at math but I didn't take the class seriously because it was online. That being said, he made several extensions for assignments and he also did what he had to for us to learn. He could have been more organized, but again it's an online class.",1
"Dr. Hale is definitely the best history professor I've ever taken, and one of my favorite professors at APU. He's incredibly smart, kind, and knowledgeable in many things, from history to politics, philosophy, and the humanities. If you aren't looking for a super in depth examination of history, I don't know if I'd recommend, but he's fantastic.",1
"It's all been said already. He is very knowledgible, but doesn't know how to teach it to students.",0
"For this class, its best that you study a lot and try to finish homework early. The material is difficult but if you stay on top of things you can definitely keep up. Professor Myers is a good teacher but wont respond to any homework questions until after the due date, so don't rely on him. Overall, this was still a good class.",1
"Dr. Brown does a great job with online classes. Interpersonal comm was oddly interesting and the topics in the journal & discussion boards are awesome. Very reasonable. If you forget 1 assignment you can drop a whole letter grade, don't learn that the hard way. No late work accepted. 1 quiz and 1 journal or discussion forum a week due on Fridays.",1
"I think he really tries to make the class interesting, but it was almost impossible for me to stay awake in that class. He sometimes has pop quizzes, but not often and they're not difficult.",1
"Claudine was a wonderful instructor! She gives clear expectations, is easy to communicate with, and genuinely cares about her students. She loves mental health and it's easy to see. You'd be lucky to have her!",1
"New teacher. Very disorganized. VERY. I like to be prepared for the semester; knowing expectations, assignment %, weekly breakdown, etc.  Every week, a new assignment is given. She is very nice and charming, but is not an educator.  She comes from corporate-level IT job, and the transition is terrible. God will need to help you if taking her class",0
Very nice professor! Helpful and understanding.,1
"Knowledgeable and passionate about history, but she assigns TONS of readings that are usually super boring. The lectures are just her talking, but once in a while she'll ask about readings so be prepared. On her essays, she expects you to basically repeat what she says in class and if you disagree with her, it shows in your grade.",0
"I love Miranda, but there are some things to take note of before taking her class. She has the attention span of a gnat, and having ADHD, it's really hard to pay attention to the class when she herself, cannot pay attention. Also for her assignments (at least in COMM-522) she has left us VERY unclear on what to do. She's hilarious and caring though",1
Take this class and professor! Her class is easy and she is super nice. She is very helpful and seems to really want her students to succeed. The book you read in class is good and interesting too.,1
Mr. Goodman is a very good teacher and easy to get along with.,1
"She's interesting. We basically sit in a circle and talk about poems and stories the entire class. grade is based on midterm and final only so if you miss a class, you don't miss anything. it was definitely boring at times but I got an A so I'm happy. She's really really sweet and super easy going about everything. i would definitely recommend her",1
PROBABLY THE EASIEST PROFESSOR AT UCBA!,1
"Tidwell really knows her stuff but she has some trouble teaching it. She stands at the front and reads from the PPs for class. You have to have a quick hand for she doesnt put anything on Canvas because she wants to make sure everyone shows up. She grades attendance every single day, too. This info is really interesting but she made it boring.",1
"Dr. Carter is an amazing professor. He cares about his students and whether they understand the material. He is truly inspirational, and you will leave class motivated. His class will make you think about questions you don't want to face, but you need to. Overall, I strongly recommend him for any and all classes.",1
Covered a lot of different genres in Spanish cinema. He cares about students and wants them to be interested in the lectures. Only critique I have is that he doesnt give much feedback on essays and doesn't give clear prompts for the essays (which can be good because you have freedom to choose). Only a few papers and group discussion on one movie.,1
Professor Russum classes are fun and you will learn something as long as you come and participate.,1
"You can tell Sam is a very smart man, and he genuinely enjoys what he teaches. However lectures are very unstructured and don't follow any slides. You have to pay close attention to catch what's important. If you get a good GSI (which i did not) your discussion section will help you acheive the grade you want. You HAVE to go to lecture to do well.",1
"Ms. Brown is great. Her lectures are more like class discussions. Everyone participates and voices their opinion. She wants to help you succeed--in and out of class. She even gave up her own free time to help me practice a presentation for another class. She offers lots of extra credit, and she always has a funny little story to tell.",1
"He was a a really good wisner. Loved his class, got an A.",1
"Great guy! Professor Vannier is energetic, passionate, and has a sense of humor. Offers lots of extra credit opportunities and is very willing to help students. Only downside is disorganized lecture slides. Note key concepts during lecture and you should be fine. Likes to give away quiz and test answers during his lectures, so look out for that.",1
"Dr. Moore is alright, ya see, she's just like you and me. She's a bit passive aggressive and bloody-well-boring, but what's important is that she loves you and me.",1
Doesn't post in-depth notes so you need to show up as there are constant notes during lecture. Get the book for the MC portion of the exams. She cares about her students and is really passionate about what she teaches. Not interested in Latin America but might take the course just to have her again.,1
Unrealistic expectations for his students.  INSANELY HARD!,0
"Great professor, truly cares about student success.",1
Only 5 exams total. Lowest score dropped. There is reading that you have to do in order to pass the exams. Great Class!,1
"Fantastic professor. Not gonna be the easiest class, but it'll be supremely fun. His lectures are fantastic.",1
"Prior exp recommended, not req'd f/program-- maybe it should be due to lab. Go fig, 3 labs & they R never ""open"", false advertising. BTW, 10 peeps failed the catheter 1st time, it's a program issue. I have gone above & beyond what is req'd class wise. When I was looking into exp COC called. At least I got away from YOU! Why do ya care A.F.?",1
"I loved his class, he really wants you to succeed and is a big part in your goals, I took a hybrid class and it was fast, easy and he was very helpful. He also puts a lot of humor into it. If you want to learn, and have a nice teacher with not too much work take his class.",1
Wants her own ideas regurgitated back at her and nothing else.,0
She is such a sweet and understand professor! She is lenient yet takes her material very seriously. You can tell she is very interested in what she teaches and she gives amazing feedback for papers so you know exactly what you need to do.,1
No Comments,1
"He is a really nice guy and always willing to help if one has any questions during office hours or in class. BUT he is a horrible professor by nature.Poor guy was just born that way, not his fault. He does set 250pt at C but given his super hard exams its hard to do",0
"Terrible. This prof wasn't engaged at all, just assigned work with not real follow up. Wouldn't take any of his classes again.",0
"Mr. Koehler is a very respectful teacher. I took this class online and it was a breeze. I recommend taking it online, overall do take this professor. You will not regret taking him.",1
"2nd time taking her online English class. Lots of assignments and the peer review for essays is painful BUT, it keeps you focused and turning in assignments. If you do the work, you'll get a decent grade no problem.",1
I have taken this class twice before and failed it because professors don't know how to lecture. Professor Hercules does a great job explaining the material.,1
"He makes the class interesting by showing videos. Tests are really easy. He's a great guy, I will be taking more CJ courses with him in the future. ",1
really helpful.  anytime you need to see her she is willing to meet. gave me a lot of good study tips.,1
"Very hard to keep up with, knows what he's doing, but not very good at explaining himself. This is the first class I have ever failed. He is also not good at posting grades on blackboard, so you aren't able to see what you have overall in the class. Would not recommend.",0
"One of the best English teachers I've ever had. Mr. November gives great examples to all the elements of writing. He is a helpful guy and pretty funny at times. He is chill, but if you piss him off, it gets scary... Overall I would recommend everyone to take this class. It might be hard, but suck it up, nothing is supposed to be easy.",1
Really nice guy and passionate about what he teaches.    three helpful hints: 1) get DB entries done early don't wait until the last minute (trust me i had to learn the hard way) 2) take lots of notes trust me they help and don't be afraid to ask for help if you need  3) take advantage of the extra credit it honestly really does help,1
"He's a tough grader. Small mistakes can cost you lots of points, which I think is too extreme from his part. He tells you exactly what he wants in the lab reports. The error analysis stuff may be hard but I'm glad I learned about it. The labs are varied, like 8 lab reports, a couple of quizzes and a final (individual, no groups) Expect to work.",1
"For exams, be familiar with all problems covered in class, and know how to manipulate equations and logarithms to solve for any variable. To do well, practice problems are absolutely necessary -- the more, the better. The final was hard, so be careful about relying on final forgiveness. I found her intimidating, but she's a fast and fair grader.",1
"This rating is for Dr. Luisa Ferreira, her first name is spelled incorrectly, but anyway, you must take her! She is the best! Super nice woman and gives amazing feedback. If it wasnt for her, I would have struggled, and I was never good at writing. She helped build my confidence, and for that Im so grateful. Take her and you wont regret it!",1
boooooo brian,0
Among other half-witted professors this one likes to randomly add passwords to quizzes for no reason other than to make your life harder because it's easy to use someone else's work and throw your name at the top. Her videos aren't helpful and she depends on course simulations to teach because there's clearly a lack of experience on her part.,0
"I respect Dr. Ferguson very much. She has so much knowledge that she just wants to share with us & to learn and expand our knowledge on that. Participation matters and helps the class become more interesting. Buy the books and do the readings. If you do not take a class with her in your years at URI, you will be missing out. ",1
"No rubric for any assignments and shows you how to do stuff, but doesn't teach what it is you're doing. Almost every class starts at a different time. Instructions and guidelines are unclear and vague.",0
Loved this class! Intro to computers and not too difficult!,1
"OK so the homework-It's hard but doable. He's a very easy grader. For the tests, I never read the book- just went through the clicker questions & slides on D2L and got an A on all of them. The quizzes were online.. MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THE ANSWERS because he puts those exact same questions on the exam! 5 exams and drops one. He also rounds up A LOT!",1
loveddd her. shes so kind and her tests are fair. def take her. you will not regret it. ,1
"Bushey is HARD. You must put excessive amounts of time in practice aside from homework, to get it fast and be ready for weekly quizzes. He also changes questions unnecessarily and makes it 10x difficult sometimes. He is unfair on time for quizzes, and leaves almost no value in understanding what we are learning, b/c of how fast you must finish.",0
Judy is awesome. I took her for a once a week 3 hour class. She is very helpfull. When you need her even when she was at home she was avalible for class.,1
"Zubin is the man. He's the best prof in the whole faculty, hands down!! ZUBES FOR DEAN",1
"This teacher is one of a kind, one you'll never forget. She's funny, knows her stuff, and makes you feel comfortable throughout the whole semester. There's a group project by the end of the semester which is a bummer for those who hate presentation, however she's an easy grader on that so no worries there. She gives study guides online which helps.",1
"This class is awful. I'm sitting here now and am debating getting up and leaving. She has NO clue how to use the online system and if you don't do the homeworks (which are graded) you WILL fail. She never lets you leave early and is so unclear, for a 101 class she speaks Spanish 90% of the time. Drop this now. ",0
Excellent class I tried to take his following class but it was full.,1
Professor Huerta is the best professor to take for any history course! She always responds back to emails and is always willing to meet to help with assignments. I would definitely recommend her to anyone!,1
"If you know how to write a paper then you will do very well in this course because its not college level material. A month into the course we learned what a topic sentence and what a thesis statement were for a whole week. She also says ""pacific"" instead of ""specific"" which makes me not take her opinion on how to use the English language seriously.",0
"If you follow directions, and show some interest - this class is an easy A. He doesn't use books, only notes for tests.",1
awesome professor! Provides a clear grading structure if you do the assigned work you'll definitely get an A. He also provides opportunities to improve your grade.,1
"Pete Wildman is very light hearted, funny and quirky! He truly enjoys what he does and wants everyone to engage and pass the class. I was so scared to take this class but once I met him, I knew I was in for a great class. He is warm and welcoming. He never makes you feel like you're bothering him. In fact, he encourages coming to him for help!",1
"I like Coop as a person, but his lectures leave a lot to be desired. As an engineering student, I don't really care about the theory behind the math, I want to know how to do the problem and he wasn't very effective for that. Overall, wouldn't take him again.",0
"He's amazing. I love his lectures. He's so nice, too. Tough marker but wants you to do well.",1
"Nice guy but I didn't exactly enjoy him as a professor. Loves the sound of his own voice and grades as if you should know everything he knows, whether you learned it in his class or not",0
"This guy is awesome, he cracks me up every class.  He's got a weird sense of humor, and a great attitude.  Always willing to help and you can tell he really wants everyone to do well in his class.  Average about one homework assignment a week, only take you about 2 hours max.  Gives random in class extra credit so be there!  Highly recommend him!",1
"Professor KmacK is very entertaining and clearly works because he loves his discipline; he isn't in it for the money or the job conditions. That being said, beware of his confused ways to teach and evaluate his class.",1
Last day in class with this professor and enjoyed him very much. He again several of the many professors have made English so entertaining and enjoyable ! The way he taught the class and the way he carried himself was just great . Always had a positive attitude never showed up moody or unprepared. So glad I took him and Definitely would again !!!,1
"Dr. Proga makes this class extremely easy. There are 5 random attendance grades throughout the year, 3 exams (one of which is dropped) and a final. He gives you the exact questions that will be on each test and openly tells you that you can find all of the answers online. He's also really funny. I would highly recommend taking him.",1
"She is a great teacher. She always emailed me back in a very timely manner. This class has really helped me with my public speaking. I loved that she allowed the class to give feedback on presentations because the feedback made me more consciousness of how other's view me. Therefore, I can correct my mistakes and improve.",1
"Thad is a really nice guy. Phys is hard, but he does his best to teach it. Lab is really easy and so are the tests. Recording the lectures helps,  but the tests are harder. He takes a long time to get grades back. Best phys teacher there is at Butte.",1
My comp 1 class with John was amazing. He is a very down to earth guy and he's fair and honest. If you can't take criticism then this isn't the class for you. He is very clear with his feedback and doesn't pull punches. He will never let his own opinions get in the way of grading a student's paper.,1
just plain awesome. but never plain.,1
Dr. Fink is great. Learned a lot from working with her. Super supportive to students.,1
Dr. Hansen is one of the best professors I've ever had. He does all of his exams in class because he is anti-testing center. His tests are straightforward as long as you do the study guide. You can tell he LOVES the environment and he makes boring things seem so interesting. His assignments are made to specifically get to know his students!,1
Hard hard hard,0
"Great teacher, not so great advisor.",1
"Fortunately she's often busy talking about things off topic rather than assigning class work. This class is very simple. Dr. Pittman should learn how to take advantage of the use of the online assignment submissions to avoid so many printed paragraphs throughout the sememster for, it is 2019 and printing every assignment is no longer necessary.",0
"SWEET person, bad professor. The readings were so boring and the assignments were so long. All 6 projects took a substantial amount of time and she talks and talks and talks and talks. You get bored. Really bored.",0
Really improved my signing ability! My favourite ASL prof to date.,1
Prof. Kim is strict on his class discipline. He will ask you to stop talking with your friends  if he thinks you distracts him. He is a tough grader on  your papers but TAs will often give a higher score to balance it out. He is very serious on the material and actually care for the students. He is very strict but caring for students as well.,1
"Do Not Take!! Professor is VERY work heavy. I had more work for her class than for both my major courses taken in the same semester combined!! She is not very friendly towards make up work or absences and is very critical with the grading system. Unless you plan on only taking her course alone, you'll need maximum effort to pass.",0
"Excellent professor! If you are looking to grow in the area or look further past the textbook, he will help you find opportunity and direction.",1
"Well dedicated teacher who tries his best to ensure that his students succeed. He even has job offerings posted regularly to help you. He relates to the students so that they can understand the material better. He also keeps the work accessible online so that you do not have to lug a bunch of paper around, all you need is a flash drive.",1
Peggy's a wonderful instructor that brings in a great group of presenters and projects that can help you figure out career and life goals. Peggy also strongly encourages group cohesion and bonding. I've really gotten to know the group of women that I've taken the class with. Peggy is there 4 you too & wants you to succeed. I'll miss this class.,1
"LOVE this class. I'm one of those people who is horrible at math, and my average right now is a 94% in this class. It's not interesting, by any means, but she doesn't mess around. She only tells you what you need to know. The tests are challenging, but fair. I don't really use the book. Print out the power points. Definitely recommend taking Ms. V.",1
Mr. Bannow is extremely condescending and borderline angry when a question is asked in class. He is obviously a very anxious person and when class gets off track he is visibly annoyed. He will shame you publicly if you give him the chance by asking a question about something he thinks he has covered enough already. You'll learn physics on your own.,0
Smyth is extremely organized and is very passionate about his subject of expertise which makes learning it a lot easier. All of the assignments and papers directly relate to the subject matter. He encourages in-class discussion and is happy to answer questions. And dont worry- youll get used to the lisp. It adds character to his lectures.,1
"Dr. Johansen is a really great professor. Her test are alright, some questions are pretty difficult because her book is different from the class book. So, there are 3 tests and she drops the lowest one. Also, there is one research paper and presentation. I recomment Dr. Johansen... You'll learn a lot!! Just study, no homework!",1
Professor Reynolds grading is very tough!,0
Mr. Martin grades your papers and gives you the opportunity to correct them. He definitely made me grow as a writer.,1
"You will have a group lab and homework every week, which due by Friday at the end of that week (usually). As personally, I think he is hilarious. He tried to put some jokes both in class and office hours. Also, the office hours are pretty helpful and there were not a lot of people there.",1
She's an amazing teacher! She gives great feedback and responds to emails quickly. She went above and beyond to make sure I understood the lessons. She's so enthusiastic and takes the time to get to know her students.,1
Nice professor. Not really interested in the course but he did a good job teaching it. Exams come more from movie sheets than lectures. if you memorize movie sheets and read powerpoints you should do fine.,1
"I took this class in the spring online. This course is setup for you to really learn and I did not feel overwhelmed with the amount of work there are 4 main writing assignments, all which she grades and you have the chance to better and submit to get a better grade. No final exam its just a portfolio of everything you did during the class.",1
"The class is discussion heavy and he will try to make quieter students participate. If there was ever an issue with the class or a question came up, he was easy to reach outside of class. The class covers a lot of topics and he goes into detail on various aspects of the readings, which makes class fast paced and enjoyable.",1
"This man is one of the best professors anyone could ask for as a college student. He wants you to succeed, but he challenges you as well. He is so invested in the topics he talks about that he becomes so passionate in lectures, it makes you passionate as well. Wonderful classes and wonderful teaching, and truly one of the kindest men I know.",1
"Ellen's lectures are so clear, they make the textbook totally unnecessary. The assignments are fun, and she is flexible about working solo on the project. I learned a lot.",1
Respect him he will respct you on a one to one - very angry with mood swings - He will talk about everything and anything not b/c he is SO intelligent but because the man likes to listen to himself speak and tries to make himself look good.  He makes stuff up!  He thinks he teaches but he doesn't - BOTTOM LINE: DO NOT TAKE HIM,0
"Fair class. All of the homeworks, quizzes and the final are online on a different website. She dropped three of the ten quizzes we took and all of the homework problems are straight forward.",1
"Class is very disorganized so you might as well just throw your syllabus out now.  I really felt like I was in high school and I think my Spanish got worse.  Prof. Sanchez is a nice person, but I'm not sure she knows how to teach or really knows what she's doing.  She's tough on grading the online tests.  I would take someone else.",1
"Professor Westover is very knowledgeable. I also think he is respectful, responds to questions right away, and definitely gives feedback about student performance in a timely manner. He is a great teacher, especially for those on the HR track.",1
"He really is a nice guy, he's just not the best teacher. He always gets a befuddled expression when a student asks a question- and half the time he doesn't know what the answer is. There's no rhythm or flow to the progression of material he teaches and nothing is bolded on his slides so it's really difficult to know what he's wanting us to learn.",0
Alison goes above and beyond for her students. She's an exceptionally inspirational professor with a relaxed yet highly effective teaching style. Class discussions were always engaging and assignments were unique and thought provoking.,1
She is literally the sweetest! She really cares about her student's success and during quarantine she would so many times extend the due date for assignments! She gives good feed back and her lecture videos are very informational and clear. She gives a lot of chances for extra credit which is nice. I wish she taught SPAN 1103 as well:/,1
"Isn't clear in directions and blames students when they don't know what to do. I passed this class but worked harder than ever, not because he was tough on me, because he doesn't know what he wants. In my opinion, you should only need to get help from TAs and GAs if you are struggling, it should not be an essential part of passing.",0
"I loved Lisa's way of teaching, she is a professor that students wish all their professors were more like. Super chill and funny, yet engaging in her lectures. Her lectures are not posted online though so it is important to show up to class unless you have a friend you can borrow notes from. If I were a soc major I would take all of Lisa's classes",1
"She's pretty disorganized and not super interesting, but her class is easy to pass. The exams are way more involved (and graded harder) than you'd think, given how easy the day-to-day work is, so study hard for the midterm and final. Overall, don't love, but it's still a pretty easy class.",0
"I really enjoyed this class! Ms. Logue is very sweet and loves to get to know her students and help them achieve success in her class. It's low cost, she supplies everything you need for the course. The work load is very manageable and her lessons are easy to follow!",1
"Dennis is a fun, hilarious professor who takes his work seriously. Taking his class was just such a delight!",1
"Matt is sweet, caring, and always willing to answer questions. The laboratory was easy, and his manual was highly valuable in navigating each module. The lab supplemented my learning in statistics considerably, and I strongly recommend taking it with him.",1
"Doctor Wood is the most communicative professor for an online class. Although there is a lot of assignments, she is willing to help however. There was an extra credit opportunity, and a fair late submissions policy. If you show that you are trying and communicate with her, you will do fine in this class. A lot of interesting discussion posts.",1
"Professor Luckett is really organized with his lectures .All the test come from what he says in class. take notes and you will pass, He answers all the emails and questions you might have. took him for both intro to social work and social welfare easy classes. if your really interested in social work then you will pass. lectures are interesting.",1
I defintetly learned a lot in this class. I want to pursue something amazing and get my name out there. I feel like this class gave me a good beginning view. However the teacher needs to be more specific with her students. Excellent helpful powerpoints but also with the coding/intro to languages I found a lot of students partially struggling.,1
"He is a really great teacher who cares a lot about his students. He values his students' mental health over deadlines. He also carefully chooses books for you to read that are not overly difficult or long and that are very relevant. This semester for ENG 105, we read March (graphic novel) and a collection of Greta Thunberg's speeches. Great prof!",1
"I Took Abnormal Psych Advanced as an independent study for my Bachelors's. Just a suggestion when you get her book start reading the book and begin answering the questions through the chapters; they are either in red or blue boxes depends on edition. Not consistent giving feedback on the papers, made it clear to me she is VERY PART TIME.",0
"Mr. Harvey was awesome! The class was very easy, show up to class and participate. He makes learning fun. I would absolutely recommend this class.",1
"Matt is my favorite teacher at NAU! You could ask him the same question a million times and he will always be patient and kind with you. If you have you have the chance to take his class, please take him!",1
"She's very sassy and says she wants us to ask questions if we don't understand. But then gives us an attitude when we do ask questions. The lectures are typical, study notes, take the tests. It's the lab that's ridiculous. Theres little to no teacher. You essentially have to figure everything out yourself. And it's not easy. ",0
"This class is so easy if you buy the textbook. He puts the quiz questions on the McGraw website and you just need to memorize them. He gets off topic very easily but you don't really have to pay attention in class to pass. The grades consist of quizzes, participation, and a concert report. Which is also very easy.",1
Idg her bad reviews. I took her in the winter and it was the easiest class. all of mindtap is online and there's one final at the end. Would I say I learned a lot? No Was it an easy A? YES. TAKE HER. GOOD FOR WINTER CLASS,1
"Professor Sanchez is great and truly cares about her students. However, this class has a lot of homework that is due by every class. She is lenient and lets you hand it in late but honestly there is way to much especially if you have other hard classes to focus on. There are 3 online exams. Make sure you go to class participation definitely helps.",1
I really enjoyed this professor. His lectures were lengthy and can get boring if youre not super into soil science but he is hilarious and keeps things interesting. His tests are not easy and a lot of questions are from lecture. Attendance was not mandatory but not sure how you could pass without attending most classes.,1
Professor Bronie is so nice and sweet to everyone. She gives a lot of homework and makes you work hard so if you are considering taking her class you must make sure you will be able to do your homework and come to class on time.,1
If the class is online expect to teach yourself most of the material.. The examples shown in lectures are no where near how hard the exam questions are.,0
Spanish sucks and there is no reason to make us take high levels of foreign language. this prof made it bearable.,0
"Best teacher I've ever had, and I've had quite a few! He knew I was having problems that year, and he spent extra time helping me and some other students after lab to make sure we understood what was going on in class.",1
"Knoop was difficult at best.  If you have a difficult time getting long with her it will be reflected in your grades.  She will even admit if she doesn't like you she's harder on you.  Following along in class is difficult, expect to run off topic at least three times a class. Her knowledge of the industry is dated at best.",0
"Hard to follow.  Really nice person, but jumps around a lot.  Not great at explaining things.",0
"Tends to spend a lot of time of things that aren't going to be on the exam or may not come up again, goes off on little tangents sometimes. He cares a lot about what he's teaching but sometimes he's not quite able to get it across. He grades tough on the exams, but if you have good knowledge of the material and you didn't just skim you'll be fine",1
"By far my favorite professor at UMD. Took Death Penalty with him, overall a super eye-opening class and I learned a lot. Doesn't penalize you for not going to class, but is more likely to tease you about not showing up. I also had him for Quantitative Research Methods & Analysis and he was always available for office hours & one on one help.",1
"He is a really good teacher, but sometimes the three hour class can get a little long, but I would recommend him.  He gives study guides to the tests which are really helpful.",1
"Save yourself & don't do it. The first time he said, ""I forgot how to do this, let me look it up..."" I stopped goes to class, as did everyone else. Boring, extremely hard tests. Read high school calc notes if possible, less confusing that him.",0
"Very kind and very understanding. Really wants all his students to succeed and get an A, as long as you keep up with the work you'll do well. Grades more so on completion than accuracy",1
"Very good guy but it's difficult since CMPE-160 is just by nature a tough class. He really cares about his students doing well, and clearly knows what he is talking about. Very tough grader though, seemingly minor things will noticeably cost you on quizzes and tests (i.e. not labeling the select pins on a multiplexer). Great professor overall.",1
"Pam is a pretty good teacher. Her class is easy, and assignment due dates are always clear and reasonable. The only bad thing about the class is that she talks WAY too much! I often find myself falling asleep! Other than that, I would recommend taking her for ED 320 :)",1
best professor i've ever had. makes everything interesting and fun.,1
very helpful and understanding. to the point and uses the board to show us work instead of only using the book.,1
"Dr. Ranft is by far the least caring professor I have ever taken. He didn't show up for half of the semester and when he did, he gave incorrect, confusing examples and went on irrelevant rants. He purposely added confusing wording to questions and was not fair in hearing students' concerns. You'll never get him to respond to an email either.",0
pire prof que j'ai eu. rend le cours très difficile volontairement. Évitez ce prof.,0
"Dr. MS is charismatic, approachable and a fantastic lecturer. I went to his office hours once and I completely regret not going more often. He is the nicest man you will ever meet and his exams are fair. If you ever have the chance to have him as your professor, take him before the seats fill up!",1
"Ive enjoyed having him as my prof. Im taking him summer course, so its a bit more tough because you have to learn the same amount in a shorter amount of time. I would advise you to not take math courses during summer. He put in effort to help you understand. He told lots of stories from when he was younger which were pretty entertaining lol",1
"No enough words to express how amazing this man is. He is incredible. I have taken 4 classes with him & planning to take the 5th. He will assign books to read, but is very CLEAR about what he wants in his exams, which are usually a midterm and a final only. One term paper. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. His Classes fill out QUICKLY, register as soon as you can!",1
"Prof. Barkley is great!  His lectures are long but the powerpoints cover EXACTLY what is on the test.  Labs are super easy. Uses models to learn all parts of the body. (I took pics on my phone to help study at home).  If  you are not getting the material and ask,he will do a group study session  to help but you MUST participate! EASY A if  youTRY!!",1
"Dr. Nevil's class is always entertaining! You will definitely have fun in this class! She's very strict with grading and deadlines, but very easy to talk to, and very helpful!",1
"She is by far the most rude professor I've ever had when responding to questions and never answers the student properly, instead just telling them to read the textbook again. The content of the final assignment was entirely around coding in R when the there has been literally no content covering R until that point. An absolute embarrassment.",0
"Doctor Guerriero is a compassionate teacher that strives to be an advocate for those with special needs. She presents students with concise course expectations and provides all of the information necessary for assessments.  In addition, she is a fair grader and successfully fulfills her role in ensuring students can comprehend the class content.",1
"Need to read for every class, sometimes there are short quizzes. She tells you what exactly will be on the midterm and final. Attendance and participation are both graded. Not a hard grader. Lectures are a little hard to stay focused on because they take up most of the class time. Not too hard, not too easy.",1
Professor Lawson is one of my favorite professor makes the class easy to understand..,1
"Mike has very long lectures, it seems like they drag on forever, but if you pay attention you will be okay! There isn't homework except for blackboard quizzes about once a week maybe twice. Make sure you study for the exams, look over powerpoints, he puts all the notes on blackboard!",1
"Most of your grade is based on the group project you do. You do consulting work with a company to create training programs for humanitarian work. The other material includes case write-ups, quizzes, and reflections.",1
"Coop was a cool guy, but he was an awful teacher.  I often left class confused and didn't understand and went to office hours but his tests were 2600still hard,  but gives generous curves because of the low averages.  I did very well in calc in high school but his class was terribly hard & doesn't prep you for the final at all.",0
No Comments,0
pretty terrible,0
Hali was by far the best professor I've ever had. She cares about her students and you can tell she really enjoys what she's teaching! If you ever have a chance to take a class of hers I would highly recommend,1
"Dr. Bonaccorsi is knowledgeable about the Chemistry she is lecturing on, but her explanations aren't always well received by the class, in fact, I would say my recitation leader did a better job at explaining some topics. Furthermore, her accent may be an acquired taste for some, but give it a week and you will get used to it.",1
alot of reading early on but using summary's will get you thorough discussions. Come to class and you will pass the class,1
Ms. McClung is a unique teacher. She does not force you to do your research! However she guides you to course material to gain important aspect of her author you choose to research and write about. She know the main focus before hand and will listen to all students perspectives with respect to discussion times. Don't be shy to share your opinion.,1
"Nice guy.  Knows his stuff, loves his job.  The entire class is open to discussion.  Not afraid to give you his OPION.  Will do anything for his students.  Always having some type of midlife crisis.  Never takes responsibilities for his failures.  I wish he was more disciplined, has a brilliant mind.",1
I took Franciscan Spirituality with Br. Daniel Maria and this class was one of my favorite courses out of the 50+ credits of theology I have taken. He is passionate about the subject and his class is engaging. His course gave me a deeper love and understanding of an authentic Franciscan spirituality and challenged me to live this out.,1
She is the best Biology teacher I ever had.  You study and you will pass.  I learned so much in her class.  Ms. Smith is always available for questions.    I wish she taught Bio 252-254!!!,1
"I loved this class and the teacher! The material was great, but going to the class was boring. The professor and the textbook made the class! I learned so much and always laughed during her classes.",1
"pretty good, cool guy",1
"GREAT PROF! love the way he runs class, i am learning SO much about the education field! Fairly easy, go to class and your good to go! He is a teacher so teaching about teaching comes easy to him! great guy! very attached.",1
Every class was spent going over the previous class homework which took away time from the lesson.  No work sheets giving which I would have liked.  Overall she worked with you if you had problems.,0
"Kristi cares about her students, and she is very passionate about what she teaches. She keeps class interesting. She creates a very safe and comfortable environment for students that have anxiety about public speaking. Loved her so much I took another class with her.",1
"Mrs. Moseley is a great teacher! As long as you come to class and put some work into it, you'll come out with a good grade. She gives short quizzes everyday that are easy as long as you read the night before and she gives out bonus points. Make sure on essays to go to tutors, that will help save your grade!!!",1
"Profe is awesome.  She is extremely helpful and understanding and really wants her students to learn something, not just earn a grade. Be prepared to get called out and stay on top of the online homework or you will struggle. I plan on taking any more Spanish classes I need w/ Professor Logue, no doubt.",1
Hes a great teacher and the study groups are super helpful but hes strict about texting in class and about being there for tests... if you arent there for a test day you dont get to make it up,1
"She gives you the opportunity to complete most of your papers during class time so you can ask her questions. She gives excellent feedback when you ask her questions and on your rough drafts. She gives you clear instructions, follow them and you will get an A!",1
"Overall, I enjoyed this course. It was interesting and relevant to my field of focus. Dr. Gilbert was helpful for me with responding to emails fast whenever I had questions for him and was always willing to help. The only big critique I have is his lack of uploading grades on Blackboard to allow me to see my progress throughout the course.",1
"She is more of an English teacher than she is music. If you occasionally mistype something, I would not suggest this teacher. I tried reaching out but she rarely responded. When she did, she always had an attitude.",0
I hated this class when I first started it. The class isnt structured and he's all over the place. I realized later that he really just wants us to become interested in the subject. He is very knowledgeable and I appreciated the class after it ended. I would take another class with him.,1
"adult student class. come to participate and you will learn. sit on your hands you will complain, its that simple with this guy. I hope they give him another class, I'd take it.",1
"the field trips were excellent, However i think he is becoming senile and forgets what he said and expects you to remember it for him and the test. Very critical of any work you do which is horrible. Good on field trips, horrible in grading",1
Long and repetitive lectures. Also won't answer questions about final paper through writing and pushes phone conferences. Would not recommend.,0
"Good class, she's flexible and willing to work within your style.  She gives some instruction, but mainly lets you work through problems.  You never know what your grade is, though.",1
"Dr. Heilman is the best professor I have ever had. Her lectures are heavy, but extremely interesting and captivating. She is SO smart and very understanding about late assignments. Literally the nicest and kindest prof I've had, the U of A is so lucky to have her.",1
She takes forever to grade your essays and work. does not respond to emails in a timely manner. I would not recommend her class at all.,0
One of the best teachers at UT. I had professor Hug for both anatomy and physiology and microbiology. She knows how to teach the classes and explains everything in detail. Her exams may be a little challenging but if you study for her exams a week in advance you will do fine. Study the notes! Go to every lecture even though it is not mandatory.,1
"He is the ""BEST"" professor!",1
"I'm not one to give such a poor review, but this is truly the worst class I've ever taken. He doesn't tell you how to do well, games are often unclear, way too much reading. I was so excited to take an untraditional class, but the stress and confusion was overwhelming. Don't recommend if you need structure, reasonable class load, or applicability",0
Dr. Boden's intro to field methods class is HARD. He is an extremely tough grader. He expects your reports to be like those of a professional. Having said that you will learn a TON in this class. The level of knowledge you will get from this 260 class is superior to UNR's 260 class. Just be ready to spend 12 hours on a report and  to get a C on it.,1
Adjunct Professor Nuneville is very kind and always has interesting lessons planned; some lessons even involve presentations from professionals in the law enforcement field including police detectives and a magistrate! She always makes sure you understand the materials and that they're presented in a clear and attention-grabbing way.,1
Very tedious work and you have to pay to take the final and midterm and to have someone watch you. Not flexible about deadlines either. She's rude through email as well.,0
"She's really sassy sometimes, but not in a funny way. She seems to clearly have students that she prefers and kind of comes across as fake caring.",0
"Prof. Laucella is so kind. She's an easy grader, cares about her students, and is just an overall good person. Her class is really easy, just a waste of time. Try to take online if you can. We used the textbook but it's really not necessary. You can get away with not buying it.",1
I loved this class and prof!! he cracks jokes every 30 seconds and makes his lectures fun even though they contain a lot of information. The quizzes are super easy and follow along with the slides!! his 3 tests are pretty hard so STUDY and make flashcards for extra credit. if you don't study you probs won't pass the test. but overall easy A!!,1
"hands down BEST MATH TEACHER EVER! She is so awesome at explaining math and very detail on steps. She makes sure the whole class understands the formula, and she hands out extra credit, which is awesome !",1
"Lectures are interesting and he can be pretty funny, so if you need to fulfill the STS requirement, this is definitely a good class for it.  Just don't use your phone during class, he gets really irritated by that.",1
It's very clear on what she wants you to do. Papers are back to back. Also she will not grade any of the papers on time.,0
Does not let you make up missed homework everything online and she doesnt clearly go over everything such as tenses,0
Perez rocks. His class can be a little confusing at times but if you get clarity with him and visit him during office hours you will get an A. The paper you write will be a semester long process but visiting him and working on it will pay off in the long run.,1
Griffin is a great professor with a great passion for education. She was very accessible outside of class and made the work for the class very clear. She is also very picky and grades things a little harshly and then doesn't explain why. Overall a good professor though.,1
"She is an awesome teacher. 2 tests, 2 debates, and a paper. I got A's on all my tests and 100% on the debates. The test are easy and multiple choice and the debates are easy. I recommend taking her. Easy A and she is super nice!",1
"Professor Doubleday has an enthusiasm that is contagious when it comes to the Russian language, making class enjoyable. You definitely will need to do the homework and put in the work, but it's worth it. She is very accessible outside of class and wants her students to succeed.",1
"Smith makes clear from the beginning his classes are designed to resemble the style of law schools: Grades and materials reflect as much. Though you will have to pay for a pack back (mock Canvas) program, it helps aid the discussion and topics of the class. Exams are hard if you don't read but the material covered is foundational to 104 series",1
Cutest 80 year old man ever. He is really nice too and cares about you. His class is really pointless though.. he kind of just reads through the slides or book and no one listens. Pretty easy but boring.,1
"Truly great professor who cares about his students beyond academia. His course is rigorous, but he will teach you so many things you will actually need to know as a communications professional. Generous with assignment ""re-writes"", and a fair grader, but sometimes he will give examples of things to do, and then mark you down for doing them.",1
"You have to go to lecture, and if you don't, you won't be able to catch up easily. The slides are unorganized, and she throws out too much information without enough time to copy it down// nothing makes sense. She doesn't clarify what she means or elaborate on points either.",1
"He is awesome! The class is so interesting and you learn a ton! The class discussions are so fun, people will linger after class....take his class, but be prepard to work!",1
"Dr. Andertons class is super easy if you know computer basics. Homework is heavy but predictable, as its all based in the simulation software. Monday due dates were nice, and assignments could be completed in an hour or two. She offers weekly virtual class meetings (non-mandatory) to cover the material, but prepare to use the online book.",1
Amazing. very sweet and super caring if you ever need an extension. class is super easy and fun. but also very interesting and attention drawing,1
"Very poor instructor. Classes consisted of confusing slides and even more confusing explanations. She seemed very disinterested in the material covered. If you read the books and decipher the slides, you'll pass.",0
"Great professor, he takes the time to make sure his section understands, and if you ask a question, he will come to the next class with a solid example to help you understand.",1
"Great Professor, a tough grader but fair. He gives great lectures, is very helpful, and provides many interesting insights. His classes are hard but certainly not impossible. Just do the reading, participate a little, and ask questions. I will say that I probably would have not enjoyed his class as much if I was not liberal.",1
"Hands down the best class I've taken this semester. I thought it would be hard to wake up for a 9 am class, but it was easy when it was his class. The ""textbook"" he has you get, he tells you to get off Amazon for super cheap (there is also a free pdf version online). Final is 50% research paper and 50% multiple choice. I definitely recommend!",1
"A literal genius. You will learn a lot in this class. You will also spend a lot of time reading and doing graded work. Homeworks can be difficult, but if you understand them you can do relatively well on the tests. VERY LONG TESTS. Multiple parts with short answer, graphs, essays, and MC questions. Good guy, and very inspiring. But be ready to work",1
"AMAZING professor. I took this class online and she still managed to keep the class interesting. She is extremely knowledgeable, kind, and a very fair marker. She does not post any lecture notes so attendance to lectures/watching the lecture videos is important. If you have the opportunity to take a class with her, do it, she is fantastic.",1
He is not helpful at all,0
"Most boring class I've ever had. Most sociology professors already assume that you don't care about the material, not L.A. She actually pretends to care about it, and forces people to attend by doing in-class, pop-quizzes for marks. The class itself is meaningless, as it is all overlap, and she teaches it like ppl care.",1
"He likes to extend class periods as much as possible. He is a very tough grader on homeworks and quizzes. His grading is not very clear and is entirely graded on his judgement. He was much more helpful outside of class. If you're struggling in class, go to the MaRC and it should help.",1
I decide to take Stats with professor because she had really good rating.... her teaching skills are awful and always has typo in her lecture notes. Her homework is useless when it comes it studying so much work for nothing....,0
"Dr. Ferriera was a great English Teacher, especially for a student just returning to college after a four year break. I loved her class, and I would definitely take it again. She is very helpful, if you have a question, ask it! She is very enthused about her subject as well. If you study and do your homework, this class goes by very smoothly! ",1
"Doctor Weiner is a very tough teacher to have for such a tough class. More than half of my class dropped the class before it even hit half the semester. I had a huge issue with him and that's why I dropped. He screamed at me in front of the whole class and didn't even let me explain what happened. After that, he constantly brought it up.",0
"I love Sam! I want to do cognitive science because of this class, and he has been such a caring adviser through the process. He's so funny, sweet, and his lectures are so interesting. Some people don't like how he doesn't have slides but honestly just get over it haha and calm down because it's amazing and makes you think like never before.",1
"DONT TAKE HER, SHE IS NOT EASY AT ALL, AND NOT HELPFUL, SHE DONT EVEN HAVE OFFICE HOURS TO EXPLAIN THE MATERIAL OK. RUN 4 UR GRADE she is boring, not fair with grading, and the exams are tricky as hell. basically you got to study on your own cuz wateva she says in class is not helpful at all",0
"He is a great lecturer, really knows his stuff, and is super helpful. ",1
"Honestly such a nice teacher who seems really engaged and interested in what she is teaching. If you're not a history major and are only taking this class as a general education requirement, don't take it. She expects a lot, the lectures are heavy in material, and there is A LOT of homework.",1
"Initially I was scared to take Professor Wolf because of all the reviews I read but she was NOTHING like how these reviews perceive her. She is so sweet. She makes class interesting by adding in her own experiences as well! Weekly reading quizzes, two exams and a short paper. She pretty much gives you the answers to exams/reading quizzes in lecture",1
"His classes were pretty dull, and he doesn't always touch everything that's on the test. If you don't have a book for this class, you would defiantly fail. Also, he likes to blame a lot of the bad grades he gets on his students. It's like he can't ever find fault in himself.",0
"Jana is amazing. If you are passionate about SW, you will love her. She is kind, attentive, personable, and helpful! She really knows what she is doing. She has been an adviser, teacher, and professional. Lots to learn from this woman and she will help you succeed if you work with her.",1
He is easygoing and will answer whatever questions you have. He often shows multiple ways to solve problems and ensure that students understand before continuing. Grades are based on online quizzes that are easy and chapter tests that are slightly harder.,1
"The man worked in TV news for over 30 years and knows his stuff very well.  Very clear and precise. He will make you work very hard, but you will be better off for it. IE in his TV News 1 class, by the 3rd week we were writing, shooting and editing our very own news packages. Rick is a great professor.",1
"Dr. Kosnik is terrific! The class was fun and interesting. 2 tests, a final exam, and 2 concert reviews that everyone got A's on. I never cracked the textbook, and I got A's on all the tests. The lectures covered everything we would have read. Also, Dr. Kosnik is an amazing pianist, and he does demonstrations on the piano during class. Great class!",1
"She is the best teacher I ever had. Very funny and easy too. HWs is very little, and no need to write much. I love her class!",1
"Excellent Professor! He's incredibly laid back and down-to-earth with his students and never fails to make us laugh. We discuss compelling issues and debates in class which are always current and interesting. Class is probably one of the easiest English classes ever, I got an A on every essay I've written! Highly recommend him!",1
Professor Hensley you can tell is very passionate about what he does and he is very knowledgable when it comes to business. This class was very easy online and required almost no studying for quizzes and exams. A couple group projects that you have to work on outside of class but overall an easy A.,1
First time teaching Photoshop CIS120. Used the book extensively.  Unsure of  how-to stuff.  He moved really fast and tried to please all the Photoshop pros in class instead of teaching an intro class.   I didn't learn much except for the book. Homework was fun so I think he will get  better with experience.,0
"An insightful class that changed my perspective on the world. Take good notes outside of what is on handouts and on lecture slides, such as examples he gives, and you are likely to succeed. Study guides reflect the exact material that is on the test. Study that and you will be fine. Prof. Goldiner is inspirational & truly a gem of a teacher.",1
"He is a really good professor. He teaches the basic skills needed based on the section and all those skills are easily used on the exams/quizzes. If you have any questions, ask. Overall he is a really good professor that made the class interesting. Ask questions or get help if needed. Pay attention, and do your homework to easily pass.",1
"She is a strict grader, though she does compensate by raising the grades on the exams so that the student with highest original score ends up with a 95 or 97. There is a lot of homework. She is very willing to help students if they are in trouble or don't understand something. Is a big fan of rubrics in grading to try to be unbiased.",1
Angie is the best prof at X! She is so energetic and loves being in class. One of my biggest role models ,1
"Lots of reading, but she tries to narrow it down to the key passages.  Primary texts and two textbooks.  Jacki also provides reading guides which are helpful in picking out key topics.",1
"He's a really nice, generous and helpful guy. Makes the occasional joke in class. Goes through material somewhat quickly and isn't always clear in answering questions. Review session before final hurt more than it helped. Overall a good class and a great guy.",1
"Seeing other reviews that this professor is mean/rude; VERY TRUE! First time dealing with a prof like him, & its very disappointing. Guy sure does love the course & the course is loaded w work, but couldnt care less if you swim or sink. ENC1101 was a breeze for me, this class & teacher was just a nightmare.",0
"Taking Professor Gonzalez's class was the highlight of my semester. I felt like he was the only professor who actually cared about helping his students comprehend the material. He is always available, especially in the English Center, to help students with any difficulties they may have regarding the class. You have to try really hard to not pass.",1
I would not recommend taking this class unless you are very interested in linguistics. There are no slides and lecture can be repetitive and dull. Attend class because your best bet is to repeat Sam verbatim on exams or you will probably be marked off.,0
Syllabus is very clear on what is due and when. He lists what he is grading you on in each assignment. Happy to answer any questions you have. Organized and straight forward. This class was very basic and easy to pass. Just show up and do the homework on time.,1
Do not take his class! You will regret it. ,0
"If you know Algebra it is going to be easy and lots of fun. If it is your first time, you will work really hard. Lots of homework and hard work. But at the end of the semester, you'll notice all you have learned and it will be rewarding. Alice is always available to help you with any problem or question.",1
Do the weekly homework assignments there is two every week grades for completion. quizzes online. 5 exams & final but don't freak out. lectures can be boring but he is understanding lets you turn in work late. I did my homework during lectures. Took his lab was easy do the lab in group and just a project & trip at the end. drops lowest exam & hw.,1
He has such a monotone voice and i tired to stay interest in the subject but listening to him puts me to sleep. He does crack jokes on a occasions. Gives you a chance to do extra credit. if you miss more then 7 classes your grade drops to by 12%. i wouldn't recommend taking him,0
"Hands down the worst professor at ISU. He makes you feel beyond stupid and isn't afraid to tell you how bad you are at writing. He thinks that he is better than his students just because he has been teaching for so long. He will tell you that he ""believe in you"" when in reality he could care less if you do well in the class or not. AVOID HIM!!!!",0
Professor is a great reference. She is very knowledgable and is always available to help. She was a tough grader but gave good feedback.,1
Dr. V is such a positive role model whom I myself look up too amongst many more other students. I have never met such a caring understanding loving person let alone a professor like Dr. V. I LOVE how she makes a person feel so comfortable and loved. I can only speak for myself and from my experience with Dr.V. I would definitely recommend her.,1
"Have her for Psy 271. she is flipping the classroom this semester so we play games every time. not helpful at all. refuses to answer questions in class. tests are hard and very confusing. 50 question hw assignment every week, same thing every week.",0
He is tall and handsome. That is all.,1
This was a good class and she makes it where you learn a lot. She talks a lot but it's always more conversational and interesting about the topic. She very sassy and funny but wants to see you do well. Many random quizzez once a week and be sure to read because the on the tests you write in your own words,1
"She is so well known for her love of the LGBTQ+ community that even people in Africa have heard of: ""The Great STINNETTE"". Her ability to keep up with the times, and her academic professionalism (the way she teaches by using YouTube videos is inspiring) keeps me wondering how the world could deserve someone as dedicated as her. Chirp Chirp, Torian!",0
Took Professor Marlowe two semesters. She's a great professor! Lectures are clear and she gives a study guide for the exams. Very helpful! Definitely would take her class again,1
"If you are someone who runs late sometimes like I am, don't take this class. Quizzes on readings were not hard but given in the first minute of class - if you miss it, you were ""absent"" and get a 0/100 for the day (with only 3 allowed per semester). Some extra credit offered by writing papers. Tests are all essay and definition and are not easy.",1
The best of the best Mathematics prof. Enough said.,1
Be careful of this emotionally manipulative person.,1
Harsh grader and doesn't provide rubrics. You never know what he is looking for. Claims that you don't need prior coding experience but still assigns multiple coding assignments without teaching how to code. I also went to his office hours once because my computer wouldn't run program. He couldn't even recommend a specific computer to replace it.,0
"One of the most intelligent professors I've ever had, however, I would not recommend taking him. He plays favorites and if you are not one of them, expect a final grade that doesn't  match your work. Does not offer any help and expects you to accept his interpretations as truth- anything else is incorrect. Don't take him if you can help it.",0
"He IS helpful and nice, although he doesn't look like!",1
I highly recommend taking Dr. Reese's online course. He gives you a very clear syllabus with all the dates on it of when everything will be due and all assignments are due on the same dates every week. A few quizzes here and there and one paper. He's also very good at getting back to you when you need to contact him.,1
"By far one of the best professors i have ever taken at FIU. Lectures were 3 hours long but by far the most entertaining 3 hours ever, mind you i have a short attention span. this professor really cares about her students and i would definitely take her again hands down. 4 group projects that require lots of work and 3 exams but all well worth it!",1
"Cool guy and super understanding. Does not stand over everyone as they take the tests, so they don't panic he just sits and reads. I personally hate short answer questions but love him. He expects you to do your readings. Tests are 5 question short answer format. APA research report with statistics and citing your sources (huge part of your grade).",1
"She also made me change my major! she's ridiculous. We spend the whole class talking about what we are going to be ""talking"" about but we never actually cover again. Tests are ridiculous. On her test i got a question wrong because she claimed an animal cell has a cell wall! completely has no control over english!",0
"Patrick Cooper's lectures are extremely hard to understand. He spends the majority of the time standing in from of the board blocking his work. He lost three of my quizzes, and our average was very, very low. I have spent the entirety of the semester teaching myself the material.  STAY AWAY.",0
I took this class for my major. It was my writing intensive course. The papers she makes you do are not long at all 500-1000 words due once a week. She is VERY particular about the writing style and that you follow it to a T. I found that if you email her your paper before it is due she will tell you what corrections to make for better grade,1
"It is easy to get responses from her. She cares about her students. If you listen to her lectures carefully, you could understand. She sticks with the syllabus, she grades holistically on papers. There are no exams or midterms. She offers advice about the tutors. Being present and participate, you'll pass. I recommend her for Writing I.",1
"Unrealistic expectations for intermediate German. Does not teach, just assigns an obscene amount of weekly homework that does not help on tests (or learning for that matter). Class focuses on diagramming sentences instead of learning to speak and read German. She is out to get everyone. Hated it. Withdrew. Choose a different language.",0
I HIGHLY recommend Professor Wood for your communications course! Shes such a great teacher and makes notes on your outline and most of the time lets you revise it. Shes also very understanding with the online transition and how WiFi is unpredictable. You just have to communicate and do the assignments and youll pass!,1
He was one of the best professors I have ever had.  He is very straight forward and doesn't ask for much from the students.  His tests are MC and if you know the notes you will make an A on the tests.,1
"This is my second semester with Dr. Hug and I cannot recommend her enough. She is easily the best professor I have ever had. She gets you interested in the subject, presents material well, and is very helpful if you go to her. She is not only an amazing and hilarious person, but exceptionally knowledgable and an overall amazing professor!",1
Professor Chang is a great professor. He is very well-prepared and well-organized. He teaches and explains the materials very well to make hard topics become easy to understand. He does an excellent job on review main points before the tests and final exam. That helps students a lot. Thank you! I am looking forward to take more classes with him.,1
I really enjoyed this class and I think she is very knowledgeable and excited to teach. ,1
One of the worst at NCC Nursing. Her class averages are consistently the lowest by alot(and she doesn't care). She is constantly unprepared for class. Constantly gives work at the last minute. Gives tons of worthless busy work. Be prepared to teach yourself the material. She uses lab for everything but lab activities. Stay away from her!!!,0
"The class & material itself was cool, she's very understanding when it comes to grading speeches (if you're too shy or quiet, she won't fail you). I think the only thing that allowed me to pass her class was that I'm a good speaker. She grades hard in other aspects (like material and quality of your speech). Very strict & uptight.",1
The practice test is literally the actually test reworded. Tests are pretty easy even although she makes her own. Lectures are interesting because she applies the material well. Shes really passionate about the class,1
"Lots of people like him because he is funny, but frankly I think he is just a lazy drunk, didn't grade any hw till the very end, never saw the correct answers so know I got things wrong, no way to know why or how to fix.",0
"This was an amazing class. Taking notes is essential, but Mr. Wells makes it easy and interesting to pay attention to lectures.",1
"Not really easy, but interesting so its easy to understand.  Seems like this will be useful in the real world.  He is very understanding, and loves to answer questions.  Kind of cute for an older guy.",1
"Prof. Scaltriti was honestly THE best Professor I have ever had. He is a native speaker with a sexy accent, so that made class more enjoyable. On the plus side, he is very handsome and that was a good motivation to study Italian. I hope I will have him next year! He is THE man!",1
Dr. Mark is the worst professor I have ever had. She grades based on her personal feelings towards you and provides no clarification. There's a group assignment nearly every week. Any positive review on here is either written by herself or a student that she really likes somehow. She gives the most boring videos to watch and it's all horrible.,0
Professor Quinlan is incredible. You can tell he really cares about how his students are going and he does his best to help you succeed. I had my first class with him during the semester that we first got a stay at home order for Covid and he made the transition to online so easy for us. I'm in his class again now.,1
"He is hilariously arrogant. Seems difficult, but turns out not to be.",1
Mark basically sets a teaching benchmark for other professors in CS. His ability to deliver a lot of material and keep the class interested in every lecture is outstanding.,1
"So this professor wasnt necessarily helpful, he did not provide good feedback at all and can be very unfair. The only thing I liked about his class was lecture. Everything else was a disaster. Prepare to be disappointed.",0
"Dr. Amid is really good at teaching difficult concepts and keeps class fun/engaged. I actually felt sad when his classes for week were done. You look forward to his class. Helps struggling students, shows respect, keeps explaining if he has to. Best! of all, his humility/friendliness towards students makes him an amazing and respected prof.",1
Professor Schlortt is an excellent professor and you will learn a lot about history in his class. He goes a bit tougher and expects a lot but ultimately thats a very good thing as he prepares students for upper level classes very well! Great professor and funny lectures with a lot of knowledge in them! Take if you like history!!,1
"She is the worst prof I've ever had. If you ask her a question, all she ever replies with is ""read the textbook"" which is also written very poorly. The Mobius quizzes are the literal definition of torture. It is timed 1h and you won't know how many questions there are (involves a lot of calculations as well). I don't understand why she is a prof.",0
"This was an on line class. The professor was amazing,helpful, insightful, encouraging. The course along wit the text chosen was a perfect combination. This is by my favorite psychology course. Loved it. Highly recommend the Professor.",1
"I am very glad to have this professor, he always encourages you to learn more. Although his exam is a little bit difficult and heavy, you will professionally learn marketing.",1
She is very helpful and super super understanding. Very smart with a WIDE RANGE of most-of-the-time deep and confusing vocab- but that's okay. Sometimes I get lost in class and the lecture goes over my head because it's too detailed and lecture-heavy.,1
"Very tough grader.  If you're not an English major, but want to take this course, you should not take it with him. That said, in spite of the B or B- I will take from this class, I would take it again if I could. I love Nelson's lectures and had the best time at his house when he had our class over for refreshments and gave us Japanese Maple seeds.",1
He is a good prof He double checks each point just to make sure everyone gets it,1
"I'm in professor Hartman's math class and all we do is get on the computer, on this website call Aleks and do work on there. There is so interaction with the class, no blackboard work or powerpoint and no text book. Please do not take this professor class you will be learn nothing at all.",0
"Ummm. He is a really nice guy, but not a good teacher at all. He never writes anything down or explains anything to you. He reads the book in class and expects you to attain information just by reading. Never responds to emails, and he lost my homework (he eventually found it but it was still frustrating). All in all: good person, bad teacher.",0
David is one of the best professors I have had at Iowa. He truly cares about teaching his students how to be successful in the business world. He doesnt succumb to the political correct safe space speech many teachers unfortunately have adopted. Great guy that knows business. Take his class but be ready to engage or you will not enjoy it.,1
"Susan Kelly asks for you to do a lot of work, but the payoff is completely worth it.  I've never had a teacher seem are more about her students and actually enthusiastic about what she is teaching! If you want to be in the media field you need to this class with Susan Kelly!",1
"Dudrick is an awesome human being whom every student should want to take a class with. His class is fun and energetic, and I actually look forward to going. He isn't the easiest grader but so far its been pretty fair. Dudrick is the man.",1
Travis is an easy going guy. He loves to teach and it shows. Attendance is mandatory but homework can be turned in all the way up to the last day of class. He gives a study guide that is almost identical to the test. (Ex: y4x on sample and y6x on actual test). Definitely take if you can. LOVE HIM.,1
"I love McMillen he is a fantastic choice for Marketng. You will not regret it! He knows what he's talking about, and makes class fun and engaging.",1
"Mr. Hebert is an awesome instructor, my course was an online course however he made himself available for you and was always able to be contacted by email. He responded promptly and gave you a solid answer. He follows the textbook and really presents material to make you think. TAKE A CLASS FROM HIM IF YOU REALLY WANT TO LEARN ABOUT FIRE TECH.",1
Dr. Nikkel is the best. No one ever has any problems with him in my class. He only asks that you get the basic understanding of the material and is understanding when you write your papers.,1
"I really liked Ethan. A lot of people dont, he just takes some getting used to. pretty young & incredibly extra but its nice to have a professor like that. gave like 100 extra credit assignments, theres no reason anyone shouldnt have an A. Hes pretty new so still working on finding a teaching style that works for him. cares about his student A LOT",1
Great professor! Very clear grading criteria and tests/quizzes were right from the notes and textbook. Interesting material and class! Highly recommend.,1
"AMAZING WOMAN! One of the greatest people I have met throughout my life. If you meet her, you won't forget her. She's so helpful and so kind. And she loves to have fun! :)",1
I thought he was a great teacher. I'm not sure if he's still around though. I'd take a class w him again for sure! The first text I got a D and ended that class w an A! You learn some abstract things & he makes it easy to understand. He had study groups w him available for us to attend--he even bought us pizza and drinks at Woodstock b4 the final!,1
Prof Wheeler is brilliant! She loves what she teaches and you can really tell. There is a lot of readings but you can still do well if you skim and pay attention to her lectures. She is also very accessible outside of class and I've had so many wonderful conversations with her. She really levels with her students and wants them to succeed,1
"Nice guy, open to meet with you after class to go over your assignments. A little boring and monotone voice, but he tries his best considering the dry material A lot of group activities Marks hard",1
"*online class* This class shouldn't be taken online. Her notes were hard to understand, any feedback from her is non-existent. Self-taught class.",0
Very interested in correcting grammer and writing style and skills.Marks off for everything and she expects perfection even though she does not live up to her own standards.If you can take the class with another teacher I would do so.Good luck!,0
He díd a great job.  I really learned a lot in his course.,1
"Long, less than exciting lectures, but gets the job done. Very willing to help with homework and labs. Makes some of the toughest material pretty easy to comprehend. Reasonable and straight forward with expectations.",1
"Took this course as a birdcourse but it was NOT because of the prof. The course content was SO easy but the exams and MARKING was UNFAIR. I think Natalie would be a better prof if this wasn't an online course, she was helpful during the ""field trip"" but was so hard to reach through email. The quizzes, test, and field trip really boost ur mark tho!",0
I had her for two subjects which are Advanced Pharmacology and Advanced Pathophysiology. She is wonderful very receptive and gives excellent feedback. She is approachable and you will feel her dedication in her work. I wish I can have her in all my classes. I highly recommend her!,1
Really enjoyed his online intro to networking class. Has very good video lectures. There were a lot of labs but I felt everything was fair and I learned what I needed to.,1
"Dr. Tavss is one of  the most inspirational people that I have ever come across. His lectures have helped me develop into the person I am today. After taking this class, however, I feel as though I will never experience the sense of ecstasy and glee that I felt when I heard Edward Jacob Tavss speak. Dr. Tavss has become a lifelong mentor and friend",1
"Dr. Proga was kind, really passionate about astronomy, wanted students to enjoy learning, and didn't want to make the class stressful. He made funny jokes once in a while and liked to talk to the class conversationally. Easy class since he gives you the exam questions beforehand.",1
"Marna is a recent graduate student who is amazing at not only what she does but how she teaches. Going into drawing I had hardly any experience but Marna did not care and just wanted to see my improvement and not necessailry if I am the best drawer in the world. If you ask specifically what you need help with, she will help you, just be specific. ",1
This class was a breath of fresh air for a summer course.  Nice way to wind down the year.,1
"I can easily say that Ms. Gordon is the best math teacher I have ever had the pleasure of learning from! I first had her in remedial MATH 0306 & have signed up for her with every class leading up to College Algebra (where I am currently). I recommend her to everyone! She is smart, kind, easy to understand, and will keep you entertained!",1
"Caeli is certainly one of the best IT instructors at Madison College. She is always willing to help students and strive to help them be better programmers and understand the problem and solution. She always treats students with respect and is very supportive. Also, her knowledge and skills are top-rated. Highly recommend her classes.",1
"Dr. Oks was a really nice guy. If you went to his office hours he was very easy to talk to and was very willing to help. However, in class, he never explained anything very well and would only flash typed examples of physics problems on an overhead and then removed it promptly. Only survived by using old tests. Never learned a thing.",0
"Will is an awesome professor ... you learn a lot from his class, but he doesn't demand much.  Incredibly laid back, and very dedicated for an adjunct.  Rock on, Will.",1
"He is a phenomenal professor. But this is not a class where you can slack and still get a good grade. There is a lot of reading, but if you make good notes for every reading assignment then studying for the test is not hard. I love his style of teaching, and he does help you with your grade if he sees your constant effort.",1
"Great prof. His 'wise cracking gran-dad' personality is a bit too silly sometimes, but he cares about his lessons and is always willing to answer questions very articulately without going off track. The text is crucial, and so is really understanding the material. Your obviously not tested on facts, but on how well you understand the concepts.",1
"Awful professor. Only talks politics in a physics class. Quiz after every class, most of which are completely unrelated to physics. Big waste of tuition money.",0
If your education and your grade is important to you also if you are new to chemistry then then AVOID this professor AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!!!!,0
"Not a good prof.  Materials she teaches in class have nothing to do with Management Info Systems.  You will learn nothing in her class.  She will give you directions on how she wants assignments done, then she will still punish you anyway regardless.  Very unnecessarily cruel and evil prof.  Shame.",0
"Sullivan is a great professor to learn from. He has had first hand experience in the field, and can provide great insight on his lectures. Sullivan is a great teacher. ",1
Dr. Guerriero is a sweetheart! Her class is all lecture/powerpoint. We had 4/5 main projects which were extremely easy. Let's face it - this is a 100 level course. I didn't feel like I learned too much because most seemed like common sense especially for edu majors. Take her when you have a heavy work load - it's a breeze!,1
great class and prof,1
"Professor Morra made this class very interesting and easy. He gives lectures every class and almost always lets you out 15+ minutes early. The only assignments are the midterm and final, which are papers. As long as you come to class, take notes, and put details in your papers, you should get an A!",1
Great professor - she makes difficult neuroscience concepts much easier to understand and apply. She has a strong clinical background and she facilitates incredible classroom discussions. Can't say enough good things about her! This is my favorite class I've taken in the USC MSW program,1
"Dean Robiniwich is the best professor I hve ever had. I reccomend to take as many classes from him as you can. He is a huge part of the enviroment in the school, always welcoming and helpful. His classes are geared towards bar passage. He is friendly and helpful and makes this school a great place.",1
I love dennnis. he absolutely cracks me up.  hes a little eccentric but most artists are. i've learned so much from him concerning art and design. i highly reccomend him.,1
"Marek is probably a professional and knowledgeable individual, but he cannot create a lesson plan, or stay on topic. I don't know when my tests are until a week before, and I do not know how much they are worth. He is unclear, and he has different expectations of student work for each student. You learn to live with it, but there is frustration",0
This was one of the worst classes I have taken in my entire undergraduate career. She is not respectful (makes backhanded comments). For at least a month of this course we basically taught ourselves and her group projects were ridiculous. The case study presentation she grades hard on--she took 15 points because my 'pictures weren't good enough'.,0
"Great feedback, relatively easy assignments, overall, great teacher that really cares for us students.",1
"This hybrid HISTGLBT class on Dissident Sexualities was incredibly interesting. KM provided interesting lectures, but most of the semester was driven by student discussion. There was only one novel required for the class, but more than 600 pages of various journals and articles to read for the class, which can be tough on the CLA printing budget. ",1
Simply a great professor,1
Nice and funny guy but not very helpful and very unorganized. He seemed too caught up on outside projects to really care how we did. No reviews for test or exams. I would have been better off not coming to class and just renting the movies but attendance is mandatory.,1
"Shes very sweet lady, only homework you do are the vocab chapters so a textbook for studying and homework are highly recommended. A friend didn't get a textbook for homework she barely passed the class. only one group project very easy, easy a so don't withdraw when u hear about this because it's very straightforward and easy. would highly recomend",1
"I took for her Criminal justice system, solicolgy of Policing, Corrections and Punishment, Juvenile Deliquency, Theory and Criminal Justice! The test require studying but if your great at memorizing then the test are CAKE! She helps a lot and always willing to give you more time to turn stuff it. She can be boring but shes repetitive so I'll learne",1
"Not a bad guy, he just doesn't know how to teach. Seems as though he doesn't even care, he's gone over some of his powerpoints twice and hasn't even noticed. Very difficult to sit through his class and pay attention. Goes on a tangent every 5 minutes. Avoid this prof. if you can.",0
"Two exams, coaching assignments, he has a review day before exams. No surprises great guy great teacher",1
I though Terri was a very caring and considerate instructor. If you had any problems with canvas or not understanding homework questions she was available and approachable. We used an e-book text book which came with great study tools. She is understanding and has a passion for education. Put in the work and you will get good marks.,1
"Jimmerson goes by the teaching philosophy that all students are empty cups, and she is an overflowing teapot of knowledge. In other words, she is condescending. She is small-minded; if you don't fit into her definition of what makes a person intellectual, she will treat you as if you're inferior to her. If you're not good enough for her, good luck!",0
I absolutely love Dr. Flores.  her classes are all so interesting and she really reaches out to all her students.  she is very approachable and helpful.  The readings for the class are interesting and the lectures are entertaining.  she has a teaching style that dones't put u to sleep. i recommend her!,1
"Had Kraszewski back in the mid-00's(!) for Honors Lit.  Even now, I can still remember him ranting about the computer being an, ""evil Satanic contraption.""  :D  Anyway, the guy is amazing as a prof - knew 4-5 languages, and could make dull subject matter come alive.  Seriously, he is a walking wealth of knowledge, and very effective as a teacher.",1
This has been the worst class ever. Spent countless hours studying and doing his homework. Do not do not take this class if you are not a music major! He loads you with sooooooooo much homework its just busy work and so hard to understand. I usually get As in all my course work and have never struggled in a class so bad.,0
"Dr. Heske is the go to guy for chemistry classes, (and from reading below)especially if you don't have to take a freshman course full of whiners who had the good taste and time to trash him on the internet but were unwilling to study.",1
Her class is really tough. Lots of assignments. The grading criteria is not clear at all. Don't expect to get an A. Very unpleasant learning environment in her classroom. Does not know how to teach. Bad teacher. Avoid her if you can.,0
Professor Green is probably one of the best professors to have. His lectures are engaging and inclusive. He actually cares about your thoughts and input. He grades by the content of your ideas and gives solid USEFUL feedback. Funny and relate-able too!,1
Pretty whack professor. Class is basically unrelated to the homework which is from the book and the book is easily as whack as the professor himself. Very unclear about everything and the exams are brutal.,0
Professor Chambers is so understanding and so helpful that she is willing to go out her way just to make sure you get the material. I would take her for any bio class,1
"The main issue with this professor isn't his teaching style or course content but the fact that he always sounds angry. I don't think he's actually mad, but it's hard to feel comfortable in a class where the teacher's normal speaking volume is shouting. Expect to spend a lot of time on the labs and homework. The exams were very straight-forwards.",0
Easy professor and easy grading. She responds quickly to emails. Her assignments are clear and easy to do. I would totally recommend her and take her again.,1
"Absolutely awful. She grades Aplia by average so you get lower grades than what you deserve. She also won't even bother clarifying questions through emails (because it's ""too difficult to explain"" through email) and keeps pushing phone meetings when I clearly stated I don't have the time. Would not recommend!!",0
Worst explainer and doesn't help you when you don't understand something. She expects you to know everything.,0
"Don't hate him cause he gives vague instructions. Don't hate him cause he is unprepared. Don't hate him cause he put emphasis on the unimportant things and glosses over the important ones. Hate him because his middle name is Lick. Overall good teacher, set aside time for the class, just do your work, have fun, and it's that simple.",1
If you need help she will help you out. Use her office hours they are very helpful on the exams! overall GREAT teacher,1
"This prof. is okay. The class is pretty easy and she gives reviews before tests, but her reviews are not very thorough. You don't need the books, she usually keeps one on reserve in the library, just take good notes and you'll save yourself the money.",1
"One of the worst teachers I have ever had. Never trust the study guide. If he says something won't be on a test, expect it to be on the test. ",0
"She is a wonderful women and is very knowledgeable. Just be prepared to study your notes from lecture. She does get off track a lot and skip around so if you want solid, clear explanations and a more step by step explanation, I would not recommend her. But, if you have taken biology before and have some knowledge of how it works you should be okay.",1
"Great clarity in presentation, very patient and helpful.",1
"Excellent chargé de cours, extrêment pertinent et connais très bien sa matière",1
"She seems like a smart professor but just cant convey her thoughts across. I try so hard to understand but the language barrier is tough. She tries her best to make sure we understand but doesn't really help much, rather confuses more! tests are very ""unique"" as well!",0
"Terrible teacher. Rude, condescending, hypocritical. Does not know her own materials. Could not answer questions on her own test. Has blatant equality issues. Would not take her classes again.",0
"Very nice person and great class! However, very disorganized.",1
"Ms. Dixon is a great teacher because of her compassion toward all her students to do well in college. Extra Credit is a way to bring up your grade. Expects attendance with a few excused only,& part of the grade. Easy course,keep up with work & you can Ace it!Learned time management,organization reading faster,grammar review & being a better student",1
"He is always available outside of class. Always. Gives great feedback and knows what he is doing. Lectures are very good and most the time not boring. He can be disorganized at times, but for the most part he is awesome. He is both great in the classroom and advice outside of the classroom",1
Great teacher and always willing to help.,1
This instructor is excellent at explaining how papers and research projects should be formatted. He is very willing to help when you need it but he does expect you to do your part of the work. The skills you learn in this class will contribute to your success in other classes. I highly recommend this instructor. ,1
Great teacher! Very easy class and you learn a lot! No test only a final presentation and a 8-10 page paper. Grades easy! Very nice and understanding! I would take another class taught by her!,1
Professor Wider is the most interesting class of my semester. I find that everything in politics of law is very informative yet very enjoyable. Everything he provides from lectures to videos and links is very helpful definitely worth taking the class. Everything is posted within a month of the due date. A lot of time for the work to be accomplished,1
"This class was pretty basic wasnt to hard, but I actually learned. Says you need a text book but you really dont theres like 2 read which we never discussed in class so dont waste your money. Also no test just all papers which are not bad",1
"Even though he has 40+ years of experience he is the worst teacher I have ever had.  He goes too fast, doesn't care if you get it or not, is demeaning, and DOES NOT know the definition of a teacher.  He is one who thinks just because he gets it everyone should.  I had to practically beg him to explain (teach) me.  I hated going and cried A LOT!",0
"Don't take if you're not good at math. She doesn't teach. Her goal is to answer questions for 20 minutes then have you work with your peers to figure it out. She won't explain any concepts. You will learn by reading the book. She is soft spoken and will put you to sleep. No study guides cause that's ""baby sitting"". TOTAL MATH NIGHTMARE. BEWARE.",0
"Professor Kanchi is a fantastic lecturer, but that means you actually need to attend the classes. Missing a single lecture will set you back significantly. Shes a difficult grader, but Kettering has high standards anyway. Loads of these reviews are just mad at her because the material is tough and they didn't do well. She is a fantastic professor.",1
You will lose your mind if you know zip about computing science or programming and attend his lectures. Prepare to study a lot outside of class to understand the material.,0
"Good teacher. Knowledgeable in the subject, but uses outdated materials, (really old VHS videos, hard to read images in course packet and black&white copied overhead projector images). Tests can have surprising questions never covered in class. Otherwise, an interesting class, with opportunities for extra credit work.",1
great sensei,1
"She's really not that bad. I have an A in her class and I've never had to pick up the book once. Just read the powerpoints and make flashcards. She's nice enough. It's the kids who want A's handed to them without any effort who are bitter. You don't even need a professor for this class, so don't bother rearranging your schedule to avoid her.",0
"Dr. Capper is an amazing professor. This course embodies what a college course should be in requiring you to apply yourself, take notes, attend class, and give a well written essay. It is easy to retain all of the information because of how he teaches in his lectures. There are no surprises on tests which makes studying easy!",1
"Very kind, helpful, and smart. Sort of shy, but a great and passionate teacher. I learned a lot from her. She's tough, but that's because she is so into the subject. You can tell she really loves the books we read - and we read MANY, MANY books. (But they're good!)",1
"Professor Selgrad gives good feedback and will help you achieve passing the class. It's a hard class you must put in work, he helps by being direct and let's you know what's of importance. Theres quizzes and the coding assignments are long. But he prepares you for the assignments, quizzes, and exams. Great guy, you wont regreat taking him!",1
"there are about 7 short assignments (1-2 pages) you don't need the textbook, you don't need to pay attention in class, just clicker points, a 5-7 page paper at the end. EASIEST WRITING CLASS EVER",1
"You learn alot, I can't deny. However, the structure of this course is ridiculous. MT and final are each worth 35%, both are 50 MC Qs, and you get an hour for each exam. I've seen level 400 courses that are more forgiving than this. Also, alot of the stuff he tests you on is stuff he never talked about and isn't in the book. Take another professor.",0
"Do you like being confused by simple concepts? Then Glen Spiczak is the man for you. He makes simple concepts hard to grasp because of his spastic speaking style and his obscure examples mixed with his love for advanced physics which doesn't translate to 90% of his students. If I didn't take physics in HS, I probably would've gotten a C or worse.",0
She is a Student Teacher. Took Spring 15'. Exams were exact questions from textbook that she tells you to study off. Tough subject overall.,1
"You should only expect an A in this class if you show up to every single class and are incredibly engaged. Don't be deceived by the .5 credit: there are many writing assignments and ""Engagement activities"" over the course of the semester (standard for all dance at duke?). This class was more of an extra academic burden than a dance class for me.",0
Michele is probably the funniest CAS teacher you could have. She came from North Eastern Univeristy. You need to buy the book she uses it a lot. She is new so she is fairly leanent and will help with whatever problems you have. I take it at 8am and its still not that bad. She is also young and pretty attractive which helps.,1
Best Professor at UNO. He teaches a lot of good stuff and new trends. Dont miss his class if you get a chance.,1
"Professor Reese is a solid educator. Very passionate about teaching. Has a very good sense of humor that makes students relax and open up in his class room. Great interaction and a very reasonable disposition. I'm hopeful, I'll have more courses where he is my professor or more professors similar to him.",1
Real easy on the eyes.  Hubba hubba.,1
She is very clear about her knowledge and  note was very helpful for exam. she gives out tons of extracredit and she gives out what will be on exam. reason why I got A- is because I did not study enough...,1
No Comments,0
"She is very helpful with questions. If you complete all assignments and do decent on tests, you can easily pass.",1
"I took Terri's class online. It was a challenge because I hadn't done online classes before, but she is GREAT at helping you through. She wants you to succeed! Highly recommended!",1
"He's a very tough grader, but he does give extra credit. Also, as long as you put in some effort, you should pass the class with at least a C. Getting an A is really difficult, but it is possible. You get around 4 essays, and one grammar final. Be prepared to study that grammar.",1
"Students in the class get bored easily. She just talks and talks with no attempt to connect with the students. There is no real connection because Moore, herself, is not passionate about teaching, at least that is how it appears.",0
"The special topics class on The Wire with Scott, was by far my favorite college class. There is no textbook, you just have to buy all 5 seasons of The Wire and watch it throughout the semester, go to class watch it and discuss it.  HIGHLY recommend this class.",1
"Extremely rude,Breaks her own rules by being habitually late and constantly contradicts herself. You will NEVER have the correct answer for her. Her lectures are Long and Boring and at the end of them you still haven't learned much. English is my best subject and she has ruined the class for me;with her poor teaching style.",0
Dr. Gonzalez is by far my favorite professor. She teaches very well and genuinely cares for her students.,1
"Page is SO knowledgeable! She shares so much insight. You will learn so much every class. There are lots of projects and assignments, but you learn a ton!!",1
"She is one of those teachers you really appreciate! As long as you do the work, you will be fine. If you dont feel confident to take her compressed class then take the 16 week class (talk to her to see whats best for u). A big plus is that she shows you easier methods beyond what the homework book teaches and makes sure you get the content.",1
"Rebecca is an excellent professor and overall I enjoyed the class. She is funny and engaging, even though I wasn't that interested in the course material. You definitely get from the class what you put into it. The textbook is necessary but painful to read because it is so obvious and dull. Quizes were on tiny details straight from the book.",1
"Professor May is amazing! Very caring and approachable and you won't go a single class period without laughing. Makes learning the material and coming to class so much easier. he made me realize just how much i truly love criminal justice. If you don't pass this class, you simply didn't put in the work needed to pass. hands down my favorite prof.",1
"Expect a lot of reading from her. She makes you waste your time reading alot and gives pop quizzes, which I doubt she even grades to our participation grade. The only assignments you get in her class are the midterm, essay, and final exam. She literally gives you the entire exams before you even take them. She is very easy and you will pass easily",1
"Boring lectures but easy assignments, quizzes, exams (everything from sample questions); helpful during office hours; recommendable",1
"She is a terrible teacher for physiology. She was forced to give everyone curves because her tests were always terrible. She goes way too fast, cannot explain anything, but she does try to be nice. Her grading is just....bad...half of the time she doesn't even know what she marked you off for. Avoid her at all costs!",0
"Did not like his lectures, learned on my own. ",0
"I don't understand why this teacher yells during his lecture as if the class cannot hear him. He is ineffective as a professor because during a group quiz, none of the students knew what was going on. I would advise to take another professor over this one.",0
"Dr. Day is pretty friendly, easy to talk to, and willing to help. The majority of the points for the class are in the labs which can be difficult but Dr. Day usually has very good input if you're stuck. The tests are open note, but some of the material on them is only mentioned in class. Lectures aren't particularly helpful aside from that though.",1
"Sra. Logue is one of the best teachers I've ever had. While I wouldn't consider the work particularly difficult (unless you want it to be), it was always enjoyable. I elected to commute an hour each way simply to enjoy HER class, and on top of that, to enjoy time with her out-of-class. Fulfilling req or for enjoyment,  she is the way to go. muchluv",1
"Doesn't teach. Just regurgitates. She is very unclear at what she wants and makes last minute decisions in terms of exams and content. She leaves the student wondering what to study for, when in reality, the only way to pass is to have the ENTIRE book memorized. When the class average was 60%, she blamed us for not studying enough.",0
"I took the online class. There is an experiential paper you have to write in the end, plus other papers! I like how he has a recorded audio session available for you to listen to. Remember your quizzes because they will be on your exams. Take advantage of the extra credit he offers.",1
"very nice woman, tends to ramble about things we will learn later in the bio sequence instead of explaining what we are learning. If you use the web site that comes with the book it will be easy if not you will have to read every bit of every chapter. also she uses the 3rd edition we have the newest edition either 5 or 6",0
"Professor literally lost one of my quizzes and gave me a zero, when I never missed one class and took the quiz. Incredibly disrespectful to students. She tells us to ask her questions and email her then she does not respond to emails. Would never recommend this professor. Many people dropped the course halfway through the semester due to her.",0
"Great teacher, very detailed lectures. If you skip class you won't pass because attendance is taken for a grade. Lectures are long and boring, but if you study your notes after every lecture you'll be fine. Also, print out the notes he provides online & bring them to class so you don't have to write the entire lecture.",1
Overall  i think one of the best statistics teacher  at palm beach state. If I had to i would  take him again  as long as you have the Ti84 or Ti83 and do the homework you should be ok. And if you ever need professor Davis his at the math lab to help.. very good professor..,1
She is very helpful and will email you back in a timely manner. Fun essays and will help you understand your grade. Best teacher at CSU!,1
"First time professor and extremely demanding. Mandatory activities include: learning how to play a pan flute, dancing during lecture, and having to write a 5-page ethnography paper. TAs were amazing but discussions were not helpful at all. 3 quizzes, multiple choice + essay final, doesnt post slides and no photos. Avoid as much as possible.",0
she is ok,1
"A nice prof who obviously cares, but extremely disorganized. Never prints enough copies of midterms, and once made 30 students leave and come take the exam a week later because of this. Changes his office hours without warning and regularly skips or reteaches material because he forgets what we've done. Easy class but stressful and frustrating.",0
Mr. Boyle is a really hot guy although i wish he would lighten up. Sucks that hes already married.,1
She's an amazing teacher! I would recommend her to everyone!,1
"She assigns one hour documentaries for homework and 3 hour democratic debate. You get quizzed on student presentations on very tiny specific details. Instead of teaching, she shows video clips during class and prepare for it to show up on the quiz. The quizzes are easy except for when specifics questions are asked about video clips or presentations",0
"Just finished up A&P1 spring 2018 with Prof Zeman. She really is a wonderful teacher, the best I have had at RCC so far. She is so funny, and tells it how it is. She can totally relate to students as she was a student herself not that long ago so she gets it. Only wish she were teaching A&P 2. Definitely take her, you wont find anyone better!",1
"Super engaging, and understanding. Attend class and participate in your group to get the full experience. Explains topics really well. Fun lectures and a great person!",1
"For the first two weeks of class he rambled about non sense. Then for the rest of the semester he splits you into groups and you teach the class the book.  He doesn't teach anything. Each group has to present their chapter for two weeks at a time, and once you get through all the groups, you start over.  Huge time commitment outside of class.",0
"Dr Lenhart is a great professor and keeps class really interesting, tests are difficult go to class.",1
"Best lady ever. I recommend everyone take her class. She was so amazing and caring and the class was a breeze. Minimal work and she helped us a lot, she really cared about our class and it was cool. Be nice to her cause she is nice to everyone no matter what. 20/10 recommendation.",1
"Heather Hug Robbins was a little odd. She described herself as an award winning teacher. I did not see it. She used sexual analogies to discuss content, which was strange. She gave 100 point exams and a 200 point cumulative final. The final can ruin your grade. A 200 point final does not seem to be a good strategy for an award winning instructor.",1
You will be fully guided!!!,1
"Jana is extremely helpful and always willing to meet outside of class. Course expectations were clear: three quizzes and one large paper broken down into two sections. My main issue is that the course was too slow. We could have covered so much more material! Also, if you're like me, and detest powerpoint lecture classes..well...grit your teeth.",1
"Best professor ever!! I had her for history 101 and she is super easy and clearly outlines what is on the exams for you which are not difficult at all. She gives 4, 3 page essay prompts throughout the year, but you only have to write 2 and she is not a hard grader. Overall, I totally recommend taking her!!",1
"While she may be friendly, she is an unnecessarily strict grader. She told us once that student's complained that they ""never know what she expects of them"" and why that's ridiculous. She has very specific written instructions, but there are unwritten rules behind those instructions that you don't know until it's too late and you're staring at an F",0
"Very dedicated professor, I enjoyed her class.",1
"Fantastic teacher who is really on the students' side. She has a very funny dry sense of humour. The class was a year-long course in Anatomy and Physiology, crammed into one semester of evening classes, so making so much material manageable was a huge task, but Dr. Gonzalez did an incredible job.",1
Was terribly unhelpful. Never answers emails/questions. Assignments were on material we never learned. The rock kit required for the class was discontinued and she did not adapt any of our content to accommodate those who couldn't get the rock kit.,0
Great teacher. A lot of information each class. You must go to class in order to get an A. I got an A in both Orgo 1 and 2 with Dr. MS. Just study a lot and pay attention and you can do the same!,1
She's a very nice professor and loves what she teaches but she's a very hard grader. She is not specific on assignments and activities in class.,0
"Matt is amazing. He teaches all of the labs for the intro stats class, and it's obvious that he puts all that he can into making the class as understandable as possible. He loves helping people one-on-one through a problem and is very approachable. Honestly the best part of this class is the lab because he teaches it!",1
"Ortiz is great in class, but he is also a great advisor. If you need advice for choosing classes, he points you in the right direction depending on your interests. He is in charge of ""administrative studeis"" and his students get great advisement. He even helps over the phone.",1
Very passionate about mental health. Expect to complete your readings. Comes off as passive aggressive and slightly rude.,1
"Very good. Provided a lot of real life examples. It was very helpful. But I was in a large class, and hence it is little difficult to participate, otherwise good.",1
AWESOME professor. Extremely helpful and caring. I'd highly recommend her =),1
"Loved him, took him for first year seminar, very laid back, wrote one essay the whole semester",1
"Amazing teacher!!! You never have to bring your book, honesty you don't really have buy the book. She has u write a lot of notes but those notes are what will be on the test. She is funny and makes class fun. Gonna take her sociology 16 class next semester.",1
"Leonard is a great teacher. He was extremely helpful to any questions I had. Never opened the book, as long as you go to lectures, which are easy. Lab is very basic, and he explains every step. He gives a practice exam which is very similar to the test. Overall, great teacher and great experience. ",1
FANTASTIC professor!  I recommend him to every single person!!!,1
"Professor Zank is a very nice guy who is genuinely interested on educating his students about the various bible. His class is easy, I hardly paid attention & got an A. Exams are based off his notes which are readily available online. He is not that clear, so try to sit in front to hear him clearly. Lectures arent that organised but that's his style",1
Best professor ever,1
"Very fun Professor. She is really cool and we go over everything in class, and have fun group activities. The homework and quizzes are online and just have to study sentence structure and vocab. But you do a lot of practice in class. The class is all in Spanish so be ready to get engaged in conversation. Overall fun class and nice teacher",1
"I enjoyed the class, but his lectures are so long. Very monotone voice put me to sleep standing as he talks for 2 hours straight. Homework took a lot of effort and wasn't interesting enough to motivate me to make art. He does take time to help out students, whether or not you think you need it, he was very helpful and seemed to love what he does",1
"She is hard to understand but she posts lectures online so listen to those. The lecture exams are hard but the lab exams are not. Read the book for more clarification. Look at the lectures, the powerpoint and do the homework to do well in the class. You need to put in work to get a good grade because the class is hard. I enjoyed this class with her",1
This class is a good class if you are looking for an online class that you will learn from. It also works at your own pace which is really nice if you have a very busy schedule. She also responds to questions during office hours and even is available on weekends which is really helpful.,1
"Thompson is a good professor, however his exams can be quite difficult. His ""road map"" problems do not mimic anything he has showed you. The class is meant to be hard, and I realize he is still the better professor than the on-track professors, but he still could be more straight forward. He is nice and works with you, but he can be challenging.",1
"I have enjoyed Dr. Webb's class so far. He makes learning math easy. I am retaking this class because I earned a C the first time. The semester is almost over and I've maintained an A so far. If you're looking for a quality math professor, sign up for his class!",1
"Sarah is an amazing professor, and really made my first French class at McGill worthwhile. She's firm with grading, but a genuinely nice woman and gave me the opportunity to make up a quiz I missed. There is a lot of work, but if you set the proper time aside I considered this class an easy A. Tests really reflected what was taught - no surprises!",1
"Amazing! His personality is hilarious, and he wants the best for all his students. His exams are examples straight from the book, as long as you do the homework and examples it's an easy A/B. His lectures are basically the easiest examples from the book, but his exams are a fair reflection of the lectures.",1
Tough Lecturer! Knows his stuff very well and is such an oasis of knowledge. Passionate about what he does and extremely blunt always. Engages students very well with an open heart.,1
Has horrible ratings for Math 101 which I do not understand because truthfully if you do the homework and do the test reviews when studying you will be fine. Just show your work and he will try and give you points even if the answer is wrong,1
"Wonderful man! His World Lit class made me think about stuff I have never pondered before. His class is very discussion-based, and I learned so much through this style of learning. I would love to take another class with him-- very enthusiastic, easy class, amazing professor!! Cares about his students a lot. Take World Lit with him if you can!!!",1
He's so disorganized and all over the place. Our due dates changed about 5 times which is so stressful when you have other things to worry about. The way he does his tests are not helpful to learning and I feel like I'm learning more of how to be a grad student than understanding motivation. He's a good guy and not super tough but I don't get him.,1
"He assigns homework every night and although it is easy, it is extremely pointless and repetitive. During class, he will call on you and challenge you. Also, he is an extremely hard grader its very difficult to get 100%. Before you can turn in an assignment, you have to visit the writing center. Take this class with a friend, you do peer reviews.",0
Angela is the most helpful teacher I have ever had at ECU. She genuinely cares and wants you to succeed. As long as work hard and come to class you will get a good grade. Awesome sense of humor too!,1
"I took NSD 225 to fulfill a non-lab science requirement and received the EASIEST A! If youre not STEM orientated then definitely take while online! This barely felt like a class, with the only work being weekly quizzes and discussion board posts. Everything was already on Quizlet.",1
I really enjoyed this class and would definitely take it again. Professor Werbe cares about her students and wants you to pass the course. The only critique I have is sometimes there was a lot of HW and quizzes. Other then this I learned a lot!!,1
Show up for class and do the lab assignments.  Pay attention to the lecture not just the slides.  Getting an A is possible but the tests are hard.  There was extra credit throughout the course.  Getting a B is pretty easy if you just show up and put some effort into stuff. He wants to get you ready for nursing classes.,1
Dr. Wisotzki is a great professor. Definitely take her before leaving Loyola. She is brilliant and her lectures are interesting. You will want to go to class!,1
"He is a good prof, yes his class is lecture heavy, but the long term paper and weekly reading assignments are pretty normal for any history class. The history final is graded very fairly. It is worth 40% of your grade and is graded as such. Not a paper you should leave for the last night. Weekly quizzes are all on quizlet so they are easy to do.",1
"This man is the sweetest and smartest professor I have ever had.  I learned so much and genuinely loved his course.  If you come to class, pay attention, and take notes then the tests are a breeze. If you get the chance to take any of his classes, definitely do it. I highly recommend him!",1
"poor presentation skills, and very less techniques covered in this course, but you can get A easily.. if you want to do some practical projects and find a job related to what you learn from this course, you should rethink about it. Don't waste time on his course, better take online course to learn more.",0
"Overall, not impressed by his teaching style (online). Be prepared to teach yourself everything, because he provides no lessons and little help even if you ask for it!",0
Easily one of the best teachers i have ever had. She is super knowledgeable in human services and creates a warm and welcoming environment for students. She is so caring and creates a bond with each and every student she has. I learned a lot and it was 100% enjoyable. A true class act.,1
"I definetly dont suggest anyone to take this professor. Unless your willing to have a hard time comprehending what it is that he wants you to do. Although I think he is very knowledgeable, he seriously does not know how to teach.",0
Survey I is just a piece of cake for me. I got no exam grade below 90 and all homeworks were rated check plus in his class. Read the textbook and review the presentation if you don't understand dude!,1
"Although I was not in her college class at ECC, I was participating in her college level Calculus course at Bartlett High School. Her class is very difficult and it may take months to get A's on her tests. As far as flexibility for help, she is usually avalaible.",1
"Osoba likes to call on you in class even if your hand isnt up. Hes supper nice and a little to energetic for my liking. Gives optional problems sets, do them. Exams are difficult, no multiple choice and all open ended, lots of memorization",1
She is SO NICE.  And a really good teacher.  She's extremely helpful and not strict at all.  I had her for French (although she mainly teaches Italian) and I learned a lot.,1
"Fun guy. One of the only Austrian-tinged econ profs on campus. He will stare you down if you try to ask a question, but there's not much to ask about. Also, don't just repeat what he says back to him in exams or essays, it seems to make him angry. Not that seeing him angry is a bad experience. If you lookup his journal articles, they're pretty fun.",1
"I have a 4.0, having taken over 20 classes at Oakton. I love school. She was my worst professor. She went on vacation in the middle of the semester! She failed to answer any of my questions by email about anything, AND she gave me a B when my grades added up to an A and had to change it cause she clearly does not care at all about her students. NO!",0
"Do not take this class. 40+ pages to read, 3 tests, 3 quizzes, a 30 minute video and discussion board EVERY WEEK. This was the hardest class I have ever taken and it doesn't get easier. He's a nice guy, but a harsh grader. I am a strong writer and managed a borderline A in the class. This is a GPA killer unless you are dedicated!",0
"His lectures are pretty much useless. To actually lear, you have to read the textbook. His labs were doable, I recommend staying on top of them. He can be rude, but he is much nicer if you approach him during office hours (if he is there). During labs, don't expect any help from him, he will leave as soon as lab time starts. TA's are very helpful.",1
"Phenomenal teacher. A great individual who truly cares about the success of his students, and the importance of communication (cinnabon, savvy)",1
Ms. Dillon is very helpfully and she never thing any quesstion is stupied and she really cares about the student as a person too. She Great.,1
"Ive had several classes with Professor Clark. He challenges you but at the same time, passing the class and getting a good grade is achievable. I honestly feel like he is a great example of what professors should be like. Ive definitely learned a lot from his classes. Only complaint is it takes awhile for him to grade assignments and tests.",1
Incredible inspiration to all students that attend.,1
Great teacher! Fun class and he gives study guides! You do have to work for that A. I would take him again! He usually gives a extra credit opportunity.,1
Boring lectures that aren't helpful and vague expectations. She'll go 20 minutes over on a conference to share personal stories while you wait on her to look over your essay. One of my worst experiences with a professor.,0
"Perkins is a really nice guy and super down to earth. There is an above average amount of reading and writing for homework, but every single class is just a discussion on what we read at home (very low stress). Honestly, the most challenging part of the class is the fact he grades an A as a 95+ rather than 93, so its harder to get an A.",1
Life changing.,1
You are a really nice teacher and person in general. And you're hot. keep doin what you're doin,1
"I took Prof Rogers for calc 2 over the summer. This was my second attempt at taking calc 2, and this time was much better. He is clearly excited about the topic and is animated during lectures. I thought that he explained things clearly. His test questions come straight from homework assignments and worksheets, and he gives a lot of partial credit.",1
"Prof. Guzzone is a very nice Prof.  However, this is not an easy class.  It requires alot of reading and the test are a bit hard.  You really have to keep up with the reading.  Overall Prof. Guzzone is a great Prof.",1
Professor Smith is really not as bad as what people say. She's very kind and a great teacher. She's very respectful and great at helping us with our papers. She's a gem and I love classes with her.,1
"This professor spews his personal political beliefs and shuts down any students who has a differing opinion. By the end of the term no one would participate in class discussions because he made people feel their opinions were wrong and called them racists, and HIS opinions got more and more strident in favor of nationalism.",0
Professor Wheeler is a very knowledgeable and has a lot of great things to say. I really enjoyed her class and did well. The only issue I had was a large amount of reading she assigned and tested.,1
"Dr. Swenson is a fantastic professor. Attendance is mandatory as you get graded on it, but I looked forward to going to her lectures. I learned a lot of information that I will actually be able to use in the future. Your main grades come from a couple speeches and a few quizzes but as long as you put effort in you'll get a good grade.",1
"Papageorgiu is amazing! He is so down to earth and so funny. Although he only gives four tests, he is very helpful and the group project is fun as well. I highly recommend him! ",1
Jones has the potential to be a good teacher but lacks the passion for teaching  She expects people to learn quick and if u don't she shames you she is always just trying to beat the clock and jam as much information in each lecture as possible which I feel is not beneficial to the students quizzes every week and exams every 3 which are cumulative.,0
"Yo, don't even listen to the negative comments. Mr. Pilar is a really good teacher. His lectures are easy to understand and engaging. If you missed class, you could just go to his office hours and he will help you one on one. If you get the material, then online homework and tests are very easy. U r wasting a gr8t opportunity if u don't take him!",1
Good professor but short tough multiple choice questions for lecture exam,1
No visual aid. Hard to hear her lecture. Description of the class is very misleading. Only focused on a very specific vein of activism and movements. Does not always respond to emails. Do not take it unless you are prepared to read numerous several hundred paged books. Absolutely hated this class. This professor is not good.,0
Your best bet is to use Khan Academy or some other online resources and just use those over relying on the book or lecture too heavily. He says the book isnt student friendly then proceeds to read directly from the text. He took an hour to do 4 examples and a quarter of the class left after the following 5 minute break.,0
"Great teacher. I truly learned. Really tough class though. Her grading is tough and usually unforgiving. If you come to class and at least try to answer questions, she'll learn your face and will be more willing to help you with grading, though. She is really nice and really loves to see students succeed.",1
i asked for helped. he made it clear for me and seemed to care about my success and volunteered future assistance. This professor will help if you seek him out.,1
"Ah Dr. Rolle.. Probably the funniest professor I've ever had. Tells great stories throughout class. The only time I fell asleep was when he didn't get side tracked. Tests aren't too bad, generous partial credit is given and extra credit quizzes add straight on top of your test grade. Don't expect to learn much in his classes.",1
Such an awesome professor. I took her for ENG 100 & ENG 112. She was so understanding & she's easy to take if you pay attention in class. She helped me be better at writing essays. Literature & English isn't my favorite subject but she made me like it.,1
He won't let you use a laptop to take notes. Waste of time.,0
Dr. Bailey is one of the best professors in engineering. He truly cares about whether you understand the material. He gives his students every tool they may need to succeed. I wish he taught all of the engineering courses.,1
She really likes class involvement but is extremely unwilling to work with you if you have something come up and can't make it to class. I had surgery over spring break and missed a few classes for appointments and she was very rude and unwilling to help me when I was asking to receive homework prior to classes so they weren't late.,0
"I took math after many years, I hardly remembered anything so all the material was new to me & I had been submitted for the summer term which is only 6 weeks! The amount of material was endless and the book over 1000 pages!!! If it weren't for Ms. Niu's inspiration, direction and help on a daily basis straight after class  I wouldn't have made it!",1
"He is not an easy professor, you have to take a 3.5 hour test and then a quiz as soon as you walk into class. His quiz are very hard, 95% of the class fail them. You have to memorize 3 to 4 chapters and lectures. He is very hard headed and the questions are created to make you fail. He admitted he enjoys making people squirm. Don't recommend",0
"She seems a little scary at first but she's not at all.  Just ask questions and read the assignments and you will be fine. Personally, I think she's awesome.",1
Brandeen is one of the best teacher at Humber. She teaches some of the hardest subjects on the course but she does an incredible job at explaining them. She has her expectations on students but is also very understanding of extraordinary situations. Don't think twice before taking her as a teacher.,1
"AMAZING PROFESSOR! By far the best Ive had, super patient and makes chem fun! Loved that class so much",1
Dr Thomas is a tough professor but he really wants the students to do well and think as individuals.,1
"Great professor, very caring and eager to help. Content is clear, direct, and simple. Would for sure take another class with her again. Very reasonable and manageable class. She has a lot of opportunities for people to do well; grades are based on a lot of different things. You are only required to go to half of the classes the entire semester.",1
"Took her class in 1979.   She was very tough.  But , that is what you need these days to survive in reality.   She is preparing you for the tough world.   Take her instructions exactly the way she says.    Will make your future a lot easier.  She is trying to cut the umbilical cord from mommy and Daddy!!!",1
"Absolutely terrible. She's off topic most of the time, because she's got nothing to teach, since she's got nothing in her brain. It's sad, but it's the truth. If you want a good grade, might as well stay home and read your textbook. ",0
Amazing teacher. One of the best teachers I've ever had. He is very approachable for questions. Very charismatic and keeps your attention. He is very  entertaining and is full of knowledge. You can really tell he cares for his work and students.,1
She does absolutely nothing for her class or her students and shes supposed to teach how to tend to exceptional learners but doesnt practice it herself . Oxymoron of a professor if you ask me,0
"Dr. Hart meant well. She is very passionate about what she does, so she assigns so much. It is defiantly a good class, however if you can't balance a reading and writing intensive course with other courses... do not take her. Overall, she wasn't terrible.",1
Anita is one of the most engaging and understanding professors I have had at Vanderbilt. She gives an unparalleled level of freedom to do what you want with the class in a way that inspired me to go above and beyond. Would highly recommend finding a way to take one of her classes if possible.,1
"Was not very helpful, made me not enjoy sign language as I enjoyed it very much for 1010. She will call people out in front of the class and has a very short temper and extremely inpatient. Not the best teacher for trying to learn a new language, as she expects you to know almost every sign there is.",0
"She makes class mandatory but shows up late, grades papers late and doesn't help you understand the material well I would not take.",0
"One thing about Dr. Desselle is she takes FOREVER to grade assignments, it's actually pathetic. However the work itself is not too complicated if you actually study like a college student and participate in class. My advice is too take note to complete and turn in every assignment on time. Study and turn in everything, you'll be fine!",0
"He is a nice guy.. but professor wise, I would never recommend him. His class is passable. But, you will learn nothing. He just reads off the powerpoints and seems disinterested in any comments from others. However, his exams are easy if you study. His exam reviews are very helpful. I wish he was that helpful in daily lectures.",0
Dr. Dotts was fantastic. It's super clear that he's super passionate about teaching and he really cares about helping to bring up some good teachers one day. Just go to class and pay attention in class and you'll be fine.,1
"If you want to learn something, do not take him. There is definitely something mentally not right with him, he is constantly off topic. I went to every class, did every assignment like an idiot and got an A. Meanwhile people who never showed got an A- because it was 'easier' for him to deal with. Worst English class and experience ever.",0
"Loved her class. Anatomy is normally a boring class, but she made it is interesting as possible. She explained things very well and is available for extra help.",1
"She's very sweet and honestly, if you really care about your grade she will be there to assist you in any possible way. Definitely keep up with your notes and read the chapters so you won't fall behind. She's a good grader and provides a lot of extra credit.",1
"DO NOT TAKE HER IF YOU WANT TO LEARN. She is super nice but when it comes to teaching, she is no help at all. Not a very hard grader on the lab reports because she does not teach anything. Lab protocols are a mess and have a lot of typos and she leaves you to deal with that by yourself. No point in asking her a question because she does not answer.",0
Very helpful and quick to respond to emails. Highly Recommend.,1
If  are a  geology major  takes  this class,1
"Great guy, extremely helpful.  Loves to teach this, and he's a legitimate piano genius.  5 (easy) written homework assignments, 3 written tests, and 4-5 low-stress playing tests.  Grades based on improvement, not ability, and he's an easy grader anyways.  Perfect class for your fine arts requirement, even if you don't know what a piano is.",1
"The communication is a very big problem. Although understanding, this professor does not respond within the maximum amount of time given, then leaving you to figure out for yourself how to manage the assignments. It was as if I did not have a professor at all for this class and I was completely self sufficient. Not a great experience.",0
"For Stem Seminar 2 , he's been a great teacher, giving good feedback and makes us laugh sometimes. We all feel engaged in his class.  Though he may not look it, he is a humble yet precise professor. He will always help you if you need help with anything.",1
I enjoyed the class and have learned a lot in reference to film and music.,1
"Mr. Gilyard hold the title as one of my favorite professors in Penn State. He is intelligent and helpful with teaching his students about the techniques in writing. 5 papers, (One is a rewrite of any paper you chose) , one group project and participation in class will make up your overall grade. I would highly recommend taking Gilyard.",1
My OG,1
"He is a great professor. He makes it very clear on what he expects you to know for the exams. The powerpoints are posted on moodle, but he goes into detail during lectures.",1
O chem isn't the most interesting subject out there. Nor is it one of the easiest. Dr. Kennedy tries to make the course interesting (as best as the material allows him) and is always willing to help out. He even started a weekly study session outside of class. Be prepared to study A LOT.  Ask questions. Your grade at the end reflects your effort.,1
"Liggin is an awesome human being and teacher, he understands learning software online due to COVID makes it more difficult. He is willing to stop and answer all questions to make sure everyone is on track. This course honestly falls on the individual to put in time and effort beyond what the class time grants",1
"Took his 8 week class last semester. Seems like a lot of work in the beginning but as assignments get completed class gets easy. There are 2 quizzes per chapter plus a ""think piece"". 2 analysis papers are required but he explains to us how to do it and helps out! Checks in every mid week to make sure the class is on board! Great teacher !",1
"Unless you really know java REALLY well I suggest you stay away from his data structures class. Hard to understand also, when you ask for help most of the time he just repeats himself and talks in circles.",0
"She does expect a lot of work from you within a short amount of time, but she will work with you. Projects are interesting, and you LEARN in her classes.",1
"This Professor is a devil in human form. She is very rude, with great accent. When you ask questions she laughs as if students don't know anything. She thinks that she knows it all but i am not surprise that she is not married and don't have kids. No one can live with a difficult, rude and heartless person like 'Subadra'.",0
"Somewhat scattered, but he always made an attempt to listen and his door always seemed open to stop by; after awhile you stop worrying about your grade and daydream about how cute he is",1
"Overall this course was easy because I already had a biology background but even if you don't know bio terminology, it's easy ONLY if you study hard for the exams. You have to study at least 2 days prior for tests. Also, attendance isn't necessary. Everything on the exams are based off the slides in which she gives you reviews. She's super nice!!",1
Not the best professor to take. There are a lot of questions on the exams for a short period of time. She gives a lot of readings. The study guides are no help. She's a tough grader.,0
"Lectures can be boring and the papers are a drag, but the final is optional. Easy to get an A or B",1
"Oumar had a great way of explaining the concepts. He made up the exams, and the material that was covered on them was exactly as described in class, making the exams very fair. He makes a lot of little math errors in his work, but not relevant to the theory. If you can look past them, you're fine. I would definitely recommend him as a math prof.",1
"Easy class but she pushed off big assignments for ones she made up that and only went toward participation. Terrible at making tests, ended up getting around +12 on each exam bc she made them up so wrong, and claimed we were being disrespectful if we debated one of the questions. Semester is over and she hasn't graded half the assignments yet.",0
"I've never met a prof who specifies using a (TERRIBLE) template for submitting assignments and refuses to let students add/remove space after questions. There's not enough space and all she can say is ""you can format it to fit"". These are equations we're talking about, NOT a resume. Assignments are also not on the actual content ""taught"". Horrible.",0
Great teacher!!! He's funny and uses humor throughout the class.  The class is fun and very easy.  Take him if you can!,1
"I really enjoyed his class. I would recommend his class. It was not super hard or even hard, BUT you do have to study notes. I would take him again. He's different but I like and enjoyed his class.",1
"For someone who has worked in mental health, she sure has a problem practicing what she teaches. She does inteigue students and make them care and even listens to their concerns. But she will also make little comments that she knows will hurt students the most.",0
"Intimidating, but I learned a lot about different art forms in ""writing across the arts."" And she did give good feedback on papers.",1
"Tells you the average for the class will be a B but really it will be closer to a C. Wastes time in class talking about his own stocks along with other pointless things and will put random stuff on tests hes never talked about. Not a good marketing teacher for 300 but i'm not sure about other classes. good guy, sub par teacher.",0
"She's pretty entertaining and likes to talk. Class is fun, but watch out--she may accidentally spoil the latest TV show you're watching (Game of Thrones...). She is very friendly if you need help but she treats students like they're in elementary school. She'll get on to you for not looking straight at her during lab. ",1
"Answer Advanced Reading questions on TopHat (easy points). Although the workbooks are long, they serve as a good resource because they include practice problems in them... Tests are difficult but refer back to the workbook for help!",1
I have had this professor for two classes. I highly recommend! He is a great guy! ,1
"Her note taking style is impossible to follow, she doesn't accept outside perspectives for the most part, and is a harsh grader who gives minimal feedback.",0
one of the most laid back teachers i've ever had and makes ast intresting,1
By far the hardest class I have ever taken. Never have liked his attitude. Don't be fooled by his niceness on day one. He belittles students in class for asking questions. LOTS of papers due that take tons of time. Be prepared. Worst teacher I've ever had. You won't feel confident in your work. Does not encourage you and makes you hate  the subject,0
"Isabelle was wonderful! She was my lab instructor for this class. The lab assignments are tedious and the 4% is hardly worth the 12 hours you need to invest into assignments, but Isabelle was great. I reached out to her a few times throughout the term and she was always willing to help. She wanted to see us succeed!",1
"Honors eng 2: he was amazing! best prof i could have asked for. uses book, goes over everything for tests. you cant get lower than a C in this class. MUST COME TO CLASS tho.",1
"the worst teacher you could ever have. she does not teach and expects you to learn the material yourself, keep in mind i did not take a self paces so she should have taught. the first day when a student asked her how we were supposed to answer the questions she said ""you have a phone, look it up yourself"" the worst teacher.",0
"Huge amount of info to learn in this class, had him for lab and studied more for lab than my lecture!  Hard grader that will not negotiate, sometimes threatens pop quizzes, can have a crude sense of humor, critical about being on time, can be funny  a lot of the time, pray to god before taking bones and muscles test.",1
"good prof for sure...like some have said, likes to mess with your mind, but that's what profs do.  Really good at relating class material to real life.  Highly recommend",1
"Nelson is an outstanding teacher! She's a beautiful person, inside and out, and her goal is to help everyone understand the material/appreciate music. When giving examples of music terms, she either plays it on the piano or sings it quite well. Be sure to listen to the entire song in the listening homework, because she might trick you on the test.",1
If you have to take IME 103. You need to get Professor Collins!!,1
"This class seemed interesting but it was kinda boring. Teacher is great though, his stories are funny and we watched interesting videos in class. But the tests are extremely hard.",1
"This teacher needs to get a clue. I don't know if anybody passed this class with higher than a C.  I don't if she is trying to prove herself, but I seriously didn't learn anything because of her lack of teaching skills.  Essays questions don't make students learn, good teachers make them learn and this teacher doesn't make that mark. DON'T TAKE HER",0
"Wonderful teacher, extremely flexible, kind, funny (loves ""dad jokes""). If there is any miscommunication on an assignment and the nearly the whole class has the incorrect assignment, he won't dock you or grade you harshly. In most times he will give you another day to fix up the assignment. Great on feedback, never disrespectful. I learned so much!",1
"Excellent Professor! This professor can take you to the next level in your writing, so take advantage of his feedback, enjoy the class, pay attention and you will excel.",1
"What a horrible professor! Unorganized, ill-prepared, unfair & rude...I actually had to go to her boss about a grade b/c McClung can't figure out how to give a peer review assignment. Tried to give me a 0 b/c no one would send me a paper to review! Her boss sided with me. Grades VERY harshly & I have my doubts about if she even reads the papers!",0
I have never been so frustrated with a class. The quizzes she gives isn't over stuff that you have recently gone over. Doesn't do examples to completion. Treats you like you are stupid. Grades super heavy. She deducted points for something that wasn't in my final answer. Doesn't give partial credit. expects you to spend every waking hour studying.,0
"Don't listen to what anybody says about this class being ""difficult"", you basically need to show up, hit a clicker button in the beginning, and at the end for attendance. You can miss like 4 lectures, and the ""papers"" are 1 double spaced pages a week on easy stuff. a 75% is an A in the class, and you truly have to try to not get an A",1
"Professor Mizell is more into current events than the actual material you need for the class. You might as well take this online before you take her because nothing you do in here is relevant to the essays you turn in. She's constantly wanting to start a debate. Also, she has never once replied to any of my emails. If possible take someone else.",0
"He tries to be innovative in his teaching style, but it's a bad method. He thinks he's the smartest man on Earth and claims to care for his students, but I tried to reach out to him and he never emailed me back. Picks a few favorites and gives them the highest grades and attention most of the time. Unreasonable grading, idk if anyone will get an A.",0
"He's a pretty good teacher, tries to keep you interested, and if you pay attention/do hw you should be fine",1
"The discussion was often slow and sometimes her feedback is unclear and based more on grammar rather than content. She is brilliant when it comes to art and her love for the information is contagious. Glad I had a strong honors writing foundation from first semester going into her class, though.",1
"Took this class online, and I loved this professor! By far, my favorite teacher at GCC. Assignments were easy and clear to underatand. Didnt read the textbook, only used it for the online quizzes. The class consists on 2 DQs and one quiz a week that are due on Sunday, one individual speech, and a group speech which is your final. Easiest A!",1
"Ms. Johansen is very nice, however, her class is too easy, and the examples she provides from her own clients are presented more like gossip than case studies.  She makes it a point to say that people are not ""crazy"", they just function at a ""different level"", but it's obvious that she believes her level of functioning is higher.",1
"Professor Liu was one of my favorite professors at BC. She was very organized and clear with her expectations. Each week, you will be asked to write a long discussion post and take a 10 question quiz so be prepared! She is caring and she wants you to do the best in her class. She also provides EC throughout the class. I hope you enjoy her class!",1
Such a great professor! Enjoyed her lectures. Class is mainly tests and weekly assignments. Study hard for the exams there are no study guides. Sometimes she would have questions from the textbook in her exams which was annoying. Overall if you study hard you should be good. Super good at explaining things and she's hilarious!,1
This prof was amazing! I really enjoyed my class.,1
BEST PROFESSOR AT CSN! Enthusiastic and passionate about what he teaches. Great class.,1
Dr. Melnichuk is the sweetest and funniest professor I've ever had! He is always there for help. You will truly be blown away by how much help and support he provides to his students. Amazing.,1
Just finished a class with Ms. Magdaleno & I have to say shes my favorite teacher so far at the Art Institute. Its not just because of her ass which is nice like the other people have said; but She makes class fun & exciting I learned a lot from her about color. Its a lot of work at times & its never boring. If anything else her ass is worth it,1
"Lectures got to be very accelerated towards the end, and it became very difficult to follow along with what was going on. However, the three tests are very easy and you will be prepared if you do the practice midterms and review homework.",1
No Comments,1
"Best. Professor. Ever. She makes lectures fun and easy. Exams were easy, just make sure to study. If you have any questions, she will listen and help you understand. Shes amazing.",1
"As an English major, I dreaded coming to this class every day. I have never been more dissatisfied with an major required course.",0
"Dr. Kiesewetter is my favorite professor! She is extremely intelligent and wants her students to succeed. She provides her students with the material needed, clear notes, and office hours. If you want a good grade, you just need to work hard. If you do not do well in her class, this is your own fault. Also go to class!",1
It is crucial to do the webassigns for this class since all his quizzes and tests come from it. Trubatch isnt the best lecturer but he is very helpful if you ask for help one on one. Just work for the grade you want and you'll do fine :),1
"Patricia Brace is the best professor I have had at Laurentian. She knows her subject, and makes it as intresting as it can be. It is very clear she loves her job. As for the grades, she is a fair grader, and if anything in your personal life would arise, she is more tha willing to give you a few days grace for your projects.",1
"His lectures and notes are very clear and he makes every effort to help students succeed in class. His tests are well structured and he balances short answer/essay with multiple choice and matching. Overall, seems to enjoy teaching and helps students see that studying science isn't so scary.",1
Amazing prof.  Course was only so-so but his section was spectacular...so interesting and the way he teaches makes you want to stay in the class forever.,1
WOW,0
good,1
She's clearly passionate and very knowledgeable about her subject. You do have to go to class to pass- you'll fall behind (and/or fail if you miss 20% of the class) if not. You'll learn so much about how to be a good teacher- from personal stories that she tells and from the very useful textbooks and supplementary readings. I highly recommend her!,1
"Harding is one of my favorite professors since being here at Pitt. He's clear, the tests are amazingly easy, and his case papers are 2-3 pages long. He's super nice and makes the class discussion-based, so make sure to participate. He makes lecture slides that are pretty much exactly like the book, but you need the book for class to do activities.",1
"Professor Graham provided immediate feedback on homework and exams. Very well organized! There were almost daily webassign homework assignments, 11 or 12 written assignments, 4 exams and a final. This is a lot of work, but getting a poor score on one exam won't tank your grade. Note: this class was taken online during COVID lockdown",1
Very ez just show up it really as ez as that!!! If your looking for an A i would recomend this class,1
Ben was great for this course. Some people find R challenging - and he acknowledges that. He was always willing to help students in class and his office hours were very accessible. He makes it very clear what you need to do to do well on assignments. Follow those guidelines and youll be more than fine. Would take again!,1
"Best English professor I've ever dealt with! She is such a sweetheart, and she is very understanding. Her work is at a timely manner, she doesn't assign too much like others, and she is very communicative! If you have an issue she will gladly talk with you about it and help you resolve it. I would take her over again if needed to.",1
"I hate biology, but I really enjoyed this course! Maher is a great professor, and you can tell he's passionate about what he is teaching. Will go out of his way to explain things further during class to make sure you understand the concept. Very nice. Gives extra credit in the form of a question during class, so make sure you always go!",1
Shes good. Old school and she still uses a chalk board. She give a lot of homework but does not really check it unless you were late or absent. Your grade depends on the tests which are a huge chunk of your grade. However everything is on the study guide so youre okay. Attendance isnt enforced but its up to you to learn what you missed.,1
Good information. Great communicator. Wouldn't let us have a copy of the powerpoints that he whizzed through. I feel like I missed a lot of good info. Nice guy. Clear on what he wants. Fair grader. Took time with me to help me understand the material,1
"Lectures are very detailed and, therefore, helpful (if the material is new for you) or boring (if you know the stuff). If you did not understand anything during a lesson, he will explain it several times and not to go futher until you are satisfied with the answer.  Sometimes gives examples from real life to make you understand better.",1
Dr. Kelley is a overall good person but as a Professor she stern and the quizzes can be confusing and hard to pass. She grades her discussion boards thoroughly and harsh. Extra credit is hard to get as well. I cant recommend her for a 1010 class.,0
"She is such a sweet professor! She pretty much wouldn't hurt a fly! Class is only mandatory for clicker questions, other than that you will pretty much teach yourself from the book and online tests. good class.",1
"Took a subject I was expecting to hate and made it quite interesting. He's a huge dork, but I loved his teaching style. He does go off on tangents, as someone said, but they usually relate to the topic in some way that shows its practical use.",1
"Wetlands, H. Plants.  Extremely fair, excellent teacher.  He does not simply teach the subject, he teaches EVERYTHING!!!!  City dwellers be prepared to get your mind blown.  If you want to learn about nature take his courses.  If you take it because you need to get credits to finish your teaching degree, this is not for you. Do not disrespect him!",1
Lecture was super long winded and sometimes boring. But the material is interesting and he gives you all the information needed to pass with an A plus plenty of extra credit to help out if you need it.  Highly Recommended,1
"I had Prof Berry during the semester that we switched online due to COVID-19. Although it was a huge change for all of us, she really went above & beyond in her efforts to show up for us. Excel is not an easy class, but she made videos and held Zooms for all the tough concepts, responded quickly to emails, was a fair grader, etc. I 10/10 recommend.",1
She lectures off of notes everyday and they are so boring.  She is willing to help outside of class but it is so hard to learn during.  Take another biblit prof.  ,0
"I've had him 3, going on 4, courses. In mechanical and materials engineering. He is fair in expectations and grading. He definitely wants you to succeed. ",1
"Sad, sad case. She's hopelessly stuck in the effete, pseudo-philosophical theory camp of decades ago. Can't think outside rote memorization of Derrida and Heidegger. Ridiculously pretentious to boot. Study with a serious *scholar* instead.",0
Fantastic teacher.  Lectures are straight forward and highly organized. Provides Practice exam through the library. You are responsible for getting it and making copies.  I only read through the notes and memorized the practice exams and both my husband and I got A's in the class (and he is a History major).,1
"For someone who hates public speaking, Mrs. Jackson makes this class bearable. Her personality and class structure made the class fun. Grades you on your own personal improvements from each speech. Follow her rubric for each speech and keep up with your quizzes and the A is yours. If you need to take public speaking take it with Mrs. Jackson.",1
A memorable course indeed -- an orgo class that requires students to think about real-world issues!  This prof certainly is passionate about two things -- GOD and orgo...,1
"Morcillo is an excellent professor who gives three compositions, oral exam, two partial exams, and a final. His class is extremely easy, informative and has helped my GPA. I would only take him, he is beyond understanding and willing to work with his students. ",1
If you need a syllabus and clear guidelines for your classes then skip him. He tends to operate in grey areas. The class is a guaranteed A as long as you do the projects. You don't need to read or show up if you don't want. His lectures are very interesting though and worth showing up for. He gets you to think in a different way on some topics.,1
Dr. Roe is a great professor as long as you go and get help when needed. She is very open and caring about her students and is very easy to talk to. I would definitely recommend taking chemistry with her!,1
"Professor Bush is a nice guy! Lectures are fast and can be difficult to follow/focus on, though he is easily available outside of class and very helpful during office hours. You're probably going to have to go into office hours regularly if, like me, you're taking this for an FDR and not because math is your thing.",1
I really enjoyed this class. It was a very informative class and Dr. Westover did a great job at explaining things. I would highly recommend him to anyone. There was a lot of work but it was all helpful to the learning.,1
"The worst professor I've ever taken. Talks about herself, and is kind of rude to students. Forgets everything, sends assignment instructions out late, but still expects them to be due on their normal due dates. Doesn't teach anything. Don't take a class with her, ever.",0
"He is an easy grader on the papers. His directions are unclear, specifically on when his discussion posts are due when he opens them at random. Tests are easy if you use the book. Powerpoints are not really useful. Will email you back promptly. Ask for help or direction if u need it. Easy A, just did not want to work that hard for a music class.",1
"He's fine. But his lectures are unclear and he doesn't really know what he is talking about without his notes. He repeats what he says and the tests go along with what he says in class. Don't focus on what the slides say, focus on what he says in class.",1
Dr. Ranft is awesome! Just go to class and look at the exam questions before the exam before the exam date and you'll get a good grade. ,1
He did let you replace a test grade,0
"I had Dr. Kauanui for Conflict Management and she was great. She really worked with the class if we wanted to change around extra credit or grading, graded fairly, and although she rambled a bit at times, she was extremely helpful and knowledgable on the subject. I enjoyed her real life examples from her personal work experiences.",1
"There is so many terrific things I could say about this professor. It is true, you do need to work for your grade. She doesn't just hand out A's. If you need help she will take the time to help. I will be taking her again!",1
Best professor I've ever had. His class is easy because he does whatever he can to help you. Definitely worth taking!,1
He makes humorous examples to explain economics.,1
"This instructor said at the semester start that ""the book is wrong and confusing"" but then often recants that statement and says read ""the book it will help you"" he seems to flip-flop between these statements on a daily basis. He often says ""go to the Marc for help"" but then the next day if it is not the work he taught you than you're out of luck.",0
"The class itself is challenging, but I like working with her, she works hard to make sure the material was understood, she's good about clarifying assignments.",1
"The best teacher I've ever had, super easy!  You just have to study your study guide that she goes through with the class and gives us the correct answers the class before the test.  Only thing is there's only 4 tests throughout the semester and a final exam so you better do good on the tests!  TESTS ARE SUPER EASY JUST STUDY THE STUDY GUIDE",1
"This class requires a lot of tough thinking and sharing your opinions, as well as giving speeches both in front of the class and recorded but Prof Gentry makes it enjoyable and interesting.",1
She is the best Anatomy teacher I have had. Test are not to bad. I think we had 4-5 Test. She prints out notes that go along with the lectures powerpoint. Give you a break in the middle of class. Def would recommend having her!,1
"Professor Draper gives many hours a week for office hours. If you need anything from her, she will go out of her way to help you. However, she also expects her students to do the work. She works hard, and so must her students. The class discussions and material were insightful and thought-provoking. And she is especially knowledgeable about law.",1
"Awesome professor, keeps the class interesting and fun and is always there to answer questions.  He shows up early to class so if you need further help he is there.  Very cool.",1
I barely learned anything. The only reason I did well was from teaching myself and being taught by my friends. His class was useless because he just recites a lecture with no interaction and flies through the material. Good luck.,0
"A lot of map quizzes, but I found them easy and he drops your lowest two grades. As long as you study and pay attention you will pass.",1
She was the best Biology teacher I have ever had. She had a way of really making things clear and interesting.,1
Good prof,1
One of the greatest professors I've ever taken. He is very knowledgeable and tells a lot of fun facts. His class is very easy to pass and interesting. I would highly recommend him. Be prepared to read a lot and do homework on the reading. There are no quizzes and for the tests consists of writing a paper based on questions. Take him!!!!!!!,1
"Mrs. Fox is a very good professor. Very detailed syllabus, with all information you need to succeed in class. All online, including the book. Schedule to print that includes all assignments and due dates. Fox gives feedback on all outlines of writing assignments to help you improve. She offers extra credit. Fox can always be reached by e-mail.",1
"Professor Vannozzi is a really nice guy who will go out of his way to even give you a ride home if you needed it, but when it comes to his class get ready for long lectures and lots of memorization of him talking. He is a very picky grader, but it overall prepares you for the real world and how some companies pay close attention to detail.",1
"I withdrew from Ms. Lytle's class because she was very difficult to contact, seemed picky, and assigned a speech outline the first week without giving us any information or examples about how to do it. Perhaps she would be better in person.",0
"Dr. Ortega is extremely passionate about teaching and making sure his students find a genuine interest in his lectures. Class was enjoyable and I recommend taking notes and showing up, especially for iClicker!! Study your notes and his powerpoints and the exam shouldnt be a problem. Highly recommend taking the course, and Dr. Ortega!!",1
Awesome professor!,1
One of the funniest professors I've had. He gives out quizzes at the beginning of every class but they become so routine that they can't even be considered pop quizzes. Each quiz is based off of the homework or problems we did in the previous class and then similar questions are used on the test. Easiest way to pass is to do the work he assigns.,1
Interesting only when engaged in a discussion.  Lecture is very dry. Good sense of humor. Don't bother following study guide because his tests are off the wall.,1
Great,1
"I loved having DR. Sheridan for my HIST class! He is a super easy grader, I submitted a lot of papers I wasn't 100% proud of and never got anything lower than a 90 on anything. His online summer course is fast-paced, but easy to complete. You have to watch films and read three novels but he gives you the textbook so it's not more than $40 total!",1
"Great professor; you have to listen and you have to work to do well, but he's passionate about his field and it really flows over into his lectures. Recommend all the way.",1
"I had him in high school, possibly one of the best teachers I'd had back then. Now I got him again, I purposefully took this class just to have him teach me again. Without a doubt I can say out of all my current profs he is probably the coolest one I've had so far. He is sarcastic, friendly, and he goes above and beyond. You cannot ask for better.",1
"Very knowledgeable about the subject matter, but lacks commitment to the class and appears unreliable. An A is  realistic, if you give a decent effort. His lackadasical attitude toward the class (several missed classes), poor communication) have the ability to make you lazy. You just have to remain focused throughout the semester.",1
"Great,funny instructor. Great role-player, be ready for therapeutic communication. One of the most emotional lectures you will have. You will feelknow that she has passion and that she cares about students. ",1
"Dr. Curtis is a nice lady but her lectures are all over the place. She does not go over much in class and she makes her test extremely hard. Their are only 3 test, which is basically your whole grade, so if you do bad on one test you are screwed for the rest of the semester. I would not recommend.",0
She is not clear on the homework assignments and when you ask questions it just becomes less understandable Also shes crazy about attendance. She is a good lady just not a good teacher.4 major assignments and mid term and final are take home & take 8-20 hrs its no joke. would not recommend. grades very hard and doesn't put up grade till weeks later,0
"Excellent professor. Best and most interesting first year professor by far. Lectures are debate intensive, interesting and extremely entertaining. Notes and paying attention in class are critical! Well worth it, for the jokes, and the knowledge!",1
"If your looking for a class you can pass by paying close attention and taking lots of notes, turn around. Wells was very nonreceptive to questions and clarifications at the beginning of the course, and her teaching style is very ""if you dont remember something from a previous math course im not going to help you remember"". Iook fora different prof.",0
"Show up to class and youll pass, few quizzes usually pretty easy. Does talk a lot in class occasionally will go off topic but eventually will get back to his point. Definitely would take him again though, learned more with him than with my first semester professor.",1
"Kids on here complaining about having to memorize site locations and artifacts... its an archaeology class! She has a wealth of knowledge and is more than willing to elaborate on things if you ask. This course isn't an ""easy A"", that makes some arts students mad. Pro tip: show up, listen and take pictures of figures, you'll get an A, guaranteed!",1
"Koehler is the best teacher I've ever had in college. Not only is he super knowledgeable about music, he teaches you quite a bit about life as well. Really cool dude. Also a baller piano player, so if you're an aspiring pianist he's the guy to talk to. I'd take every class with Ray if I could.",1
"I had Professor Richmond for psychology my fall 2020 online semester. Her class is super straight forward, and it is an easy a for sure!! Her assignments consist of discussion posts, quizzes, and learning activities. There are no exams, not even a final. She is very good with communication as well. I recommend her 100%!",1
"Dr. P is amazing. She truly cares about you and will help you to the extreme to not only pass her class, but also to do well throughout your college life. This class helps you understand many things that are unclear to a new student and she opens doors and opportunities for you. She is the best, and you will not regret taking her class.",1
AWESOME Teacher!,1
"Do not take Mr. Weiner's class. Do not. He doesn't answer questions, there are a lot of assignments. He is stubborn in his opinion. He can be very rude. The class is like a high-level sociology class instead of an intro class. There is so much reading and if you don't understand it he patronizes you. Just find some other professor, please.",0
"AHHHH! i loved this teacher, personally don't like English, he made it fun, talked about relevant topics in todays society. Actually cares for his students, tries to help students with anything acts young/can really relate to students gives 3 different prompts for each essay  overall, really good prof, really cool/understanding",1
I have never hated a class or professor more than this guy. This website doesn't allow me to express how i really feel about him. All the negative reviews are correct. Do yourself a favor and take another class.,0
"Went into the semester looking forward to having her as I've heard she was a great teacher. All she did for our class was powerpoint after powerpoint (and they are not posted online). She is very passive aggressive, and got angry when students would take notes on their laptops. Won't take another class from her.",0
"This professor is a total jerk who is only interested in his own opinion. If you type a paper and he doesn't like your view then your grade will definitely suffer. If possible, take anyone else. He is the absolute worst prof. I went to him for clarification on a grade, and he gave no assistance. I am an A student who received a D!",0
Mr. Ed is the reason why iam doing so good in school. the best teacher I ever had.,1
"Not the most organized, but  flexible.  Passionate about the subject.  Focus on vocabulary, like he says, and you will get an A. Vocab, vocab, vocab. He explains grammar better than the three other EnglishArabic professors I've had. Brilliant man. ",1
"Professor Fergurson is an amazing professor. For his Global MKTG class, most of the semester is preparing you for the group project. The book is useless and his exams are on Quizlet or Coursehero. Pay attention, form a study group, and take the tests together! The test bank varies and you can see your questions you missed/got right at the end of it",1
"I did this one online, the content was nothing I hadn't studied in high school. Just a brush up course really. No homework online and you can do the exams anytime you like. I finished early so I could focus on other subjects. He was always quick back with emails but you're probably better off getting help in the LRC.",1
Teaches ethic theories and relates to contemporary issues,1
"This is the second class Ive taken with Prof. K and I wish I could take a third. Shes one of the best teachers Ive ever had. She wants you to learn, and tries to facilitate that in SO many ways! As long as you participate and communicate, her classes are awesome.",1
Shes rude. She teaches us stuff in which The class doesnt believe will benefit us. She also tried to get loud with a student because He didnt have his flash drive. Like idk what type of teacher treats there student in such a rude way. Its unacceptable.,0
He is good in teaching. But don't use proper material for studies.,1
loved her! Gives everything you need to pass her course. definitely go to the supplemental instruction courses! I earned a B in the course but because I went to multiple SI sessions she bumped it to a B+,1
"Amazing German guy, he's funny, energetic and he knows what students need. His lectures are bearable and he comes up with new ways for students to participate even in a 150 person lecture hall. Highly recommend taking this class with him. The class is largely dependent on easy homework and quizzes. Just remember to do the homework!",1
"These descriptions are correct for the most part. His tests are more understanding than memorizing. They are multiple choice with some free response questions. Make sure you study everything from his study guide. I found the book helpful when filling it out. Pay attention in class so you do well on the random clicker quizzes, you will do very well.",1
She's very helpful and nice. Willing to do everything for her students.,1
"Ms. Gordon will work with you and she explain the work.  IF you do not show up for class she will drop you,(makes room for the ones that want to learn). Very easy going and I have her for all my math.",1
You get what you put into the class knowledge wise. You can just show up for the midterm and final and get away with an A . But i would highly encourage you to go. Mensah is one of those professors that really should not be at Howard and took major pay cuts to be here. Though it does not come across all the time he is extremely knowledgeable.,1
Lynn Baker is an amazing math teacher! She can mess up at times but she knows exactly what she is doing! She helps other students when they need it and always stay after class to help them! Easy grader as long as you turn in everything on time. This was the only class I enjoyed out of the other classes I had!,1
"This professor, doesnt teach anything about English. He goes and explains History. Nothing to do with English!",0
One of the best profs I've ever had.  Very good looking too!,1
"Great Class, Great Professor",1
"No exams. Weekly 500-word essays, 2000-word final paper, 20 minute weekly discussion videos. Easy class",1
"Had him for Calc I, really easy!! Tests are from homework problems, and just memorize couple of theories.",1
"He is a genius. Hi class can be boring for some because, his strategy and counter strategy is based on numbers and is a mix of economics and finance. The best prof I had so far in MBA!! hands down !!",1
awful,0
Michelle ROCKS!!! one of my best profs at SU. Always ready to help.,1
Do not take this class he is so hard to understand he has an accent. He is also old so he is sooooo boring I had him at 8am and I could not keep my eyes open.  He also does not teach so well . Many test,0
"The lectures and homework are much more in depth than exams. If you listen to the lectures and do the homework, the exams are an easy A! I love this class!",1
This was a challenging class that I feel I learned a lot from. I enjoyed all the lectures and learning about other religions of the world.,1
"Before coming to college, I heard horror stories about crazy professors who didn't care if you got an A or an F. Dr. Hauck proved those stories wrong. He set time outside of class to help me understand all of the material I didn't understand. His tests were straightforward if you paid attention during lecture, and he was super fun in lab. Take him!",1
"One of my favorite professors I've had thus far. Going to every lecture is necessary as she does not post her power points online but she uses humor and pop culture examples to make them interesting and fun so showing up everyday is definitely not a drag. Exams are fairly easy, study and go to review sessions and you should be fine.",1
Wonderful teacher. She inspired me and made the class a significant experience.,1
"Bertram is the most fast-paced a&p professor I've ever had. I've taken an a&p series before and this is one class you do NOT want to rush through. He barely goes into depth about anything so be prepared to study. He does give some EC though, but his tests are TOUGH and NOT what he lectures on - VERY detailed. He's pretty much all over the place.",1
Weird guy.  Grades hard.  Boring lectures.  Guy's a total slacker.  Avoid if you can.,0
Amazing teacher! Anything to do with math is really hard for me to learn and understand but he is so nice and cares about the students so he always offers help and extra credit and wants to make it easy for everyone. He made psych stats painless and manageable! 10/10,1
"I have him for statistics and I must say, I never knew statistics could be fun! Yay for Kevin!",1
Doesn't know what she wants to say to the class. Doesn't have any type of lecture plan. Teaches very slow and speaks very low.  ,0
"Very well organized. Gives a couple of papers. Nothing you can't handle. Prepares you for test, etc.",1
"I am so grateful to have Mark as my professor. I took two geology classes with him. I wish all professors would like him. Online quizzes, in class mid term and final are easy if you have paid attention to his lectures. Test reviews are great! Will take him again and again! :)",1
I got to say. Im currently enrolled in her online psych 1 class and its not like the typical psych class. She treats discussions lile english exams and the topics are so mediocre on discussions,0
"There's a lot of readings to do, but if you read them all and attend all lectures and sections, it's not that hard to get an A. Beware of bad TAs though, because it's an asian-american class the TAs might seem a little anti-white, just take section with a grain of salt",1
"Most of us were intimidated on the first day until we got to know her. This instructor was amazing, you had to work for your grade but you learned a lot. Feedback was very helpful.",1
"Dr. Brooks was grea, he supplied great feedback and he will have you submit rough drafts that he will edit so it makes the final essays easier to get a better grade on. He was very nice overall.",1
No Comments,1
"Dr. Pittman is a great teacher. She's a little awkward and ""corny"" as she describes herself but she is incredibly passionate about her job and her students success is genuinely her main interest. She told my class in the beginning of the semester that she will do everything short of write your papers for you and it's true. I highly recommend her.",1
"Mark truly has a passion for what he teaches. His lectures are engaging and fun. I am not huge into religion, but I would definitely take another religion course if it was with him.",1
Best Teacher Ever,1
"He's a good teacher, very nice and humble.  Happy to answer questions and help outside of class.  Lots of guest speakerspresentations from the actual arizona forensic labs.  Very interesting.  He's pretty straight forward.  Would definitely recommend taking this class for a basic fingerprintsfirearmsquestioned document refresher.",1
"Not a fan. The class does not encourage engagement and you don't get much from it. You can study 2 hours before test without any other work through the semester for your A. Frustrating, as even if you do want to self teach, the provided resources are hard to navigate and hard to understand. Don't take physics at MCTC.",0
"I would advise not to take this class unless you really want to and already have a deep understanding of packets and how they are made up. It also helps to have a good understanding of Wireshark, nmap and other Net Sec tools. You will know if you won't pass his class as he sends out 2 different emails telling you if it is possible to pass or not",1
Swift is excellent! Very easy teacher but I learned a lot in his class. I took AP stats in high school and covered all of the same material but Swift takes a different angle that is aimed at liberal arts students.,1
"Dr. Hoffman was a great  intro biochem professor! He makes the material really manageable and easy to follow. If you go to class, read/skim the book, and do the practice questions that he posts online, you will be fine!",1
Very easy to work with. Understanding and clear,1
"C'est la première fois que je prends la peine de noter un prof. Si vous avez la chance de prendre un nôtre professeur, faites-le. Il est gentil, mais pas claire. Tout le monde est mêlé en cours. Je ne comprends pas pourquoi il y a des gens qui l'ont bien noté. Je trouve le cours très difficile, la raison principale est lui. (J'ai eu 90 en sco1250.)",0
"Not that much homework but does give a lot of in-class journal assignments that count for marks. Gives two main essays, one is a take home and the other you have two classes to write. Pretty easy class if you put in the effort and she's a very sweet person!",1
Knows what he is talking about for sure. Not an easy class though. Don't mess around,1
"If you've taken ENG 308, here it is again...I think Pam tried to switch things up a little bit, but it was hard to see over the sarcasm and fake smiles.  Good luck!",0
Scott is a great prof. His class is enjoyable! Although he is a very tough marker! Be ware you must put in work in order to do well ! Seek clarification when needed and ask questions in order to improve,1
Get ready to fail this class. No matter what you do. No matter if you study 24 hours a day. At the end you will not pass the class. Really tough grader and very confusing. tons of homework and quizzes. you will get crazy of studying. Please Please Please do not take a class with him because you wont get good grades nor understand mathematics.,0
"I was nervous about having him b/c of negative comments from students. But he's actually a fair professor, being if you want to pass his class you won't be trick with materials outside of the class. He'll tell you what's on the exam. He's clear when explaining anything you don't understand. AWESOME PROOFS PROFESSOR EVER!!!",1
"Dr. Weiner's course was very difficult, he assigns a lot of work with strict (but clear) grading criteria, and he expects a great deal from his students. Even so, the things I learned in his class I have thought about nearly every day since I took it in 2018, he was very inspirational and I highly recommend taking his class.",1
Professor Stevenson is amazing! Anatomy lab can be quite long but her lectures are interesting and she is very clear about what she expects you to know. Tests and quizzes are straightforward and she doesn't try to trick you. She also makes sure to give credit where credit is due. Highly recommend!!!,1
"Professor Bronie is such a great teacher! Do the homework, study and ask questions and you will pass her class. She provides her students with a lot of useful handouts and resources to prepare you for her tests and to gain a better understanding of Math. Her class is not easy, but its worth it. She wants all her students to succeed.",1
"Listen, he's a good teacher but his final review was an 18-page packet and on top of that 70 vocab words to know. Little ridiculous if you ask me.",1
"Christina is a funny and wonderful person, dont be intimidated by the bad reviews. Christina is very friendly and the classroom environment is relaxed. Due dates for assignments change a lot based on how she thinks how far everyone is. If u r a visual learner it might be harder for u b/c she doesn't show examples of upcoming projects so TAKE NOTES",1
"le pire prof que j'ai jamais connu, a eviter a tout prix",0
"It's not easy to get A from Dr. Moore, but if you want to learn something and get some real training, take her course.",1
Professor Mingo was such an amazing instructor. I felt that she really cared about us and she was very understanding. I took the course online and it was well organized. It's an easy class.,1
"This is an English class, having to write many papers should not come as a surprise. Lisa is absolutely wonderful. She's so helpful, lenient, and understanding. Papers were very reasonable and of course she wants you to work hard on them but she isn't a super tough grader. There used to be a 12 pg final but instead she added one more 4-7pg essay.",1
"I took this class over the summer. Dr.Z is very helpful. If you dont understand his lecture, just ask him. Always willing to help. He does give EC during quizzes and exams. If you attend lectures, do your homeworks and do all your labs, you will do good and get A. He is very funny. Class is not boring at all. Very nice teacher.",1
Great teacher,1
"I'm another that took his online class. He was always very timly in posting grades and offered timely, constructive feedback. Highly recommended.",1
He is the best professor ever!,1
"Great teacher, you can get as much out of the class as you put in, quick to respond and easy grading system.",1
"I loved Adriano! He honestly really wants to see his students succeed and is really engaging and entertaining in class. He does require a lot of reading and expects people to participate, but he is funny and quirky and very lively.",1
"I took the online class intro to programming class. Teacher had clear expectations. Teacher is very well organized and makes learning the material easier. Super helpful when you didn't understand something. Overall, this teacher was great!",1
DEAN DOESN'T KNOW HIS RED PINE FROM HIS SCOTCH PINE!,0
"Best teacher! Very fair and very helpful, great class discussions.",1
"Close to retirement & she could care less, skips steps when teaching, Hates 2 show how 2 work problem fully, 2 HW assignments & quizzes online wkly, Shell never know how well u do individually because all work is done & graded online, Test are in class & must show work & thats the only time shell know if u know how 2 do prob & still wont care",0
"Dr. A is one of the best professors I've ever had. He has a great teaching style and he his happy to help you. If I were you guys, I would definitely take this professor because he is very kind and would want you to succeed.",1
"ALOT of weekly assignments. It is challenging to be on top of it because there are many assignments and 1 major individual project. I've learned alot about marketing due to these assignments she gives. She is kind-of a tough grader. If you can't do EASY (multiple) weekly tasks, then this class isn't for you. DONT BUY THE TEXTBOOK.",1
Professor Smiley is by far one of the best English professor's that I've had. I'm usually not good in English as a subject but she made me a better writer when I do essays. I took her for English 101 and 102 and I pass the class with an A and B. She was very caring in her students and wants her students to understand the materials. She is awesome.,1
"""If you don't read EACH chapter THREE times before the test, you won't get above an 80."" He's not lying, his tests are extremely hard and you learn 20 chapters in 3 short months. Your saving grace will be the MindTap homeworks and the business plan. Really passionate marketing guy, really hard professor.",0
I was in his office almost every day with questions. Took this class as a freshman (frowned upon but worth it) I think he saw potential in me and helped me a lot. ASK QUESTIONS outside of class bc he will answer them. This was an 8am and I looked forward to it every day bc I loved it. He makes class fun and you can actually have a convo with him.,1
Marlow is a very good english teacher but hes hard as hell!!  He expects the best out of you and expects you to have your work on time.  You have four major papers and the first two are fairly easy.  The last two are research papers and they get somewhat hard esp the last one.  He will have you ready for your next three years of college. Great guy!,1
"Mrs. Elfring is an absolute Gem of a professor, who makes the subject fun and worth putting the time and effort into. Right from the start she created a comfortable work environment and this is actually one of the few classes I've been in where everyone talks and communicates with one another. Easily the best and or funnest class I've taken at ECC.",1
Professor Scoville is a great man with a big heart. I would have enjoyed the class more if we didn't get stuck on the small things and focused more on the larger topics.,0
Excellent teacher!! I recommend her classes!! I learned alot from her. Her class is easy if you pay attention in class.,1
"Tom is on of the many reasons why I love learning about sociology. His class was hands down the most challenging class that I have taken at ISU and he requires an immense amount of work from his students but you just have to trust him and his ways of teaching. He's a professor who encourages and cares for his students, definitely worth taking!",1
"Dr. Maher's exams are harder than I would have liked, but his quizzes help with grades, and give you a good idea about what the exams look like. They typically have quite a few short answers/essays, so be prepared to know what you're talking about. Overall, he makes class interesting with the studies he includes, along with cute videos.",1
"Notes/lectures on the website. HW and projects get progressively harder. HW eventually strays away from the notes, so it gets frustrating to find answers. Can be rude on random days. Exams are multiple choice. Just study off the past exams he gives. Curve is dependent on how smart the top 1/3 are as 1/3 gets A. No guidance on Proj after part 1.",0
"For the sake of your gpa and wanting to graduate on time DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR! He's one of the worst professors I have ever had. I've never failed a class before him. If you take him, good luck.",0
"Overall good, chill, helpful teacher. Textbook is a must, but I just used the one on reserve in the library. There's a decent amount of reading each week, not too difficult though. As long as you do the homework, participate, miss very minimal classes, you'll get an A",1
"she is very knowledgeable, if you follow her instructions you will be fine",1
I love Michelle Hunt. She is very good at explaining things. Shares power points online. Knows everyones name in a 50+ person lecture. Organized. Tests are fair. Listen and take notes in lecture and you are set. Never assigned reading from textbook. Sweetest lady you will ever meet. Taking her again next semester for Anatomy II. ,1
Just an over all great teacher. Didnt make the class drag and made it interesting to be there,1
Great teaching style.  Very fair.,1
There is no document of civilization that is not at the same time a document of barbarism.,1
Doctor Odedukun is a very  good professor. He explains so well for every one to understand. i found his lab classes very interesting. he gives study guides for every exam. i would take him again  for 2060 is available.,1
One of the greatest professors I've ever encountered. Would recommend to anyone.,1
"Professor Garrisi was super helpful before quizzes and tests.  All the material is from the textbook and homework sheets. Save the homework. Start working on the hiragana and katakana right away coz KANJI comes  mid-term. The writing practices on-line helped the most, just keep practicing. She is very sweet and  is excited about teaching.",1
"boring course,too many things need to remember. don't waste your time.my GPA is 3.5 and got a c in his course.worse grade i ever got. don't expect he will curve Hundreds of slides notes. if you want to suicide, take his ee333.",0
"Best teacher ever!! Gave study guides and they were practically the test!! If you want an A, take Mrs. V; she's awesome!(:",1
"This is an Intro to Java class. Coming from not knowing any Java, I quite enjoyed it. She is usually late to class and it seems like there isn't any lesson plan she follows. Takes awhile for her to grade things. Codelab is a waste of time so just get the answers off the internet. Expect to spend a lot of time later in the term on assignments.",0
I loved this class. She always keeps things interesting and is very funny and nice. I learned so much! I highly recommend her and this class,1
"Seems to not be aware that this is the 21st century and that everybody has phones and needs them for different, but important, things. Also incredibly petty and likes to gloat about his past. Loves to bemoan class about not remembering every detail of the notes. Do not recommend taking his class, but if you do prepare for misery and a bad time.",0
"Absolutely loved her assignments. They were always eccentric and fun to do, and great ways to exercise a writer's mind. She's a tough grader but she always gives great feedback. The only issue I had with her was how much she'd go off on tangents about her life during lectures, which made it really hard for me to focus. Overall a pretty good prof.",1
No Comments,1
Easy A and you learn a lot. Teacher gives good feedback and the work is not difficult. Quizlet is your best friend!,1
loved him! He was so nice and understanding and teaches the material clearly. Just do the assigned stuff and you'll pass with a B- or higher.,1
omg... i did not have a good experience withthis professor. She failed me on a paper but never gives an explanation why. i only saw her once a week and i dreaded everytime i went. i did however make a b in her class suprisingly.,0
"he was a rly good french teacher but he is also a very hard marker. Though when he teaches you see that he's passionate about it. He can have some interesting stories to tell the class when he goes off topic, which is often. :)",1
"Prof Perez is one of the best professors I have taken in my college career. There are a total of One manual, One Tech Report, One Lab Report and a Group Project. He gives clear instructions on what he wants and if you dont understand he will explain it to you. If you ever get to take him for a class do it, you wont regret it.",1
"Avoid this professor,  tests are very wordy, so if English is your second language you will not get a good mark. If only she could bring her enthusiasm into her actual teaching abilities.",0
Sonia is the best!,1
"I LOVE HER! Hartman was a great prof to have. She was so understanding; clear on her expectations; gave amazing feedback; gave plenty of time for projects, and assigned fun projects. Dr. Hartman is not that challenging but she does have high expectations and expects participation. I would take her for every English/Comp class if I could. 10/10 lady",1
Great instructor! Lots of fun and variety in her class and she knows how to give you a good workout.  I recommend her if you a semi-boot camp workout.,1
Dan is best. I really recommend this class if you are interested in the health field or just want an awesome class.,1
Professor Coleman is a very smart professor and knows his information. he gives a couple extra credit opportunities during the course. the main factor to doing well in this class is preparing hard for the tests and keeping up with the online homework. i would take this class again no question.,1
"Dr. B. is a great professor, however he is definitely someone who won't go easy on you. A little harsh, sometimes, but he wants to prepare you for college, so. Lots of essay practice, but they're fairly easy, and overall the class was not hard at all.",1
"At first Dr. Richards seems loud and intimidating, but you will realize how much she does to ensure her students have the information they need to succeed. She really cares about her students; that being said, she will push you to make you better! Everything I've learned in her class has honestly made me a better teacher and a better human being.",1
"Keval is great in that she cares about you, but she wants everything to be exactly how she likes it and won't accept anything else. There is little room for artistic freedom. I did like the class though.",1
Mehmeti was decent as a teacher. Gives out a copious amount of homework for an introductory course.,1
"Brian is really cool and approachable. He gives very helpful, relevant lectures to teach technique and photoshop tools and is willing to support you and help you with your unique direction. Take him for any digital classes you can!",1
"Great professor, I learned a lot from real world business person. I liked the way he related the material to current situations in business.",1
I really enjoyed this class. I liked how there were transcripts for the videos so I could use them for studying. I also liked that everything was laid out as far as clear expectations and all the lesson were available so if you wanted/needs to work at your own pace you could.  I also appreciate how accessible Dr. Kelley was.,1
"He's an excellent educator and mentor. He clearly knows what he's talking about and he's passionate about it too, so it's hard to get bored or lose interest. He'll keep you busy but he's very empathetic towards college students and extremely approachable if you need anything. As long as you put forth an effort to do the work, you'll be fine.",1
"Dennis is the absolute best. Straightforward class, well-divided between lecture and interactive examples. He embodies ""chill:"" never seen him not calm, cool, and helpful, and he turns mistakes into constructive lessons. This man loves Organic Chem, but understands that you don't. Never condescending. I wouldn't doubt that he can fly either.",1
"He is very good at explaining and will repeat explanations if not understood. Although Anatomy and Physiology is tough, he tries to make it easier for the students by clear explanations. I enjoyed his class and will recommend him to students",1
"He was very knowledgeable when it came to the material but I felt like he covered it too quickly. The final is open note/open book, but you need to do the reading throughout the semester otherwise his exams will seem impossible.",0
"Class was a little boring, but I definatly learned a lot about music.  The tests are pretty easy and straight from the notes if you study.  Just don't miss too many days!",1
"He is extreme passionate about his work,very understanding. Lectures are based souly on his power points. He puts lots of information in the tests that is not covered in class. If you show up to his SI he will answer any questions you have. I asked all the questions on the study guide and my grade has increased significantly. Good luck!  ",0
"She's extremely nice and always there to help with anything you need. Discussions are based on readings and sometimes go off topic but they are usually interesting. Very relaxed type of class. Not many grades, but all assignments are simple. The final is an essay basically on what you learned in class (not a research paper). Easy A",1
"Great prof! The lectures for the class are online. Also, he provides potential question ahead of the midterm in order to help out students! He guides students throughout the process of their essay! He is a caring prof and must-take if possible!",1
"Good teacher, helped with resume.  Classwork was not hard, tests were not easy but in all if you attend class and listen to the lectures you will pass the class.  He is a great teacher with a good heart.",1
"yaya she was easy but i like SOC and i ddnt learn a whole lot, that made me mad,the tests were easy, and projects were eay but i wanted to understand the material, not just sit and do group activities. id take her if you needed the class, if SOC is your major, then no way jose.",1
"Took Human Impacts on the Environment with Beck. She's a good professor and good person. Do well on the papers. They are worth as much as the tests. Put in effort and you should get nothing worse than a B. Some of the test questions were worded in a way that made easy concepts confusing. Overall, good professor.",1
"Mr. Wells is very thorough and is very interested in the material he teaches. His tests are generated from his lectures and his lectures tend to be fast paced. He jokes around but uses class time wisely. If you miss a lecture, it's somewhat hard to catch up because there's a lot of material covered in each lecture. Great professor overall though.",1
"Professor Bronie really cares about her students excelling in mathematics Shes very charismatic about the subject. Be prepared to memorize the methods that she requires for solving certain equations, lots of homework and tough grading. Overall, shes a great teacher that pushes her students.",1
Tough grader. Sometimes his grading doesn't make sense but he give ample opportunity to revise assignments. If you put in the effort and he can clearly see you're trying your best he'll help you out a lot. I also did 207 which wasn't listed in the dropdown menu.,1
I can honestly say I liked his sense of humore but I always thought that I had a talent for writing well- untill I took this class. There is NO professor for this course that I would recommend. You will have a crapload of frustrations no matter what. It's not easy.,1
"He told me that ""since I was not a chemistry major, I don't need to pass his class"" and was not very helpful during lecture or office hours. You can tell he knows what he's talking abt but has a hard time relaying it, MAYBE would have been good if I had a strong chem background. But not very ""user friendly"" for an INTRO TO CHEM prof :(",0

Arguably one of my favorite professors! Participation does count towards your grade so make sure you're in class. His exams are really easy if you study the material he gives you as well as the textbook. He made ANT 2750 such a fun and exciting class. If you need to take this class- DO IT WITH HIM!!,1
"Take this professor! You will learn a lot and there is not much work to do. Just show up to class, meet his expectations and you'll get an A.",1
"best teacher I've had, he's a good time forsake might take one of classes just to have him again",1
"Trubatch knows his material, but is not the best at explaining. He's a great guy, and grades pretty easily, but many complained about his exams being hard. His exams make you take the material to the next level, and you will have to read the book sometimes on your own or you will not do well. WebAssigns teach you more than his lectures do.",1
"Very easy class, but lectures kinda drag sometimes TBH.",1
"Felicia is super chill. She always answers questions, and the homework is long but usually not hard. She provides study guides that make the test pretty easy. Tests are worth most of the class so study hard.",1
This class only had one test and one major project. She was super caring and made students feel like their opinions mattered. This class is worth taking.,1
"There are 3 exams and 4 team assignments. The exams are short essays and there are study guides for each test. She gives up to 10 points if you complete the study guide, in which helps A LOT!. She is an amazing professor who knows what she's talking about, very helpful outside of class. Definitely recommend!!",1
"There are assignments due for each class, they usually are pretty short though. Sometimes her grading criteria is unclear but she is willing to work with the students to change. There is A LOT of small group work so be prepared to meet EVERYONE in your class because she will make you work with different people multiple times in one class period.",1
good teacher,1
"Professor's reading assignments mostly consist of his own writings that summarize thinkers like Hegel, Locke, etc. in a few short paragraphs -- so this course doesn't really teach you about sociology or how to critically analyze texts, just parrot back his own ideas of who these people are. Seems very self-indulgent.",0
"She grades on subject matter more than formatting. You get the bare minimum for feedback, and the course work was a joke. 2 essays and 2 power points. She teaches the bare minimum and by that I mean you get the link to the Purdue OWL site. Her class is a waste of tuition and you probably won't get an A unless you write on issues she agrees with.",0
"Excellent Prof for Kin150, very help full as long as you seek her help.  Written exams (short answers) are straight forward, NO trick questions, if you study, you will do good.  She marks practicals according to one's ability, and how challenging the sequence was to YOU.   Her marking is very fair, and consistent.  Keith Russells's prodigy.",1
"I agree with another student on this page: THIS CLASS IS NOT AN EASY A. It was nearly my first B of my MBA career due to how insanely hard he grades the discussions. Yes, discussions of all things! I've never struggled so hard to get an A on discussion work, as he admittedly RARELY gives full credit in this area. Strange approach to grading.",1
"Professor Leonard made the class as straight forward as you will find. Show up, read, and do the study guides and the tests should be a breeze. There are a lot of notes to write down but they are so helpful on the test. 90% of test questions are word for word on study guide.  As for lab, just show up and put in some effort and again you'll be fine.",1
"This class was the hardest college course I have ever taken. It was my only B in my college career. He puts so much weight on a group project and gives you all equal grades, so even if you do all the work and the other people in your group do nothing, you will still do bad. I had an A in the class until the final project. Tons of reading.",1
I don't know if it is him or the class itself but it's VERY difficult. Makes you feel stupid when asking questions and poor office hour times.,0
"I took this teacher online for medical terminology and she was amazing, she was able to answer all of my questions very quickly. Plus she made the material very easy to understand.",1
"Dr. Arevalo is such a kind soul. Her lectures were intensive, but they were very helpful and I learned a lot. Her exams were tough, but she helped her students to prepare. She was always very helpful during office hours and really cares about her students. <3",1
"Prof. Draper is one of the most supportive, flexible instructors that I've had at this school. She goes above and beyond to help students and teaches with such clarity and genuine empathy. This pandemic has been stressful for a lot of us; having an instructor as fair and caring as Dr. Draper makes this all so much easier. Highly recommend.",1
"Power point reading in a monotone voice in an early am class  zzz!! Expect to make use of the tutors in order to get your questions answered. She is very unclear, only uses simple problems as examples, does not really seem to know the material well herself. She acts as if questions should not be expected and are an inconvenience to her. ",0
"Very nice, very fair grading, keeps class interesting",1
"Dr. Colavecchia is simply one of the best, if not best profs. I have come across at McMaster. She is insightful and explains theories and content in her lectures in a way that gets students to think outside the box. Her classes challenged my own views of society and I am so privileged to have been taught by her. Amazing person.",1
Micah is my favorite design professor at Weber State. He gives good feedback and truly cares about his students. I look forward to his classes and have learned a lot from him.,1
"Not a very helpful professor. She may be funny sometimes and enthusiastic about her topics, but when it comes to student's opinions, she is not very open. Assignments were not clear and feedback was not helpful at all. ",0
Very good prof. Attendance mandatory if you want to do well.,1
Amazing class with an amazing professor. He gets to know the students who reach out to him. You can really tell how much he loves the material,1
Jason was the best professor I've had at UT. He was always available for questions from students and made lectures fun and interesting. The TAs were really great too. The topics covered were relatively simple so I wish we had been able to cover a little more. The workload for this class was relatively manageable. I highly recommend this class.,1
Although the class was extremely boring (2 hours 3 times a week with an hour of lecture and a hour of recitation back to back) Dr. Ross was very informative upon showing example problems to where it was easy to understand the material. Also his 2 midterms and final were very easy as long as you studied and he provided many extra credit chances.,1
"He gives a lot of assignments and doesn't always grade quickly, but it's not hard at all to get an A in his class. Also had to complain about a group member going AWOL and he took it into account and went even easier on us. Also midterm is take home, and no real final. Strongly recommend overwriting each assignment and adding details from class",1
Professor Guttmann is by far the best professor I've had. He used to be the chair of the department and is so passionate about economics. He doesn't write on the board often so make sure you're ready to take a lot of notes. Make sure you meet with him before the test about the essay questions because he helps a lot! You have to work for your grade!,1
"Weekly homework takes a while. Lectures are pretty straightforward, the Italian accent was not an issue. She had a tendency to rush a few topics towards the end. I highly recommend reading the txtbk ch. before class. Most important thing is to stay on top of the topics, the last thing you want to do in this class is be confused/behind on topics.",1
Dan Clark is a great professor. He really is good at math and cares if you are understanding the material. He even takes time out of class to organize study sessions before tests. The class isn't easy and will require a lot of work.,1
"Disappointing. not willing to help much when I'd go in for office hrs. took the whole semester to grade our 3 tax return group projects and 1 individual tax memo. Exams are open book/open note and straight forward if you study, about 20 MC/ TrueFalse and 4 problems. boring, hard to follow lectures. didnt try to get students involved during class",1
"Professor Robertson was great.  She is very positive and encouraging.  Her class was really interesting and I learned a lot.  I studied, but this class was easy.  Tests are online/open book with multiple attempts. 1 short (easy) paper due. Mid-term and final are open book but timed. I would recommend her. If you don't get an A, it's your fault.",1
"2 discussions and 2 responses a week which was pretty normal. Quizzes are fairly easy if you've read the material. 20 multiple choice, 5 short paragraph response. He responds pretty quickly to e-mails, gives good feedback and grades fairly!",1
Worst professor I have ever had! Assignments were unclear and very difficult. Would not recommend!,0
Professor Liu gave concrete and specific guidance on research methods. You will learn how to differentiate good from bad research.,1
Awesome teacher,1
"Lectures were not very helpful. Had to google most things for my homework, didn't buy the textbook nor did I need it. Doesn't take attendance so don't need to go to class. Not a stimulating class, not an easy class. He's a cool guy, but not a good professor",0
"Dr. Barton cares about her students' success. While the material can be challenging, esp. the 2nd half of the semester, she does all she can to assist her students. HW is very representative of the material you will see on tests. Put in the time and you will succeed in this course. Final exam is proctored, other tests and quizzes are not.",1
Absolutely amazing professor and a stand-up person. I don't think I've ever had such a kind and considerate professor. I highly recommend you take one of Tom's classes if you can.,1
"Dr. Capper is one of the best Professors I have taken! His tests are not hard, especially if you actually read the material he told you to read. His class was very in depth and his knowledge will broaden your mind. Awesome teacher.",1
Fantastic professor! She breaks the material down in her lectures and slideshows making it all much easier to learn and understand. Just don't be late or get behind in the readings.,1
She is very rude and reads directly from power points. She will force people to make friend with the others . The class is very boring and is very hard to remain focus,0
"The course load can be a bit heavy, so you need to make sure to stay on top of everything.",1
"The best professor at Allegheny. Thoughtful, caring, and understanding. Will push you to be the absolute best that you can, and recognizes if you're slacking off.",1
"This class was a blast. I learned so much. Thad has a very dry sense of humor which I enjoyed. He is also not hard on the eyes. It is very important to attend the lecture, but the book is not necessary. He takes test questions from the study guide. He was often disorganized, but oh well. Evening lab was great, we were always out early.",1
"She's a very nice woman, but she just isn't a good math teacher. I got A's in math until I had her for a teacher. I barely passed her class, even with the help of a tutor. But she will help you outside of class.  She just wasn't the math teacher for me.",1
"DO NOT TAKE HER! You don't know what to expect on the exams because her study guides are too specific. And she does not explain the diagrams from the ppts very well which caused so much confusion. She talks too fast. Oh, and she does not attempt to adjust her teaching style in order to make the class easier to understand (even if you ask her to).",0
"Horrible teacher! She doesn't know what she is doing or teaching. So confusing on what she wants to teach you, and the material that is on the tests are not what she tells you.",0
Homework has some tough questions that are made harder than they need to be due to the prof only giving one or two examples per topic. He's quite friendly in his office though and can explain things a lot better so definitely utilise those hours.,0
He is extremely cocky and can make you feel like an idot if you are unprepared for class and ask a question. once you get used to his personality you will do fine as long as you STUDY.. this seems to be true for all lab bio type classes though so as long as you put in the time you will do fine. i recommend his class just dont get on his bad side!,0
"Hybrid class: Do online work & go to class, even if you feel you dont need to, GO TO CLAS -lectures are tough to understand -examples dont make since! -I would def. take into consideration before taking him if math is your weak spot. Hard to tell if he actually cares to see his students succeed! -Utilize tutors & study groups for sure!!",0
Great Professor. He understands that most of the students in this course aren't science majors and the course itself isn't that hard if you give a little effort. There is so much extra credit that lots of students end up with over 100%.,1
"Dr. Bonaccorsi is a great chemistry teacher and knows what shes talking about, shes there to teach students and answer any questions after class, quizzes/exams can be difficult and there is no curve. Top Hat questions during class strongly suggested you should show up.",1
Mrs Kuntzman is a great teacher! I took her class as my 2nd attempt at math 043 becaus I had failed the semster before. I was having to retake the class and very discouraged but I have recieved an A on every assignment. She took me from hating Math to being an A+ student. She's amazing! I Highly recomend her!,1
"I took her summer online class. Doesn't accept late work. I am a straight A student, haven't missed a class, and got in contact with her for extra credit submissions, she didn't offer any, and gave me almost nothing on participation. If your major isn't Psychology or anything related, don't take this class.",0
"Nice teacher, really gets the material across. She has won teaching awards for having some of the highest grades in the nation on standardized tests. The required textbook was never opened but her ""Survival guide"" is a must! That being said, the questions on multiple choice tests are hard, and it is very difficult to get a good grade. No reqired HW",1
"I got at little worried when first coming to his class. Just do the work (blogs) and you will be fine. He can put you on the spot, but he's really a great guy. Good sense of humor. I really thought I would do poorly, but I did all the blogs, studied for the tests and made an A. God forbid, DO NOT get your phone out before or during class.",1
Dr. Howell is the best physics teacher I have taken he tells you explicitly what he wants (it makes solving and understanding physics way easier). Physics is a hard subject but he teaches it to make it simple. As long as you are willing to put in time and effort you will pass. DON'T cheat he will catch you... but you wont have to if you do it right,1
"Jill Miller is a wonderful evolutionary biologist who studies Lycium species and their distribution around the world. She has a great sense of humor and will poke fun at experimental techniques in science, e.g. poking a salamander repeatedly with a stick. She includes great model organisms in slides and pushes you to understand evolution fully.",1
"Always show up to classes. There are regular assignments. She offers a lot of reading, but it's all articles. So no textbooks needed. She really makes it clear she wants to be there. Health econ can be a bit dry, but she incorporates a lot of relevant stuff for today. It was a great class",1
"Get ready to write down lots and lots and lots of lecture notes, he doesn't make them available online, honestly never seen a teacher do this before, and then he tells us if you don't study the lecture notes you're not gonna pass, also made us buy the book for $80 in the beginning of the year, never used it once",0
Read straight from the powerpoints all semester and did nothing to make the class interesting. Attendance is mandatory so you actually have to sit through the class.,0
"Prof. Calkins was an awesome teacher! I held an A all year because of the feedback that she gave on all my papers. There is a lot of reading and online discussion posts, but they all help with the major assignments. I would definitely take her again!",1
"Dr. Morris is a great person, a professor I'd take again, and a total babe.",1
Great teacher for English 2030 for Summer Semester. She has a few assignments due each work but they are not hard. If you put in the work you can pass easily. Her homework assignments are in order so when you do your final paper you understand! make sure you ask questions as she responds to them and helps you become a better writer! Good luck.,1
"I took online 280 this quarter and I loved it! Everything's so clear and I never missed any assignments because everything's so clear, from week to week. I don't think we have long research paper due. I am getting an A.",1
"Professor Layoun's lectures are unconventional but if you trust her and follow, you'll find yourself inspired and changed. If you need lots structure, this may not be the professor for you. But if you want to learn with a truly brilliant woman who cares about you, and more importantly if you're open to being moved, you should take a class with her!",1
"Christina doesn't believe in perfection, but she expects it. She is very knowledgeable about color theory and I learned a lot in her class, but I also hated it. She is an extremely tough grader and even if you think you did great, be prepared to have her find AT LEAST one thing wrong with it! She also takes forever (like months) to grade things!",1
"Best science teacher I have ever had, period! I have 207 accredited hours so far, and she wins hands down. I recommend her all the way. Wish there were more like her. If you have a chance to take her and you don't, that's a mistake on your part.",1
"He live streams and records his lectures so you don't have to attend in person. He has good examples and I had a good understanding of the material. Seemed like he had other priorities this semester. Didn't send out ANY grades for our labs/hw. Often canceled class or said ""online class today"" like 3-4 hrs before class and was late a lot too, idk",1
"I have a 4:30-7:10 class, about 5:30 every wednesday she has a guest come in and talk. This is soooo boring for some, and for others interesting. Nuneville, will teach you the lecture for about 45minutes - 1 hour and after that her guest speakers come in and talk for the rest of class.",1
"His tests are pretty difficult, but he is an amazing teacher and you will learn so much! He gives a lot of chances to help you raise your grades. The class is hard but an A is definitely possible if you try.",1
More work than all 3 of my other classes combined. Her class is literally a full-time job.,0
"Great professor. Your grade is based on only 4 exams, but if you read the textbook and take notes you will have no problem at all. If you don't, this class is not for you. Professor gives tons of free answers and extra credit during the lectures. As long as you put the work into it, you will easily get an A.",1
"I would not recommend personally. The work is a lot for a small group comm class. There are 3 individual papers (3 pages). Then 4 group research papers (1-3 are 3 pages, the last is 10 pages). The class itself isn't to bad. But she does have a snarky attitude at times and its frustrating. There is also chapter quizzes every week.",1
"Taking a physics class, I expected the curricula to be difficult. Mr. Bannow has a great sense of humor and likes to talk about his life experiences to explain topics. As long as your prepared to do the homework and like using google, you should have no problem getting at least a B in his class with all the extra credit he gives.",1
"Ian Green is a tough grader who requires a decent amount of reading. He is, however, really good at giving feedback and really good at making you become a better writer. I was able to do good with lots of office hours. I know not everyone can do that, but if you can, I'd recommend making as much use of them as you can.",1
"she is very helpful, and a great teacher, she is always motivated the students to go ahead, she asked you all the time you understand? If you not she take time to give you all the explication  that you don't understand she is great and she have a charisma to teaching she love that she don't wants the students fail class,she is reminded each time.",1
Spencer has structured this class such that your grade depends on you knowledge of Accounting Vocabulary more than your actual knowledge of accounting.  So read the vocabulary sections and you should be ok...don't really expect to learn very much accounting though...,0
"He really knows his stuff and his lectures are very clear. He assigns classwork that really helps prepare you for the tests. If you don't understand something, don't be afraid to ask him for help. He's very approachable and willing to help. For whatever reason, his teaching methods really clicked with me. I highly recommend his classes.",1
"Olzman is a relatively new and still figuring themselves out. There are ups and downs, but they clearly care deeply about teaching. Listening during class time also does wonders, so those who rely on everything being posted for their convenience should take note. Ultimately she's a good professor. Take the time to communicate and engage.",1
Melissa is a great teacher. I had her for Engineering in History online. It is literally the easiest class. For homework and exams just pull up your powerpoint and use the search functions to find answers. I only needed the book for one assignment. There were 2 essay projects but she gave everyone a perfect score. ,1
great teacher!,1
Overall I enjoyed this class.,1
WHATS WRONG WITH YOU GUYS. Dr. Moore is so cool. She helped my writing improve ten-fold. She helped me outside of class and emailed me about everything. Real personal and friendly - she is the most caring teacher I've had on a personal level. I took this class about a year ago with Mr. Wahl and to this date it's been the only class I've ever failed,1
"Dr. Hough has obviously worked hard to develop good pedagogical practices. I didn't go to office hours, but friends say he's super accessible. During lecture he always made an active effort to talk with students during clickers. Awesome explanations. Would definitely recommend sitting in front! Also, he is very kind about pronouns & accessibility.",1
"The class is fairly easy, but the weekly readings are brutal. She assigned at least 100 pages per weeks. Also when it comes to mannerism she is extremely snobby and opinionated and passive aggressive!",0
"She is the most horrible instructor I have ever had in my life!  She does't respond to emails, doesn't update d2l, doesn't grade assignments promptly, grading system is a joke, she grades and gives grades on however she wants, and she's not punctual herself but expects that from us.  Literally she makes you read the whole book. hardly lectures",0
"Russ wrote the textbook so you need it. He does weekly in class quizzes that are completely from the textbook. Russ really doesn't teach he expects that you read the textbook and understand from that. Midterm was really easy but, the final was much tougher. The class isn't overly difficult however it requires A LOT of work so be prepared.",1
"Took this class online - great class - He took the time for thorough preparation and the extra clips/articles and videos made this class very interesting. (has a great sense of humor-makes class interesting from the start). Directions are clear from day one - so if you follow his directions and don't put off assignments, you will do well.",1
"This class was a bit of a hassle since we had homework but it didn't count as a grade, so no one ever did it. There are wayyy to many assignments besides the 3 essays (4 vocab assignments, a journal,2 tests...) Just give it an honest effort and you could probably make an A. Although I hear the other prof. who teaches this class assigns less work...",1
"I took this professor online for Pre-Cal and let's just say the work was the easy part. In the syllabus she has a chart that shows you what is needed to be exempt from the final, which also also states that if you're close she will make an adjustment. I exceeded the points, but she failed to realize that and didn't grade my discussion board either!",0
"Doug is an AMAZING teacher, by far my favorite I've had of any teacher at NMC. He is clear in assignments and very helpful with developing techniques, and getting more comfortable with mediums that you are not as comfortable with. Can't wait to take Drawing 2 with him! Highly recommend!",1
"Class with Professor Perkins was a disappointment. He is knowledgeable about the subject, but he is so blinded by his own political views and biases that he cannot cover it in an appropriate way. Easily triggerable. I wasn't upset with my grade - just with Perkins's hypocritical views that found a way of targeting particular students.",0
"Great Professor, he stays engaged with the weekly conferences and replies to emails timely.",1
There is 1 test (the midterm) and 1 project for the entire yearbut its a group project. The project turned out to be a 50+ page document between 4 people. He said that he was expecting around 100 pages. I did a majority of the project and made sure he knew that. I walked away with a B- and my group members who did nothing all got C+'s. DO NOT TAKE,0
"This guy is awful.  He was bad for EE 312, and he's even worse for this class.  He now uses quizzes to see if anyone is paying attention, or at least, showing up to class.  My biggest peeve: he issues a final for the last day of class instead of during the scheduled exam date.  It's unfair, because you can't finish a final in 1:15.  What a jerk!",0
"Professor Dodson is absolutely amazing! Even with doing an online class, she was a great help. The discussion board is the key to her classes (at least online). Statistics is hard but she made it fun and as easy as can be to learn.  I highly recommend her!!",1
"I took her Spring 2016, she started out on a good road but went completely left at the end. She actual taught the last two weeks of the semester. When she began to teacher she was giving a crash lesson. She believes you should be a professional writer not thinking this could be a class you have not taken in thirty years.",0
"Don't be intimidated.  Take his attendance policy right to the Administration if you find him, or, it, unreasonable.  He'll be overturned.  That said, an engaging professor who is truly an expert in this subject.  By his own admission, however, his type of mediation and dispute resolution is almost entirely academic.",1
"In the beginning of class, she'll say how it'd be nice to see more people on camera- annoying especially to those not comfortable with that or who have bad internet. Other than that, the class is generally fine. Nothing special but at least it's something actually useful for the future: emails, resume, cover letter, LinkedIn, reports.",1
Super nice guy. Enjoyed his class. Do the work and participate and you'll have no problems.,1
"I like the whole course in general. Each lesson gave me more edu action and understanding of human psychology.; it helps in my everyday life to communicate with family. When I misunderstood something and asked Dr. Kelley to clarify them, she replied very quickly and answers were concise.",1
Professor Beato is super nice and really cares about his students. He makes sure that everyone is doing well in class. His classes are very fun.,1
TAKE HER!! Easy A++ and she is really caring about all her students. Classes were not mandatory and her tests were all in the slides. Only 4 tests and the final was optional.,1
"He can be disorganized at times, but he's great at providing practical examples that correlate to the topics at hand. Most assignments are interesting and end up having extra credit opportunities built into them. If you take the time to study the concepts and visit office hours, its pretty easy considering 300+ level courses. 10/10 would take again",1
Very nice guy willing to explain your clarifications and help you with any concerns. He is always on campus you must take this class with him. ,1
"Sanchez is a very considerate professor who takes into account that we have other classes. She gives A LOT of homework and does not grade them right away, but for us she allowed us to hand them in late without penalty because she knew we were busy. No final, just a written prompt in the last class. 3 major quizzes, all online. Makes the class fun",1
"Dr. Mike is the best professor I've had so far. The first week he tries to scare off LSA kids, but don't drop him if you need the class. He knows that many (specially engineering) students just want to be over with the class, but he tries his very best to help you understand the material. He's funny even when the material is boring. Exams are hard.",1
"Professor Lockett, gave students multiple extra credit assignments, she gave us videos to watch. She had a lot of writing assignments , she had quizzes which were manageable. Overall this course was durable.",1
"He's a great guy and almost a great professor. I struggled because Russian is, in fact, a hard language to learn. He'd tell us about quizzes, sometimes we'd have them, other times he'd forget. There is no extra credit. There are no makeup tests. I studied constantly and left with a C. Attendance isn't mandatory, but you'll fail if you don't go.",1
Lectures come straight from the textbook. Takes attendance through plicker questions but doesn't expect you to attend every class. Homework takes some time but some questions from the test are word for word from the homeworks. Don't really need to participate in the lectures. Overall easy/average class and average teacher.,1
"Great teacher, but really missed her calling as a shoe designer .... seriously look at how exact her shoes will match her outfit  :O)",1
I'm in love w/ him!!! he's soo interesting and knowledgeable!!! He's very helpful and hilarious!!,1
Horrible,0
"He might be the worst person to gain the privilege of earning a Ph.D. This dude is so unorganized its unreal, he doesn't know what time his class is. Do not take him if you are a student that enjoys structure and a stable course schedulethe worst class I've taken in 4 years.",0
He over-complicates things in his lectures and is not great at explaining. He is mean when you don't understand something and want to ask a question. He takes away points in exams and lab reports for the smallest details.,0
"Dr. Hale lets students discover things themselves by talking it out. He doesn't teach in order to preach his own opinions but to help students gain their own insights. He may not be an expert like some other professors on specific texts, but getting to actually discuss in class is possible because he keeps his comments to a minimum. He's kind, too.",1
Be warned: this class will not be easy. You have to put in the hours coming to class and paying attention. Celia organizes drop-in hours at ollies and other places around campus to practice with TAs and other students- TAKE ADVANTAGE! If you put in the effort this course can be extremely beneficial.,1
"She is a good professor. She meets us every week and answers questions carefully. But her exams are really really hard! She gets curve the grade. I read every slide carefully, and I went over the Review sheet all afternoon. But the exam has nothing to do with the review. This is an online class, and everyone I know in this class is complaining.",1
Great guy. Easy class. Not an A** like Steve. Humorous.,1
"Bias information presented without any acknowledgement of different socioeconomic views. Very limited experience as an 1 of the 2 black   .  In class. Poor representation of the black family, overall discouraging and unhelpful. Grading structure is vague and unpredictable. Consider a different course.",0
"Great Professor, she is a little off sometimes and tough on presentations but overall a caring professor. I would recommend actively participating and doing all the work. easy A",1
"Mr. Luckett is a good professor. One interview assignment, discussions and a few quizzes. Just read the chapters and you will pass. Take him!",1
"Great teacher. Great lectures. Great class overall. I had Prof. Mensah for PoliEcon and if you're looking to learn a lot, read chapters he assigns from the book. The chapters are really interesting. His lectures are great, but it can be hard to follow if you aren't a student who learns well by lecture because he gets off topic really easily.",1
"Dr. Kopacz talks to all of their students like we were in elementary school. She once spent a whole lecture explaining why we have seasons based on the tilt of the earth. Another time we spent a whole week learning how if you add energy to an ice cube, it will turn into water. Her class is boring as hell but attendance is 20% of the grade.",0
Mrs. Hayden helped me come out of my shell and be more comfortable with public speaking. She is very helpful with your speeches. You will use your book to learn things and have quizzes over certain chapters. I can say that I was nervous to take this class but it was actually fun.,1
"My time in Professor Kanchi's course can be summed up through one thing she said to me when I asked her a question about the homework: ""Why are you using the lecture notes to answer these? Use the books instead, they give much better information than what we covered in class"".",0
"This class was awesome! She sent our weekly assignments in an email every Saturday morning which included: reading one chapter, an online lecture for that chapter, a quiz, and a forum post. Took an hour and a half each week tops!   As long as you do the forum post and respond to someone, you'll get a 100.",1
"Prof. Frazier is super nice and very good at replying to emails. However, he is very serious about participation. Class is easy, mostly everything is online (quizzes and tests) which is nice! He's really funny and interesting!",1
No Comments,1
"Professor Zabowski is amazing. She's interactive and very caring. Unfortunately, it was online so we didn't get to eat goodies, but I had the best time in her class. She really does a great job of making everyone feel included. No textbook required would definitely take again!!",1
Very easy reasonable guy. Just pay attention to whats going on in class and you should make an A(if you can't that's on you). He tries to get the class involved as much as he can in his lectures so if no one talks then he will make the class more difficult. Only 3 test with a short hw assignment due every week. does give occasional extra credit,1
She was one of my best professors I have ever had!! She was very kind and caring! If you show up and pay attention to her lectures it'd be hard to not get an A (you don't need to take notes bc she posts her Powerpoints on bb). I highly recommend her!!,1
"Believes history to be your only class, expectations are sky high. Handles her review for her difficult test quite poorly. Wouldn't expect her to be here next semester.",0
What are you all talking about? College classes are so hard and she finally gives us a class that is easy! You all just don't appreciate when a teacher cuts ya some slack! Quit hating!!!!,1
"Super Hard grader. The pop quizzes are worth most of your final grade. At least telling students about the quizzes even one day beforehand will help. There was a pandemic going on, and I felt like the guidelines were so harsh considering the state of mind so many people were in. He doesn't think about the students and doesnt grade fairly. UGHHHH",0
"Brian is awesome! He really makes you feel comfortable in the class, so your never have a problem asking him about anything. Great guy who really knows his stuff.",1
"Steve is alright.  He will lecture, but does not seem confident in what he is teaching.  He sometimes got confused on what he was teaching, and didn't really seem to care if you understood the material.  His tests were really easy though.  I did not really feel like he taught me a lot, and that I did well because my HS calc teacher was 100x better.",0
An awesome professor who is willing to put in the time and effort in order to explain the concepts in and out of the class.,1
Did not enjoy this class at all.  Could have easily done it at home on my own.  She uses sparknotes!!!  Not a good teacher!  Did not help when asked.  Would never take her class again.,0
One of the best professors i had throughout my college experience.,1
"Professor Sullivan is a great teacher, but lectures can be confusing and boring. You have to read the books to understand the discussions. He gives mini quizzes on the readings which aren't too bad and often open for interpretation. Read the material and pay attention during lecturesdiscussions and you should be fine! ",1
"She is passionate about Academic Dishonesty! In other words do your own work! It was a horror show for this class specifically. The class is easy, pay attention, write down the clicker questions - they are in the exam. Learn the content. Her test are average as long as you study the review questions. NO LAPTOPS! Or phones she will call you out!",1
"He is just a great guy... sometimes can be goofy, but he really is awesome. If you need help he will help you. He is a great teacher, and knows his stuff. He is just an overall caring and great professor. Highly recommended",1
"Has lots of opportunity for extra credit, very little homework, and fair tests. He is hilarious and a joy to take. For Gen Chem I, don't bother getting a textbook just print off his slides and make sure you understand what's on them.",1
"This guy is honestly awful as a professor. Just finished another exam in which no one could even manage a B. The way he words questions is terrible and unclear and he refuses to change anything or take suggestions, despite the fact that out of the entire class 15 have below a C.",0
This was by far one of the most difficult online class I have ever taken. Professor Knapp was very available and asked for me to reach out to him. But bottom line I take online classes because I don't have time for any extra meetings. I think the class would have been better had it been in person. I also don't think the book was helpful at all.,1
Great professor! I would definitely recommend him to anybody for learning frameworks.,1
She's excellent & dedicated.  A real purist and a joy to be in class with!,1
"Dr. Kim knows what he is talking about and knows that you know he does. He went very fast the first half of the semester and the language barrier was a little difficult, but his tests are very similar to the homework and mainly looks for knowledge of the application.",1
Professor Lee goes beyond her means to make sure everyone understands. She is very through and goes step by step. I would definitely her to other students ��,1
Great professor who is very professional.,1
Im disabled and he was very understanding with me and my situation. That helped me a lot. But he is very considerate.,1
"Il parle surtout d'histoires personnelles et de lui durant les cours, n'explique pas très bien et ne fait jamais d'expemples au tableau il fait simplement montrer le corrigé des exercices et commenter rapidement. Bref, je ne recommande pas ce prof!",0
"Dr. Sankara is a very nice man, but his class was terrible. I've been studying French for seven years and dropped my French minor after taking this class. He gives 2-3 hours of homework per class and takes up most of the class going over it. Really hard to get anything above a B+ in the class, but exams aren't too bad.",1
Awesome prof!,1
Don't take his online class. He takes forever to put in grades. The only grades you have are journals and exams which are both worth 5o points each. He grades really hard and he gives no feedback about how you can do better the next time.,0
"love him, you never have to go to class, easy A",1
He made me love moral theology and I was always excited to go to his class! Only 2 tests and every class is a different lecture.,1
Awesome class. Unexamined life is not worth living.,1
"Prof Ryan loves to teach and he projects that to the class, with that being said, this was the 6 wk session, so there was a lot of work to do, mostly done in groups. Be prepared to read and work hard. labs were fun.  there were three group presentations. just beware of time management to get this work done along with all of your other responsabilit",1
"Would highly recommend to take her for psychology, she is very approachable and is there to help you. Also, she knows her stuff and gives amazing examples. Just take good notes and you will do good.",1
"I am NOT a history person, but this class was engaging and easy to understand. It is difficult because hundreds, sometimes thousands, of years are covered in 50 minutes but it's not impossible to keep up. The readings are VERY important, but the exams are fairly easy and predictable. Overall good teacher and valuable class.",1
He is the toughest grader I have ever taken. He gives a lot of homework and is really tough on the specific details required in your answer. He is the hardest teacher I have taken. There is a lot of drawings and answering questions.,0
"Mr. Lawson is great professor. If you want to take his class you must've be ready, you're going to suffer with all of the work that you have to be done. Keep in mind is a hard class because are combined two classes. He's very serious with homework assignments. However if you're looking easy grade this class isn't for you, but you'll learn at end.",1
"Worst teacher I have ever had in my life. Mocks his students, mean, biased, overall horrible teacher. AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!",0
"Professor Nguyen is a very caring teacher! He really challenges his students and wants to see them succeed. Overall, philosophy is a very difficult subject but that's what you know signing up. I hate reading but you have to read because everything on the tests comes from the book and his extra notes. He's also funny which makes the class enjoyable.",1
"Awesome teacher! you have to put in the work to get the grade but bates helps you out too. She keeps the class interesting and is willing to help you out. due dates are not set in stone, she will extend one if you ask her.i highly recommend her class!",1
"He's new to RIT so he's still adjusting to the environment. At the time of this rating, it was only his first semester here. He tries hard to be helpful, though he doesn't have much experience yet so he isn't always able to answer certain questions.",1
"I Had Jon for a Calc 2 TA and felt obligated to write this when I saw a bad review. Jon has been the best TA I have ever had at UConn. Very clear, very knowledgeable, and very fair. He is great at explaining both concepts and problems. If I could have him for all my classes I would. If you have the option, take his class, you won't regret it.",1
She is an amazing and kind person who cares about her students and does her best to help them succeed; she always makes herself available to her students. She can be VERY disorganized so it's important to read everything before class and really know the material b/c in lectures she can be confusing but will help make connections once you understand,1
This professor is awesome! One of the most kind and compassionate ones who actually cared about YOU and your academics. He is very warm to students and classes are always something to look forward to. You learn a lot of material in such a short period and he is there helping you right along. Very stress free and laid back environment. ,1
"Dr. Viola is an amazing professor. He adds interest to learning a dry subject. He is also a practicing Infectous Disease physician, so he is able to relate what you are learning in class to its application in the medical world. If you don't understand something, show up for extra credit before class and he will help you out. Would take again.",1
I took his class 171 for elementary teachers and im taking 172 next quarter. He is a nice guy and has a fun sense of humor. works at a quick pace but will answer questions and provide more examples. he collects homework but only grades 4 or 5 random problems out of it. short quiz on each chapter.,1
"Ben is such a fun, quirky guy in his lectures. He cares about his students and just wants to show everyone what the world of Healthcare Ethics is like. He just wants you to learn and tries to make his as lectures engaging and fun as he can. I would recommend taking him if you enjoy dry humor and someone who is passionate about the hce field.",1
Very easy gen ed. The teacher is very talented. Get ready to listen to a LOT of music and learn about history. The class was kind of boring to me but there are moments.,1
Gives you quizzes on things you didn't learn and grades them really hard. She's terrible please don't take her this is the biggest waste of a class i've ever taken. The class is 3 hours long and she barely gives you a 5 minute break and gets off topic onto the worst tangents then blames students for not knowing material. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS!,0
"Refuses to publish his powerpoints, read the textbook and pay attention to his study guide to figure out what type of test he's giving this time. Unsure if he's just new to the job or what, but he was completely inconsistent in assignments. Also regularly says inflammatory things to get discussions going. ",0
This man should do us all a favor and retire.  His class is hard and he rounds down instead of up for your final grade.  I should have got a 2.7 but he gave me a 2.6.  He is the type of professor that looks at teaching as only a job and takes no interest in the student.  The tax assignments were VERY time consuming and worth little points.,0
"LA does an amazing job lecturing so paying attention is no problem. If you attend class regularly there is no way you can fail. She lays all the material out in a way that is easy to follow, she is very approchable and kind. If you have the chance to take her class do it.",1
"She's a good Professor, and very nice. But, her grading technique is a bit strict and she makes/creates her own quizzes/exams so be prepared to actually read and gain a thorough understanding of the work. No searching up questions on google, she's not that easy. But yeah good Professor and make sure to address her by her full name, not a nickname.",0
"She was an awesome teacher and made sure to give accurate feedback to give support, she does assign a lot of essays but they are on the lecture given and she was very generous with the grading. I would strongly suggest being in her class, so helpful and I truly enjoyed the teaching.",1
Miserable time. Felt invisible. Eventually had to drop the class after she upset me.,0
"Krutz is the coolest professor in the SE department. He's extremely laid back and approachable, which makes him a favorite of most students. That being said, you probably won't learn much taking a course with Krutz. His class was beyond easy with little to no homework and the easiest exams I've ever taken. Take his class to have fun, not to learn.",1
"She time and time again made it clear that if you have personal issues that affect your ability to attend class or turn in assignments, SHE WILL WORK WITH YOU. Her assignments are pretty clear on what she expects. The main problem I had in her classes was the lack of respect from other students because they didn't agree with her personal opinions.",1
DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH THIS PROFESSOR. Lots of readings and if you forget to read he takes points off. Only quizzes and half the stuff is not in the readings or talked about in class. One absence is 5 points off your attendance grade which makes a difference. Lectures in a socratic method; basically whatever he wants to talk about that day.,0
Great lectures however the tests are graded completely unfairly by his group of 4 other graders so there is no consistency.  if you can afford the high probability of a C  the material is worth it.,1
HORRIBLE PROFESSOR STAY AWAY IF YOU TAKE PRIDE IN YOUR G.P.A! The TA's do all the grading and think they are grading for a PhD Course. Basic information which they make harder than what it should be.   ,0
"I took Dr. Russum's courses until the school had to tell me, alright, you've capped on out Humanities. Take this professor. Appreciate the sources he gives you -- I still look at my notes from 5 years ago. Take this class if you're serious about the course itself. And when you do so, be prepared to learn and unlearn what you think you know.",1
He is an awesome professor.,1
"A really good professor with a ton of knowledge. Extremely easy course if you follow his syllabus and write notes. Your hand might get a little bent out of shape from writing so much, but the tests aren't too difficult. You'll never get out early, but you should be able to do very well.",1
"Funny teacher, and really passionate about what he's teaching. I did not attend lectures at all except the first one, but still managed to get an A-. Do all his readings and listen to the recordings and you'll be fine!",1
"Awesome dude. He speaks a lot about God because it PERTAINS to the readings, not because he just feels like it. He made the readings very interesting and made me want to read as time went on. He's very chill and likes it when you talk with him in class for discussions. Slackers won't do well, if you try, you'll be good. Do the journals!",1
"Mr. Martin's class changed me as a writer. He taught me how to express myself in my writing and do it well. Back in high school I hated English, but now it is my favorite subject! Mr. Martin cares about his students, and he will not give up on you as long as you continue to try. Cannot wait to take English 105 with him next semester!",1
Very engaging.,1
"She is terrible. Does not offer any help or assistance and just doesn't care about students.  RUN, if you can!(I really hope that she reads these comments and learns from them).",0
"Allen is enthusiastic and the class is pretty good overall. Definitely not a complete ""easy A"" and requires some studying, but easier than most Berkeley classes. 2 hours of lecture and no discussion for 3 units makes up for the annoying field trips.",1
She is very passionate about what she does. She is sweet and most of the tests are online.,1
"I took her class for the F/W 2019 year and dropped it because she refuses to use any technology whatsoever. If you miss class even for a valid reason such as a doctor's appointment, a family loss, etc., you're screwed because she doesn't use moodle and doesn't post any content online. She often said she never uses her work email and never responds.",0
"Professor who talks to students with respect. Dr. Brown is laid back and has a great attitude. Isn't afraid to crack jokes, but doesn't deviate from the material. I would recommend this Professor to anyone. It made me happy to come to class and engage. Doesn't go out of his way to make the material difficult, but makes it informing.",1
"The class was not terrible, but after a month most of the class dropped out. She was difficult to talk to. She makes you feel dumb. It was the hardest class I've ever taken and it made me so stressed out all the time about all my work.",0
"Good teacher - really feel as if she is trying to help you succeed. I made a C, but I deserved it.",1
"He repeats everything 5 times. He repeats, everything. 5 times. 5 times he repeats everything. So we know, we see, things are being repeated. And what is the frequency of this repetition? 5. He repeats everything 5 times.",1
What an incredible professor and all around guy. Never gotten more out of a class at USC than both the ones I've taken with him. PY is so knowledgeable about the industry and gives you the most valuable learning experience. Hands down the best prof. and really cares about the success of his students. You'll be lucky to take one of his classes!! ,1

"I strongly recommend a course with Professor Drake. The class I took moves at a quick pace and requires careful study of notes taken during lecture. It also required reading 6 books, watching a few movies and reading some essays/articles posted on the course webpage. Professor Drake is an incredible resource for UM.",1
"I don't know if I would recommend this professor. Yes,I passed with an A but I think eveyone in the class did.Did I learn anything? Absolutly not.You better now how to speak spanish if you take a class with him cause he mostly will teach in spanish.He reads straight from the power points and exams are nothing like reviews.",0
A great capstone class with a good level of engagement by the Professor. Clear expectations. No textbook. Cases and readings assigned. Biweekly message board postings required. Write 2 short papers covering cases. Semester long Capsim simulation that you perform solo. CompXM sim (solo) at end of class. Quick grader and would take prof again.,1
Nesvig is a great professor.  His lecture are interesting and he really knows what he's talking about.  He's funny and tells great stories.,1
"She is a good teacher, easy, class is never boring. Helpful, kind, constructive, easy grader on debates, and she wants you to succeed. If you need help go to her office hours and she will help you. I recommend her.",1
Tbh his teaching is not that good. He can't explain concepts well and it is confusing even to me as a student who have taken calculus before. But he is very organized in his class and test schedules. He give extra credits. Has a lot of hw to do. Tests are not too difficult. Wouldn't recommend taking him if you don't already know the materials.,0
"I loved this class! Catherine and our peer leader, Emma, were so nice and really made us feel comfortable with transitioning into college. The class is easy and there is a lot of hands on work. I definitely recommend taking her class.",1
I think she make english easy and she lets you be creative with your writting. If you just need to get through english and it is not your fav. subject then this teacher is for you.,1
No Comments,1
Id rather transfer than take this class again. The class is an hour despite the 50 minutes allotted for the class. For the sake of your mental health do not take this class. Studying for exams with our homework and with a professor that teaches differently from the textbook will kill you,0
Brian is a wonderful teacher and is really passionate about what he does. You get to learn about an aspect of theater that you wouldnt unless you had him. He is easy to understand and is more than willing to help you if there are miscommunications. I highly recommend Brian,1

no a good idea!,0
"Very wishy washy. He will decide one thing one minute, and change his mind the next. Makes you participate in a Global Business Game, impossible..then tests you on it. Even harder. Try to avoid taking him. Pretty nice guy, just not the greatest teacher.",0
She's an amazing professor and she is passionate about the subject. She also cares her students.,1
"McGee is a great instructor! Quizzes once a week over lecture notes, easy as long as you study some.  A total of 4 tests and then the final.  She is keeps you entertained during her lectures so you aren't falling asleep! Just study and pay attention, you'll be golden.  One of the best instructors by far.  Take her!",1
"Dr. Spiczak is interesting to listen to, but that's about it.  He is very enthusiastic and smart, but he treats a generals level class like a graduate level.  His class is very hard and he tests on obscure facts from the book that we don't discuss in class. Nice guy, bad teacher",0
"MOST BORING PERSON TO EVER LIVE. monotone lectures are better than white noise for sleeping, reads the textbook, and does exercises, no initiative to ask students if they're learning, don't even read the chat if people have questions! HW and Exams are via 3rd party. no need to attend cuz he can care less how many ppl join, hell teach an empty class",0
"Lipson is a great professor who has a ton of knowledge on the material presented in class. It is very important to attend class in order to do well on the tests. With that being said, his lectures and the application to current events is spot on and super interesting. Class was always fun and intriguing.",1
"Professoressa Miller is one of the most enthusiastically passionate and caring professors I have been privileged enough to meet and learn from in my entire academic career. She definitely makes you work for it, but the challenge is inspiring and helps to build confidence in your own abilities. She goes above and beyond for her students. Recommended",1
"Great professor, very helpful and teaches you the material. The test problems can be tricky but hes a very fair grader with partial credit",1
"This is the professor you want to take for ENGR 101 and ENGR 102.  She will help you with anything you need.  Very nice person.  She tells you exactly what is going to be on every test and quiz.  No pop quizzes.  You use the textbook once or twice in ENGR 101, but very often in ENGR 102",1
"Great feedback, I'd look forward to reading what he wrote on my papers. Always honest and helpful with his feedback. Great lectures, he has a comprehensive view of the US. If you want to open your mind, then really listen to his lectures and think about them hard. I very much respect this man and the work he's done.",1
"Thick accent, he reads off the power points, gets frustrated when students ask for help, he tries to squeeze in chapters together regardless of the time he has, test are over 125 questions long EACH! Overly obsessed with attendance, if he makes a mistake with your grade he will not change it even on McGraw hill connect. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!",0
"Mr. Koehler generally rants about things that have to do nothing with the material of the class. 10% of the class is spent actually looking at the material, and usually, that doesn't end up on the quizzes anyway. I have sat through multiple 2 hour and 20 minute sessions without getting a single note in my notebook.",0
"I've never met a professor who absolutely refuses to answer emails before. Sure, a few might take longer than others. But to NEVER answer and then blame you for misunderstanding something? She's ridiculous.",0
"Dr G. is one of the finest men and Professors I have ever met. I will remember Dr G. until my final day on this earth. He cares so much about the environment and students but he is tough and he challenges you until the end. I hope he is remembered with the greatest, Thoreau, Muir, Burroughs, Leopold, and Euell Gibbons. You're the best Dr G.",1
His lectures are slow but they are easy to understand. The tests are also not very difficult as long as you remembered what you did for the homework assignments and memorized every single definition taught in class. People typically struggle on the first test but it only counts as 15%. He also lets people do homework in groups which is very useful.,1
"She is an amazing teacher who takes her job seriously!  If you do not take her class serious she won't take you serious.  Don't expect sympathy when you make excuses as to why you aren't doing well.  Don't expect great grades if you don't do great work, simple as that.  Put in the time and effort and you will do well.  This is real life kids, work!",1
"michael is such a cute old man! despite the fact that his tests were hard as**** and did not focus on anything in class, he was still so enthusiastic about the subject matter. great guy, ridiculous class.",1
"don't take this professor! on the last day of class, he said we 'can't ask any stupid questions', my friend asks him to repeat a question and says ""class is dismissed, get out"". He assumes we ONLY take his class with no other work for other classes, is the rudest prof, and will call you out in front of the class if you have your phone visible.",0
"I had her for math 108 online, it could be very stressful at times, but she was always a phone call or email away. She helped me a lot, I felt like I actually understood the material & she wanted to see me do well. All the endless nights of homework/quizzes/tests paid off!",1
"Dr. Avila is amazing professor, I have taken Chem I and II with her before organic and if you really want to learn and have take it easy a bit, she's the one to take. At times she is very serious, but most of the time she's very caring and sarcastic which makes her class enjoyable. I would highly recommend Dr. Avila to just about anyone.",1
"I was hesitant to take her class because of the poor reviews, but a friend of mine had taken the class prior and encouraged me to take it with her. She became my favorite professor! I loved her class and the discussions we had as a group. She is so funny and has so many stories from her time abroad. I definitely recommend taking her!!",1
"She's very amusing, knowledgable, and overall just a great teacher. ",1
"I loved Prof. McArdle. SUCH a funny and sweet guy, and he really cares about your wellbeing. He wants you to get an A and he'll do anything he can to help you get there. Super understanding with any out-of-class issues you may have going on. 100% recommend!",1
"Great teacher, very helpful, and isn't too strict on enforcing due dates. He explains everything really well and will take the time to help you out during class, but you gotta be willing to put forth at least a little effort.",1
"I have mixed feelings about her.  She is very knowledgeable, but she makes far too much of an attempt to seem cool.  She's outrageous, spouting the F bomb and talking about sex. The projects will eat up your life too, so don't get behind. And hope that you don't get Russell as your TA, he is hopeless.",1
There are 5 tests and 2 extra credit opportunities. I advice you to take part of the extra credit to have that as a boost for your grade bc if you flop on all the exams its a wrap for your grade. Knox isn't the worst but he isn't the best either. Assigned seating. The class was interesting as far as speakers & videos. Fairly recommend. Late course.,0
"Professor was up front that it is more difficult to take trig online. You need to be able to study and learn material for yourself, but he picked a good text; its online homework is time-consuming but you can get the system to hold your hand and walk you through problems step-by-step. Reviews mostly reflect the tests. Lenient grading.",1
"Short papers, blogs and a 4-5 part final paper.  At least 2 of these are due every week.  She's not clear on answers. Open book tests but she takes so many points off for everything else that it doesn't matter. Expects very detailed everything but never gives an example of what she wants and you lose an incredible amount of points for it. ",0
"Good thing is that she stopped using the textbook to save students money. Bad thing is that you will fail this class if you didn't take Spanish all through high school. It's not for beginners, it's difficult to understand most times, and the class moves on with the wrong assumption that the last topic you spent 10 seconds on completely made sense.",1
"I have taken three of his courses. Great Professor.  Crititical thinker that encourages one to think and see through different lenses / perspectives (his common line.) He has a unique teaching style and is an intelligent man. He is not very strict regarding attendance however, miss one class and you miss out on a lot of material. He is pretty flexi",1
"RICHARD <33 made me love earthquakes so much, such a good prof, take him please!!",1
"She makes this class really hard, but if you ask for help outside of class it will help. She moves too quickly through material, her accent makes her hard to understand, and she doesn't answer questions in class well. There are graded clicker questions each class. There is a semester long group project. Definitely suggest going to office hours.",0
Her class is so boring!!!!!! She needs to make this class more interesting!!!!She gives hw which is extra credit towards her exams so I suggest that you do it. The book is very useful. She is very careless about her students and her exams are hard!,0
"The most stressful class I have ever taken. He doesn't give clear instruction and doesn't really teach you how to take pictures. Make sure you submit something on the assignment due date even though you don't do a good job. Because he will only grade everything at the end of the semester, which means you won't know your grade until then.",0
"I was told that I took the class AFTER they revamped it, so it may have been a lot harder since they were testing it out on the new group of kids. She was okay, tried to make things clear, but the exams were SO difficult, and no partial credit. Did my best, but did not enjoy it too much.",1
"Easy, boring & useless",0
"She is very unclear in lectures. She doesn't use blackboard at all and if you want to know your grade you have to go into her office with her to calculate it. Email her, she probably won't reply. As if she's against technology. The textbook will really be your lifesaver as well as the online study modules and Pearson homework. Drops lowest quiz.",0
"Nina is sweet and caring, but clearly favors philosophy students. Tough marker and not the most interesting.",0
This was his first semester teaching stats. Professor Maher is really knowledgeable about statistics and how to use R software. His tests are very inconsistent and is inconsistent with grading curves. He does not post his lecture slides on blackboard and he goes through the slides very fast. Great beard.,1
"Listen. She's a good professor, ok? If you go to class, she offers a lot of extra credit. Also, I don't think her class is hard. Everything is literally from the notes. Sometimes  she'll really reeach for a real life example/metaphor (?)  and it doesn't work lol, especially in the beginning. She'll round you up a grade. You'll be ok! Good luck!",1
I learned a lot in this class.,1
"Great professor! He is a  little intimidating, but once you get comfortable you can get a lot from David and his class! He is helpful and lays out the assignments clearly. Very organized and quick to grade, plus he keeps his Moodle up to date! I really enjoy not having the stress of being tested, it makes it easier to take in what we are taught. ",1
Pros (3),1
"Dr. Hart. Her review slides are longer than the lectures themselves.. babbles on about her personal life more than the protists she adores and fingi she thinks are cool. Save yourself and avoid her at all costs. Or just go off the textbook and skip class, lectures are not worth it.",0
"She waits until the last minute to give grades and feedback. She tries to be understanding but doesn't really provide help that is well, helpful. Her essay prompts are too specific for an Eng 101 class and the grading criteria is vague hence why she has so much feedback to say. Overall terrible experience, wouldn't recommend. Would give her a zero",0
"He is not really the personal teacher that would memorize you're name, and I personally liked that. This class is extremely easy, the only thing needed is half a brain a or a ton of work. If you struggled, even failed a math class in highschool (like I did,) you'll do fine with his detailed teaching",1
"If you struggle with math or haven't taken math in a while, I recommend you take this teacher. She is amazing !!! The best math teacher I have ever had. I have seen some bad reviews on her but they don't make sense because she is very helpful and does care about her students passing her class. She does have some typos in lectures but she fixes it.",1
"Professor Logue is very enthusiastic about Spanish and wants her students to do well. She is nice and spends the time to help her students if they reach out. However, her class is weighted and there are so many different moving parts to her class that if you miss one assignment you are screwed. It is a bit all over the place, and not an easy A.",1
She is so sweet and tries her best to make sure you understand the material! Her exams arent too bad - based on the books you read. She gives good feedback on essays and lets you edit them for a higher grade. Def recommend her!,1
I really liked Dr. Ranft but wasn't crazy about his class. Class attendance is 100% mandatory. His tests are all essay based and require some preparation. He made the subject pretty interesting. ,1
"She is the worst professor at the university. In a class about why one ought not to make sweeping generalizations about groups of people, she found it very necessary to do so with regard to her class. She insulted the prior education and viewpoints of the class on a daily basis. She is a hypocrite and a know it all, who doesn't actually know jack.",0
da bomb digittyyyy.   she:  - takes time to explain things - offers extra help - very nice - fair marking - very lenient - ANSWERS EMAILS/PMs VERY QUICKLY - gives good feedback - much more  TAKE HER CLASS NOWW !!!,1
"NEVER take ecology with her unless you can get the tests from previous years. She'll talk about something in class for maybe 5 seconds and put an entire page of questions on the test. She literally can't teach and makes the class based off of group quizzes. Really difficult time passing this class and I'm usually an A student, good luck w yang.",0
"Quizzes every week on chapters, two major exams Mid-Term and Final. All online and you can use your notes and definitely save or print out the quizzes each week as those questions are legit your questions in the mid and final. Labs every week, labs are fun. Always willing to help the students pass the class. Would definitely take again.",1
This professor is AWESOME! He is one of the best Math Professors at CSULA! His test are very fair!! (2 Midterms & Final). He always reviews a couple of days before the exams so their won't be no surprises. Homework is collected every week but its not bad since during lecture he goes over a few of the problems. & he always adds humor to math,1
"He is the best professor in Hofstra, he is brilliant he should be in Harvard. He will capture your attention immediately & makes the material in class interesting & relevant to what is going on in the world today. It's A hard class but he makes you want to come to class & learn. I learned more in his one class than in an entire semester of courses.",1
"Very difficult to understand her teaching style. She isn't really one to answer any questions as her excuse is ""I don't have enough time"" to answer them. Her grading style is very off and seems a little unrealtic to pass the class. I don't recommend taking her if your math skills aren't up to par. She's not one to go into detail about.",0
"i never had a great interest for astronomy, but i have always liked science. lots of information paced into this class. extra credit offered. 3 tests, lowest test is counted as only 15% of grade. 7 homework assignments that take about 1.5hrs each. homework 25% of grade. nice guy with lots of knowledge, it was hard to take in all the information.",1
Easy A if you do your weekly online quiz and short reflection. One project and it is a super easy A on the assignment. Should definitely take this class for an easy A. Make sure you check to see if there is an activity to see whether you NEED to go to class.,1
He's awesome. 4 tests and a final. About one written homework assignment per week. Most of this class is common sense which will really help your gpa. Take this class for your gen eds!!,1
"Yes, you have to teach yourself and a little more work than what you would expect from a 100 level class but overall if you do the work there's no reason you can't get a B or higher. Uses old exams by copy & paste and once you get a feel for the class not too bad. Usually gives extra credit for tests which help out a lot.",1
"Dr. Fontenot has knowledge, but he doesn't share it. He easily gets distracted and rambles about unrelated content, which resulted in the class being several weeks behind. He is late to class all the time, he will not stick to the syllabus, is an incredibly harsh marker, and is rude to students. I would avoid him unless you want a hard time.",0
Psychology is not easy to learn. Professor Kim tries hard to make everyone understand the concept.,1
"Prof. Dodson is so helpful and really knows her subject area well.  She is funny and understanding of student problems also.  If you fear math but don't mind putting out the effort to learn, then she is a great professor to have because she helps make things so much easier and understandable.",1
It's true that 3140 is hard. But Dr. Swift made it even harder. He doesn't fit into the online course AT ALL. You were expected to do heavy quizzes and exams within an extremely short time. And he actually think the time was way too much for the students. It's very upset that a professor can be such detached to his students.,0
Sweetest lady ever. So cute.,1
This class is pretty much all self-teaching and memorization. She reads over the entire powerpoint in class which is not very helpful. The written portion of her exams are hard but she gives partial points and curves all the exams. She also gives lots of extra credit. Getting an A is possible but you have to put in a lot of effort.,1
"Freshman here. I had some issues adjusting to being away from home, as well as the workload that comes with attending a university. I fell behind (like bad, I was failing pretty hard), but Heyborne worked with me to get caught up. He had no reason to give me a second chance, but he did. I highly recommend his class. He's definitely the best.",1
"This is a pretty easy class but Dr. Sullivan is really disorganized which can make it harder. Almost the entire grade is based on a project which although easy is very time consuming and feels like a bunch of busy work. He's a very cool professor though, definitely your stereotypical quirky professor.",0
"Dr. Atkinson is a great professor, mentor and all around good guy. Go to class! He is awesome! He is very helpful during office hours and really cares about his students. ",1
"Nice man and a great chemist, but I found his lectures to be all over the place. He rushes through examples so fast and skips mathematical steps, so if you plan on just learning from lecture and not reading the book... Good luck. A lot of out of class effort is required for this class, I found it harder than organic.",0
She's Awesome ,1
Does not care about students and it shows!  Multiple choice exams ... he does not care about student learning!!,0
"I took her compressed course with Math 115 & 125. One of the BEST professors I've ever had. Very passionate and caring about her job. She is always clear on her lectures, stops to answer your questions, and sacrifices a lot of personal time to review for tests. Lots of HW yeah, but its only to make sure you get the material stuck in your head!",1
She was a great professor. Very open to helping and made the class extremely interesting. Fell behind a little in 101 and had to use 102 to catch up but she really helped with that. Lots of improvement over the year. Ended up loving her and the class.,1
AWESOME professor! I learned a lot from her! The workload varies depending on how much for your 4 year college plan you have already figured out prior to taking this course. Easy A and the textbook is straightforward. Be sure to answer the homework questions completely for full credit. Meetings not required but the course is easier if you attend.,1
"Professor Nikkel is very knowledgable and intelligent. He explains and covers his materials thoroughly. He is not like some professors who teach one thing, and when you get to their tests/exams you wonder where did he/she get the info from. What he teaches in class is what you get on the exams.",1
Gave us thoughtful and interesting pieces to read with great insight.,1
"hilarious guy. great sense of humor and just can't seem to keep from smiling. however, his tests are RIDICULOUSLY hard. and LONG. however, he really wants to help you and he puts a ton of work into the class. its definitely a gpa killer though",1
"Saas is a real gem, always make corny jokes throughout the semester. Show up to class, if no excuse then 10 deduction. Just do what is asked, meet his requirements for speeches and turn things in on time, then you'll end up with an A+. Super chill and laid back. (PS. NO MIDTERM/FINAL)",1
Great teacher. Makes the class really fun and interesting to listen to. He grades very fairly for writing pieces. Not super strict in grading but you do have to put effort into the work. Also gives good feedback for the essays and such. Lots of reading overall but it's manageable if you keep up.,1
A nice guy overall. He is easier to pass than most other NCSU profs bc he curves everything heavily. Grading is 95% from 5 exams. He does not indicate what will actually be important so you have to study everything and then might have several questions on info from one slide while entire chapter is ignored. Use outside resources and you'll be fine.,0
"English is not my first language, and i didnt know much about Eng Comp until i took her clas. At the beginning she might come across as arrogant, but she is very helpful and by the end of the semester i learned a lot. But she is tough when grading essays and homework, you need to take her class seriously.",1
"Excellant teacher, will recommend.",1
"Not worth the effort if you are just taking this class for core credit. If you take his lecture back to back with the lab, be prepared for him to lecture well into lab time leaving your lab as homework. Spends a lot of lecture time telling you why you should be interested in Geology instead of just teaching it. Tests are extremely difficult.",1
"Had a great time in Brett's class, he let us clown around enough to blow off steam, but he always got right back to plugging away.  Covered lots of good material, and was always encouraging.  See you at graduation Brett!",1
"She is an amazing teacher that cares about her students. As long as you do the work, you will get a passing grade.",1
"the class is hard, exams are lecture heavy and I felt that things studied for weren't even on them. There are a lot of assignments, quizzes, and exams that are crammed together- it can be difficult due to the overlapping. Lab is easy, you learn as you go. There are only two lab exams and they are easy A's. The book was used once for hw on a chapter",1
She is such a nice person! she will help you understand the class especially is you are a freshman and do not how to college.,1
Excellent teacher! Does a great job of keeping everyone interested through positive individual inclusion during the class.  Lots of work though.  If you're in 1505 you need to come to class regularly.,1
"super organized and gives well thought out feedback on all assignments. Every resource, rubric, assignment, etc. could be found easily within Canvas. I appreciate the fact that we can resubmit revised versions of our work, throughout the year, for better a grade. I honestly loved the Hybrid style of ENGL 2030 because I got Thursday off.",1
"He is seriously the nicest professor you will ever have. So caring & considerate and a very level headed guy. If you put in the work, he will work with you & make sure you succeed. Great professor.",1
Absolutely brilliant educator. She was very simple to understand.,1
"OMG, I am 30 yrs old, and never been to college and this man is a trip. Makes you feel like you belong in the class and is extremely easy. Open book tests and 15 homework assignments! Awesome Teacher and a trip!",1
Angie has the most entertaining lectures I've ever been to. If you're a frosh in HK you have to take her for the intro class and it is the best. Her class is entertaining and interesting but I wouldn't call it 'easy'. She is also a hot af so take that as an excuse to go to every class.,1
Dave is a very funny and entertaining teacher. Business 101 is an introductory class so there is a lot of information to learn. That being said he lectures are never boring and he is there to help if you need him.,1
"I generally found Professor Wolverton's class to be enjoyable, but nothing that blew me away. I believe that she is a very good teacher, but her lecture style personally did not suit me. She lectures almost exclusively on the chalkboard, which can seem unorganized and scattered at times. She's also a tough grader, although not unfair.",1
"There are no real math classes at NAU unless you take Falk. He is the only reason I'm still at this school. I don't understand the other reviews, I mean would you rather him assign the toddler exercises that appear in most books?",1
"One of my favorite professors here, she really cares about you being able to pass with a high grade, you have to show up though as she takes attendance and it will affect your grade if you don't show. lots of group work and makes you do ice breakers which actually helped in having the class speak instead of sitting there quietly. great teacher!",1
There were a lot of test which is good but they were a lot of questions and people were often rushed. His grading policy is really harsh and the quizzes are due at weird times. Hes really funny but gets upset when people ask questions. Not very helpful if you dont understand the information,1
"He talks at you, his questions to the class are 99% rhetorical.Gives take home multiple choice tests with multiple right answers per question, but he decides what the ""most right"" answer is. The class is not interactive, it's just his monologues. End of the class multiple difficult essays are due, with no homework before then that would help you.",1
"His lectures are very interesting. I easily get bored durint long periods of conversations, but not in his class. Especially since everything he says is important, and will likely be on his tests. Many students don't appreciate his hard lectures and exams, but I did because it made it that much more worth it in the end. I learned alot!",1
"This guy is the man! I've had him for a few classes already, and plan to have him for some more. He lectures a lot, but is willing to stop and explain everytime a hand is raised. Likes to show hollywood movies to get the point of his class across. Great teacher! Highly recommend taking all of his classes!",1
"Great professor. Does A LOT to prepare you for tests and it really helps. Explains things very well. When she talks about a concept, she always tells us the reasoning behind it which will help you remember everything, not just memorize it. Use the materials she gives for test practice and u probably won't get lower than a B on a test. Def take her!",1
"Not a traditional class by any means. Not easy, but a lot of tedious small work. Gives you plenty of chances to earn an A. If you dont receive an A in this class your lazy and should not be at Temple. J Street knows Philly local politics.",1
Hes good people through and through.,1
He doesn't follow the syllabus to teach. Hard to understand.,0
"Doctor SC was the best. You always knew exactly what she was asking of you, and she makes political science courses super interesting.",1
"He is okay, but he talks about the most irrelevant things like how he chugged 28 beers in high school, seriously? I am paying top dollar to go to this uni to not have my professor sound like another frat brother. He is sooo scattered brain and his office hour culture is ridiculous. I do not have time to sit in his stuffy office all day to get help",1
"Dr. Z stimulated student's interest in the subject, even for concepts that were not as ""intriguing"" at first glance. Awesome anatomy professor!",1
"Dr. Clementz is clearly very passionate about neuroscience, but because of that he spent a LOT of time going into excruciating detail on minor topics. He also went way over 50 minutes every single class. Never responded to emails either. If you thoroughly read the textbook it isn't very hard to do well, but these things were pretty annoying.",0
"He is very nice and easygoing, but has a heavy accent (Chinese?) and can be difficult to understand. Also, he is not helpful when you don't understand a concept and need to ask questions.. All things considered, I would not recommend him. I had to heavily rely on my book to learn in this class.",0
"Seriously one of the best teachers you could have at ELAC. She cares about her students and will make sure you understand the material. She is very clear when teaching and she doesn't assign to much work. Overall a great teacher, would highly recommend.",1
He is an awesome teacher. He fully reviews before a test and he assigns current events. Sometimes he shows videos and I think he actually likes what he does. He's a cool guy and you'll learn a lot from him. :),1
Took her class a couple semesters ago. Really excited to hear she is teaching math 121. Unfortunately I will be unable to attend this class because the location does not work for me. Very caring teacher.,1
"Melvin Hall makes you read TONS of redundant material;  over 200 boring pages a week!  His tests have obscure questions that are hard to  answer.  The reading makes you fall asleep while slogging through it.  Avoid this teacher and EPS 550, Marisa Crowley (she uses his tons of reading  material ).  This class is NOT about learning.",0
I think I've learned more in IDE and in doing the NXP car project than any other class. He's definitely the best professor I've had so far. His lectures aren't boring in the slightest. The labs are a lot of work but it's worth the knowledge you gain.,1
Go to class and pay attention and you will be fine. He is straight forward and will tell you what to study for each test and the final exam. His notes are very good and labs are not that bad. MUST TAKE FOR ME3500,1

Great teacher. Really cares. Would take again,1
I took him for online summer class 1102 and it was pretty good. You DO need to participate in the discussions and triple check your essay before submitting it because he WILL give you points off for small things like wrong font etc. Overall he's pretty funny and easy to work with. Responses within 24h excluding weekend.,1
"Professor Sanchez is a sweet and caring abuela who lets the class go in the direction the students want. She teaches you about the histories and relates them to today and current events, where you have sometimes deeper meaning conversations in Spanish. If you just complete the short homework every day and try you can get an A",1
Dont take him.Very boring and waste of time and money.. Will not learn anything..Dont please DO A FAVOR ON URSELF...............,0
Really helpful...lots of extra credit and study sessions. Fair...patient...helpful.,1
Professor O'Donnell is a great teacher. Very Structured but very approachable. I learned a lot about public speaking that I did not already know and I have her in fall for Drama Theater Literature,1
"Never take this professor. He lets you have a page for exams to write down anything you want, but it doesnt help because tests are designed to confuse you, my class avg for the 1st test was a 28% and the extra credit offered due to this was hrs worth of hw for a max of 2%. No point going to class because you usually will spend the time watching TV.",0
"Prof. Magallon is one of the most insightful teachers Ive ever had. I loved going to her class and learned a great deal. She gave me confidence in my writing and as a student. Do the work expected, with effort, get an A. Homework, outside reading, pop quizzes. Prepare to work hard outside of class but it's worth it. I'd take her again, forsure.",1
Professor Chavez is a great instructor! She made the class fun and it was easy to understand the material with help from her and the textbook used. She responds quickly to emails when you need help with assignments.,1
"What a terrible professor. He rushes through his lectures. We have class Mon and Thurs 8:30-9:45, and this fool always ends it right at 9:30 and relaxes the rest of the day. Tough grader and expects answers in a certain way. Definitely the worst professor I've ever had. Worst part is? You have very few grades. Only 6 hw assignments and 4 exams.",0
She is awesome.  This class is meant to be a grade booster as its for students who were on academic probation.  She wants the students to do well and will do anything for them. She truly has our back in ANY situation.  She bring real life stories to class from her own stories and celebrities.  I never got less than a 100% on an assignment.  ,1
"Amazing professor! He made critical theory fun! So easy to understand it after he explains it in class, and the papers/exams were so easy. He really cares about his students, and he admitted at the beginning of the semester that you shouldn't contact him through email. Very enjoyable class! Just write 2 discussion questions and show up.",1
Easy class,1
"Mean, just mean",0
Dr. Colavecchia is a great lecturer. Her podcasts are useful when you can't make it. I re-watched/re-listened to the podcasts when I was studying for the term tests. You can re-listen at the gym or while you're driving. The content is interesting. Make sure you read the courseware and know the facts for the tests/quizzes and you'll do well.,1
"Seems like a nice guy, but that means little when 90% (his #, not mine) of students fail his classes. He moves quickly, and you take TONS of notes. By the time you finish writing something, he already moved on. I know everyone makes mistakes when doing math, but we have to correct him 8 or 10 times a day. He uses ambiguous wording on tests, too.",0
Ben is a really nice and smart guy but I do not recommend his class. He's very confusing. He tries to help but usually just confuses you more. He does use the online part of the Algebra 1 and 2 textbook which has great examples if you follow along. They have examples and online personnel to help with questions. It's the only reason I did so well.,0
She is like a mother figure. She will help you and take care of you. Be ready for constructive criticism. She is straight up but wants you to succeed. She has a good humor and can connect to any student. Respect her.,1
"Professors don't come better than Dr. Hinch - if there is room in any class of his sign up. This is the 2nd time I've taken his classes and have never enjoyed my education more. Tom genuinely cares about you, your education & input, gives relevant examples, fair/reasonable expectations for workload, and made a dry topic like policy interesting.",1
"I loved Patti- she was a great teacher. A real tough grader, definitely not a class to take for an easy A. Quite a few papers, but overall she really made sure I understood the texts and was always open when I needed help.",1
"Burke's a great guy. Took his advanced historical writing class and had to write a 20 page paper. (If you are a History or Social Studies Major at NKU you will have to write this paper no matter who you take 389 with) If you pay attention to his instruction and the resources he gives you, you'll make it. After the draft, the class is a breeze.",1
"Prof Harding is a very nice person who is clearly passionate about the material in the class. Sometimes his powerpoints and lectures were all over the place which made it hard to study for quizzes. A fair grader on the writing assignments in the class. Overall, a difficult class regardless of the professor, but Prof Harding made it tolerable!",1
"Daily homework but accepts late homework as well. Expect 4 to 5 exams plus the final. Attendance is not mandatory but if you're not good in math, you can fall behind.",1
"Worst prof I've ever had.  Made our entire class redo an assignment because he said none of us did it correctly, failing to realize he clearly is not good at communicating what he wants.  Quite harsh as well in his criticisms and expects you to do a LOT of work per assignment.  Tough marker as well.  Avoid this class if possible!",0
"Participate, seek assistance when needed and your time in this class will be worth it; dont participate and you will rate Matt and the class awful. But who's fault is that? Everyone I spoke to learned something more than they knew about public speaking. That was my goal, I'm pleased with the results, thank you Professor Rosenberg",1
No Comments,1
This woman is crazy. She told us not to let kids use glitter because they will sniff it. She should retire. Avoid her class because you will learn nothing.,0
I really enjoyed her class but I personally feel like she's a feminist.  :(  I put in a lot of effort and still a C? ,0
"She makes it easy to study. She gives you videos to watch on youtube and the website she grades hw on, helps you solve problems when you need it. She helps you if you have questions. She drops your lowest score. Downside is she gives a bit too much of hw. if she tests you on pearson she only gives you an hour to finish but 2 hours if its by hand.",1
"Dr Mensah is the Professor Ojelade of the Poli Sci Department, but actually nice and respected. His classes are GOD easy, as you only have to do the test and he reuses the same test that he's created since he first made the class. However, as said, he is very kind and funny and that alone made me want to come to class as he doesn't check attendance",1
WORST TEACHER EVER! she took points off assignments because of stupid things like forgetting to put the feet sign. and not just one point when i did this but 3.,0
Great teacher. Really encouraging and helpful. Public speaking won't be hard with her. My only complaint was I felt like she gave the peer critiques on speeches too much weight. But great class overall!,1
"Part of my rating is about the overall class as a whole w/ material. Professor Kula himself is a great teacher. Yes, in the beginning he was intimidating and scary, but as the semester progressed, he definitely warmed up. The material itself was difficult for me, but I don't believe he should be penalized for that. He's just doing his job!",1
This class was the easiest online class I've taken. The answers are word for word in the book and you can use the book for every test including midterm and final. (She even tells you what section in each chapter),1
"For someone not interested in math, this class was very dull and seemed to be a lot harder than it would have to be. She seems pleasant enough but doesn't make any attempt to connect to most students. Not a great teacher; take someone else for 125 if you can.",0
Great professor! Really accommodating and wanted to see each student succeed.,1
Professor Lanning  really knows the subject he teaches. If you don't understand a concept in class he is willing to go over it extensively during his office hours. His test are based on his lectures and homework's. Their are 3 midterms and a final that is cumulative.,1
Saas was an awesome professor. He was very laid back and was really lenient. He really does care about his students. He wants everyone to pass. This class is an easy A. Literally just do what is asked of you and turn it in on time and you'll get an A. Not a hard class at all. He's also really funny.,1
He went off and got a new job at Google like 2/3 through the semester and dropped the ball on our class. Told us about a huge final project and then ended up assigning it like 3 days before it was due. It ended up being easier than anticipated but it was a stress fest. Was too busy to answer any questions via Slack so no one knew what was happening,0
"PROFESSOR IS AWESOME! The class is hard, but he provides every resource to help you. I didn't attend office hours so I don't know how good he is at helping 1 on 1, but the TA's are helpful. Old test and quizzes are posted w/solutions which are useful. Class is clear and straightforward. UNderstand your HW and you'll get an A. Also be fast.",1
"Took Engineering Mathematical Analysis with Dr Gueye, and he was absolutely useless. Constantly did examples incorrectly in class, never answered student questions properly and provided incorrect solutions to the lab work. He also planned and marked exams so you would be rushed to complete, make small errors and get 0 for the whole question.",0
Horrible class structure and the professor is a bit crazy. I dropped this class because I had a bad feeling about him. He has lots of assignments and he is ridiculous about how he requires you to submit them. The class has a horrible structure and he treats the students like it is a second grade class.,0
Read homework. Do the essays. She does not b s. Around in class. Tough but fair.  Expects students to be serious and will call out those who act stupid. Not a class for immature idiotsdoes not give out class notes. Take good notes. Don't email her with 1000 excuses why you can't come to class. If you can't come to class its your grade going down.,1
"Great time in this intro class. A few people were in the wrong class since CIS111 is actually the beginner class, not 110. Confusing much? We learned a lot and the Excel section is a great introduction to it's many uses. There was extra credit and bonuses for getting all of the assignments done on time. She wasn't easy by any means, you earn it. ",1
"Pretty useless professor. Mumbles in some unintelligible language which slightly resembles english throughout his lectures. His exams cover material which he doesn't go over in any detail until afterwards. grades the exams based solely on the answer and maybe a little work, so even the smallest error can bring you down to a c/d.  Not reccomended",0
Russ explained some concepts very well in class but doesn't cover everything you need to know for the quizzes. The class itself is very easy to get an A in just read the textbook and answer the questions Russ has posted on Blackboard. You don't even need to go to class unless you want to ask him a question. Very easy.,1
"Good modern teacher, helpful in corrections and personable, although can be a bit moody sometimes. I definitely learned a lot from her, esp. in terms of style--she can be very dogmatic about style! In generaly, I liked her class, though!",1
"Amazing professor. He's very kind, offers you help, and he's really funny. I took 3 classes with him and they were all really interesting and fun. He'll help you if you ask or not, but do ask and he gives feedbacks. 150% recommend, you won't regret it :)",1
"Super funny, super inspirational. He will let you redo pretty much all of the assignments. The tutorial assignments are annoying, but he hates them too and will give you full credit as long as you turn them in on time. The only issue I've had is participation. You have to earn 20 participation cards over the semester and it's harder than it sounds.",1
"Her tests are a little hard, but she does give a review before every test. She's hilarious and reminds me of my mawmaw. Great teacher for my first semester at McNeese.",1
I loved Dr. Carter's class. He is always prepared for class and each class has something that will make you think. One of the best gen eds you can take.,1
Everyone on here is saying she's hard and her exams are difficult but they weren't even difficult UNLESS you study. You have to memorize word for word and to read ahead before the lectures. People who don't do this will get a B+ or something and will complain. She's pretty helpful as she replies quickly to emails and gives reviews :-),1
QBUS 110 was a difficult class. He cares about his students a lot and wants everyone to succeed but sometimes he doesn't explain things well.,1
"Prof Hart wants you to learn but is very unorganized, if you can stand hearing the word ""um"" 10000 times then its the class for you, dont even bother printing the handouts because you cannot follow them! The readings are pointless n mean nothing. WOULD NOT TAKE HER AGAIN!",0
There are 2 midterms which are easy if you truly study the study guide. 3 quizzes based off of the 3 books you read outside of class (read them or you won't pass the quizzes). Participation is 5% and all you have to do is be present on the day of exams. As far as class goes it is mostly power point with a few videos. Boring but manageable.,1
He is ADORABLE. And smart. And nice. And funny. And wise. Did I mention ADORABLE?,1
"Prof Ruzek is a really great teacher. She provides solid feedback for assignments, allowing students to develop and improve their writing throughout the semester. Although the textbook isn't necessary for the class, reading it will help improve your writing ability. She is also flexible with due dates. Overall 10/10 would recommend",1
"She isn't very helpful, and (in my class at least) often refused to explain problems or questions because she was always in a rush. She would write it out but never explained how she DID the problem. Very frustrating. She grades fairly harshly, but she's a pretty friendly person to just chat with after class.",0
Dr. Portaro is awesome! She is super nice and wants to help her students. She speaks clearly and always teaches interesting topics. She's a fair grader as well. ,1
"Kenzer's class is one of my most enjoyable. He assigns readings everyday, but he chooses them so that they're applicable to the class. The quizzes are not hard at all if you pay attention to what he says and do the readings. He has great availability and teaches in a way that keeps every class interesting.",1
"Lectures are boring, VERY boring. He's funny. You don't have HW other than online quizzes, which don't matter that much because the tests run the grades basically. This was the only class I could not get an A in no matter how much I studied or tried. There's no curriculum, no method or comprehension. If you can memorize a lot of stuff you're good.",0
Easy class. The test questions are exactly the same as the study guide in the back of the book. Class can get a little boring sometimes but its mostly because its a 3 hour class. She's funny and her accent is great.,1
"Great teacher, she does her best to make sure you understand the material in the easiest way possible. You should definitely take her classes.",1
"Extremely knowledgable, amazing at lecturing, is very patient/kind and helpful during office hours, and clearly just wants you to succeed (unlike many ECON profs). BUT, administratively, he needs assistance. Loses assignments, forgets to assign assignments --- the syllabus will not be followed. Be comfortable not knowing where you stand pre-final.",1
tough grader but worth it. as long as you pay attention use your book and do the work you'll do fine. DON'T BE LATE TO LAB EVER. very funny and HELPS you UNDERSTAND chemistry. great teacher overall,1
"I learned a lot in his class. He is very smart and you can ask him about anything. He goes off topic a lot but you sure do learn a lot from it! Overall, I enjoyed his class. Worth taking.",1
"An amazing teacher, material taught is immediately useable in your field",1
"Horrible! Gives out worksheets that don't make sense or missing information and don't realize it until someone points it out. Answers very vaguely or his answer isn't helpful at all. Very stressful to work with. Sometimes give you readings that barely if any, helps with the homework. He is the definition of why not everyone should not be a teacher.",0
"Sweet lady! Easy online course, quizes every week and either a journal or forum post every other week. Yes you have work to do, and there's a time consuming final essay, but I enjoyed it.  ",1
There were 2 big papers and the final was basically revising and reflecting on your writing throughout the semester. Lectures are boring but she answers any questions you have. You have to put in the work to get an A in the class.,1
Give's great feedback to each paper. Customizes your homework based upon your individual learning needs.,1
Dr. Wisner is nice and the class is well organized. He makes his expectations clear from the beginning and gives really useful feedback on your writing. Discussion posts are absolutely vital so don't skip them.,1
"If you just take notes during his lectures, and follow the objectives in the syllabus, you are pretty much guaranteed an A in the course.",1
Professor Trubatch is a nice enough guy but his class is the hardest I have ever taken. My entire class is failing due to a horrible textbook and unclear lectures. Quizzes are nothing like what we do in class. It is defeating that a class full of math majors are failing a math class. I have never put so much in without any results.,0
"She knows her stuff. Has an accent, but she writes out everything she says. She genuinely loves teaching, told my class, ""I can't wait to tell you guys all about this!"" She's easy to talk to and extremely smart. Highly recommend. Don't skip classes at all. The notes are clear, but you'll understand more if you got to lecture.",1
She takes attendance EVERY class! Actually paying attention is optional. Don't bother buying the book; everything is in the powerpoints she gives you. You must memorize absolutely everything in those slides though. Tests are lots of multiple choice and a few essay style Q's. Read Q's very carefully. Will have a paper and group pres at the end.,1
"I could say a ton of great things about professor Robinson! Out of all the science professors at HGTC she was by far the best. She was very clear, organized, and straight to the point . She made the material easy to understand and made it almost impossible to fail her class ! I usually get Cs in bio but passed her lab and lecture with As!!",1
"I am not done yet. He might have passed his exams and managed to be smart once, but he ain't any more. This guy can't even answer a questions without saying things like: uh emmm uhh what does the boo say. or, eh umm i don't,, uhh what do you think? I have my own opinions about discrimination but since i don't have fact i'm not going to talk about",0
"Very caring, adapts to students needs, devoted prof. has a lot of wisdom, Awesome!",1
Absolutely do NOT recommend!!! I took AP Calculus in high school and passed the class but after taking his class I failed the final and now have to retake the course. His tests and quizzes were unreasonably difficult and I basically had to reteach myself calculus. He just rants about Newton and physics without actually teaching anything. Stay Away!,0
The absolute best Professor. She teaches the concepts in layman terms and makes sure you understand everything. She would not just let it go if you are confused. pleasant classroom experience. I would take her again in a beat. Clear set expectations and homework was not overwhelming at all. Reviews for test are excellent.,1

"I took it online but ended up dropping her because I just couldn't take it anymore. There are three exams and 5 HW. A ridiculous long project plus you have to do peer feedback for EVERYTHING. All material comes from the book. Meaning she hardly contributes anything original, even the powerpoints come straight from the book. Lame and boring.",0
"She is such A DOLL, I really enjoy her and the class. If you do the work you well pass, if you need help she will help you because she want you to pass and do the work. Make sure you follow her direction if she changes the assignment up because you well lost point but if you do that it pretty easy A.",1
She was amazing. I learned so much about music history! She even played piano some classes. Awesome teacher. Sad I only had her for a quad.,1
Professor Conta BEST TEACHER EVER I NEVER GET BORED SUPPER NICE AND VERY EASY HE TELLS U WHAT IS ON THE TEST AND ALL U NEED TO DO IS STUDY THATS ALL !! EASY N FAIR JUSTICE IS SERVED !,1
I want to be Dr. Braun when I grow up.,1
Tom actually cares about the course and your understanding of the material. If anyone else taught this class it would be super boring! Tom is passionate about giving students not only a increase in knowledge but a way to jump start your career. He knew my name by the second class! Speak up in class! Seriously no dumb questions with Tom.,1
"He's not very clear with assignments and his discussions. That's the only downfall. However, he does provide his number to get in contact with any questions or concerns you may have. He's pretty understanding with any issues you may have. It is an easy A class if you do the work. A total of 4 quizzes and a final essay.",1
"Very smart, arrogant. Counter intuitive point of view. Buy his book or Economics of Strategy not Kotler. Attack his theories and learn to be humiliated. Very approachable but has draconian rules about homework/presentations. Don't piss him off and don't talk about things you don't understand. Don't expect solutions to cases and enjoy the ride.",1
"It was an online class, so I'll give her the benefit of the doubt. She curved the final by 10 points, but when it's worth 50% of the class, that doesn't do much. You can find a better, more caring professor willing to work with you",0
"Not a hard class when it came to subject matter, but the semester-long group project she assigned was ridiculous. Impossible to coordinate, instructions for the group assignments were very unclear, and she didn't care about our life outside her classroom, making us complete endless hours of outside work. Have a job or taking other classes? AVOID.",1
"Not a terrible teacher, but not an amazing one either. She seems to know a lot about what she's talking about, but she DOES NOT appear passionate in any way. She smiles and tries to relate to students, but at the end of the day, most students in the class do not respect her. Her class isn't extremely hard, but the prompts are a bit silly...",0
AVOID. AVOID. AVOID. I cannot say it enough times. This man thrives on seeing his students fail. His tests are downright impossible. He is an incredibly tough grader as well. I took the online course and he made us come in to take an exam because he thought we were all cheating. I promise even if you did cheat you'd probably still fail. AVOIDDDDDD!,0
"Professor Endlich is great, she is really nice and always there to help. She does give assignments during the semester, but gives you enough time to do them. You do not have any tests or quizzes at all. As long as you do all the assignments you will easily get an A.",1
I took my first online class with this professor! Amazing. Respond to discussion questions thorough and on time and youll be fine. Quiz every week and one final paper. Hes very prompt with response to emails (little as 4 hrs) and hes there If you have any questions. Great Prof!,1
"She is a great teacher for lab. She starts the class with a short lecture to introduce the topics of the lab, then we break off into different stations to do different activities at each. She gives a study guide for the test and gives recordings for the models which are very helpful.",1
"It was unclear the amount of essay questions that were going to be on the test. After failing the first test, I went and spoke with him. He was helpful in that setting. The study groups he offers are helpful, GO TO THEM! The reading is helpful but I wouldn't focus just on it.",1
"Probably one of the worst teachers iv ever had. Currently taking this online and am struggling. No guidance whatsoever. She does not seem like she wants to teach. When you ask a question there is always an attitude. Very lazy. Seems unhappy every time she speaks. There is no lecture, you teach yourself. Same for lab, its a joke. Dont take her.",0
"Very strict about grammar us and writing skills on projects. You never have tests but rather assignments to hand in. Doesn't really explain much so you kind of wing the projects but they're ok. Midterm (could be take home, if she wants), group projects, & final business plan (long. don't procrastinate). You calculate your own grade at the end.",1
"Rick is a good teacher, but the class was soooo boring..... Didnt learn to much at all. Rick tho is a nice guy and would take another course with him if it was gonna be more intresting",1
"Total Recommend anyone take this class with the Professor. She is understanding and helpful to those who do not understand the material. To those who are retaking the class like myself, this is definitely the professor to take it with.",1
"Makes every concept relatable. He is very open about his life and you will end up knowing him very well. Super sarcastic and easy going. Get the book, go to class, have fun, and you will have a good grade. Definitely take him if you can :)",1
Very funny but a horrible teacher. He does not teach just tells you what to look at in the book. Very messy on the board and jumps from one thing to another. I cried after every test but huge curves if the whole class does bad. I'd say if you have a good background in physics you'll be fine but if you're shaky with the stuff don't take.,0
"I honestly love his class! Its pretty easy, yes there are a lot of readings but they are interesting and he goes over some of them in class. Exams are straight forward if you pay attention. Wish he taught more classes!",1
"Dr. Field is the best instructor that you will find at UNL. He is laser focused on developing a culture within individual and groups of studnets that he works with. Take as many classes as possible with him. If you have the drive to work hard, desire to succeed, and want to lead then you will really enjoy your time in any of Dr. Field's classes.",1
"So respectful, so friendly, and he is the best teacher I have ever seen in my life",1
Prof Calkins is a super sweet lady and loves her students. You can easily get an A in this class if you are willing to do the work. LOTS & LOTS OF ASSIGNMENTS! DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU ARE LAZY! That being said most of the work is easy and straightforward. The class is 1 day a week so attendance is mandatory. You need to be self motivated.,1
"Dr. Draper is bright, positive, and so impressively intelligent. She strives to be each student's number one supporter and always does so with a smile and the utmost professionalism. The amount of growth and improvement students experience in her classes is truly amazing. If you want to do better and be better, Draper is the one to get you there.",1
"This guy is the best prof at NU. The best if you want to learn-not necessarily get a good grade. He will push like you have never been pushed before. HIs assignments are ruthless and he doesn't care about your social life, but you will learn! If you want to learn he is the prof to have!",1
Worst teacher I have ever had in my whole life. I tried so hard and went to ever class plus his office. He didn't help me at all. I passed the class but didn't know anything. I am now having a rough time in my later classes. I would never take him EVER!,0
"This class was the reason I added Marketing as a major. I loved it! I took this class Fall 09. She is a person to go to if you have questions. There were cases in her class, but they are so easy. Won't change a thing about her!!! <3 this class!",1
"All homework and quizzes are done online on a site you have to pay for. That's where the textbook is as well, but I never used it and passed. English is not his first language, so it may be difficult to understand what he says, but powerpoints are clear. Pay attention, show up to take notes and you'll pass. Hands out a clear syllabus.",1
"Took him for A&P 1. Tests and quizzes come right from his powerpoint but he doesnt really teach in class, so you have to put in study time everyday if you wanna ace this class. Curves pretty much every test/practical. Lecture textbook isnt needed but lab one is used. Study as much as you can on your own and show him you care and youll do fine",1
Easy class if you put forth a small bit of effort.,1
"Professor Lamprey is awesome, but her directions are not always clear, especially when explaining assignments involving Excel. Become familiar with Excel before taking this course. Other than that, she does a fantastic job teaching about modern-day technology. Tip of the hat!",1
"Avoid this teacher at all costs! Major language barrier,unorganized and sucks as a teacher. If he doesn't understand your question, he completely ignores you.",0
"I TOOK HIS ENG100 & ENG103 CLASSES 'CAUSE HE'S THE PERSON WHO MAKES U FEEL COMFORTABLE WHILE U ARE LEARNING HOW TO WRITE AN ESSAY. HE'S  WELL ORGANIZED: U READ, WRITE A LOT, AND DISCUSS THE TOPIC WITH UR CLASSMATES! WHEN I BEGAN HIS CLASS I WAS ABLE TO WRITE A PAGE LONG ESSAY, AFTER HIM I AM ABLE TO WRITE 8 PAGES LONG! ENG LANG ISNT MY NATIVE LANG!",1
"I think this was his first semester teaching. He's a cool guy and puts all the lecture power points online so you can miss some classes. He does give random graded attendance quizzes, so if you miss a bunch it can hurt you. He gives pretty helpful study guides for the tests, and we only had three tests. He even dropped the lowest grade. Solid class",1
"Attendance is not mandatory, but it will be very difficult to pass if you don't go. He always makes himself available to students for help outside of office hours. It is important to him that you understand the basics. Everything stems from them.",1
"Very clear grading criteria. Not much EC, maybe EC in a couple tests. Attendance depends on the person. We used the MyMathLab and all of the assignments were available. You didn't have to be in class. Would have been better if I have taken it online. He does give clear and understandable lectures and helps you out when you have a question.",1
Professor Reyes is really funny and he makes Spanish fun. You still have to study hard to get a good grade. Overall the class was good.,1
"The class setup is very straightforward. Prof Bachmann gives feedback on work posted. It is easy but if you miss too many assignments, it's easy to slip down a letter grade. She is very easy to reach. Replies quickly to emails.",1
"This class was extremely boring. There is a ton of reading that isn't hard, just time-consuming. Professor Wheeler can be somewhat passive-aggressive and rude. One thing that isn't great either is that she and Dr. Nieman both say the word ""Negro"" frequently. She seems like a smart lady, but her class is not engaging in the least.",0
"Very easy to talk to and helped me when needed.  The second half of this class is quite difficult and statistics. Her tests are open-ended questions and difficult to get done (13-14 questions) in the time period. Overall, she is a very good teacher and makes you learn!",1
"She's very sweet.. But a horrible instruction-giver. My research partner and I felt our way around in the dark the entire semester. Attending class is mandatory, but pointless. You will learn nothing. That being said, she's a relatively easy grader. Possible to make a good grade, but I don't recommend her.",0
take her. she is good.,1
"Very nice guy, cares about students and wants to teach. Lots of reading but they're well picked for what the lectures are about. Tests aren't bad. He'll really encourage participation. Great choice for an introductory class",1
Worst teacher ever in the whole universe!!!! Did all my work not even miss one paper or a class and he gave me my first D ever.He expects 101 work when he does not teach it!!!!!,0
"Mr. Mehmeti is an awesome teacher. He is really flexible when doing the concert reports. He extends deadlines after they are due. He is really nice too, uploads the terms for future quizzes and exams.  It's really easy to pass his class. Pay attention and you will pass the class. He also teaches with a passion he is a fun teacher and you will learn",1
Professor McConnell is great! He does not take attendance. But it is mandatory to go because if you don't go you will miss his great lecture and will not be able to complete the homework assignments. Taking professor McConnell for STATS was the best decision I made during SPRING semester! Definitely take his course you will not regret it!,1
"Brown is fine. He keeps his voice low and is very reliant on slide presentations that have a LOT of material, and if you miss a day you miss a lot of information not included in the actual pres., but WILL be included on the test. I found him interesting enough, but the class was very boring with him. Tests have a lot of material on them.",0
Lectures are pointless but you have to go because of pop quizzes. If you arent already experienced with computers or programming prepare to teach yourself. The class itself isnt that difficult but he assumes you have prior knowledge. Very bad lectures.,0
"She is an outstanding and understanding professor, especially during difficult times.",1
"Took an online math class with him. It was the usual, done in math labs. Don't forget a quiz because he will not let you make it up, no matter what. Clear grading criteria and responds to emails pretty fast.",1
Very easy class he explains everything in depth so its very easy to understand. going to class helps understand material tests are easy mainly common sense and the reviews provide answers. i would highly recommend,1
One of the most well rounded and knowledgeable people you will ever meet.,1
She is really great at teaching. If you miss a few classes you need to get notes from someone in your class or you will be lost. She's very understanding and she will try to make sure you understand her lecture before moving foward with the lecture.,1
Knows what he is talking about but boring lectures. Tests are multiple choice with take-home short answers and you get a 3x5 note card. Multiple chances for easy extra credit and gives study guide with exact topics. Group project is unnecessary but easy to finish fast and it doesn't matter how well your partners do. Helps with online hw in class.,1
"she was a really good professor. class wasn't always thrilling, but she was passionate about all of it. she had great stories and graded fairly.  plenty of small papers and 3 take home exams that ruined my life while i was writing them. but if you finish them, she'll give you a good enough grade.  i'd reccommend this section.",1
"Teaches one of the toughest subject of Information Systems major. If you really want to learn Agile, this class is for you.",1
"This is her response after she put up a misleading question in a quiz ""Not all facts you are given on a test (and life!) need to be asked in such a way that NO person will ever make a mistake. The onus is on the student to read the question well and think!"" (while in fact, almost everyone misunderstood the question and got wrong answer) What a joke",0
Helpful when making comments on test and quizzes. any questions you have she is willing to explain until you understand.,1
"Great Professor, in-depth coursework, yet, not overbearing which is a huge plus for working parent/student. He is super educated in his field and made this subject SUPER FUN, no lie! I recommend",1
"First off, he's a nice guy with a big heart. However, Vallee is very unclear about his expectations. He is a very poor marker; no constant b/w projects/reports. If course material was presented differently, it would make for a much more enjoyable term.",0
Not clear lectures. Study the exam reviews and you will get about 90 out of 100 in the exams. Only even-number questions are graded. Easy A!,1
class was great! time flew by and it was clear that he was really into it. he paced back and forth in front of the class and threw his arms up to make a point. really funny and nice guy. hard paper grader but its worth it!,1
HOT HOT HOT HOT MAN,1
"He was the best professor I have had.. He is very clear on what he wants, so he doesn't leave you wondering. This is not a hard class to pass, like any class you just have to pay attention. He has amazing lectures, the only real class work (no homework) is in the lab after lecture. Attendance matters, he takes roll.",1
He is a tough grader and he gives u 4 essays and the final and gives u grades on those and thats all and then for extra credit u have to listen to his Boring friends talk. Gives u a lot to read and it is almost always on the same crap ok get your note card out today class we gonna talk about the sublime and how It is good to use Forget him,0
He is one of the most enthusiastic and off the walls professors you'll ever meet. His grading is very fair. The exams aren't bad considering you can use a notes sheet. There's lots of Iclickers so you have to show up to class. There's no book used. Take this class its fun and interesting!,1
Film studies class with lots of comparison papers. The movies were pretty bad (because they were old- like 1800's old). Newer movies were good. Had to watch a lot of boring/cheesy movies outside of class. Quizzes were over some film techniques covered in the textbook.,1
"His class is super easy! Lectures are only 2 hours long. The review test are identical to the in class exams. You only need the textbook for homework, but you can take pictures of the homework at the library. Easy A. if you plan on taking higher maths I wouldn't recommend him(Math majors). If you only require one or 2 math courses, he's worth it",1
Professor Dudrick is my favorite professor at Colgate. He always takes the time to talk to his students outside of class and he gets excited to talk to you about philosophy and your life in general. His is so engaged in class and is really funny. You have to participate a lot and go to office hours but if he sees that you care he will work with you,1
Excellent instructor and is really good at what she does. Provides constructive feedback through (Jing) as well as very helpful supplemental material throughout the semester. Highly recommended.,1
This prof is AMAZING! such a sweet and caring person! he really wants people to succeed! If you need help he will go out of his way to help! he uses personal stories in his lecture which helped me remember what we were talking about! Exams were exactly like the study guide!,1
"He is an extremely harsh grader, gives unclear instructions, and penalizes you if your work doesn't reflect his personal preferences. I took the class when we first started using Zoom, and still received my worst grade. Heartless & apathetic. Get's a power trip over his ability to give students poor grades. It's sad he doesn't want you to succeed.",0
"Can't say enough nice things with the character limit. I took her for A&P 1 and 2 lab and lecture (4 times total). Professor Stevenson wants everyone to succeed, she is really clear with what you need to know and her exams are very fair as long as you study. Anatomy can be a tough course but she does her absolute best, and she's such a sweetheart!",1
"I took his online class spring 2019 his class is an easy A. Gives great feedback, very easy assignments, and if you have any question his very quick to respond to any emails.",1
"Dr. Banks has a passion for nursing and it shows through lecture. Sometimes she can be a little dry, but her caring attitude and pun jokes make up for that. She has an amazing heart and wants her students to succeed. Provides interesting guest lectures.",1
"Thad, is a great instructor. YES he is an easy teacher. He teaches from the book and that OK! He has a great sense of humor that keep lecture alive. He doesn't explain things clearly when it comes to Krebs cycle and so on.. Group study sessions are necessary if you want an A. I worked two jobs and was a full time student.",1
This was my favorite class. The reading and assignments were so interesting. For an online class this teacher was very responsive and helpful and writes very clear directions for assignments.,1
This subject is difficult on its own but Dr. Kennedy really tries to make it interesting and easy. There was so much extra credit which helped everyone out a bunch and lab was easy. He is a fair grader and professor. Attend lectures to gain bonus points.,1
Utilizes a lot of examples from business. Does a good job of explaining the material.,1
Shes the best prof at the u of a,1
Ms. Fountain was an alright teacher. I just didn't enjoy the subject (public speaking). She was one of the few teachers that had closed note tests on some decently difficult information. The speeches were also somewhat difficult to perform but mainly because 1) I suck at it and 2) her grading was kind of harsh.,1
He is an awesome professor that cares for his students. Homework is not mandatory but do it and it will help you pass the tests. Also do the extra practice he have online that will help alot.  If you pass his final you pass the class even if you did horribly on the other tests. If pass all his other test and fail the final he will average final ,1
The best math teacher I've ever had. Makes you actually enjoy and completely understand what you are learning. Gives helpful test reviews. I haven't taken my final yet but I know I'm confident in getting a good grade. He taught us well :),1
"She is an inspirational women. She teaches her student to make the connection textbook to real life. She will not teach you she will help you make the connection. 80% is individual learning. Those comments below are from people who are lazy , expect everything to be handed down to them, and dont read before class.",1
"Dr. Battisti is a good professor. She knows what shes talking about and she has a lot of knowledge to offer about American history. She cares about her students and their success. But, one thing is that she only has 3 tests for the semester and they are all in the format of paragraph-long answers and then an essay.",1
"Great Professor, Wants to see you succeed and improve. The class was easy and helpful. It is an easy A as long as you try to learn how to play piano a bit. If he sees you know more than the average student he will challenge you with harder material if you would like. Adapts the class to you.",1
"I really loved her! She was easy, though I did previously learn this material in high school. If you can, take her. Its the best!",1
"Nicest teacher I've ever had. If you have to take a WI, take JRN205 WI with her. I have never taken a JRN class but this was an easy A with a great teacher. Attendance is taken, so go to class. She assigned a lot of hw but cancels it frequently to give us a break. NO EXAMS is a huge plus. Other than that, weekly journals and in-class assignments.",1
"No doubt - the reading is like drinking water from a high-pressure firehose!  Keep up with it, though, because she can spot BS from a mile away (someone else tried that). You *will* learn a whole lot if you are serious about history! She encourages independent thought and research, and favors the enthusiastic.  Find your interest early, though.",1
"Very intelligent and articulate! Material was always new and engaging. While she presents some difficult ideas to grasp at times (and talks a bit fast), she is patient if you need explaining. Overall, a challenging but rewarding experience.",1
"She is amazing. She tries to help you understand, she will brake down hard stuff for you to understand better. She really wants her students to pass. She gives the handouts and you will pass  just studying from there. I would definitely recommend her.",1
Good first time professor.,1
Dr. Piland is a great teacher. He can break down course material for anyone to understand and apply. He uses analogies to help students understand alot. Very interactive with students so come to class engaged. You must read and spend time outside of class studying! When preparing for tests make sure you just don't remember info but how to apply it.,1
Dr. Parker is totally chill. I had him online this summer and he gave us lots of time to work on what we needed.,1
Jim is a great professor. He knows what he is talking about. Would highly recommend taking his class. I gained a lot of information from this course. One of my favorite professors last semester. He doesn't miss class hardly ever and if he does he will find a sub. Very reliable professor!!,1
He was the first professor I ever took at SUNY Westbury . I was horrific to choose such a hard class but I really learned a lot. He is such a good professor! Love his feedback . Take him if you can !,1
"I lost all respect for him towards the end of the semester when he kept showing us pictures of the effects of war. They were tasteless and vulgar and lowered his professionalism as a teacher. Also, he made a paper due a couple days after our final which is not ethical. I spoke to other professors & they all encouraged me to talk to the dean.",0
"Pay attention to lectures and ask questions about labs. She is very knowledgeable about geography, particularly water! Not hard to get in the A if you do the basic work of taking notes during lectures (which she records!) and do the labs. She is very lenient with giving extensions during the pandemic. Definitel would recommend taking a course w/her",1
"BTW, the majority of the students are doing fine in the lab skills b/c they have prior esperience at their jobs, or volunteer work. That's a no brainer.",1
"Really clear and concise lecturer. Even tho the material is crazy hard, he made us learn every bit. Also his english is perfect, which always is a plus in ucsd mae courses",1
Fliping awsome,1
I'm not a major and had to take this class. It turned out awesome though. She really loves what she does and actually kind of like it now too. Tests are based on lectures and are not easy but I guess ok as long as you go to class.  ,1
"Dr. Jones is by far the best English teacher I've ever had. She motivated me to write about a topic I truly care about, and was really supportive and gave great feedback throughout the semester.",1
"If you want to fall asleep in class you should really take him for english. He talks waaay too much, but nothing he says makes sense. He leaves too much work and theres alot of reading, talks more about history than anything else. Does not know how to teach I dropped his class and if you are smart you will too!",0
"Great teacher, and fun.  Put a very new (to me) spin on the subject.  Thrives on class participation, but doesn't seem to want to absorb new viewpoints.",1
"Certain topics introduced in ECE 241, such as bit masking, weren't clearly explained by Dr. Day. This required me to go out and research them for myself outside of class. (not necessarily a bad thing!) Dr. Day would occasionally go off on tangents during lectures that were interesting but not part of the curriculum. He is a very fair grader.",1
He's a nice guy and all but gets easily sidetracked so you don't accomplish much in class. I only had him for a freshman introductory class which he agreed was pointless and shouldn't be required so he just let us blow it off.,1
"Professor Lai is very passionate. He puts effort in making the class engaging and interesting, will relate it to the real world. He will go out of his way to help you if you ask. He is straightforward about exams, no curveballs or trick questions. Rent the textbook and you're set.",1
"If you don't like to talk in front of a class, don't take him. He gives over 100 problems for homework and the only way to get credit for the homework is if you go to the ""homework days"" in which everyone, one by one, has to read the question and their answer. If you get it wrong and/or don't fully understand how to answer it correctly he gets mad.",0
"Test have no multiple choice and consist of an essay and all writing. There are 2 exams, and one essay. A VERY hard grader, but note taking is a life saver; don't take notes, don't pass. Before each class, you had a reading of about 20-30 pages followed by a quiz with very specific questions. Super fun, but hard class! Very caring person too!",1
"His lectures don't line up with anything that will be turned in for a grade. He does do lectures based on the upcoming lab assignment, but that's just him reading the posted document(s) to the class. He posts most material online and usually will just read off of those during lecture. It's an intro course but background knowledge is required.",0
Definitely one of the best professors at UO! His lectures are entertaining and you can tell he really enjoys teaching. There is randomly a lot of homework in this class but its a very easy subject so it doesn't take long. As long as you go to class and don't miss any deadlines this should be an easy A.,1
"If you care about his class you will get a lot out of it. His teaching style worked for me personally, it might not for everyone. If programming is not naturally intuitive for you, youre going to have a hard time at first, but I think this is true regardless of the professor, he just forces you to actually learn rather than giving you the answers",1
"It is kind of hard to rate her because we never saw her all semester, only the TA.  2 main big essays that you do, but other than that it is a pretty low maintenance class.  HW is online and can be ridiculously subjective sometimes (for example asking what a painting symbolizes or something) but it is doable.  No exams/quizzes so that is nice.",1
"Really nice guy...you can stop by his office any time and he will go over the material with you until you understand it.  He is energetic and funny during class, but never calls anyone out. He is not strict about tardiness, but does take attendance daily.  If you take notes and pay attention you will do great.  HINT: make flashcards to study with!",1
"Picks hard & confusing books to read and assigns reading due EVERY class. Papers are also confusing, midterm not too bad. She is a nice person but she makes the class difficult.",0
"Took Drugs and Behavior with her. She is AMAZING! Greatest professor I have had at NAU. Cares about students and their success. Difficult content, but she makes it easier to understand.",1
"He does not go over prelab, he leaves the stuff on the counter tells you to read the manual with no direction. We weren't provided with the materials the lab manual states to use. When asked for help he just says ""read it"" repeatedly. Lectures are insufficient and criteria for what he wants is unclear. He had to curve his class very hard. Be warned",0
"This class is horribly boring, it is impossible to follow the lecture becuse she is jumping all over the place and very unclear. Attendence is graded so you have to come to class. Tests are easy though, but this was literally the worst class I have ever taken at UMass.",0
No Comments,0
Very generous professor to take for first aid. Lectures are amazing and straight to the point. Exams are based on lectures and CPR certification is fun. Mr. Bonilla is a great teacher and i would recommend this class.,1
One of the best instructors I have encountered at both Delgado and my previous college.,1
"Professor Endlich is amazing and caring. She cares for her student well being and the work is not that hard. She really tries to make the class fun and interesting. Her peer leader is the best, she is so helpful. YOU NEED THIS CLASS!!!",1
"He can be pretty intimidating, but just let him know that you aren't scared and he'll love you.  He's still a tough grader though.",1
"Esposito can be very overwhelming at first, but you will grow to love him. He has such passion for what he teaches that you can't help but become interested. He assigns a 1 page essay every week for CC101 so be prepared for a lot of writing and reading. Do not skip the reading or the class.",1
"Probably one of the most passionate teachers I have had before. Cares deeply about the subject which for my case was Early American History and a focus on Native Americans. I didn't use the book for the first couple weeks, but you should as all quizzes are based off readings. Loved this class and gives reasonable amount of work.",1
"Professor Jagpal is brilliant, and exhausting. He will be critical of the content you provide (both participation and graded assignments), but he rewards effort. He will lecture for two or three hours, but I found it interesting. I had no knowledge of marketing coming into the class, and I appreciated his seemingly novel take on it.",1
"Doug is very down to earth! Getting the packet for the class will really help. You can get extra credit on tests. If you don't understand animal science very well then it might be a little difficult, but you can still definitely get an A in the class.",1
"She sets a very distinct criteria from beginning of semester. Tests are hard&worth a lot. She curves down for her tests so if you get a 100 on the test after the curve it will be significantly lower if the curve is large. She did not seem understanding when I emailed her about a personal issue, hw on mindtap for every chapter. Not an easy A",0
"Allen is easily one of the best professors in the IT department. If you have a chance to take him DO. His assignments are simple and easy to do, he will also scale assignments if the class does badly on them. His classes are never really boring, and he understands the difficulties of group projects. Also he records his lectures and puts them online",1
"She is a great teacher. It does become drone after a while because you do the same stuff everyday, but she tries to liven it up with her crazy personality. If you do your work, then you will pass.",1
"I've taken 2 classes with Professor Wheeler and I absolutely love her and her teaching style. This isn't another boring history with memorization, it will make you think critically about history. The TA's are also very helpful in and out of class. Attendance is mandatory though.",1
Good teaching style. He really cares for his students unlike most professors there.,1
Her tests are easy because the class before the test she tells you exactly what will be on it. She gives extra credit opportunities to people who show up to class.,1
"Not enough can be said for this beacon of light in the Lambton College faculty line up.  Delivers material very efficiently with clarity.  Intangibly, he provides motivating insights into various gainful career avenues in the accounting industry.  My best advice:  use this man to the fullest.  Don't let that sheepish grin fool you.",1
She is my favorite professor so far! She is very understanding and really knows what she is talking about. She assigns the perfect amount of work to make sure you understand the content but isn't overbearing. I would rate her higher if I could.,1
"Dr. Berger is a really funny guy who has a great personality. He's pretty tough to follow in lecture, but the exams are a piece of cake. For intro to computer engineering, half the mid-term is in class, half take home, easy grade. Then there's a presentation you have to do which is another easy grade. Final exam is all take home. Class is an easy A",1
"Though Professor Maragh-Llyod is new to Gonzaga this year, she truly embodies the Zag spirit. She is an amazing teacher, and a real gem of a person as well. Not only is she approachable outside of class, but she encourages in-class discussions around current events and pop culture which isn't always encouraged. Take her class if you have the chance",1
"Dr. Love is an excellent professor. He explains things well, is approachable outside class, and truly cares about his students. I had no idea what to expect from this course but I found it very interesting and fun! Dr. Love is very enthusiastic about his work and loves when students ask questions.",1
"Awesome teacher. Had him for Landforms, and then took Weather and Climate strictly because he was teaching it too. Always available for questions, and concerns. Great sense of humor... okay so some of his jokes are pretty horrible, but he tries, and that's what makes it funny.  The earring was pretty sweet too.",1
"Even if you do exactly what he wants, word by word, you will not get an A. He refuses to give out 100% and can never be reached in time. His lectures have NOTHING to do with anything you do in class, but since attendance is mandatory, it is a waste of time. There are projects back to back with no clear grading criteria and hundreds of assignments.",0
"Mr. Stacey is a wonderful professor. Keeps lectures interesting with jokes and stories of his vast life experiences. Tests are difficult if you don't study for it, heavily information based but is straight forward and exactly what you're going to learn from the book or lectures. If you're a good class, extra credit or points are possible!",1
"She is a good teacher, but the course was bad.  Definitely take classes with her, just not German Humor.",1
"I think Dr. J is a very nice person generally, but in terms of her as a professor? I really struggled with her. She practically demanded that we prioritize her class over others, even going as far as to say her class is the most important class we are taking at the moment. She gives an ungodly amount of homework, most of which serves no purpose.",1
"DO NOT TAKE with her. Does absolutely nothing but sit on the computer while in class. Doesn't know how to answer questions on material or tests she gives! Never teaches or lectures about  new material nor reviews for exams. if you want learn nothing and waste your time then you should take her. She probably has tenure, the only reason she has a job",0
He gives us a ton of homework thats way harder than what he taught us. Most of the time he doesnt go through a problem completely he just goes through the method in the beginning but then expects you to know exactly what to do after. Hes also a bit passive aggressive when someone tries to be smart or asks a question.,0
You're great..... Keep up the good work,1
"She is such a cute/bubbly person! I look forward to this class every time. Lectures get highly off topic, but it is fun when it happens! Just catch up with the readings and be ready to discuss about it. 3 major papers + citations. The class is never boring! She is lenient, she will be there for you, and she loves what she does! Should be an easy A!",1
This class was wonderful! Pam did a great job of creating and maintaining class discussions; the assignments were fun and interesting; and we had a few guest speakers come in which was really nice. I would recommend this class and this Prof to anyone; truly a great experience :),1
Sara pushes you. Don't expect to take her class and do the minimum to get by. She genuinely wants to she her students succeed. If you are not putting in the effort to grow then she will not be able to help you.,1
"Regret missing one class because I was totally behind after. She is so organized, stays on schedule, syllabus helps, SO ORGANIZED, I cannot stress this enough. Nice, smart, challenges argumentative thinking. Like 2 homework mostly worked on 3 main debates/speeches. If you enjoy Coms you'll love it.",1
Tests are rough but gives you a lot of ways to bring your grade up. as long as you attend class you'll do fine. she can be difficult to understand sometimes but just ask her to repeat herself and shell say it clearer. she also writes everything down so you can read clearly what she says. always willing to help and really wants you to do well!,1
"Very applied, very thorough. Great prof",1
"Susan is a charm. She does have strong opinions often that you might disagree with, especially in regard to her attitude toward male students sometimes, but you can get tons from her. Like all people in this industry, she has strong philosophies on various topics that other people in the industry disagree with e.g. story titles (hers are bad).",1
"She's a very nice and easy teacher. Just do all the assignments on time and participate in the class group discussions, I bet you will get an A for sure. You can email her to ask when you have questions. Hard to find her in her office, usually she doesn't have office hours. I recommend take her class if you are an ESL student.",1
"Some student really like this course, find him easy to understand. Unfortunately, I was one of the many that had a hard time following his lectures. He does provide online recordings of his lectures, that saved me. Every quiz, homework, and test is online. He provides a ""study guide"" that is actually does not follow through with the exams.",0
"I took this class online, it's very easy as long as you do your work. Tests are based of the book and is filled with worksheets that she leaves for homework. She mainly had us researching colleges, financial aid, majors, etc. The class helps to start a plan to transfer to a 4-year school.",1
"she is an amazing woman outside your classroom but ooh do not get confused when you see your grade at the end of the semester. Speaking of the devil, she actually gives undoable projects which are actually a pain in the ass.",0
"Average exam scores for the whole class was like 45. She boosted grades a week or two before the last day to drop, then put them back to what they were. No idea why she gave false hope but yea. Honestly my fault for not dropping and staying. Dont take this class she sucks at teaching.",0
"he's a very nice teacher and will help u if u need it. the hw is very easy, just write a paper w/ the ques. he ask u 2 answer and u will get a good grade. the tests r a lil harder i thought i would have done better. the films r all very good. but studying is the key! u'll never get out early. breaks are only about 5-10 mins long",1
Professor Camaj is remarkable. He teaches with enthusiasm. Engages with his students individually & collectively. Gifted in helping students harness their talents. Clarifying difficult lessons in the simplest ways. He is humorous and makes the class entertaining. It describes his high level of motivation to educate his students to his best ability.,1
"HORRIBLE PROFESSOR. First of all he abbreviates so much to the point of no understanding. It takes longer to understand his abbreviations then what he is trying to teach. Basically you end up teaching yourself. He allows you to bring an outline for the final but it doesn't help much. Overall, its worth taking someone else",0
Easy class. Don't miss class. Attendance can make your A to a B if you miss.,1
"Easy A as long as you show up for class and do homework. I took in the summer best decision I made. Great Professor, totally recommend and I would definitely take him again if he taught other courses.",1
"You have to attend class and pay attention, but as long as you pay attention in class (ESPECIALLY to the pictures and maps) you'll do fine on the exams. Pretty interesting course and easy connections are drawn between the different civilizations. Would definitely recommend as an easy A to science students.",1
"Professor Myers is such a great math teacher. She is very helpful in class. If you are in class she will show you many ways to solve one problem, because we all look at it differently. She helps each individual student and wants you to pass. If you are willing to learn and be in class you will do great in this class.",1
Fun class. Hard assignments. But he encourages you to get good grades. Recommend if you like research though.,0
"Very kind person. Very inspirational. She makes me want to achieve the most out of life. Thank you, Alynn !",1
"By far one of the worst and rudest profs that I have ever taken. Does not keep office hours appointments and is very condescending to anyone who isn't a scholar in calculus. Lots of homework and grading on ""major"" and ""minor"" exams is beyond confusing. Does belittle students during class if you ask a question.",0
"The professor is the worse professor I have ever met. There's pretty much zero practical explanation of the material in class, and exams are ridiculously difficult- it's as if your expected to memorize every little tax rule and condition, as writing everything down on a cheat sheet using the textbook takes far too long.",0
I just finished calc 2 in the first half of summer so i thought i would relax a bit and take intro to russia online for the second half. I'm spending double the hours per week on this class. It's insane. she is crazy if she thinks this is an appropriate amount of work for a intro class like this. I'm doing like 8 hours/day minimum. DO NOT TAKE HER!,0
"I came into this class thinking it would be impossible,  but it was extremely doable and easy. Professor Dodson is an extremely nice woman. She isn't very good about emailing back, but that's the only downfall. Homework can be somewhat hard and participation in the weekly discussion boards is crucial. Otherwise, super easy class.",1
"Edward gives interesting and detailed lectures that I found entertaining and educational. He enjoys discussion, which represents a decent chunk of class time. Unfortunately, his quiz's fall into the History Teacher trap of nitpicky detail. Note to Ed: Discussion is great! Asking how many pounds of meat/fish Fredrick Douglass was rationed is silly.",1
Susan is SO AMAZING. She is to date the best professor I've ever had. I still go to her for advice. Going to her office hours is a great experience and she will remember things like that! She knows so much about pre-production and makes you want to come to each and every class. LOVE HER!,1
"Favorite Teacher by far, super easy to learn from and will help you with anything.  Highly recommend taking her class",1
"I can't with these people complaining about her. Mrs. Trombley is one of the best teachers in LAVC. She is accessible anytime you need, she's helpful if you have questions. And her classes are very informative. It might seem easy because it's online class, but actually you have to work hard to keep up with the schedule. I might take P66 with her...",1
He's fine but annoying in how much work you have to do. And he isn't very clear about how he grades you.,1
"Jurmu is a friendly, funny, entertaining, and passionate. His lectures are interesting, and he is always willing to help outside of class. He also plans field trips, so students can have hands-on experience. I highly recommend taking a class with Jurmu!",1
"Professor Calkins is an AMAZING professor. She is very caring for her students and everything she does throughout the semester is geared towards one big final paper. I'm an Engineering major, so personally, this class was EXTREMELY work heavy. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU AREN'T WILLING TO INVEST TIME ON IT. YOU WILL FAIL IF YOU DON'T.",1
"This professor took long to get things graded and when you ask him about it he will blame it on his TA who you will never meet and does not even live in the same state. He will also not care about your grades. If he doesn't grade something right the first time, he never will. He will respond to emails but they are likely not helpful.",0
He's not good at teaching on how to write a paper.,0
"Best Professor ever! her lectures were awesome and helped you understand the grading criteria and the information needed to write the essays. Only needed to write 3 essays on super easy subjects. She lets you pick what you want to write about based on the topic. Also, watched the movie, The Greenbook.",1
She is a very tough teacher. You can learn a lot if you dedicate the time to her courses. She expects you to come prepared to class. If you aren't she will scold you. Find another teacher for this class if possible.,0
"Great teacher,interesting class. Case studies every thursday-easy, but repetitive. Miss two classes and start to lose points. Easy/interesting lectures and class discussions. 2 simple papers and easy tests. Definitely recommend!",1
Formula sheets can be used on tests which is a great bonus. He provides reviews and the tests are very similar. He gets kind of angry with students who don't put in 100% and you needs to be present in class or a lot will be missed and you could get lost. He also provides bonus points but it can be revoked if you miss 2 classes. Overall pretty good.,1
Professor Guzzone is a kind hearted professor that is easy to get along with and easily accessible outside of class. This class is so much fun and you learn a lot from the lectures. He is very current with pop culture and the music industry and loves to play music for the class !! Hes a great guy!,1
"The class was very easy if you show up. He tends to go on and on about random things, but it'll mostly tie in with what he's teaching. He is an amazing teacher who only wants to help you understand the lessons and achieve not only in his class, but outside. He is very welcoming, always asking how you are doing, or how your outside hobbies are going",1
"Lectures are difficult to follow, course content generic social science material.  Tutorials, however, were great.",1
"She is so nice. She helps out a lot, very easy to understand, and she puts the notes online which is very helpful. She knows her stuff and the work she gives out is very fair. Homework is not always mandatory but when it is you get easy class participation points for it. She isnt too easy but not too hard. VERY fair.",1
"He doesn't believe in extra credit, whatsoever he makes exams extremely difficult so that no one passes and that he has to give massive curves material is extremely dry. I've never taken a class where so many students complained",0
"While I have a rather large disdain for all Humanities classes, this class in particular wasn't all that enlightening.  It was really specific in the opinions and bias' we experienced as a whole throughout the class and it seemed like the holistic view of the class was trite and redundant.  Nearly worthless class.",0
She extremely cares about her students. She's always there to help you and she will find a way to help you achieve your goals in life.,1
"You will not pass if you don't have the textbook. On your review sheet, review and read every single little detail she tells you to read.",1
"billy's a necessary evil because he's the only organic chem prof, he's an idiot, you can find his companion notes for the textbook online and he just reads them word for word, you'd be better off just reading the book and only showing u for tests, if you remember anything about gen chem 1, you're smarter than he is",0
Murtuza will work with you to make sure you learn. He will let you take the test on another day if you feel unprepared or are unavailable during the night time exams. He wants you to learn the material more than he cares about testing you on the material. Anyone who gave him a poor rating honestly didn't try or pay attention to him.,1
"The ambiguity of Dr. Eubanks' grading is extremely frustrating. You can expect to receive zeros on assignments with no constructive criticism or explanation, as he seems to have a complete disregard for his own rubric (which he almost never uses). His contradictory feedback makes this class even worse. Awful experience. Do not take this class.",0
"Professor Jassen's class was one of my favorite courses to take over this past semester. Although I did not do as well as I would have liked as I am taking the course over again next semester, she is an amazing professor and will stop and explain something if someone does not understand it. Remember to pay attention & study for weekly quizzes!",1
"Most interesting and passionate teacher I have ever had. She makes the class environment so friendly and engaging, and I've learned so much since the beginning of the year. Her feedback is always very helpful and encouraging.",1
"He was a great choice for all of my English classes. I enjoyed the film class and science fiction course he taught. As long as you do the work and follow directions, it is a fairly easy a or b class.",1
"She is a great professor. Like a typical English class, you will be writing a lot of essays, but she will be here if you need help with anything. If you can't turn something in on time, just let her know ahead of time and she will be fair. She is very nice. If I had to take more English courses, I would definitely take her again.",1
"Ayland was a great instructor. He was super enthusiastic, caring, knowledgeable and engaged and gave great feedback. I was new to strength training and he really helped me to feel like it was something I could on my own.",1
"So much extra credit! The class grades were super inflated. Attend lecture, make flashcards, and do all of the assignments. You'll want to buy the online textbook. He uses an app that makes him super accessible. He loves chemistry and is always approachable and excited to be there (even at 8am). It's a difficult subject, but he makes it possible.",1
"Michael Perez is the best for COM 221 (Technical Report Writing). Mr. Perez helped me with my long research paper and gave many great advices on how to make the paper good. Overall, in order to pass COM 221 is to have a topic you like doing research on. I would really want Perez again for another class. If you have him, he will really help you",1
I took two classes with him. One was intro to visual basic and the other one was Internet Programming for Business.He is a very nice teacher and explain the material so well.One advice: if you do your homeworks and projects you pass easy. Tests: There are no trick questions.Just pay attention to what he says in class and read the book. A+ guarantee,1
"I was advised not to but honestly, the class was not that difficult. She states that this class is often a make or break class for non physics majors so she caters to us. Exams were replicas of class work and videos she provided. I liked the class because it was easy but our personalities did not blend well. She was nice but got on my nerves.",1
She is nice but unprepared. Most students are confused and remain confused at end of class. Expectsyou to read and understand content before teaching it. Gives homework and a lot of power points.  You feel you are doing all the work alone.  In clinical she expect you to be an experienced nurse.,0
"He is easy. You will pass, but he is EXTREMELY rude. If you are in the class to actually learn, forget it. He will tell you the answer and if you ask why, he will say don't worry about it. If you just want to pass with an A or B, take his class. If you actually want to learn, don't.",0
"Her online class was amazing, super organized and fair. You get one writing assignment a week followed with a quick summary quiz on the lesson thats never over 10 questions. She always gives positive and informative feedback on assignments very quickly. Definitely will be trying to get another class with her in the future.",1
No Comments,0
She makes class interesting. There is a lot of reading but manageable and she manages to make a boring story bearable with fun discussions. I have an A so I think she's a fair grader. ,1
"He literally teaches from the book. There's no point in showing up to class, your best bet if you end up with this professor is finding someone who already took Calc II and have them help you with the class. Take someone else if you can help it.",0
Dr. Nesvig is one of the best teachers I've ever had. He is incredibly passionate about the material and genuinely wants to see you do well. The class isn't too difficult if you put in the work. He's also hilarious and makes each class very entertaining. I'm so glad I decided to take this class! HIGHLY recommended!!,1
Worst online teacher. Im a 4.0 student and he grades DQs super hard.,0
"Very encouraging, interactive and business minded. Her smiling teaching style makes the course more understandable and great",1
She's by far one of the worst prof. I had to work with. She's really does too much. Like her online math class and how she wants the camera set up is just so annoying. And she will not give you one extra point and won't let you makeup work. I just missed one assignment and everything else messed up. She's just plain worse!,0
"Literally the most boring professor ever. Everyone falls asleep in class and the absurd amount of homework you have with the most extra essay criteria is really annoying. If you really need the class for Hub, it's good to take because the class is not hard. It's just a lot of work and wanting to cry listening to his lectures.",0
"Mrs. Myers is committed to seeing her students succeed! She is happy to answer anyone's questions in class & gives plenty of reminders about MyMathLab HW and Quizzes. She is energetic about math, often nerding out over the cool higher-math stuff we ""don't get to learn"". Willing to chat after class, & VERY responsive to email. Generous EC on tests.",1
"If I were to go back to the begining of the semester, I would take this class somewhere else. Cristina says things that are not appropriate for any educator. She has told us that few of us will ever be able to get a job in the feild we are pursuing and is not encouring. When she says something nice, it does not come off as genuine. Good luck!",0
"Ms. Lewis is NOT a good teacher. NO test reviews, NOT even for Finals!! Practice Test on my math lab for the final were not reflective of her final exam. Very Tough Grader, no room for error on Any exams! BEWARE... classes start out full most will drop! Studied my tail off, A student, enjoy a challenge but Something was off here!!",0
"I took his class based off of the reviews... wouldn't do it again. You can easily get a C if you dont do anything and you just want to pass. He does boost your grade if your on the edge and his E.C. will get you the next letter grade, otherwise i couldn't EVER understand a word he said and i basically had to try to teach myself the whole course.",0
"Tom Archibald is a solid choice for mathematics. His lectures are engaging and he is open to questions during the lectures. He is clear and explains concepts well. His office hours are fairly open, and they are well worth going to. He is very kind-hearted and fair.",1
very unhelpful very rough grader dont take his class,0
"took her for public speaking online, you post every 3 days I think but the assignments are super easy. As long as you submit on time and follow her instructions you'll get an A. She grades kinda slow but its whatever because you probably got a decent grade anyways",1
Professor Nuneville really cares about her students and wants them to pass. All you really have to do is come to class. There are a lot of guest speakers but its better than just staring at your teacher talking the whole time.,1
"I really loved this class and his lectures. There's a lot of reading but I just skimmed them and read in depth for the readings I used for the papers, so it's doable. Papers were the toughest part for me but there's help available from TA's and Professor Kim. Discussion participation is worth a lot so be ready to participate",1
"I had him fall of 2014 , I have anatomy 102 this semester. my lecture teacher I have now is beyond atrocious, many complaints about him ( Reinken) , I have had questions and my 101 teacher Mr Baumgartner has even helped me here in 102 ,not in his class, a level up class even , and he has been willing to help me as well as others ! He cares a lot !",1
"The worst teacher ever, ifyou see your going to take a class that she's teachong... RUN AWAY! RUN AWAY!!!!!!!!!!",0
"Really nice person and teacher! Goes off topic quite a bit but it does relate to what she is teaching (most of the time.) Be sure to attend class and it is recommended to have a textbook for her class just to make your life easier, her online notes are very generalized and don't cover much of what she actually talks about in class.",1
"He made a potentially boring subject interesting, he is very knowledgable on his subject material and open-minded to hear new perspectives and thoughts. He encourages discussion and participation",1
very fun class. makes learning biology fun.  wants to get out of class just as soon as you do.  tells u exactly what is going to be on the tests and all the tests are essay ( u have to write the answers out ) as long as u study you should do great,1
"Dr Wisner is very clear about his expectations, and explains them in detail. Following his rubrics and examples has definitely made me a better writer. He's a little slow when it comes to grading, but if you follow the directions, you should have no problem getting an A.",1
"Her ethnography / speech codes theory class was a lot of work, but it was interesting. You will need to spend a lot of time with this class. But you should get an ""A"" if you put in the work",1
"I took Carrino for Spring '11 Wed 7-9:30. Its a great class and a great professor.  He has something a lot of other professors at MSU don't have: REAL WORLD BUSINESS EXPERIENCE.  He knows his stuff and as long as you do the work (read the material, don't worry he doesn't assign B.S. stuff) you will do fine.  Great speaker with good sense of humor.",1
Out of he twelve things we were supposed to cover in the class we only covered two. The whole class revolved in a philosophy he claimed would be famous one day (he made it up). We literally talked about the same thing everyday. The class was a major disappointment and he acted immature when students disagreed with his philosophy. Run while you can.,0
"Took Eco101 this summer. Lot's of work to cram into 8 weeks. He was a very good teacher. Patient and reassuring for students. 4 quizzes, mid-term, final and an essay. He gave extra time to complete all. Highly recommend taking his classes.",1
She did not give me many materials and information for our reading and citation. I learned most of it from the writing tutors. But she is really nice and caring. She always gives her students opportunities to be creative in class.,1
He is a good professor but it is impossible to do all homework if you have a full time job and is a full time student. It is too much reading and home every single week. I would not take him again because I am a full time student and also work full time. Plus my major is in business and I dont need all this work for my future.,1
Great guy helped me with my resume and interviewing skills.    Everyone should take him,1
Prof. Zaitsev is a really good Biology Prof. I took him for BIO 110 with lab he dropped the lowest multiple choice test and lab grade. Sometimes he can get a little irritated when people come late and/or don't study but its only because he cares. Be on your toes; make sure you study the class notes gives you; and you should pass. Would recommend.,1
"This professor is a very hard grader, points are taken off tests because of not writing parenthesis, or an equal sign. He is very disrespectful, the very first day of school he told us he was only trying to help and that we could look at him as our favorite grandpa, three weeks later he refused to answer questions. PLEASE DON'T TAKE HIM!!",0
"She is one of the nicest professors I've had. She teaches well and is clear on what is due and what is expected. Basically, if you do the relatively small and easy assignments in and out of class, you will pass. You probably won't need to read the textbook except when studying for the midterm.",1
"This is an amazing class and Paul Young is an amazing professor. He is funny and keeps class engaging. He gives class time to letting students get to know each other and network which is awesome. He teaches so much useful information in class that makes you feel so smart about the music industry. Loved this class, 10/10 would recommend.",1
"Taking Dr. Bardo for SOC 255 was a great decision. There are no exams, attendance is not mandatory, there are only 7 quizzes and he drops the lowest two, and the largest portion of your grade comes from an easy project at the end of the semester. I have learned a lot about medical sociology from him and HIGHLY recommend his class!",1
"Be ready to work every week many hours in this online course.  You MUST write 4 students each week. If you don't, it is points off.  He will not tell you to respond to 4 students, so ask.  I made 'A' in course, but put in over 10 hours a week.  You must ask bc he will not offer info.  I would take him again though.",1
The lectures blow us away. If you play the game right (note comprehension) you'll get it good. Receive his elaborately input with confidence and you won't just be on the right track you'll be on his tracks.,1
"I took Calc 2 with him and really should have dropped his class. Not a bad guy but is a horrible teacher. Gave no curve, no extra credit, or even extra examples for practice. I worked hard in this class and still failed horribly.",0
"Stay away!!! Took her for two online courses and she is a very tough grader. Assigns discussions+comments every week, (not terrible) but she barely ever gives full credit for them. You NEED textbook for her or else she'll give low grades. 3 to 4 tests, makes you work for them. Don't miss assignments or turn in late ones. She WILL flag you.",0
"Il n'explique pas bien, survole la matière, nuit plus qu'il aide. À éviter.",0
"Loved Mr. Martin's class! He is such an approachable professor, and he tries to make class interesting. He makes sure to learn your name and help you get to know your other classmates. He's adorable. I think of him as my ISU grandpa. :)",1
"STOP CRYING PEOPLE. GREAT Professor, A well of knowledge. LOVE the lecture, He will definitely WORK WITH YOU. His door is always OPEN. He stays AFTER Lab and HELPS,  he's there BEFORE lecture to HELP. He is not an Easy ""A"", his tests are HARD and be PREPARED for homework. (REMEMBER THIS IS COLLEGE!) I took Six classes with this and achieved a ""C""",1
Great teacher...does a good job explaining topics and trys making class interesting..go over slides before test and work on projects and should be an easy grade,1
Chang does not teach.  His power points are unclear and do not explain the material.  Homework is no help in preparing you for the his impossible quizzes and tests.  Expect to spend a lot of time with a stat textbook if you want to pass the course.,0
"Many people give this teacher good reviews only because of her positive attitude and cool humor which i can agree on, but do not let her positive attitude fool you she is really tough when it comes to grading her tests are up to 50% and everything else is below 10. So trying to bring the grade up was extremely hard!!! Would not take again",0
Mr. Ball made coming to class enjoyable. Ive never been good at math but he explains it so smoothly its almost hard to not understand it. His personality is so caring and hilarious. I took him for 0308 and 0310 and best idea yet. Wish he could teach college alg.,1
Well respected and honest to his job. Tests you on stuff covered only. No tricks. Nicest guy and will care for you if you are sincere to yourself.,1
"Sam is a super cool guy, definitely take this class if you're looking at it to fulfill your gened requirement. There are very few grades in this class, but its so easy (I ended with 100%). For the few assignments we did have, he had a clear rubric & grading instructions on canvas. Sam is an inspirational guy and is passionate about music, TAKE HIM!",1
"i thought she was great! thus, i'm taking her this semester again for 2308. she's a nice lady...easy-going and well awesome!",1
She is very disorganized; you will spend large amounts of time trying to find her materials(she can't find them herself half the time). Her classes have the lowest grade averages by far(dept-wide tests). her lectures are of no value; you have to teach yourself. She is not a professor you want. Steer clear unless you want to fail.,0
I really enjoyed this class! Dr. Bland is awesome as long as you do the work and show effort you should be fine .,1
"Lenhart is my favorite professor at the University so far. He makes a genuine effort to make sure that all of his students understand the material and are doing well in the class. If you have a question, just ask, and he will more then likely explain in simpler terms so that you can understand. Would definitely recommend for both Micro and Macro.",1
She is smart and knows her stuff. No doubt about that and she is a good person at heart but I wish she could at least see how it is for first time learners when it comes to micro. We don't have a PhD in that field and need more time then what was given to UNDERSTAND. I took anatomy and so much other required classes for nursing major. I couldn't de,0
"Only thing I have to add to this is: she focuses more on poetry than fiction. If you are interested in poetry, take this and she'll teach you how to improve as a poet, but it is also valuable for writers. In fact, on our exam, we were tested only for the poetry readings and poetry terminology; none of the fiction.",1
"Cesar is fun! You'll like him. =)  The class is only somewhat difficult, but he keeps it fun. You'll need to participate a LOT in class to earn an 'A' for that requirement. It will make a difference on your overall grade, so don't be afraid to speak or make mistakes....just talk!",1
"He's a super nice teacher. He has a comprehensive knowledge of what he is teaching and if you ever need help, he will try to explain abstract concepts in different ways. As long as you go to class and pay attention, you will pass. No real required homework aside from short readings.",1
"When I took this class years ago I hated it and didn't understand anything in the class. Now that I look back on it he had the right idea of covering the material he did. He is a nice guy if you talk to him, just can't explain things well. I passed the CPA exam and this class helped make studying for the exam a little easier. I have had worse.",1
"She does genuinely care about her students, but the work load is excessive. The class is mixed-mode, but she gives 2 classes worth of work. She gives so much work you don't get your grade until the next paper is due. Not helpful when you don't know have anything to use for improvement on the next paper. Classes are useless- there's no teaching.",1
If you have the option do not take this class online. Her directions are not very specific and she is terrible at replying to emails when students have questions. She will even copy and paste emails and send them to multiple students that asked for feedback on their paper. Not very helpful at all. ,0
"Best teacher ever. High expectations for students, learned so much from her. Hilarious. ",1
"Old fashion teaching- assignments,assignments,assignments. Hard grader.",0
"Ronda is a wonderful teacher, very highly recomended.  Although she can come across as a bit reserved in class, and have strong opinions on the right way to do things, she is always open to listening to others ideas (and often says she learns something new),and is always willing to help with projects.  Very inspirational teacher. Highly recommended",1
"Each section of homework takes about 2 hours to do but is not too hard and you dont get to use notes on the tests. He goes over the homework and answers any questions at the beginning of each class before you turn in the homework and there were a few different opportunities for extra credit. I think hes a good professor and a nice, funny guy!",1
"This man has pushed me farther away from engineering than even my parents' disapproval ever could. He has made me question every decision I have ever made. With his boring voice that is enough to put an insomniac to sleep, I've been unable to focus in any class. He is the WORST professor I've ever had, and that's saying something. Take it at a CC.",0
"Sonia is very intelligent . She often speaks in monologues but if you pay attention you can really learn from them. If you want to get anything out of her lectures you need to do the reading. On another note, she is approachable and understanding that we're all humans, which I appreciate in a professor,",1
"Amasing teacher. We are in college to get an education and if you got 50/61 outcomes you can still get an A in the ""A-tests."" Obviously the ""60/61 ****"" is cardstacking and cannot handle the truth that they didn't try hard enough! Take this professure and you will learn, isn't that why we are in colege?",1
He was good at the beginning. Then began losing control and getting mad whenever you asked questions.,0
"She is very sweet, but we are not getting our assignments back in an appropriate amount of time. This is a 5 week online course.. we have 2 weeks left and we dont have any grades in yet. Unacceptable.",1
"If you have the ability to take him, do it!! He made me love English when I hated it coming from high school. He has a grading contract where as long as you do the work required with effort, you will get an A. While this seems like an easy way out, it actually encourages people to take risks and deeply engage with the material in interesting ways.",1
This teacher was the most unclear professor that I have ever had. She was never avaliable if you needed help. YOu could never get a hold of her. She told me I was getting one grade then ended up with another. I know a few people she did that to. My thoughts are they could find someone better to teach an education course.,0
Fairly easy class. I am taking a Bio. lab and for the most part we work in groups and do  labs each class. Id be surprised to see a person fail his class unless they never came or participated. Id take him again for any science.,1
I gave the review below. Meant to give her a 5--she deserves it,1
"I loved Mrs. Smith! Very clear about what will be on the tests, lots of easy assignments, posts study guides and power points/recorded lectures online. Such a sweet lady too! Wish I could take her for all my sciences.",1
Wouldn't recommend this professor.. Dry boring lectures and exams did not correlate to anything we did. Quizzes were nearly impossible. Do not take this professor unless you are very skilled in acct,0
"203 is a difficult class, dr engelkes kaltura system is genius so I didnt have to read the text book. It really is what you make of it. The program is tough you have to put in work. She has helped me even after I graduated her class.",1
"Healthcare Eco. good class, not that easy of a grade,but managable....",1
"ENV 331 is an intro to sustainability course, but Lisa Jo really knows how to make it about building your awareness on the topic no matter how much you may or may not already know. She cares about her students, she cares about the topic, and she knows how to make you care, too. If you have a chance to sign up for one of her classes, don't hesitate.",1
"This teacher is really hard to understand, the way he teaches makes the subject matter harder to explain than necessary.  He adds steps that go beyond the basics of this class and goes more into higher end math like calculus",0
"Best teacher I ever had. All of you numb nutz that say she's not good, are idiots. You will KNOW biology when you finish her class. As for me, I'm headed to medical school because of her! Where are you going...?! heh?",1
"I really like him. Lectures do drag on a little because class is so long, but sometimes they can be very interesting. He is an EXCEPTIONALLY fair grader and does not try to trick you on the tests. Lots of extra credit to help with your overall grade. Lots of required readings, but some are cool. Chill, laid back guy. Definitely would take again!!!",1
I am so glad I had this professor. There were not really any proofs and he taught what would be on the test and explains well. Most of the grade was based on 2 midterms and a final but both allowed notes and were the easier of the questions. If you understand the quest hw then you'll be fine. Office hrs are super helpful. The textbook is optional,1
My boyfriend and I took her class and loved it. She was recommended by a lot of past students. If you study and come to class it's pretty chill. She stays after to help you with anything. Mrs. Garrisi is a cool prof.,1
Very good teacher. I wish I could take more classes by her.,1
"Miranda.. I like your sense of style but, your lectures lack information. I do like to hear that protists are beautiful and fungi is cool but, you will never test me on that stuff so why are you telling me it? Miranda, your lectures need to switch gears from strong personal feelings about things to the stuff you plan to test us on..  ",0
"She is such a terrible teacher. First test covered 12 chapters of material, class average in the 60's and she didn't curve. She doesn't really care if you're doing well or not. So lazy. Lab and HW bring up your grade if not no one would pass. Started to make lecture mandatory. Some test questions can be found verbatim from the online HW tho!!!!",0
"Professor Brooks was a great teacher. He was by far not the easiest professor, but he tried to be as helpful as possible when it came to his students.",1
"She would go through more problems if we didn't fully understand. If you went up to her with a question, she would answer it then if she could and try to find other ways to go through it, so that you understood the process. She clearly stated what she expected and wanted us to do on homework and exams. There weren't many exams either. ",1
"Michael is really knowledgeable! don't be shy to ask questions he is really helpful and I respect him for all the cool work he has done in his past. He will NOT babysit you, so if you want an A you need to work for it! He even tells you that from the beginning, you won't do well if you slack.",1
"To add- We got to choose any religion in history to write about for our final paper. I chose Scientology and others chose ones like Satanism, Wicca, ancient Greece, Nordic, and Quakerism. Interesting!",1
"Great teacher, id recommend her!",1
Classes where great but marking scheme mad NO SENSE.I have teken high level Engl courses and only got a C+ in this. Seems to have unerlying homosexual themes in everything. Chosses Dark material (Gilgamesh/cosmopolis/hunters in winter)Great classes and a funny guy. VERY understanding and helpful with emails.,1
Mr. Lirenso is a good professor. All he really wants is for you to show up on time and do the homework. He does give a lot of homework but most of his stuff is incredibly easy and he is an easy grader. His tests are also the best. It's an open notes test and honestly the only way you can fail this class is if you can not read or speak English.,1
Readings were easy. Average on the open book midterm was a D which was curved to Bs and As. Monotone lectures which consist of reading off blocks of texts on a word doc. What the prof is looking for on exams is unclear. Says he wants little to no quoting but you get graded down if you don't use the specific vocab from the reading.,0
"Love this professor! Extremely knowledgable, friendly, and funny. Although her lectures may seem dry, they really help students understand readings more in depth and keeps things simple. Exams are simple if you actually read (some readings are long). Always willing to help during office hours. Would definitely recommend taking a class with her! ",1
"I am taking Physiology with Thad right now, nearing the end of the semester.  He has a good sense of humor and makes this hard class much easier to understand.  He enjoys what he does.  Grading takes a while sometimes because he is a business owner by day.  That's ok with me, because he is pretty lenient and I appreciate that!",1
"You must learn @ home outside the classroom if you want to succeed PPs are helpful but very vague & pretty much read verbatim Adjunct prof., doesn't seem to care abt our success Marks grade down for being late  lowering GPA Keeps you late well after class is over Hands-on in-class activities are fun Makes you work for your grade Lots of group work",0
"Noris is a nice guy, knowledgeable, and makes Human Physiology very interesting. He is addictive, I actually looked forward to every class. The class covers a wide array of topics in physiology. Quizzes every Tuesday and he tells you whats on the quiz, so a voice recorded is highly recommended. It is an easy class. There is one research paper.",1
"She is very fun, laid back, and genuinly cares about her students.  She was a great prof. to have for one of my first classes in college.",1
Nice guy but his class discussions tend to be off topic 90% of the time.  Some of the videos that he showed had more to do with history/political science topics than english.  He also chooses a lot of political and history topics for the essays and term paper.  Grades hard on essays but the midterm and final are pretty easy.,1
"He is a very nice guy who is extremely passionate about statistics/teaching. He can get carried away in lectures and cover material that is beyond the scope of the class/difficult to follow.  He makes those that show up to class feel bad about those that don't which is annoying and calls people out for it sometimes. Tests are difficult, use TZ",1
She is a great Groups At Risk professor.  Her material is online/power point.  Not a lot of test and quizzes just midterm and final.  Easy A!,1
"I really did not like this class. I use to love history, but after this class I dont know if i'll ever take another history class at oregon. She says if you know the answers to the questions in the beginning of her lecture slides you'll be fine but her questions are super broad and on the test they are very very specific.",0
"I think Professor Triplett is not being portrayed the right way here. He's down to earth, friendly and doesn't rush the class- he stays with the tempo of the students instead of forcing forward when the students aren't grasping the info. His personality makes you comfortable to say hey Im not getting this. He cares and for Math that is essential",1
I think Maria did a fantastic job. The class was interesting and she is a very interesting person and a great teacher. She is Russian and has an accent but I understood her perfectly and she articulates her engligh better than most americans. Love her,1
"Dr. Boden is the only reason i use rate my professor from now on. taking his 100 level class was a great challenge and even though many hours were spent doing homework, lab reports, tests, quizzes, and taking notes i ended receiving a C for this class. never had participated in such a hard 100 level class, no extra credit avilable. not recommended!",0
"Hillarious guy, just a lot of on-line homework",1
Gets in your face a lot. Treats you as if you're still in Middle School. I wouldn't recommend her class at all. Less than half of the class stayed for her class before I left.,0
"Dr, Carol is very good at what she does. I admire you information and her willingness to learn from her students as well. Most professors that teach graduate level courses feel they are only source of information that matters. The reason why I said she grades hard is because she follows strictly follows  APA formats but she provides great feedback",1
"A lot of fun. Exciting debates. Like everyone else said, get down pat all of his methods for how to approach each type of fact pattern on the exam.  And record his 1 hour review on the last class and review it over and over and over again.",1
The best professor ever. He gives packets every class that helps so much with learning the information. He is such a sweet and caring person and definitely cares about every person that is in the class.,1
Dr. Ba is an amazing professor! Very clear in his expectations and understanding in that people have lives and things come up. W?He was more than a professor he went above and beyond to help his students!,1
"Gives terrible feedback, misspells almost everything, demands too much for how little he seems to care about the students.",0
"He clearly explains all concepts in lecture and explains ahead of time what will be on the tests. Your grade in the class is based entirely on the 4 tests, as there is no homework, extra credit, etc. The tests are challenging but the GSS resources (which are posted on ELMS) help a lot to prepare.",1
"I had Professor Bushey for CHEM131 and he was fine, however having him for 132 was hell. He is not good at explaining material, and often moves wayyy too fast. He got some of his own answers wrong and made the learning catalytics very stressful and due at the very beginning of class, but would get you the code minutes before. Not taking him again.",0
Prof. Faux runs a good class if you're looking to get your fine-art credit out of the way. The lectures can get boring if you aren't interested in them but he provides everything you need to know on reggie-net so you can self-study for tests if needed. If you're doing that at least go the day before each test since he does a very useful review.,1
"I took professor Luckett for social work, and I loved it. He answers your emails and questions almost immediately. And his test are everything he discusses in class. ",1
"Tom is the reason my writing has improved and it has shown through all of my classes. He cares a lot about his students and wants them all to succeed. He is a tough grader, but always comments on what you need to improve on. SOC 206 has been the hardest class I have taken throughout my college career, but I would have not have had it any other way!",1
No exams Weekly 500-word essays 2000-word final paper 20 minute weekly discussion videos Clear expectations,1
"So inspirational, great teaching skills. ",1
"Nice Guy, bad jokes. Doesnt return HomeWork soon enough for students to know if they are doing their work correctly. Puts questions on quizzes from sections he hasn't gone over. He doesn't go through the process of solving problems, he just plugs it into Mathematica and students have to figure it out for themselves.",0
Professor Mukherjee is very arrogant and condescending in his class. He assumes you know everything and will take as much time ridiculing the students than he could just be explaining. Super test heavy and a quiz every week. By far the worst professor I've ever had.,0
"Jane's class was taught well, and she knows what she is talking about. 3 tests, 1 final, 4 huge case studies and weekly homework. You have to work to do well-- the usual for any class. Def do not slack, and she knows the hard workers. Love her though, like a teacher who def cares!",1
"In the latter half of the semester, I became very sick due to cancer. Combined, I missed almost a month of school due to various hospitalizations. Professor Holmes allowed me any extra time I needed to complete my missed work. Her kindness and compassion relieved me of any increased stress I was feeling from school. She is inspirational.",1
Literally the worse teacher I have taken within my two years of being at NCC.,0
No Comments,1
Ms. Walkrt is the best teacher I have had at Moorpark College. She is hilarious and so sweet! Her class is actually fun and talking to her is so easy. She is very flexible on turn in dates but don't make it a habit. I hope I get her for my other business class as well!,1
This professor is challenging and most times confusing.  Most of the semester I spent teaching myself because she did not give good lectures.  She is confusing and unorganized.  She sometimes seems aloof and doesn't know how to answer questions. She is tough; nice person- but not a good teacher at all.,0
"This was one of the most difficult classes I have ever taken. His lectures are super engaging but he doesn't stop to review/clarify concepts that might have been forgotten. There are so many lecture quizzes and lab quizzes which can be both beneficial and harmful. His tests are super specific and vague, but it taught me where to focus my studying.",0
"Follows text closely. This is hard material to understand, but he will clarify if you have questions. Need to read and practice on your own though, otherwise the best teacher will not help you in this course.",1
"As an English major, I have never disliked an English class as much as I did this one, with this professor.",0
"Great teacher. Made class interesting and seem a lot shorter than what it really was. Don't come in late, and don't expect an easy A. However, if you study and attend class you will do fine, and learn a good deal of information.",1
"Big nerd with a big nerdy ponytail, and an awesome professor. Genuinely loves what he's teaching and it rubs off; very helpful and understanding. One of the best at GCC",1
Dr. Starner is soooo nice.  He explains wonderfully and he is very patient with everyone in class. He really wants the people in his class to succeed and he has fun teaching. Don't miss class. Everything you need to know will be taught to you in class. Haven't opened the book yet.,1
She is a great professor. Her lab tests are really easy as long as you study them. She is flexible with taking tests. You can make up tests if you have a reason. I highly recommend her.,1
"Very good proffesor, I totally understood her and very helpful. I recomend you take her classes. I had a very good experience with her and if you try to attend classes and be active you will get what you want. Easy to talk to and an open minded person for many problems.",1
"Had her for 166 (Black Science Fiction) last semester and she's just amazing! She's super helpful and caring during office hours, and she taught a large amount of material/background in a clear and coherent manner that made it easy to understand. She's on the tougher end when it comes to grading papers, but it's totally fair. Favorite prof!",1
Lots of weekly homework!!,1
Ms. Smith is really easy to get along with. Listen to her lectures and review all of models she shows in class. The tests are challenging because there's a lot of material to cover. She's easily accessible outside of class and will thoroughly answer any questions you have. One of the best teachers I've ever had.,1
"I highly enjoyed his class. He is great and very knowledgeable in Anatomy. Book is not needed, he provides power points which all tests are based on. Also, study the old test questions, lots of them will be on test!",1
"The best professor around hands down. Super understanding, considerate, hilarious, relatable, encouraging and immediately available for his students! I have had multiple foreign language professors and I feel like I have learned nothing. With Morales sensei I have learned so much and continue to learn every class and have fun learning.",1
"Easily one of the best math teachers in Spokane. There's a lot of homework depending on the class, but it's really simple and you will always pass if you put in the work. Math is my worst subject and he at the very least made it enjoyable to learn. You only need the book for the homework it entails because he's great at getting the message across. ",1
"I took Math 90 online...Mr. Narin was a great professor to take an online class from.  His website was very clear...he (and his T.A., Linda) responded very quickly to any questions. You know exactly what is on every test and quiz because he provides a review before each with answers.  Definitely recommend!",1
"I had her fall semester and she was very unclear but I thought it was the language barrier but it was not. I stood in her class till the end which was a huge mistake. She is very specific in what she wanted and you got no credit if you didn't follow her ""format"" (you just fold a paper a certain way) or not complete sentences. It's math..",0
"Mrs. Rogers is a good teacher. She lectures out of her notes, I never used the book. She assigned extra credit a few times, then counted them as homework, so watch that. Come to class. Whats going to be on the test isnt always clear, but if you study the notes she gives you it should be pretty easy.",1
"CHIEUX  !!! pas de classe, commentaires ****es. pédophile, emmerdeur, ne connait rien a sa matiere et veut faire croire qu'il est connaisseur !",0
"Interesting class, although the lectures consisted primarily of pictures and videos. Read the textbook, show up to lecture/discussion, and you'll be good. Take your time on the quizes due to minimal points that greatly affect your grade.",1
"Dr. Huerta is awesome. My class sucked (noone willing to answer questions or, y'know, participate) but she managed to save it. Each class was information heavy, but in an accessible and engaging way--I've been talked at and talk to, and she talked to us. Show up, pay attention, and check the syllabus--topics change often, but you can be prepared.",1
"Nice teacher! Concerns what students concern...use her way to push you study, and it works! difficult quiz, and force you to learn sth, but 5 quiz only have 5% in total...midterm and final are open book...heavy work, but it's tax, you have to do it in that way! I like her, she is old, but never lazy, her attitude is super good!",1
"Ms. Lee is a true professional who helps students to understand what is the lecture about. She is very meticulous on how you answer the math problems, but she still gives points even if the final answer was wrong. It's how you understand and process the question. She also offers a lot of extra credits to help you to pass in the exams.",1
"Prof. Hale is a great professor. Prof. Hale is willing to help, and more than anything, he cares about you and your situation. He's nit picky on citations, but other than that there is hardly anything he won't be lenient on. In addition, he'll teach you what you need to know to succeed in future classes.",1
"If you aren't taking this class with Matt, you're missing out. He is so genuinely kind and truly cares about how his students are doing. The lab manual guides you so well & show up to every lab if you want guided tutorials! He is always willing to help & he offers extra credit, like a lot of it.",1
Prof Foster after two semesters has become my favorite teacher. There is homework almost every day which is needed when you are trying to acquire the knowledge of another language. What you put into it is what you are going to get from it. Intellectually challenging with creative assignments that keep it fun. I recommend Prof Foster hands down.,1
The class was enjoyable. Professor Lawson cares for his students and wants them to succeed.,1
"I'm taking Prof Baez's class online and his lectures are pretty good. They're only 50 min long, once a week even though it said 3 times when registering. His homework and tests are always on Sapling and due Friday's. HW about 10-20, Tests about 40-60 multiple choice questions. Pretty easy class, if you are required to take econ I would take this :)",1
Stunning & electrifying lectures.,1
Prof. Jackson makes public speaking bearable! Her classes seem like a large family so you are encouraged to speak. She has five speeches but gives amazing feedback for you to improve on each time. The grading is straightforward and she is available to help you outside class. Just keep up with the quizzes and speech outlines and you'll get an A!,1
"Physics 131, 132, 133, EGR 235 since i can't type it all! Awesome teacher, some of the best conversations i've had in college were with him. a blast to hand around. BIG HELPER!!!",1
test are hard. he takes forever to grade and emails you back after a century has passed. very irritating. doesn't have notes for the class or power points for online class. would not take him again.,0
"Completely uninspiring and reads pre-prepared notes when lecturing, the lecture lasts about 30-40 minutes. The exams are extensive so just writing down notes will not be enough to prepare you for the exams. The lab consists of her telling you the page in the lab manual and you figuring it out from there.",0
Awesome professor! Very sweet and understanding! Interesting lectures. Fun class. Highly recommend!,1
"He gives a lot of tests, non mandatory homeworks and is a tough grader but he is a great teacher and is always willing to work with you",1
If you do the weekly labs and take the quizzes you will get an A,1
I love Dr Colavecchia. She's one of the best professors I've had because she cares a lot about what she's teaching and she makes the material interesting. She's an amazing person too and really cares about her students but her tests are decently hard. You really need to study and know the material but it's 100% worth it to take one of her classes.,1
He is the best prof ever,1
"I loved this class. Lisa is great and really helps you understand the material. Class time was split between lectures and group exercises, which was a good change of pace and gave us a chance to apply what we were learning. The papers are all on the same topic of your choice exploring different stages and processes of research. Take this class.",1
He loves to curse which is not good if you dont like curse words. Get ready to talk he will make you. Turn in your papers he will tell you if you have them in front of the class but wont read them unless you got a perfect score on a assignment later on in the course. He sometimes speaks some words that shouldnt be said. And reads mc papers.,1
"This professor gives excellent feedback, is easy grader and very respectful of his students. I will encourage you to take this class during summer, it will be a breeze.",1
"Just because her name rhymes with hell doesn't mean that her lab is. Far from it in fact. She will respond surprisingly fast to e-mails (worryingly even, I mean come on, play hard to get at least a bit), explain the information clearly, and is very knowledgeable. Go with Rishel, and it'll all be swell.",1
"Awesome professor, he's really passionate in class.  He's lectures are good and he makes class interesting.  You don't really need to buy the book, almost all of his questions come from his lectures.  3 exams, 2 movies that you have to watch and attendance.   One of the best professor I've ever had.",1
"This professor's office hours are extremely limited if you are looking to get extra help. However, if you somehow track him down for extra help in this course, you will not feel respected for he had uncalled for political jabs and degrades your work and thinking process.  Prof. Rogers clearly does not believe in the success of his students.",0
"I was one of the last two taking the final exam, when he walked to his TA and started talking about how easy the test was and how bad everyone was doing. Yes, while students are still taking it... Try concentrating while being made to feel stupid by someone who is suppose to be professional. Long story short I didn't do well and went from C to D.",0
This teacher is useless make sure if you get her run. Her grading is ridiculous and grades you down for the wrong reasons. She has her favorites and her tone of voice is very annoying. DONT TAKE HER!!!!!!!!!!,0
"I dreaded taking this class because I was terrified of public speaking. Thanks to Mrs. Hayden, I'm not as fearful and I'm so much better. This class really taught me a lot. Just go to class, participate, and try your best with applying the information learned this class will be an easy A for sure. Mrs. Hayden makes this class interesting!",1
"I was a bit let down by the teaching style of this professor. She presented math in powerpoint slides so it was very difficult to grasp the concept. We did not work through many examples in class, so I had trouble with doing the problems at home. Her tests are take home, but the problems are much harder than what she goes over in class.",0
"Great Professor, very fair and helpful.",1
"She is very unclear and almost makes you feel dumb for asking a question. She has this laugh that she does when you ask a question that makes you feel like she is mocking you. We never finished a lecture, tests are very hard and she doesnt explain things. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. SO many people dropped this class.",0
Be ready to watch a lot of Youtube Accounting videos.,0
"So funny and nice, makes gen psych enjoyable to go to. Would highly recommend!",1
She is the best bc she signs like a native deaf person and brings out the best in her students. Smart and thoughtful and my fav at LagCC,1
Not too inspirational. Very by the book. Could stand to liven class up a bit since it's math and math is not that great to begin with! All in all he's a nice guy just not very riveting.,0
"The material's pretty dry and I had him for a night class, so staying awake was always a challenge. Mostly, you have to attend lecture and memorize definitions. There is a huge group project (presentation and paper) at the end of the semester, but he grades easily on this.",1
"unbeleivable, english is defietly not my stong subjectand managed to get an A. pretty straight foward class if your the kind of student that just wants to show up and play angry birds. she shows alot of videos.",1
"Dennis didn't teach anything and was extremely disorganized.  He was unavailable for help if you needed him with lots of other obligations and other students...plus he didn't even notice if you were in his office.  His grading was abstract, and he was totally confused himself.",0
"She is the only one who could teach me stats and make it seem easy. Her workbooks are so helpful and she knows how to teach. Just go to class and do the homework. Stats sucks, but she makes it easy.",1
He is gorgeous and caring. He is super smart and nice!!! I low key admire him��,1
"Professor Ramamoorthy can be a bit tough to understand at times, due to his accent. However, if you make an effort to communicate and truly understand what he wants from an assignment, it can be much easier. He grades very leniently and is very nice, and understanding. The key is to make sure you communicate with him continuously.",1
Professor Maher is by far the worst professor I have ever had at Missouri State University. He is not willing to help you in any way. Tests are completely short answer. First exam was 5 front and back pages of short answer statistic problems to do in only 50 minutes. Would NEVER recommend.,0
Professor Demchuk is the best Math teacher I've ever had. He is great at explaining algebraic concepts.  His way of teaching is very clear. He gives you just enough homework to know and understand each process. The quizzes are take home.  I would choose him as a Teacher. ,1
"Ranft is a really nice guy. He comes from a psychology background, which doesn't make for the most black & white material. It's not that he's a tough grader, you just really have to pay attention in lectures to know what he's looking for. Not a lot of info on his note slides. No exams, lecture every Tuesday, quiz every Thursday. Interesting class.",1
"Amazing professor. Really cares about his students and will go above and beyond to make sure you understand the material. The material is not easy, but the exams are extremely fair if you do the homework.",1
"Restricts creative freedom. You're practically forced to abstract your work to her liking before you can start painting. Style is redundant, it's mostly collaging images on Photoshop and regurgitating it onto a canvas. The readings and the questions are a pain. Lastly, it's drawing and painting, wish she didn't restrict it to merely painting.",0
"Best teacher I've had so far at salve!! She's so funny and knows a lot about life. Always has a story to tell us every class, keeps you engaged and wanting to learn! Can't wait to take more classes with her! Great class for common core and very interesting. Plus, only 3 exams all year.",1
"I dont know what he is like in person but his online class sucks. He has two sites that for assignments which can be confusing, and no notifications for when he makes a new assignment. For due dates some quizzes don't have a due date while others do which is misleading. Also you don't know if a certain assignment has a due date until it is too late",0
The course itself is a very hard class to take. However Rafferty made the class interesting and not so painful. She made herself available for her office hours and was always there for assistance. I would take another class with her if I had to. Highly recommend her. You get what you put out while taking this class.,1
"FSE intro to engineering easy class, he has an accent but its not a problem, you dont need to go to the lecture to learn. grades leniently",1
"This teacher... wow (that's good) i took another chem class before this one and the differences between them vary, she goes at a slow pace, she makes us work without the pressure and has a hard hand/soft heart. quizzes help out immensely and very easy to talk to. Want an easy A? hate chem but need it? This is the class for you?",1
"Dr. Maragh Lloyd is fantastic! She makes you actually want to do the reading, and makes you see why it matters. Tough grader-follow the rubrics and prompts. But I literally want to be her friend",1
I am white and not a bit ashamed of it.  Dr. Fontenot's class was the only class I got an A in all year.  I got A's on all my papers.,1
This class has potential to be super boring but Pete tries to bring in outside situations that are relatable to make It interesting. If you use his office hours he is very helpful and willing to do whatever it takes to get you to pass his class because he sees the effort you put into it. Gives out extra credit. I did not use my text book oncnu,1
Prof was pleasant and entertaining. Made class fun. would take more classes with her,1
"difficult for a first year fall semester course, but she's a great prof",1
"Thus far, I have found Professor Parker to be helpful (and we have only turned in one document). He was available to read my draft outside of class and his feedback helped me to get the grade I wanted.",1
I took MTH 242 this summer amid the pandemic. The coursework was quite heavy because it was a typical semester class that I took in 6 weeks. Dr. Chang is very upfront about the demands of this class. Her grading policy is very clear and fair. Statistics (MTH 242) is somewhat of a difficult class but Dr. Chang is willing to help you in any way.,1
"He makes it VERY easy to get an A. 100% lectures but the material is captivating if you're at all interested in the subject. 3 non-cumulative exams (gives GREAT study guides) and 7 EZ online quizzes across entire semester. No calculations or formulas. You can miss class 7 times before your grade takes a hit. If you can't pass, IDK what to tell you.",1
"Amazing professor, excellent class where I learned lots!  Dr. Fredrickson is extremely helpful and is a great character to work with. Would absolutely take another class with him.",1
One of the most inspiring professors Ive ever had. He LOVES chemistry. Seriously. But hes tough. He wants you to know chemistry and hell test you on it to make sure. You have to know it. I personally think its too much but hes really a great teacher.,1
"Dr. Hill organizes the entire class so that you can move ahead or continue along in the module. She loves her job and loves teaching Psychology classes. This was a hard class to take but with the labs and discussions.. this class turned into much more fun than I planned. If you excel throughout class in the beginning, the end of class is a breeze.",1
very good prof. good looking too,1
I took her class she is helpful but the thing is I dont penfit from her alot i had to study har to undertand every thing i most of the time understand from the book more from her. it's maybe because she speak alot fast and she is like reading the materials not make me love the subject as i excepect. but i think overall she is a nice teacher .,1
Terrible teacher!!!!! You are tested on material that isnt taught yet. You take blackboard quizzes everyday. He will keep you late.,0
"I loved every minute in his class.  I had him for calc 1 and 2 and part of 3.  he is very clear and understanding and if I had any more math classes I needed to take, I would make sure I had them with him.",1
"Dr. Dotts is a great professor! He really cares about the subject he is teaching and acknowledges his own privilege in teaching it. His lectures can get a little boring at times, but it is not difficult content at all. The one word of advice I would give is to not slack on the 20 required hours of field experience. Do the work and you'll be fine",1
"Dr. B has a good sense of humor and likes to keep the class serious, yet free of interruptions. He does not go strictly by the syllabus and can be confusing at times on what he is expecting from you. If you show up to class and do all the work, you will pass.",1
Never again.,0
"I have taken many on line classes and this class has been not only interesting, but fun. I felt I learned a lot and have discovered I love sociology. Mrs Robertson is a wonderful teacher. Take her class!!!",1
"I decided to drop her class after the first half of the first semester. Her class may be ""easy,"" but she is such a boring teacher-she reads straight from her notes. She gets WAY off topic WAY too much. It was rather dull at times, and I don't recommend this class for anyone unless you absolutely LOVE history.",0
"This class was SOO boring, but it's easy. You don't need the textbook and your don't even have to go to class. I don't think I listened to any of his lectures, but I got an A in his class. He talks so quietly. The whole class is based on presentations and 2 online exams.",0
Tough grader but excellent in discussion sections at covering the material. Fair grader as he learns your writing.,1
"Brandon Huff was one of the best math teachers I have ever had.  He goes over things mulitple times, tries to put it in simple steps, and is always reasonable with assignments, tests, and quizzes.  He always gives you a week to complete the homework assignments and understands how difficult my math lab can be so he often addresses questions in clas",1
easiest class i have taken so far at wake tech. yea she goes through powerpoint slides really fast but that doesnt even matter. her study guides are the EXACT same questions & answers that are on her test. first test i got a 98 & my lowest test grade was a 96 all semester. memorize the study guide & u got an easy A. i LOVED her!!,1
"Good Class Overall. Weekly Quizzes that are pretty easy. Every now and then there is a paper due but it's not too bad if you cite things from the lecture and briefly expand on them. There was one group project that took a bit of working and collaboration, but even that wasn't very hard after splitting up the work. Not the best teacher but not bad.",1
"Professor Conta, is the best teacher I have ever had. This class is the third class I have taken with him and I keep coming for more. This professor has good teaching skills and he knows what his talking about because he has experiance in the field of criminal justice, so if u interested in criminal justice his the professor to take.",1
"Puh-lease. Prof Waller just doesn't like bull. I have had NO issues with her. Also, how many students do you think are in the program? Don't you think it might be hard to accommodate EVERYONE. If its never open why have there been special days just for 1st semester students before practicums. Stop with the pity party.",1
He is not a good teacher.,0
"Crittenden is a very nice guy but his lectures can be very very boring for this class. This was his first time teaching math, all he did was write across the whiteboard the whole class. There is more homework and it can be time consuming but he lets you retake every test no matter what grade you received. He also kind of talks like Eeyore.",1
Brace is a very hard marker but a really nice person.,1
She is probably the most disorganized professor I have ever had. Grades from the very beginning of the semester was not entered until last days of the course. I wonder what she does with those 5 months.... It's aggravating because you won't know what grade you have. Email replies have so many typos. Late replies or no replies most of the time.,0
shes amazing and so inspiring. so damn helpful and very clear. easy A if you do the work. she doesnt want you to just study and stress you out but she wants you to actually learn so that was very helpful. I wish she taught other psc classes as well because shes an amazing professor.,1
"This was my first time having Prof Hansen, and I enjoyed his class each week. His lectures were insightful, and I could tell that he knew a lot about the books he taught. If you enjoy a class that is discussion and lecture combined , take him!",1
"If you work ahead and ask Professor Kolluru questions as they come up, this class will be an easy A. She's super caring and will work with you even though it's an online class.",1
Quizzes every class. 50 multiple choice question tests,1
Don't ever take him. Its a terrible experience.,0
"She is wonderful! You will learn a lot about public speaking. Really gives you an awareness of everything, big and small, that factors into a good speech; stuff you wouldn't even think of. Very supportive & fun to be around. Everyone in the class will learn each others names quickly, and it creates a really friendly and supportive environment.",1
Boring lecture. Don't take when this guy's teaching Astr323.,0
I absolutely LOVED her and the class. She helped give a lot of feedback in and outside of class. She is great at her job and it absolutely shows that she loves what she teaches. She deserves all the love.,1
I never went to this class UNLESS I thought that there would be a random attendence quiz and turns out.....I never missed one quiz. His lectures are entertaining but sometimes can be really tiring. He is very inspirational about music and what he does which is good. Tests (midterm/final) were only 20-25 questions and exactly like the study guide.,1
"This is one of the best teachers I have had in college. She is by far the most helpful if you are having issues. She will work with you and is understanding if you miss an assignment, just talk to her. She does tend to get off track a lot but in the end we learn the material and have a good time while doing it. She can be strict if someone acts out",1
"She is very enthusiastic when it comes to giving her lectures. The problem is that she doesn't put ANY of her lectures online in colour, but has them in colour when presenting. It is very confusing when she mentions a colour slide and I am unable to see it. She doesn't finish her thoughts, and her slides are sometimes incomplete thoughts as well. ",0
"Dr. Polster is brilliant.  She is very helpful through the process and beyond. The material is no cakewalk and she is well aware of that fact.  Her raw intelligence can be intimidating at times, but her personality is warm and her demeanor is kind.  She even shows restraint in dealing with stubborn ignorance.  If the opportunity arises, do it.",1
"I started CIT 217 expecting it to be another easy Mindtap course I could bash through in a week. Brown unlocks content week by week. i didn't like this at first, but I actually ended up learning some new stuff. Lots of homework, but if you follow the text and do the work you'll be fine. His course was very well organized, which is important to me.",1
"Gives six tests, drops your lowest grade and about 50-60% of her tests consists of multiple choice questions. Very nice, and realizes that learing Spanish is a process.",1
DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR FOR STATISTICS. MAKES YOU TAKE WRITTEN TEST THAT TAKES UP MAJORITY OF THE TEST TIME AND IS EXTREMELY BORING.,0
"Her work is beautiful, but her work is clearly her focus.",0
"Boden grades with an iron fist, but his lectures are interesting and fun with great pictures and examples.  He does grade hard, and his tests are tricky even with notes.  I took this class last year, and would still recommend it. Even though it was hard to get a good grade, it was better than falling asleep due to boredom like other geol profs.",1
"Had him for every drawing class I took at NMC--and will have taken every class he teaches by next Spring. Amazing teacher. Hands down, the best I've ever had. If you love art, you HAVE to take Doug's classes. So constructive and knowledgeable. Plus, he has this insanely calming voice, haha",1
He definitely cares and wants students to succeed. The problem was is he did not teach in a way that helped that. He mostly read off lecture slides and class was boring. Tests were difficult and he does not do nearly enough examples in class to make sure you understand material before class. Homework didn't really help you learn and was very hard.,0
"While the class itself was a bit difficult and required a lot of studying, I truly enjoyed having her as a teacher. Very funny and is always willing to help outside of class if you're behind. Expect to be studying at least 1-2 hours a day. Learned quite a bit.",1
Professor Fitzpatrick was such an amazing professor. She is willingly to help on any essay she has assigned and is very concise with her comments on essays. She encourages her students to do well and is very passionate about the subject she teaches. I would love to take more of her classes.,1
"If you want to major in literature, this class is for you.",0
"This course heavily relies on participation. As long as you are doing your work, you will be just fine! I would wait until after class begins to buy the books that he requires though, because you only dive into one or two out of the bunch. However, the others are interesting reads if you are someone who likes a good book.",1
No Comments,1
"A real stickler when it comes to attendance and grading and doesn't forgive mistakes at all (won't even reply to emails for explanations). I accidentally turned in a wrong paper and even though he knew, didn't mention anything until giving back my grade and wouldn't accept my actual paper. Jerk. Take this class with a different professor.",0
I always looked forward to this class! Dr. Monroe is definitely one of the best professors I've ever had.,1
While Mrs Yang is a very kind professor her ideas over group work are less than ideal. She will assign people to random groups at the beginning and at the middle point of the semester. Group work sometimes isnt bad but when you get stuck with a bad group it hurts your grade bad. The professor also did nothing as one or two groups had conflicts.,0
He's very clear in his teaching. U will learn so much 4m him if u don't know much about computer. Don't skip class b/c u will learn new material 4 each class & new materials build on old ones (unless u already know it). U only hav 2 read the summary at the end of each chapter 4 the quiz.Very easy,1
"This is by far the easiest college professor Ive ever had. He explains everything very simply and you dont even need to take notes. The week before tests, he hands out a review and a take home test that are virtually identical to the exams! And you get to use them for reference on your exams! Only math professor I would ever take!",1
"Dr. Judson is a great professor. You can tell she truly cares about her students, and the material wasn't too difficult. Hybrid class - meet in class one day, online the other. You have to dress business casual because of it being a MKT 230(+) course. Biggest project are two case studies which require reading about 10 page cases, tests are easy.",1
"Really tough grader, and she assigns an incredible amount of reading.  Other than that she is a pretty good teacher.  Her insights on the text are original and quite amazing.  She does expect YOU to participate though.  I wrote a really insightful essay, but rather than grade it based on the content, she graded based off of its structure.",1
Great Lecturer. One of the few teachers that could make me pay attention during the whole class. Exams are easy and he only tests you on relevant topic. Uses easy languague and makes class very interesting.,1
"A great professor! Really enjoys and knows what he teaches. Always willing to make sure his students grasp the material. Very tough but extremely fair test/papers. You must do the reading, go to class, and ask questions to do well. And you'll want to! Take at least one class with him for sure! One of the best profs I've ever had!",1
Math is not my strong point.,0
"A very nice woman with very rigid grading. However, she is a very good teacher and if you go to her office she'll help you as much as she can. Just watch out for the homework assignments. They take up a ton of time, and she only picks 2 problems to grade so you can get unlucky and have the one problem you got wrong picked.",1
"Love this class. Dr. Bardo is really an expert on the area but so down to earth and easy to talk to. I was a little unsure about this class because hes new here, but my advisor recommended it and Im so glad I listened to her.",1
She is one the best lecture professors at CSULA but she is brutal when it comes to her tests and assignments. Her tests are multiple choice and rest is scenario questions. She will combine every thing she lectured into one question multiple parts. She does curve but depends on the highest grade in the class. She is very helpful during her office.,0
"I made an A in this class simply because the exams were departmental, and they were much easier than the work we did in class. He is a really nice guy who is willing to help, but he is just not a good teacher. He made things so much harder than they had to be in class, and he confused me more than he helped.",0
"inspirational in his teachings, puts effort and character into lectures. lectures are LONG ,but meaningful. does a great job at explaining the importance of communication.",1
Do NOT take this Professor! Ever! Run! Quick change classes and SAVE YOURSELF! Worst Prof. Ever.,0
She is a very nice lady. Her lecture can be a bit boring sometimes (make sure to participate once in a while) but she definitely cares about her students and the class isn't too hard.,1
"I enjoyed taking this class with him - even if we did run behind with the syllabus, it wasn't expected that we know something that we ended up not having time to delve into. He is super knowledgable & open to learning from his students, too. The class was super engaging and I LOVED the discussions. If I had any complaint, it was the students lol",1
"Hollis is very knowledgeable and willing to help if you are willing to put in the work. Tests are very specific and difficult, and he was probably the hardest professor I've ever had. ",1
Class is interesting for the subject. Wolverton makes it very clear what is expected of the students therefore it is easy to succeed if material is studied. Doesn't handle questions in class very well but this is expected of a 50 min lecture of which she uses every min. I recommend this course to any one who is interested or for GE purposes.,1
"Professor Marlow is a very entertaining lecturer. His humor may not be appreciated by some, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The subject itself was interesting, and he obviously cared a great deal about what he was teaching. Lots of reading, but there are lots of grades, so you have plenty of chances to keep your grade up!",1
"Great guy, just not a good teacher. Lectures were almost impossible to follow. He did more examples as the semester went on but still not enough. Exams are pretty difficult (averages were around 50%) but he curves strongly so that the average is around a B-. He does want you to do well. Just can't explain material well enough. Self taught myself.",0
Professor Calkins is an exceptional English professor. Trust me I was absolutely horrible at writing in high school. ENC1102 requires A LOT of writing but if you stay on top of the assignments and follow her example papers you will do fine. Few quizzes and 2-3 extra credit assignments. Assignments during the semester form the final research paper.,1
"FInishing my third year in this field and she is truly one of the driest lectures and most useless teachers I have had. Reviewing for tests is impossible, between the half empty slides with color clashing font, and spending hours just trying to find readings she gives using only a name and date. Shoots down questions in-lecture, truly the worst.",0
"Professor Eubanks is awesome, his world literature class was my favorite class so far. His tests are not hard, and there are 2 large writing assignments. In class, he promoted a more discussion-based atmosphere and comfortable environment. There is homework, but not hard homework. If you show up to class and put forth effort, you won't have a prob.",1
"In this class expect yourself to be involved in both speaking with others and presenting with smart and savvy attitudes towards the topics you choose! The course can be a breeze as long as you are active and have participatory outlook! This professor is caring and respectful of your time, so be respectful of his!",1
David actually makes me want to come to class. He has the typical powerpoint notes but he makes the material interesting to listen to by giving a lot of good and funny personal examples. He wants you to succeed and there is minimal work with this class that are mostly presentations. I wish all my classes could be taken with this guy.,1
"Avoid if possible. Although he's a nice guy and very funny, I found the lectures to be very unclear. I had to teach myself everything in this class and mechanics is not an easy thing to self teach. Studying hard and often is the key to doing well. He gives a quiz every class but helps in the end. Tests are hard but he curves the average to a 75.",0
"Not the worst teacher in the world, at least compared to what I've heard about last semesters. But holy cow I don't understand the point of this class, everything he's gone over has already been taught in previous CS classes, so you just sit there while he over explains things that other teachers taught in four minutes that takes him an hour.",0
"Dr. A is very good. He is more than willing to stay on one topic as long as you need him to. He doesn't create the tests, so don't blame him for not testing on certain things. You'll need to study ALL of the material from all of the chapters. It is a lot of work, but he definitely assists in making it as easy as he can! DO SIMS!",1
I loved Dr. Pittman. She really cares about her students and will do anything to help you out if you put the effort in.,1
Instruction in clear. Weekly homework is required in order to learn subject. Instructor shows enthusiam for the subject and makes accounting come to life. She is open to questions and encourages class participation. The class moves quickly and there is a lot of information presented.,1
"Professor Allen is amazing! His class is actually pretty interesting, especially since he is quite clearly very enthusiastic about his work. The class is very easy, as the assignments don't require too much work. If you go to lecture and have a decent memory, you will get an A in the class. He also has an English accent!",1
"Wonderful, passionate teacher and really just a lovely person. She makes class engaging and I love listening to her french! The work isn't mandatory but is reflected in the tests, thus very helpful when you actually do it.",1
"Excellent for 108. NOT for 201.  I was 2% away from passing and I only missed one class AND did tutoring, and she didn't care.  Only cares about smart students or those in front row. Rude outside of class. She got corrected EVERY class period.  not a good teacher for 201",0
"If math isnt your strongest subject, please avoid taking her. She is very inpatient, impolite, and very short worded. She also gives lots of homework most of it is hand written homework. She teaches very fast and goes off of the book. Makes you feel very unintelligent when you ask a question. I ended up dropping the class because of it.",0
"Don't be scared off. She is harsh in her marking but if you ask for her help, she will be more than willing. Her words might feel a little sharp but all she wants is for students to be ready for the harder parts of ASL. Even with online learning, she had clear and easy lectures to follow (not long). She listens to student feedback, don't be afraid.",1
He has a very thick accent and spends most of the class writing theorems and equations on the board without explaining what they do. Exams are way harder than the content seen in lectures and homeworks. Do not take his class if you are not ready to learn all the topics by yourself.,0
U will be shocked of his TOO complicated & unorganized syllabus! he says it is 3 short writing assignments short means(2500-3000 words)also u need to do a project with many requirements. U need to write one analysis paper (MC) as HW every week. he let u do Lots of reading then he never talk about what u read. u will be confused of what he wants.,0
I just wanna make sure everyone knows to never take this class. Like fr... These positive comments are actually cap. Like please save yourself and do not take this class. If you want to get anything more than a D good luck! YOU NEED TO GET EVERYTHING RIGHT IN THE CLASS. LIKE NOT EVEN CAPPING EVERYTHING. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS,0
She is really sweet and really helps when it comes to giving feedback on drafts. She gives a clear criteria on what she wants in her papers. Really tries to make sure you do your best in her class. She listens to what you have to say during discussions. The only downside is that she gives a lot of hw but I would definitely take again.,1
Her personality is just like her last name );( No sense of humor; no personality. Lectures were long and unclear; exams were ambiguous.  Unwarned  quizzes; no curve; no extra credit; tough grader. DO NOT TAKE HER! Avoid as all cost.,0
"This was the hardest class I have ever taken. I felt such a relief when it was over because I literally felt like I lived and breathed SOA 206 all semester. I learned so much from Tom and he is very knowledgeable, but be prepared to devote a lot of time to this class. I mean A LOT OF TIME!",1
"Barbara is helpful and knowledgeable.She knows how to guide a student and when to step back and let you be an artist. She helps tone down the subjectivity of art, i.e. ""all art is beautiful"" and helps students to create art that they will be happy with and proud of.Spend time on your work and you will learn and be pleased with the finished product.",1
"Hands down best professor I had at UT throughout my undergrad. The class was really fun to attend, and he makes learning all the material a breeze! He was also available after class for any questions, and is a very genuine person and caring person outside of class! If you need to take biochem, take Hoffman!",1
"Honestly, I really expected more from this Professor given that he has really good reviews but Im really disappointed. His lectures were clear for the most part but the hw/tests werent always representative to the lectures. He throws curve balls. He doesnt really reply to emails either. This class was not really enjoyable whatsoever:(",0
He is a great professor. He loves what he do. He is funny and classes are entertaining. Just study the lecture book. The quizzes of the lab are from the homework.  ,1
"He talks in a monotone voice, but he knows his stuff, and has a lot of ideas. You have to dress out sometimes but it is fun to play the games he has, one project which broken into parts, and only 3tests the whole semester including the final. GOOD GOOD TEACHER!!!!",1
"I also searched her on RMP and was scared but she is so helpful. Really learn so much, easy, so many extra credits. PPl who don't wanna study or do an effort in exams, don't like her but who really want to study love her. She is one of my best teachers and I do not believe feedback on rate my professor. Love her..",1
The best teacher ever! Helpful and will go out of her way to make you succeed,1
"My mother actually had alison over 20 years ago, and since then she has built up a reputation for very difficult classes. Some have said ""impossible"". I got an A, I worked very very hard, and took alot of time off to study properly. She is tough, however if you plan on going into the medical field, you better get used to it. She def prepares you.",1
the easiest class I've ever taken.,1
"A very good professor.  Attendance is not mandatory and he emails notes from class.  There is a midterm and a final, with the final being two thirds of the grade.  This was an easy A class and it allowed me to focus a lot on my other classes, which were a lot tougher.",1
"Fantastic, compelling woman.  I think the students who rate her low do so because Mary raises issues of race and class, and those topics make some people uncomfortable-especially in the direct, thought-provoking way Mary discusses these things.  If you're willing to open your mind, you will learn so much. Mary Layoun is an incredible teacher.",1
"great professor she is lenient but, smart and challenging with assignments ",1
"She explains things once to the entire class clearly, if you were not paying attention while she was speaking she does not like to re-explain things. I liked her style of teaching and talking with students.",1
"When you think of Ethics it sounds boring at first, but Nuneville does her best and succeeds at keeping students interested and engaged! I loved her and as she is someone working in this field it was nice to learn more about her experiences. You should expect a group project (easy) and 2 tests (yes, study) Tip for enjoying this class: Participate",1
Horriable...makes you feel so bad during every class,0
Do not take any class with him. Very boring class and need more time to practice and you should be good at MATH.,0
"Professor Serpell is incredibly brilliant! She gives the most passionate lectures, excellent feedback, and assigns the best readings I've ever had in an English class. You can really tell she cares about her students and her subject matter. Professors like her really remind you why Cal is ranked so highly.",1
"Professor Higham is a fine teacher, but he doesn't bend over backwards for you so you have to be pro-active in seeking him out to ask questions and visiting his office hours if you want help. He doesn't know how to explain difficult topics so that students can understand, so make sure you ask for clarification. Still, he will help you if you ask.",1
Legace was amazing as a professor. I took his IQL recently and he was very understanding. I had computer issues so I wasn't able to get all my homework done but he was very understanding and allowed me to hand in the homework late. Also really into sports. Highly recommend him. One of the best professors I've had here in the past two years.,1
"Great teacher!!!  Would recommend him to anyone!!!  The class is very updated w/ real activities and info you can use in a PE class.  Sometimes, the note taking can be a little boring, but his stories and activities make it interesting.  Attendance is a big part of this class!!!  It's an easy A!!!",1
"The class is two hours long and if she doesn't have the material to make fill the two hours, get ready to listen to stories about her life. I am an English major and I still need to know so much more about punctuation and correct writing. Make a good first impression. She gives you the benefit of the doubt when grading if she likes you.",1
"He is a fantastic guy but one of the worst teachers I've ever had. He is very unclear with what he wants and he frequently forgets what he originally required and changes his mind. He is a nice and funny guy but he just cannot teach. Nearly everything I learned in that class was from the book. Take someone else for this class, you won't regret it.",0
Jen is a great prof as long as you're not the type of student that never comes to class or isn't respectful. She can be blunt but is genuinely very kind if you show her you're ready to learn. She creates a safe and fun learning environment and her anecdotes are really funny/helpful. Would definitely recommend for anyone into Creative Writing.,1
Great teacher and person,1
"Nina is an absolute sweetheart and such a kind approachable human being, but she has this 'crazy lefty' side of her that I didn't like. She literally gave us an article that claimed New Caledonians are smarter than Europeans (idk who she's trolling with that one). She also sometimes spews political comments here and there, but overall, she's sweet.",1
I did not enjoy this class as much as I thought I would because it was an on demand class. He was spotty with when and how often he posted lectures and assignments. He kinda waited until the end of the semester to post a lot of the lectures. The quizzes are tough in my opinion but the exams are made from the quizzes.,1
"She only grades you on four tests, a case-study, and some lab work. She is an amazing person. She does so much and is a strong role model. Is it less than ideal? Yeah, but you get the grade you deserve. If you put the time in, you will learn more than you thought possible. She would do anything for her students, Its amazing how busy she must be ILC",1
"I loved Thad! I wish I could take more classes from him. Such a great, caring guy. He did take a while getting back some test scores to us, but made up for it by adding5 pts to everyones grade for the hassle. His lectures were thought out and easy to listen to and absorb the information. This is a hard class but he made me want to show up each week",1
This guy was amazing. Class was extremely interesting and he also taught us more relevant things. Learned more than I ever though I would about the Mexican Revolution and in a good way. He always has the best stories too.,1
"Marketing 190 is basically like MKT 230 except for Marketing majors only. This class was a hybrid so half online half in class. Very easy to pass. The only thing that stinks is having to dress business casual but usually she doesn't care after the first few weeks. Over all, she's a great professor and class was fun.",1
"Drain is the best teacher I ever had. The other comments don't do justice. He explains everything in detail, and constantly helps when there is a need. This other person doesn't know what their talking about.",1
"Not the best, but certainly not the worst. You have a certain amount of absences until it affects your grade. Few homework assignments and exams. Use Google, read the textbook and keep your notes organized, you'll pass. Not much interaction besides daily exercise sheets with nearby classmates. No group projects/papers/presentations. EC offered.",1
"Took this class online- Pretty easy...you have to do the work- Discussions all the time, quizzez, & tests just about weekly. Just do the work, i got an A.",1
She is such an amazing professor!! Shes very understanding and patient with her students as they are learning ASL and includes a lot of fun activities in the class. I would 100% recommend anyone who either has to take this class as a requirement or just wants to learn ASL to take it with Professor Hellmann.,1
"He knows this stuff cold, and can explain it clearly.  His grading is a bit tough, but he makes the material so easy to understand you should be fine.  He's also pretty cool, and has a sense of humor.  A great experience.",1
He was a decent teacher but the homework is hard. Tests aren't even that bad unless you missed more than one class in that unit. He was funny but a little awkward.,0
"Expect to do lots of online homework (sapling) to understand the material being presented, and self teach.",0
"All the stories about him are true as this was my most traumatic academic experience. I literally had to study every day, especially when he might spring a pop quiz on us. Lectures were hard to follow, since he went too fast when using powerpoint slides. His english is incomprehensible at times (achume?). Shockingly helpful during his office hours.",0
"Professor Bardo is great! He is very caring and truly wants the best for all his students. He always asks students for feedback. For participation points just writing him a note and telling him what you thought about the class counted. Your grade is made up of participation, an essay, midterm, and final (both exams are online).",1
"Great teacher that loves what he does, but tests are pretty hard!!!He doesn't like the use of our textbook as our first resource, instead he pushes students to fully understand his powerpoints, which are from the textbook for the most part. if you don't understand something go to SI and/or office hours he helped me many times when i didn't get it.",1
He likes to edit things last minute which can create some anxiety. But he gives you a clear expectations and even has a test review day Before exams so youre able to prepare and he is very fair and lenient on grading I recommend this teacher,1
"very nice. very helpful, knows more than she should on her subject matter. movies she shows are good and she gives tons of ectra credit come finals",1
"Dr. Zavarin is very knowledgeable but more importantly is an effective teacher.  He is relaxed, funny and approachable, and will make himself available for questions.  He seems to want you to succeed and provides thorough practice exams and solutions and some extra credit.  Lectures are thorough and not at all boring.  Definitely take his class!",1
"He is a very kind professor. I had a very rough semester due to my health, Professor List motivated me to keep going and I am so glad I did. This is definitely not the easiest course but do the homework and you can do it! He made the topic very interesting, I took the lab with this course and that helped me understand some topics a bit better.",1
I wish there was another CS320 prof because he is the worst. I'm not even being salty or joking when I say he is a tough grader and doesn't teach that well. This class was a living nightmare with no help at all and the worst way to grade. I got 0's for the smallest mistakes and tests were just ridiculous levels of time and difficulty. Worst prof.,0
"Professor Peterson is a very fair, nice professor. Her assignments were graded fairly and she did not have unrealistic expectations from students. I had her for Comms-116 and the class was great. I would recommend her for any communication class you can get into.",1
Professor Schlorrt gives excellent and hilarious lectures. You will learn a great deal about history if you take the class. He gives a lot of feedback on assignments telling you what to do better. Some might say the feedback is harsh. I would say it is fair. He gives you good grades and will help you pass by dropping assignments! You'll learn a lot,1
"He is the most caring person ever, he is a really good teacher and his ways of explaining math are simple and sometimes funny, 100% recommended.",1
I really love this class.  I feel like I understand things happening now so much better now.  The lectures are really good.  The tests are all essays but I don't think their that bad.,1
HORRIBLE got a D in the class. When you ask questions he tells you look in the book doesnt bother to help. pop quiz when he feels no one is participating doesnt even tell you what to study or focus on for the exam. terrible professor doesnt care for the students.,0
"Sam is really a nice and friendly professor!!! P.S. One important thing to keep in mind is: don't be absent minded during lectures otherwise you will find yourself completely lost, as there is nothing called ""slides"" in Sam's lecture. But even without slides Sam is a great professor! (as long as you are a good student and go to lectures, lol) :)",1
"honestly one of the best professors ive ever had at uw. although i dont find coding very easy, the instructors offer plenty of help, and in all honesty i felt like the difficulty of info201 course very reasonable. the course is very worth it! you learn a lot. the lecture and textbook (written by the professor himself) are also very helpful.",1
"you take 4 exams, read 5 stories with mini quizzes, and a papers. Dont bother buying the text book, just show up to class and take the notes. Her lectures are somewhat boring and very fast paced, somewhat hard to keep up. Make sure you are always reading the syllabus as well, because she will not remind you of when the assignments are due.",1
"Make sure you do youre homework, it can save your grade especially if you arent as great as math. Brooke is an amazing professor, shes eager to help and easy to approach. Even with my struggle, having a cool professor really helps.",1
"Great professor who cares about your grade! I wouldn't say he gives a a lot of homework, but he does give homework everyday. Its easy homework and he really gets you engage with his lessons. His lectures are aslo very interesting and I enjoy them very much!",1
Average exam scores are always below 60%. Heavy homework. Doesn't explain things very much. This course requires intelligence of your own. I wouldn't take this course if it weren't for the graduation requirement.,0
worst teacher ever period !,0
"He was a really awesome professor! Of course you have to actually try, and pay attention or you will not do well. He really relates the information to teachers and KIN majors, he also provides everything you will need online. I would not bother buying the book, I never opened mine& got an A! :)",1
"Great teacher, the curve is very generous, if you go to class you'll have no problem understanding any content presented in the class.",1
"She's fantastic, a really easy grader for sure. She really helps you with your papers to improve them, then gives you a terriffic grade. Totally devoted to her students. Love her!",1
"Ms. Wright is um mediocre. Her class isnt hard, if you show up youll pass (and if u dont show up youll probably still pass). Not too much hw. Her tests/finals are straightforward. She relies on the class to do a lot of the talking, so idk what she knows. Class kinda drags on , I took notes to stay awake.",0
"This class is not hard if you stay on top of your online homework. The only real complaint I have is that there is honestly no reason to go to class. Quizzes are all online, and his tests are in the testing center. He's a genuine teacher, just seems a bit lazy.",1
"3, 50 question quizzes. He only takes the 2 highest scores. So 100 points. 1 final exam of 75 questions & points. 25 points for 5 random attendance days. 200 points total to pass class with an A. Super easy. He GIVES you the EXACT questions that will be on the quizzes so don't be dumb and fail this class. Put effort, study and respect him. simple.",1
"He's incredibly boring and the material was dry. Read off his notes most of the time and attempted to make it interesting sometimes but not very well.. Could have taught myself better. Tests were pretty straightforward. Makes you use Connect which sucks, but it's pretty easy. Probably wouldn't take him again.",0
"Great professor, very caring and want's each student to be the best. Would recommend..",1
Class was OK. He can be kind of rude so don't take his class if you are easily upset. ie. acts like youre an idiot if you answer a question wrong,0
"Professor Bulriss was from Chandler Gilbert Community College. I dropped his OGL320 right after the first day. So, he basically gives students 2 essays (one of them needs 1200 words) on 1st day and due in 2 days. Then the syllabus shows that you got more essays to write with more words every week after, and don't forget about group project!",1
"Thad is great! I took him this Summer for Physiology,and he made it awesome. He doesn't waste your time with things you don't need, and is VERY clear about what he expects you to know. It's a hard class, but Thad gives you every opportunity to do well. He's got a good sense of humor, and really knows his stuff. I would highly recommend taking him!",1
"Worst class I've taken at SJSU. Do NOT take this class if you're not a Journalism major. I cannot tell you how preachy and rude he is (especially to this one student in my class). His expectations are really high for a ""beginning "" Journalism class. This class has destroyed my interest in Journalism.",0
"Crazy Austrian Economist from the University of Vienna.  Although he knows his stuff, he is extremely dry.",1
I LOVE this woman. Not only is she hilarious but her lectures are clear and she relates them to life expierences. She goes off topic frequently but she's one heck of a lady! Respect this woman like crazy and I wish I could take her for every class in the future!!!!   TAKE HER!!,1
"He is such a good professor, very detailed lectures and tells you exactly what you need to study for. The tests are not difficult if you show up to class and pay attention to the lecture. He is very descriptive with the topics given, and if you have any questions, he is willing to answer them in office hours. Highly recommended to take his class.",1
Mrs. Elfring is an AMAZING teacher. Her class was so easy and her feedback for assignments  is amazing. Her class assignments are easy and she is always willing to help when you need her. I would love to take classes again with her.,1
"I had her for ACCT 1, she's a great teacher. She is not hard, before the test she goes over some of the questions and pretty much lets you know the answers. If you read the book, and pay attention in class there is no reason why you shouldn't do well.  She's extremely helpful. She seems strict at first but she's a wonderful teacher.",1
Charlotte is an amazing professor. I have had her twice and both times she has been a wonderful teacher. She is always willing to help out her students and genuinely wants to see her students succeed. It is easy to do well in the class as long as you do your homework and study a little bit every day. The workload is light. Class is always enjoyable,1
"In laymans terms - lots of smoke & mirrors. The perception he gave in class was different from what was posted. Some good stories but there was a lot of ""did I say this in this class or last class"" while at the same time insisting he said something that he did not. We proved this in class and then had a surprise assignment. hmmm",0
"this teacher is so special, but so good at the same time!!! i really love that teacher",1
"Greg is a really nice guy and cares a lot about his students. He is very willing to help out with papers and is willing to clarify things for you. HOWEVER, he makes you constantly write papers about plagiarism after reading lengthy articles about it WHILE you are trying to focus on a research paper. He gives out a lot of work.",1
"Anyone who says this guy is too hard just doesnt put in the work.  Yes you have to read, yes you have to go to class, and yes you have to study for exams, get over it this is college! great teacher, very passionate and if you listen in class and read, nothing on the tests is irrelivant.",1
good prof. very clear instruction.,1
"Honestly if it is your last spanish class, take him. He is a real leniant grader when it comes to grading as he is really chill on grading compared to other spanish 122 teachers that I heard about.",1
"Extremely lecture heavy. 5 50 question exams. He offers limited extra credit. If youre going for nursing, this is the ultimate weed out course. To earn my A Ive had to take my own notes off the chapters, do lecture notes in class, read PowerPoint, watch YouTube - EVERYDAY. If youre just an average student, you wont pass this course - beware.",1
"Great professor, very helpful. Take home final, 2 critiques and a proposal. Everything on the final should be in your notes. If you listen and take good notes you will be fine, i got an A.",1
Great teacher!!! You can def get an A! Be sure to go to every lab!!!,1
"Dr. Mark grades you off of her personal feelings and will not clarify when you ask for reasonings as to why your grade is so low. She is a very boring lecturer and does not respect students when grades are late or if there's a family emergency. She also grades your participation on how she feels you did in class, her personal opinion of you.",0
Hands down the best math teacher I've ever had. I feared Math until I had Alisa's class. she explains things in a way that makes it easy for non math folks to understand. Her tests are hard but she prepares you for them really well. I would recommend her to anyone!,1
she is an excellent professor. her class is almost entirely discussion based and she will clarify any and every question you have about something you read. she accepts everyones opinions and really wants to get to know her students. just read for class and participate and you will do well. she appreciates participation a lot! definitely take her!!,1
"Jeri is awesome, I love her! She is so fast with grading, gives excellent feedback to your ideas before you start your project. She really cares about her students and is very interested in her student's lives. I highly recommend taking her classes, she does not disappoint!!!",1
Make sure you attend every lecture and discussion! I had 90+ in both midterm and final. But only got B+ overall because I missed a few lectures. His one page essay is really restricted in terms of his requirement. His lecture is always useless and you better off read books on your own. Participation grade is so subjective and unfair. Avoid him.,0
"Prof. Asbell was such a pleasure to have, she is very passionate about her work and give different perspectives on everyday life. She goes off on rants about 70% of the time and the other 30% asks for class input. She's an open book and allows the class to be very independent.",1
All test based off of study guides you fill out in class and does tutoring on zoom to reinforce what she taught. she will do everything to make sure you get the grade you need. Does practice quiz and practice test before you take quizzes and exams. If you dont get at least a B you didnt prepare on your end. Great Teacher!,1
Al is quirky and funny but lectures were very boring. Tests were easy if you took good notes and studied. Assignments were easy and had clear directions and expectations. Good class to take to fill a gen ed requirement!,1
There is a lot of reading to do however the topics are generally pretty interesting. His lectures are very long though (3 hours) and so they are pretty hard to sit through because he goes on a lot of tangents and makes simple points very convoluted. You're better off just reading and not listening to lectures.,1
"Avoid at all costs! Will tell you to do things one way and then mark you wrong for doing it. I had to turn in 2 homework assignments late because I was sick and he gave me zeroes on both of them because they were ""late"".",0
Professor Cambic is extremely helpful with assignmetns.  She explains everything well.,1
"He is a great guy but he doesn't give very good instructions. He is very experienced, but I think age is beginning to affect his memory and processing.",0
"Grade is based completely on four tests, so make sure to study. He posts the study guide online, but you need to go to class for the vocab, especially the class right before the test. No homework but he does offer extra credit.",1
"absolute worst professor i have ever had in my life. I had to retake the class because she failed me with a 72. She may or may not be clinically crazy. Her tests are impossible, she is extremely lazy, she gives you one day to do hw. makes you hate microbiology bc shes so awful.",0
"His lectures are fun and interactive, you will enjoy them, they just don't prepare you very well for exams. Need a lot of self studying.",1
Always has a positive attitude and makes the effort to actually get to know her students I always enjoy coming to class. Great teacher choice.,1
Dr Feige is the best. He provides us with many assignments in lecture and lab to improve our grade. I really liked the exams posted on blackboard and the lecture videos.,1
"He took way too long to grade things & never followed the syllabus. His class didn't seem to have any structure or purpose. He often arrived late. He has a tendency to come off as arrogant, rude, &condescending. I asked him roughly how many sources should we use for our paper. He said, ""I shouldn't have to tell a college student that."" Um what??",0
"AWEFUL!! I took Cultural History of Dogs and was SO excited for it.  She totally ruined it by teaching the class as though it was an impossible writing class.  If you can help it, DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS!!",0
"ALL THE TESTS are based on the models available in the lab, but he doesn't use the models to teach, ASK HIM to explain the models & take pictures to practice on your own. Tests are fair & straightforward. Read & do the homework, use review sheets to study. He doesn't use blackboard or power points, lectures are boring, not helpful in my opinion.",0
"Professor Barkey really cares about the students.He goes above and beyond.  Offers extra credit & allows make up if you missed test or quiz.Very helpfull, grades quickly and explains everything until everyone understands. Subject matter is difficult & boring and tests are standard, but if you study you will do well. I wish he taught A & P II.",1
"Jesilow is one of the best teachers I have had; he offers you a chance to make up points on the midterm/final by doing a 1pg essay for each problem missed. Sure he may be rude in class but its b/c he doesn't want students disrupting lecture since it affects learning. I wish I could say more, but I say take him and find out if you like his class.",1
"Prof Zaitsev is a great teacher. 4 tests, he drops the lowest. Do not miss his labs. I didnt have time to read the book, just learnt the lectures ( he gives printouts ).Micro is not easy, dont expect him to explain everything. You ll have a lot of memorization to do.  Do your work- you ll get an A. ",1
Awesome professor. Highly recommend her for COMSTD-2. The group projects were really fun and she gives you a lot of feedback to help you be more comfortable speaking in public.,1
"AMAZING teacher! He really knows his stuff, and his lectures are interesting and thought-provoking. Grade is based entirely on two essay assignments and three exams. The essay assignments are easy, the exams are on the harder side (require very good note-taking). He really wants his students to succeed, and arranges study groups prior to each exam.",1
"Passionate about the subject he teaches, but expects you to work hard.",1
"Dr. Purser is very helpful and highly intelligent.  Although he is extremely smart he does his best to help people understand the material.  His lectures are fun and he encourages class participation.  However, his test are VERY HARD!  When he tells you to read something, write someting down, or to attend a study session you should do it.",1
The class is not really that useful. No one really learns anything directly from this class. I would not recommend unless you already have decent knowledge of everything in the book beforehand,0
Definitely one of the best professors I have ever had. The lectures and classwork are super easy. She provides guided notes which are really helpful for the exams and quizzes. All the information you need is on the guided notes. Currently taking 6 classes and this one is my favorite by far !!!,1
"Great professor. I learned a lot from him. He cares for his students and does a great job presenting the notes. If you study the notes and do well on all HW's, it should be an easy BA. 3 midterms and 1 final. Yes he has an accent, but he's more than willing to help if you ask. Take him if he's an option for you. ",1
"I had this teacher for comp 2.  I was very happy that she was nice about a lot of things and not too strict on papers.  We never had to do in class presentations. She is fair when grading essays and as long as you're not a moron, you should get an A or high B in the class.",1
"Professor Waller is a fantastic professor!!  She is helpful and fun and wants you to get it.  I loved having her be the constant professor during my 2 years while class professors changed every 8-16 weeks.  Looking back, I'd say she was one of my favorite and most encouraging professors in the whole program!  Thanks Professor Waller!",1
in grading papers he LOOKS for ways to take off points...the type of teacher who tries to make you do poorly...also never available for after class help..would strongly NOT recommend this class with him if you have any desire to get above a C,0
"Great prof, subject is pretty difficult. Use a financial calculator, it would help, A LOT.",1
"Falcon has a huge fan club, but he's simply not a good teacher. If you sign up for his class, read the syllabus and you will see what I mean. Frustratingly obtuse man with no problem being ""tough"" (but not really tough, just irrespobsible)",0
Overall one of the best professors I have had in 3 years of college. It is a relatively difficult class but is well worth it. His lectures are very enjoyable and he lets the students get involved.,1
"Took calc 2 with her! It was hard! But the way her class goes made it so easy to understand the material! She isn't an easy A, but she is an A professor! She is great with partial credit and drop quizzes! her office hours were beyond my expectations. She challenged me but made me love maths more! So Possible to get an A if you do the work!",1
"I *LOVE* her. She has forever changed my outlook on Research. I too was *so* afraid of Research, yet on the first day of class, it all melted away. She is so present, and aware and has brought a Human side to Research, that for me can be lacking at times. I definitely see her as a great ally, and mentor:)",1
"A nice lady with very rigid grading criteria. I would say she is an ok teacher, but CALC2 is just a terrible class overall to take.",1
"A solid choice for theology. Definitely not the easiest grader, and lots of reading. Having that said, he was a super chill guy, he was his lectures easy to follow with terms he told you in advance you needed to know. You truly do not have to read anything and you'll get a B.",1
"Professor Hooper is a very straight forward lecturer, very punctual to lectures and while lecturing is always very crystal clear. In your first class you may think he is too pushy, but after two to three lectures you come to understand that he is very nice and clear in teaching. Mark is also easily accessible. ",1
"I had  Historical Writing. This is not the traditional lecture style history course, but is geared towards individual guided research papers. Doing your own research is interesting, but the class itself is pretty boring. We didn't have class each week, just because there is so much research. He is really nice, but can be very bland & boring.",1
I absolutely love Dr. Feige. He is a great teacher and makes the lecture easy to sit through. Biology is a lot to take in but if you cant pass his class that mean you definately didn't try. If you stay on top of your assignments you will pass. He is hands down the best professor to take for biology i promise!,1
"There is quite a lot of reading, but Li gives amazing feedback and cares for the students! Loads of extra credit! The textbook is online and is quite the money saver. Make sure to read and watch all material early so you can get a head start on the assignments. The assignments are hefty with 600 words each. The grade you earn is what you work for",1
actually found him as a hard grader but he gives opportunities when needed. based on midterm and final. He is super passionate about what he is teaching but personally was not interested so much,1
"I took her during the fall while covid was happening and she was not helpful at all. She taught it like we had been it for 20 years like she had. I had to teach myself, not sympathetic about mistakes on her end. Argued with students.",0
The best professor of sociology in the Richland College. Take her and you will never regret. You will learn a lot in this class. I took her in the Maymester and I received A grade. Lot of work but doable.,1
"I have always received an A in every math class I have ever taken. I love math but this professor nearly ruined it for me. Every class is a lecture with note taking but ALL OF THE NOTES ARE WORDS, NO MATH PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED. He made something simple seem extremely confusing and he YELLED LOUDLY at us because of it. I didn't go back. Disrespectful!",0
"One of the most arrogant professors I've ever encountered. Not helpful what so ever, and very condescending. I had a few issues in the course because of a BBLearn error, but said it would be alright and in the end got upset, even though I had outreached to him. I didn't mind the content or the work, it was just his lack of willingness to help.",0
"Wonderful teacher! She takes attendance, but you have 4 skips. There is homework every night, but takes less than 20 minutes to do. She gives a lot of partial credit, which really helps your grade. Tests are pretty easy as long as you study. She was very friendly and lectures were very active and not boring.",1
"Hands down worst prof i've ever had, not sure how he has not been fired. Grades by his judgement, not what questions you answered correctly. Tests you on things he didn't even talk about, and are 10 pages in length. Best of Luck!!",0
"Well I did learn a lot and enjoyed most of the readings. We had three papers and an optional final. All of class is just one big lecture with a small group of students that always participate. One time he was heading towards a biological determinism argument (crazy I know), and I think that was the highlight of my experience as a sociology major ha",1
I dont know why everyone makes a big deal about Professor Drake being too hard. Its probably because he is one of the few professors who is actually legit here at the university of Montana.I get A's on all his tests. The key is going to class and making distinctions behind main actors in the readings. Not a class for deadbeats who only want easyA's,1
He's very rude but his work is extremely easy. The majority of the time he will let class out early. He does a review prior to exams. Every question is worded the same as the exam so there's no surprises.,1
Great professor! Loves chemistry and is very helpful. She also has a good sense of humor. I definitely recommend going to class because chemistry can be a very hard subject.,1
"Very easy professor. Almost too easy. Very plain powerpoint lectures, followed by videos. Short online homework assignments. Some miscellaneous projects thrown in. This class kind of scrapes the surface of different personal finance activities. Very low-stress class.",1
this prof's #1 goal is to make his students life a living nightmare. avoid at all cost,0
Professor Rosenberg takes long to get things graded and would not fix your grade when there is an error. He will also not care about your grades which is the most irritating part. You should consider yourself lucky if he responds to your email but his responses are useless just like he is. Overall an easy class but a crappy professor.,0
She's great as a person but our grades were based on two major group projects that I wasn't expecting. The first one she chose our groups and it wasn't great but overall a solid teacher,1
"The professor taught an online course that was not ADA or 508 compliant. The course had only five assignments in the grade-boo and absolutely no online discussions. If the course ended on a Monday, no assignments were graded until the Saturday before, two days before the course ended.",0
"Kathy was a great professor. In class, we discussed real-life topics that were relevant and interesting. There were quite a few assignments and quizzes along with journals due every few weeks all of which were very easy. It doesn't matter if you miss a few things because she offers tons of extra credit and points just for showing up to class.",1
Makes you earn your grades.,1
Easy A!!!!! Easy discussion boards and easy current events. Just follow the criteria. The quizzes were dirt easy and there's no exams and no finals. If you miss an assignment it'll be hard to bring your grade back up. Just do everything on time and follow the syllabus and you'll pass with an A.,1
Programming was fun.,1
Online homework and lots of it. Tests have too much material on them gives review for them but they are not very helpful. Class could be easy but she makes it hard.,0
"Adelle is a really sweet professor. You can tell she is interested and knowledgeable about what she's teaching. The quizzes, midterm, and final are all pretty straight-forward, just make sure you take good notes from the textbook and lectures.",1
"I took this class online and the requirements for the course were incredibly clear from day one. Four assignments due a week, for each chapter, none of which were horribly difficult. Read the chapter, do the assignments, and you should be fine. Professor responds to emails promptly provided the answer hasn't already been answered prior. Easy class.",1
Ms. Crowley was the best professor I've ever had. That's not an exaggeration. She will sacrifice her time to help you until you know it. She taught me much much more than just chemistry in the two semesters I had her. I've told my friends they need to take her even if they don't need chem. I was sad to see her leave WSU. She was an inspiration!,1
"Her class was very interesting but, she is a hard grader, she gave me B after really hard work. I will never take with her any future classes. By the way, no one in my class took a full mark.",1
"She is so awesome, took her online, she gives great feedback! Plus if you don't understand or mess up on something be open and honest with her and she will give you the opportunity to fix it!",1
Professor Hartman is a great professor and such a sweet lady. There is a lot of reading and the tests are all open ended questions for the most part so you really have to know the books. Easy A as long as you attend/participate and read.,1
"I took Geography 1 online and he made it very easy to pass his class! All you need to do is participate in the discussion questions and do the weekly assignments. He gives you a study guide before the tests, just complete them and literally all of the questions are on the test. Super easy class if you are looking for science class for your GE.",1
i took two spanish courses with her and she was so easy and this is coming from someone who really struggles to learn languages. I hate learning new languages but she made it a great experience.,1
This class was intresting and layed out really well.,1
"Three papers, but he is unhelpful when you ask for advice. He will grade lower on papers written on subjects he doesn't like, so write about the assigned books if you want to get an A. He is unclear with his instructions and he mumbles a lot during class. His lectures are irrelevant and unhelpful in class. Hard class/grader, not recommended.",0
"very tough...lots of reading and writing. helpful, but an impossible grader",0
"I've taken Intro to Psych., Stress Management Psych., and now Abnormal Psych. with Professor Trombley. She is particular about what she expects from students but it's nothing unreasonable, you simply have to read instructions carefully. I love that she quizzes weekly because I am able to retain more info this way. Take her class, its great.",1
"Mrs. Peters is a well organized teacher and is always prepared for class but her teaching methods are horrible. She teaches everything the long way. Alot of our class had issues with her method of teaching. Not very helpful when a question is asked, always gives general answers. Very sarcastic attitude. Not very helpful. Would not recommend her!",0
No Comments,0
"super irresponsible, not good ppl to communicate",0
"Alyce was an amazing professor, especially when you are taking a course online.  She was caring and compassionate.  She gave great feedback and in lieu of test for our midterm, we did a group project.  Working collaboratively helped tremendously and really connected people in the class.  I highly reccommend her!!!",1
No Comments,0
This class is hard. It's unfortunate that it's a required class. Definitely don't take it online/over summer because you are gonna hate doing the work on your own time. There's an ungodly amount of substance to this class almost to the point where it just feels unnecessary. I'm sure Calkins is a nice lady but it's just too much work.,1
Not a bad person but insisted that we brought the $120 text book and that if we didn't we would be required to drop the class. Upon buying the book a week later he made the class online and you were not longer required to have the book.,0
"Ferguson is a typical old fashioned and opinionated professor, and he is definitely a character. I found the class and content interesting, and his personality contributed to that.",1
Got A's on every exam yet got a B for the final grade because I missed numerous clicker quizzes and in-class activities.. material not hard but you HAVE to go to class to get an A...,0
"Very easy class. Easy quizzes. Attendance was taken everyday but it didn't really have an affect on grade. Fun class. Not hard at all. Projects were not hard at all, given a lot of class time to work on projects. Always accessible before or after class. Would definitely recommend taking this class.",1
"Participate. Read the chapter for the quizzes, which he tells you(chapter&day of quiz). Writing assignments are 3pages. Study guides for the tests are posted online. Do everything & youll get a good grade & pass.",1
"Does not really teach anything, assigns lots of reading and then has the students discuss it among themselves in class (and it often seems like she does not know what the readings are actually about).  The research papers that each LSFY-103 class is required to do are not research papers in her course - they are literary analysis papers.",0
"Dr. Hale is one of the best professors I've had at APU. If you do the work, study for his quizzes, and pay attention and actually attend class it should be a piece of cake. Reading the material is a must! He's entertaining and sweet as a person. I would one-hundred percent take Dr. Hale again!",1
"I tooked the 115 and 125 class with Mrs,Wells. Very good teacher be prepare to do lots of homework. you want an ""A"" she will make you work for it. Her lectures are very clear she is very passionate about her job and helping her students.I would take her for all my math classes if I could.",1
"Prof. Weber is the definition of laziness. No lesson plan, he teaches out of the book. He makes up problems that backfire in the middle of lecture. (frustrating) He assigns most of odd problems, but class notes are not enough to encounter the difficult problems. You must teach your self and speed lots of hours in the math success center.",0
"Osoba is a really nice teacher, but I would personally never take this class again. I would only recommend taking this class if you are an economics major or you have a love for it. The test are really hard and you have to memorize everything. You won't understand any of the study guides unless you go to him for help. Take it online if you can!",1
"This is the worst teacher anyone can take, she does not teach the class. Her exams are super difficult and if the work you solved are not her way she marks it wrong. Do not take this class with this professor she is rhe worst. She is very rude and disrespectful. Will make you feel like you dont know anything. Rudest professor I met.",0
"i got a B+ in this class and did so much work , only missed 3 classes and made up 2, and did extra bonus out of clsas work.  she gave someone a C+... she's moody and weird. avoid her if possible",0
Super Sweet Professor. Relates real world and the textbook. I highly recommend taking Positive Psych w/ her. Take Notes and her tests are all multiple choice. Def take her for psych!! :),1
"Phenomenal professor one of the best I've ever had at Albany! Very quick to respond to emails, and always extremely helpful. Lectures are the usual, but just follow his online slides and you'll do fine. Material is somewhat tough, but the actual data mining Python scripts you write are really fun.   Would definitely take another class with Chen. ",1
"I like Professor Duina's teaching style a lot, he always encourage student to participate in class and the homework assignment is really ON POINT and clear. Trust me you'll start to appreciate his teaching techniques after the semester ends.",1
absolutely ridiculous grader.  he teaches ANTHROPOLOGY yet tries to grade everything else.. unfairly.,0
"Very bad teacher. Seemed to care little about what students thought and cared little about helping them with any problem they would come to her with. For a class on race and ethnicity, a class where people should b able to be open with their thoughts, she was very narrow-minded in her approach on the topic.",0
best teacher ive ever had. She makes class interesting and is a very intelligent woman.,1
"Horrible teacher! The textbook basically taught you how to do math. He did one example of a lecture and the rest was up to you to figure it out. I love math, but he made me hate it.",0
Teacher was really leniant and helpful in certain situations.,1
"Mrs. Shelby is super nice. Her grading is very relaxed when it comes to the 2 papers and presentation you do over the semester. And the day before her tests, she'll go over everything you need to study. Also, there isn't really any need to buy a book for her class. She's definately an easy A.",1
TAKE HER! Mrs. Elfring is such a sweet professor. I took honors english 102 class with her and it is super easy. Only 4 papers plus the standard 10-12 research paper for your final. Super easy and she also gives a lot of extra credits. Replies right away to emails.,1
"Great professor! 100% recommended! I learn a lot during this class. Do the discussion board assignment early, and try to write more. The extra credit will boost your grade a lot (even from B to A).",1
"She's actually the nicest professor I've ever had. She really cares for her students and really helps you in order to do your best. There are no tests and essays are not bad at all. I really recommend to take her, she's literally the sweetest. def recommend",1
"I think this guy's a genius.  And he is one of the few professors whos jokes are actually really funny.  HE says a lot of real things as if he should have been a social worker, mentor, or minister or something. I felt him. Unfortunately he's a little stricter now that people tried to take advantage of his benevolence. not hard if you take notes",1
"This teacher is nice, but is not a good teacher. Doesnt seem like anybody in the class is doing well, pretty bad when the class avg on tests is a 42%...take another teacher if you want to pass",0
CRAZY WOMAN BUT an easy teacher.,0
Do not take his course please. It is terrible! Tough grader,0
One assignment due per week. Its required to post 4 times on the weekly discussion board. That gets quite annoying especially since she takes off points if you aren't detailed in your posts. Tests aren't bad. Its only required to post certain questions form the homework so you won't have to do them all.,1
Helpful and is great at coaching. Expects a lot though and pushes you hard.,1
"Truly enjoyed the course! Well prepared, always willing to hold extra office hours. Prof. Katselis has a deep knowledge of the course material and he can easily simplify difficult concepts, his teaching style helped a lot!",1
"She's so bad that she doesn't deserve an explanation, just take my word for it and don't take her classes. Spare yourselves.",0
I do not appreciate the cursing and belittling that I experienced in this class.  Scanlon was completely improfessional with questionable ethics.  Even going to the dean did little to change his behavior.,1
Don't take her... she is horrible!!!,0
"He's the best prof at Blinn. He's extremely experienced, very intelligent, and very hilarious and kind. He made me love the topic and I learned things that will stick with me for a long time. Cares about animals, cares about his students. I can't say enough kind words about him. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1
- Provuding great coverage of the material,1
"The projects are not difficult. Lectures are long but he answers your questions. Tests and quizzes are hard if you don't study his sample questions and quizes. However, you need to study more for his final. He curves but if he can't do anything for you he will let you know earlier so you still can drop the class.",1
"He is very smart professor, he knows the material very well, be ready for all the pop quizes and do not miss the class otherwise u miss the quizes and do great in final and u will get A.",1
"Sean's class was very standard, and you will need the book to get through it. He's very understanding if you need help with something in the material. Do the homework, it helps a lot. I wouldn't advise a morning class, I kept wanting to fall asleep.",1
"Best teacher! He's crystal clear, helpful and his classes are never boring. He has a lot of experience and really knows his stuff. I highly recommend him!",1
"Dr. Guerriero is incredibly kind! Her passion for the subject matter is always evident.  While her class can be very boring and redundant, it is a breeze, and she makes it very easy to pass. There were 2 easy quizzes and the final, which was not cumulative and taken online.",1
Boring. Do not expect her to answer your questions in a clear manor. The tests are straight from the book and you only have 3 or 4. Not hard at all and I hate studying. However she expects you to turn in a 10 pg essay & powerpoint on a group project at the end of the semester! Pls drop if you can not dedicate personal time to meet w/ your group!,1
"Amazing Prof! Very Tenured, and genuinely interested in teaching students about the topics she loves.  Very enjoyable class to be in.  Explains things many times, and in many different ways so everyone understands, but not in such a way where it becomes too repetitive and boring.  Once again, awesome prof, shes my favourite! highly suggested!!",1
"Love Dr. K. She is very knowledgeable and has lots of experiences. She is very helpful and always available. She knows when you're BSing, so some effort has to be applied in class, but she's willing to answer questions and offer guidelines for expectations. Wish I had her again!",1
"He is super funny and I enjoy going to this class. He only assigns a midterm and a final, which are in forms of take home essays.  He makes class interesting, I recommend taking.",1
"MWF exams were 5-7 questions, about 20 points, average never exceeded 50%. Average gets curved to an 80% but it's not a bell curve, so one bad exam screws you over big time. The final was 2 hours and out of 200 pts with same level of difficulty so many felt inadequately prepared. Sweetheart as a person, very difficult to follow in lecture though.",0
I LOVED LISA! She was an awesome teacher. Every time I would turn in an assignment she would provide the best feedback. I knew what to change for my final draft. She is TERRIFIC! Take her if you have the chance!!!,1
Great prof. Easily the best prof I've had for online teaching. His resources are actually useable and couldn't ask for more not having access to a microscope. Highly recommend Dr. Gaidies.,1
"Even though I never have written so much for a course, my writing ability increased tremendously because of the course outline! You can ask my wife!",1
"Professor Looney is the BOMB.  He is a truly good teacher, and really explains material thoroughly.  He is also absolutely hilarious and makes me laugh every class.  I would highly recommend him and this course to anyone - I am far from a science-lover, but this class has helped me enjoy, I repeat, ENJOY science!!",1
Just take notes during the lecture. Easiest gen ed for Fine Arts.,1
"Covers topic well. Exams are reasonable. Also, he's really funny.",1
"Erika is energetic, accessible, intelligent, and well spoken. She knows her materials and is the best at conveying it. She makes class more fun than any class I've ever had while still getting the materials through to you. She also creates a very, very friendly classroom environment making it very comfortable to present. Take her!!",1
"I had Dr. Thomas her very first semester at Tech. When I tell you this was my favorite class so far in my college career, please believe me. You can tell that she loves teaching. She is also a vet herself, so it's very helpful to get this kind of knowledge from her. There are easy quizzes every week, so take advantage of them! The tests are easytoo",1
"Right now she is it for A&P lectures so you have no choice. Her teaching style is very hard to follow, doesn't make it easier to understand.  Her testquizes are hard.  Feel like she is trying to trick you. If you have to take her use other supplementary material to help you pass this class. You will have to spend ALOT of time studying.",0
"Christine was personable and helped foster a sense of community. A huge part of CYCW is encouraging growth, empowerment, and support to the forefront. Christine displayed these elements in her teaching.",1
"He goes very fast and it is hard to follow along. The practice problems will help you keep up, so do them. He ends up curving the entire class at the end, so if you are not happy with your grade don't worry because it will go up.",0
I started off with an F but i immediately went for help during her office hours. she can explain complex ideas extremely simple and it was a joy to have her as my professor. Before each exams she prepares the class with a practice exam so make sure you complete that before the test. Great professor if you want to learn the beauty of algebra!!,1
"Falk is a very sweet man. His class was the hardest class I have ever taken. He knows his class is hard so he curves the class but even then I still struggled to get a C. He is extremely smart but I think he struggled to teach the material to undergrads. If you take his class, be ready to devote most of your time to it.",1
"Often misunderstood: In class, she is not only teaching the subject but also a very singular conception of ""the professor"" and of the philosophy of teaching, through a self-conceived postmodern performatic method, that makes use of facial gesture, body language, and vocal expression, plus sartorial and make-up props: A truly revolutionary method.",1
Class can be boring. People don't usually listen and are doing other things. All assignments are in the syllabus. He wants you to be in class but you can miss and still do well. Tests aren't bad if you read the material beforehand. Lots of interacting with classmates. Lots of assignments but are easy. Easy A. He's a nice guy and cares.,1
amazing.,1
"She has high expectations and makes you talk a lot. However, she is fair and what you put in is what you get out of it. She wants you to ask questions, but they can not be questions that you can answer yourself from reading.",1
She is the best art teacher I've ever had. She gives really good suggestions and has a very good eye for what needs work. She has taught me so many new techniques and has helped me navigate things that I struggle with. She's very kind and won't embarrass you if your art isn't the best.,1
Professor Stevenson was an amazing lab professor. She answers any questions during lab and is available at her office hours with help studying for practicals. She is very sweet and funny and I'd recommend her for lab or lecture.,1
"Absolutely one of my favorite professors. Take him only if you are able to work hard. I learned so much from him and this class and I recommend it to any non science major. Really interesting stuff. He cares about what he teaches, just be prepared to put work in. also, he's always up to smoke a cigarette after class.",1
"Prof. Sun is not the right choice if you are not going to really participate. You need to read the materials in advance, prepare for pop quiz and do the homework for a good understanding of the whole thing. It is easy to get A since he curved a lot. But you will get TOTALLY LOST if you are not to spend time on the course.  A cool and kind Professor",1
Doug is a great teacher.  He is friendly and has really mastered teaching drawing. He helps you strive to be a better artist.,1
She's great! She's hilarious and fun. The class is really easy if you put the work in and read the textbook. She's pretty fair.,1
"Super based on memorizing for this specific class, but Erica has a lot of fieldwork experience that is truly interesting",1
"Professor Thompson is the best professor I have had at USC. I was retaking 322b and he completely helped build my confidence back up in the course. His lectures are clear and concise, he isn't trying to trick you, and his exams are straightforward. He always answers questions and is very helpful outside of class. I would definitely take him again!",1
cours facile si t'es à l'aise à l'oral,1
"Great professor. She is an expert in her field and gives interesting material.  Lots of group work but its very simple.  No tests but a lot to get out of the class.  One reading each week, 3 essays, and group projects.",1
I overall enjoyed this class because the assignments were straightforward and interesting. I just didn't enjoy the video project because I felt like no one in my group cared enough to help.,1
"Professor Kiesewetter is the best chemistry professor in the department, and quite possible the best professor I've ever had. I did pretty subpar in Gen Chem 1 and 2, and even I understood every lecture she ever explained in this class (organic chemistry). Lectures were thought provoking, and the exams were very fair. I would absolutely recommend",1
"The lectures were very lucid and we often got let out early. She gives a lot of in-class extra credit as well. During the lab portion of the class she took us through the grader projects. Overall, she was a really nice teacher and this was a low effort class.",1
J Allen is by far the GREATEST teacher i have ever had he is the coolest and hes really nice and really knows his stuff....Ryan,1
"Nancy is an incredible teacher.  I have never worked so hard in a class for such a low grade, yet knowing I learned so much.  I always had the feeling that we spoke a slightly different language, as my essays (which I did well with in every other class I have ever taken), seemed to always be taken differently than I meant them.  But regardless, I learned so much and admired her tremendously.",1
"Extremely dry, makes everything unnecessarily confusing, and does not adequately prepare you for tests. She turns an interesting subject matter into pure torture. Does not care about student success. I didn't understand a single thing happening in this class.",0
The nicest physical science professor Ive ever met at cal. He cares so much and is more than willing to accommodate and be flexible with you. The class is really interesting but you have to want to learn the material. The only negative is that assignments sometimes have really unclear grading policies and take a while to get back,1
"Honestly Dr. Monroe was the best professor I've ever had! If you want to take an interesting class and an awesome teacher, take any of Dr. Monroe's courses, I guarentee if you show up for class, you won't be disappointed! Do the work and study for the exams and you'll get an A. His lectures are amazing too, they keep you interested and entertained.",1
"Dr. Goldman is a great history teacher. She enjoys having passionate and important discussions about history. Her tests are not difficult, and you don't have to memorize any dates. As long as you follow directions and put in effort, you will get an A.",1
"if you have to avoid one thing at UConn is this guy. yes you might try your best to understand the class but taking him will take the interest of math out of you. its a no no, never take him, you you will be clue less the all semester and get bad grade.",0
Easy to get along with. Encourages class participation in his lectures. Gives plenty of opportunities to make up work or get extra points. Always willing to help troubleshoot or give advice on assignments.,1
"Has a decent sense of humor, but is not the clearest speaker or lecturer. Seemed to delegate a lot of the homework problems to GSIs, and it was often frustrating. Tests are not the most well-written ones but are still fair.",1
Michelle hunt is an absolute queennnnnnn. lots of lecturing but she makes everything make sense. will take questions in class and answers them thoroughly. literally the cutest little lady like 10/10 would want her as my grandma,1
"Difficult to please. Makes his students work hard. However those who pass his tests, will appreciate his style of teaching after finishing the class. For those who are new to his class - do your best, and you'll have no problems writing ANY essay or paper in the future. If something is not clear ask lots of questions!!",1
"Essay prompts are pretty ridiculous but not impossible to get done. In-class presentations do not help in any way, but she seems to think they do. Journal Entries aren't entirely difficult, just a waste of time and unnecessary. Not bad, but I would NEVER take her class again. Terrible teacher.",0
Very caring and enthusiastic teacher that gives some easy points in assignments. Labs are manageable to get A's if you put in a little effort. There are two tests throughout the entire semester that make up a good portion of your grade and they are pretty hard if you don't study (and even if you do). Study is needed as there is a lot of material.,1
Awesome. Nothing else needs to be said...,1
A very great German class. Class wasn't too difficult with many quizzes and written assignments to make it so your grade isn't dependent only a few things. Homework each class but it's easy and just checked for completion. As long as you show up and engage you'll do well.,1
"If you must take this course, here's some advice: DO NOT listen to what the TA and prof say about failing the midterm-I swear they WANT students to freak out. All that is difficult is the format. If you complete the hw and understand it, the exams are simply re-worded hw probs. Do practice problems and don't depend on excel formulas to do them.",0
"Be ready to dive into the readings! They are absolutely mandatory, and you will be lost if you do not read them. Especially when it comes to the tests, since the questions are not obvious ones. But overall, a nice, very interesting professor.",1
"He might know the subject but has very poor explanatory skills, with a strong Greek Accent that you would barely understand what he's saying. NJIT has no other professor teaching this class so you are out of luck. My friends took this class before me and told me about but NJIT doesn't give a choice when it comes to his classes (696&647)",0
"This course is a hybrid course, meaning that its a class you go to to simply do work online. MyMathLab helps a lot in refreshing your memory on past techniques and the professor is always there to help. However, he makes it clear that he doesnt teach the material.",1
"This class was all over the place. The HW questions out of the book were fine, but he gave no direction when it can to using R. He likes asking word problems on the tests, but beware of curve balls. He tried to help us with points in the form of in class assignments, but it can only help so much.",0
Professor Chavez is a nice lady and sends out reminders for when work is due. The only way to fail this class is by not doing the work and by not studying.,1
"Professor Nuneville is a solid choice when taking ethics. I know ethics can be a boring subject to some, however taking it with her will make it better. She uses mindtap for all homework assignments, tests are open-book and she brings in guest speakers. You get points for showing up to class, but it can hurt your grade if you skip.",1
"Had him his first semester at BYU--he's replacing Dr. Toronto temporarily.  Extremely nice guy who really cares about getting the students to think and learn.  Class material was interesting, and we did more than just read and listen to lectures.  Tests were challenging but fair.",1
"If you want to skate by with an easy class, don't take this one. There are mixed feelings about whether people like Maureen as a professor, she will challenge you and will not let you get away with half ass effort. She expects you to expect the best from yourself and won't let you slide. If you work hard, you will leave her class a better student.",1
"She was horrible, she treated and 1101 class like a grad class..she doesnt care about anyone and will willfully fail the entire class.",0
"Sias is a wonderful professor. She's obsessed with podcasts, particularly Serial and This American Life, and will make you listen to them in class a few times. I didn't mind listening to the podcasts as they were interesting and a nice break from normal lecture or work. There's a video interview project, so get on the ball with it, and a paper.",1
he was a great teacher. film and short fiction is a really great class and he really loves what he's doing. he's very passionate about it and will def be up to helping you when you need it. and he lets you hand in your 1pg paper late which is nice :-) i would def recommend him!!! take his class!!!!,1
Excellent teacher. Full of energy and gets the class to participate. Anyone who fails this class should not even be in school. The best teacher I have had so far.,1
"A very friendly teacher who is very passionate about what he teaches. Most of your time will be spent watchig documentaries about historical figures or events, and I promise you, they will never be uninteresting. Our main grades were papers written based on the things we watched, which are very easy to write if you pay attention to the videos.",1
"Great professor! He knows his material well. His tests can be a bit lenghty, but they are doable. The jokes are one of the best parts of the class.",1
"Be aware this professor does not appreciate student opinions. If you are not a mind reader, she will completely shut down your comments. This class is not hard but her condescending attitude makes students apprehensive to participate in class discussion. She did not give us a chance to evaluate her, but instead insisted we do it on her time.",1
He'll provide more info on tests and topics if you ask. Knows his stuff and the in class discussions are enjoyable. Do the homework and study well. Some extra credit opportunities on tests.,1
"Professor Benjamin is caring and very knowledgeable, however, his lectures are difficult to understand. If you are not willing to teach yourself you wont pass. Doing the practice test questions and going to math lab helped the most.",1
"15% curve on exams, lotsa extra credit, extra credit exam, 2 attempt optional exam that drops lowest grade, answers any and all questions with much depth post class and  well during class. Lectures are def way worse than  Sarathy but Sarathy def isnt better since both have same book and tell you to study the whole chapter but Sarathy doesn't curve.",1
She was always willing to assist and acted with a  sense of urgency on behalf of all of her students. She was always on time and worked well with us as students regarding deadlines (I took her intro to language/linguistics fall session two). Most people work full time and attend school and maintain a family and she was respectful in every aspect.,1
"Prof. Miller is so sweet and amazing! She truly cares about her students and rewards you for your honest and hard work. her feedback on your grades is out of this world! She is a very good communicator. I held an A the entire class, and had two opportunities for extra credit and got a total of 1,070 out of a possible 1000 points. Awesome teacher!!!",1
"I took his honors music class, and he is the nicest professor. His lectures focus specifically on what is on the test, and he does a great review before the test. If you listen to his lecture and read some of the textbook he points out before the test you'll be fine. On top of that, he made the final optional.",1
"She is great!! Lectures are good and material is interesting! you will have to buy online quiz and attendance program (TopHat) to take the class, and a big chunk of grade is based on attendance. She doesn't let you take notes on computer. But overall great professor, who is easily accessible outside of class. Would take again!!",1
She's a very good teacher. recommend for anyone who has trouble with reading and writing because she helps in those aspects.,1
"The bulk of information for exams comes from a print out that he hands out before he even covers the material, so it's hard not to know what to study. He wants you to participate, so make sure you do the homework and readings before class, it WILL bump your average up significantly. Honestly, I thought he was great. I got an easy A",1
"It was the best experience of my college career taking classes with and working as a student assistant for Dr Christine Ott Hopkins. Even after moving on from her community college classes into university, I have not had a better experience or as much fun learning than with her. I wish she taught all my classes in university. Go Christine!",1
"Really cool guy, obviously very knowledgeable in many fields, especially those he teaches. Electric personality, holds classroom attention with ease. His lectures are always provocative, sometimes intentionally uncomfortable as he delves into sensitive topics. However, the class was too easy and he had a tendency to ramble is lecture.",1
"She teaches an English class, but the course content is not English related. Her feedback is not helpful, it's rude. The work she makes you do is useless for the class. I thought I signed up for English, but it was all history related content.",0
"The people complaining didnt try, welcome to university!!! You put in effort she will too! Great teacher, you dont take her class seriously, she wont take you seriously!!! Learned a ton!!!",1
"Lectures were always interesting and I always left feeling inspired and deeply enlightened about American literature. So while Dr. Nelson is a great teacher, he's not a good professor. Very unapproachable, impersonal, can be rude, comments on papers are not very helpful, and he is an incredibly tough grader. I'd be wary about taking him again.",1
Honestly one of the best professors I have ever had...was nominated for instructor of the year soon after I had him.  Take this professor whenever possible!,1
"Covers the basics well, but the class is really easy using some logic and common sense.",1
"Quite honestly, you'll hate her at first. And she knows that. But Dr. Richards taught me more than I've learned in every college class I've taken combined. Give it a couple weeks and you'll realize everything she does, she does because she wants you to succeed as a teacher.",1
"Literally made an account on RMP to say that Barry Thompson is the best professor I've ever had. Would recommend to anyone taking Ochem B - he's seriously the most caring, respectful, and ""on top of it"" person.",1
"I did not learn a thing in his class. WAY too easy. All he did was talk about what t was like working for the LAPD. He let use our book for the tests, so what's the point in studying. All I did was write own what he said I didn't even et a note book. I just used index cards..  Overall, SUPER easy.",1
"My favorite professor ever!!! I love Dr: Ferreira, she explains everything so clearly and always available for your questions. Make lecture fun and keep you interested. She is extremely caring, attentive, and patient with her students. If you want to take this class, I highly suggested.",1
"Mrs. Hanratty has been one of the best teachers I've had, but she is not easy. The criteria for her papers are tough ad she is not an easy grader. However, she really teaches you the subject without just slapping an A onto your paper. She gives lots of helpful feedback. I would recommend her to anyone looking for a little more than just an easy A.",1
"good professor but his tests are much harder than others out there.  problems on tests are difficult and advanced as if everyone in the class is upper level finance major.  doesnt explain well - had to teach it to myself.  try to take someone else, but if you get ervin its not the end of the world.  problem is you need C to get credit - hard to do.",1
"Lectures very well and explains the material the best way possible, but makes the exams quite different from his lectures. It was difficult to study for his exams because of this. The Final Exam was brutally difficult and had problems we had never seen before. Thankfully, the class was curved quite a bit.",1
"This class seemed a little too difficult for a 101 class, and she definitely had big issues with clarity for me. Helpfulness was sort of hit and miss but she would at least try to help. Would not recommend taking her for your first college English class if you can help it.",0
"I definitely won't recommend to take his claas. He's boring, mean. He won't even let you drink water in class or put a hat on during icy weather. Your grade based on 4 exams. Pass 4 you pass the class, fail one and average on three you'll fail the class.",0
"The people who rated Arevalo for their 104 classes probably did poorly and are no longer bio majorsI've taken 3 classes with her and all 3 of them (including 104) were an easy A if you showed up, took notes, and read the text. The exams are very clear and she was always willing to explain anything further if you asked",1
"Jim is honestly one of the only professors in the department that I have had that I feel like knows about the field. I learned more in his class than most of my others combined. He is also one of the most caring individuals I've ever met. His tests are very hard, and he gives a lot of homework. Do your work and youll pass.",1
"If you struggle with math, try to avoid if possible. He is a very smart man, but skips a lot of mathematical steps  that you normally need to piece it all together.  You need to take the initiative and learn outside of class with his notes, textbook and tutors.  Tests are hard but fair. ",0
"She's a wonderful person. I actually picked her to be my academic advisor, so I work pretty closely with her, she's really helped me figure out my future. Class wise, the other reviews are accurate. You do have to read your text book beforehand. There are weekly quizzes. She does grade hard. There is no makeup work. Do NOT let this scare you away!",1
"Dr. Birkett was by far my favorite teacher as a psychology major at NAU. She enlightened me to the amazing world of psychopharm and physiology of psych. She gave me confidence to pursue a career as a clinical psychologist! She is a very dedicated teacher, has amazing classes, and really cares about her students!",1
"Took this online over the summer... It was extremely difficult without lecture, because the structure of class is to just do a ton of readings and then answer questions on Skype and write an essay about the readings (at the end of each week). It may work for some people, but I feel like I didn't learn that much or get a good grade.",0
"The only class of mine this semester that I cannot wait to go. 11/10 would recommend it. His enthusiasm makes you want to study and learn in the class, always open for a good discussion and a conversation.",1
"Wouldn't necessarily call this class Beginning Greek 2, it was more like Learning Fun with Professor Esposito. We did learn a lot about Greek, but during the 2 hour lectures he would constantly spin out into digressions, all of which were extremely interesting and you could tell how passionate he was on the subject.",1
"Intro to Public Health. Took it over the summer. VERY clear expectations. 10% atten, 10% quizzes, 10% hw, 20% each for MT and Final, 15% each for group proj and research paper. Grading is not bad, but no late work accepted. VERY easy to contact through email. VERY helpful in terms of instruction. Won't give free grades. Straight-forward attitude.",1
This class was easy he put his old exams on blackboard. They were basically the same test as what he put online. Quizzes were not hard. You would have to try to fail.,1
Intro computer class but the teacher made the class interesting.,1
"Professor Smith is such a special breed of person: creative and compassionate, and always full of insight. He is so good at getting his students engaged with concepts and ideas that could otherwise scare others away, and never shows anything but respect and appreciation for any questions or requests you may have. Highly recommended.",1
"I took this class online(virtual) and she go very fast over the homework problems. It wasn't mandatory that you participated online. She made us meet at the school to take the exams,which I didn't understand since it's a virtual online class.",1
"Class participation: mandatory. More writing than Ive done for any English class. Weekly articles & book Q&A to be submitted online/in person. 2 major written projects. Tests: pretty tough, even if you studied. Actual core info was super interesting learning about why people believe & do what they do, but I was constantly stressed out all semester",1
I LOVE Dr. Braun. I don't know what the commenter was talking about when it comes to clarity.  She gives you specific things to work on and will work with you whenever you need help. Extremely passionate and knowledgeable.  This will not be an easy A but it is worthwhile in my opinion.,1
"As lovable as he is effective, Morales teaches Japanese from its foundations and has the experience to answer just about any question you could have. Classes are densely packed with information and timed perfectly, and homework is picked down to the individual question to help solidify learning. I eagerly look forward to JPN 2.",1
Take this teacher at your own risk!! Day 1: 35+ students Day of Final: 7 students total. his teaching doesnt make sense and he Laughs at his own jokes. His class is based on  eassays. Students dropped the class because they knew he wasn't going to pass anyone.,0
"I would strongly recommend going with any other professor for this class. Extremely random and heavy lectures, notes will be all over the place. Most of the tests and quizzes have questions either never covered, strongly opinionated, or way more specific than emphasized. No assisting material to study, expected to research unknown topics.",0
Not an easy A but truly learned a lot. Tests were straight from his lectures. Lectures were great and made a 4 hour class durable. I would recommend this professor. Take good notes and study them for the exams and you should be fine!,1
Great teacher and a great class. Can seem harsh at first but is a wonderful person once you get to know her and get into the class. DOGS in every class.,1
"Went into this class regretting taking him. He grades HARD, but tells you exactly what he expects. He gives feedback if requested, but after the assignment is already due. Class got easier half way through. Final was a joke, it's his reward for making it through his class. if you don't like work, don't take him. But he notices who tries.",1
"Barely listened in his class, was pretty boring, everything is on slides, final and midterm are just papers, APA FORMAT, cool guy, just really really really really really really really boring lectures... so yeah have fun with that",1
"May is a great guy, but as a teacher, very boring. Do not take as an 8 am class. You will be fighting to stay awake. He is willing to help at all times, but be sure to stay on schedule with tests and projects.",1
"Really enjoyed this class! Super well structured and the tutorials are actually really helpful in understanding reading material. We covered LOTS of content in lecture, however there were podcast lectures available to help incase students were absent or needed to review a slide for their notes. Overall a very encouraging prof and great experience.",1
"My man Dr. Hazell was the best professor I've ever met. His tests stem DIRECTLY from his stunning and electrifying lectures! I'm not that much of a history gal, but he made it so interesting and made me actually want to come to class. There is no homework other than reviewing notes, and there's only one paper! Amazing professor 10/10.",1
"An amazing human being. Empathetic, caring, knowledgeable, and unbelievably nice. Ask any psych student how great he is - Matt is beloved by all. He's one of the most supportive teachers you'll ever meet and is always there for you if you need help understanding content. Just a gem. A conversation with him boosts my mood and brightens my day.",1
"Professor Swift is a kind, patient and a very logic oriented professor. Our grades were dependant on test grades only, where our final grade counted only the best 4 of the 5 tests that where given. Homework was not collected, no pop quizes, and very clear on what he wanted us to learn.",1
"she doesn't like your ideas unless it is within her genre of writing. And it isn't real if it's comedy.  She is the worst teacher, there is no support or guidance. It's her way or a failing grade. She is not fit to teach because she doesn't know how to share knowledge or accept others ideas. It's a terrible learning environment.",0
Wonderful teacher! You can tell he wants you to pass,1
I took her Tuesday night class and she was awesome. She makes the class interesting and fun. You will have a test every class  for the first couple weeks but as long as you are in class or read the 3 chapters you will get an A. Also she gave out study guides that are practically identical to the test. Take Her!!!!!!!,1
"Menasco is an awesome professor. He does interesting work with very visual forms of math. He's super chill, but is good at knowing if you don't know what is going on.",1
"this has to be the easiest lab ever, just show up to class, he won't let you leaven unless your paper is a 90. Automatic A!",1
"NOT GOOD. Avoid this professor if possible. Manages to make incredibly interesting material VERY dull. Very nice lady, not a good prof.",0
"Thomas was our Physi lab Prof. Loved him! This guy truly has a beautiful soul. He is super laid-back, nice, funny & an all around great professor. Very knowledgable, made class fun, responds to emails, is chill on due dates, answers questions, always offered help & takes the time to explain the materials well Also did Zoom after shifting online",1
"Nina is my favourite professor I've had. She is hilarious, whether or not she even tries. I have taken two of her classes (211+314) and never once been bored. You can really tell she loves to teach, cares about her students and of course, loves philosophy. Her classes are up beat and engaging, but as a side effect she will probably make you talk.",1
Dr. Feige is the best professor i've ever had. He wants us to be successful and cares about our scores. His powerpoints are okay but he explains everything in full detail. So go to class. He teaches a very hard class that prepares us for the nursing program.,1
"The BEST physical science breadth you can take!! Super knowledgeable, lectures are interesting and he was super accommodating to student's circumstances because of the pandemic! Highly recommend.",1
Professor Knox is very entertaining and class is always fun. Your only grades are attendance and 4 tests. The tests are very easy. I really enjoyed this class.,1
Michael is a great choice if you're looking to go into animation. He will give you honest feedback and an honest grade of your work; which may seem rough but it help will your improve your drawings/animations for your portfolio. Although his class is a lot of work it's all to prepare you for the work ethic of the program and the field.,1
Professor Duncan is an inspiring teacher. Lectures are always interesting and interactive. I'd take this class 100 times over!,1
"Dr. Wolf is very knowledgeable and overall cares about student success. I respect her as a professor. That being said, she does rub you the wrong way. She creates an uncomfortable environment for participation. You feel stupid if you don't answer her vague question precisely how she wants. She does reward effort as reflected in grades, though.",1
I took women's self-defense. I enjoyed the class and learning the moves. I did not like how much we would talk though sometimes. It is 60% physical and 40% learning. The learning in class is not entertaining.,1
"she is very nice and cares about everbody learning. if you have a problem she doesnt mind explaining it. she does use the textbook but as long as you have the study guide and look at the pictures she puts up, you can easily pass. she is awesome",1
He is a great teacher. I learned a lot.,1
She is a good professor. Her explanations are very clear and she is funny. Do your work and participate in class and you will get a grade you want.,1
"Professor Woodman is a wonderful professor, this was my second class with her and I'm so glad I decided to take it with her. She's super nice and always available for help with anything. This class also has a clear schedule for the whole semester and it's a very easy elective, so perfect for any upperclassmen and you learn some useful skills!",1
Extremely hard grader. Was extremely unclear with what she wanted regarding assignments. A lot of reading and assignments. Would not recommend her.,1
Gives good feedback on reports.,1
"Made me believe I could and what do you know, I did.  I passed this course after struggling with math for so long.  She made it easy to learn the material and everyone is comfortable with her in class.",1
"I absolutely loved him, fav professor at ucr by far!! hes so passionate and makes lecture fun. Extremely down to earth guy. Just do your readings and you should be fine. he clearly states midterm/final prompts in advance and you get a notecard to write whatever you want for them!!",1
"can be rude, teaches that teaches should always build & encourage not tear down students, yet i witnessed her tell a student she was a bad student and wouldn't make a good teacher.",1
"(REMOTE INSTRUCTION) This course is HIGHLY READING INTENSIVE. 60% of your grade is based on reading questions. But Egan is the only professor I've had this semester who is actually receptive to student feedback. He is very flexible with deadlines if you miss them, and will adjust workload if students feel they are getting too overwhelmed.",1
"I took this class as an elective to expand my knowledge base and was told the course wasn't too hard. The online grading components of the class are not hard, and the project was really interesting to do. The midterms seem to grade on things which are unimportant, memorization-heavy and don't match with the reading sections. Beware stupid course.",0
Excellent lecturer. Always willing to help students during and after classes. Students questions are encouraged however answers are unclear to the subject matter.,1
"I took this class for a general education credit, and I'm not a biology major. His class was hard but definitely passable. You have to get the textbook and you have to go to class if you want to pass the tests. His lectures were fun and very informative and he did a lot of in class activities.",1
My absolute favourite prof at McMaster! Her lectures are great and she speaks about concepts so clearly that helps everyone understand. Love love love this prof.,1
"Very hard to hear and understand in class. Gives you the option to view the course online instead of in class, which is nice. Homework is not turned in or graded, so its only tests and quizzes for your grade. Homework does not match what is talked about during lecture. Seems to be more of an into to using Excel course",0
"Assigned interesting readings but led very poor discussions. Anytime we got going, she took us off in a new direction using her buzz words she uses over and over. (Ex: hegemony, intersectionality, ideology). She also grades papers based on her politics and not on the quality of your writing or argument. The course is interesting, but she is poor.",0
Because of sue i lost 10lbs. got a 1.5 on the beep test ended with an 85% somehow. keep up!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
"Maureen occasionally just won't show up to class, because  she over slept or wasn't feeling well. She is also often late. She took over a month to mark our first essays , giving us only less than a week to write and second and third final essay. She failed over half the class on the first essay. Her weekly quizzes are almost impossible & take 2hrs",0
"Nice guy. Thick accent. Class was a waste of time. I only went to get extra credit for perfect attendance. Lectures were all powerpoint slides that he later posted online. DON'T BUY THE BOOK! It's not needed at all. If you can turn on a computer, you are probably overqualified for this class.",0
He is by far the best accounting teacher I have ever had. Very clear and helpful. I highly recommend.,1
"She is an okay professor but, she regurgitates information from slides that are from the textbook and doesn't even bother slowing down . Also she relies too much on Sapling Learning for homework which is the worst program to learn from in my opinion. Also she scolds you for not knowing the material so read up,do your best, and pray that you pass.",1
"Such a sweet lady! Kind woman, definitely recommend. Not too difficult of a grader, but very reasonable and helpful.",1
"She doesnt respond to any emails, takes forever to grade, and doesnt consider that were in a PANDEMIC. Her grading was tough and she wasnt lenient at all. Take it at another school dont put yourself through the stress and mental deterioration. Disappointed because I had heard so many good things about her when classes were in person.",0
"Honestly the nicest guy ever. Genuinely a great person and if you take his class you'll enjoy it. He's easy to understand and very helpful. I'd recommend him to anyone, and I have and my friends who took his class loved it too!",1
"Teaches out of the book, but does not understand what the book is teaching. Graded heavily by exams that are very difficult. Most of the class was failing, so he made the grade entirely dependent on the final which I got a C on. Extremely boring lectures, monotone.",0
"I have taken two classes with Professor Heilman and she is absolutely amazing! She gives clear and constructive feedback, her assignments are more than reasonable, and she is accessible for any questions about the course or assignments. She cares a lot about her students and you can tell she is passionate about what she does! Highly recommend.",1
Our course went online bc of corona virus and Dr. Carter acknowledged it was a bad time for students. He did not require zoom lectures but gave assignments to do at our own pace and used zoom for office hours anytime so we did not feel alone. He is truly a professional and can be demanding but in a good way. He will not let you down.,1
Professor Thompson will stand in the front of the class and brag that students averages 66 on his tests. Ive never seen anybody be so proud of their own failure before. his tests have nothing to do with what he is teaching. This is like an SNL skit of an actual microbiology class. Except no one is laughing. Very sad to witness and pay for.,0
Avoid at your own cost.,0
"Great prof! Does lots of examples in class, which are very helpful when studying. His notes a great and he's really helpful if you ask. Easy to understand.",1
He is SUPER easy. Doesnt provide any extra credit anymore. His attitude is what I dreaded in this class but it you want an essay A TAKE HIM. Attendance only matters on presentation days.,0
Vannier is a hilarious professor. He puts up powerpoint slides on BB and you just have to fill in some blanks during lecture. The tests are hard but he gives a ton of extra credit so do it and you'll get an A. Labs are really easy and you almost always get out early. Lab practical is hard but extra credit makes up for it. Take him if you can.,1
"Dr Arevalo is an amazing professor and person. She genuinely wants students to do well and is always willing to help with things you dont understand. 104 is definition heavy, and many parts of it are very similar and hard to differentiate, so you MUST pay attention in her lecture. She is great at getting you to understand and explaining for clarity",1
"Awesome professor! I love this guy - he's smart, he's funny, he's nice, he's helpful and he's very clear. Tests aren't easy (very conceptual) but UNDERSTAND everything on the study guide! I really enjoyed this class - the iclicker questions weren't too bad either. Microbial metabolism can sometimes be boring though, but he makes it interesting.",1
I told him at the begin of the semester that I was not good at Spanish and he was very encouraging. But later in the class he became condescending when I answered questions wrongly. I put more work into that class than I had in any other Spanish class before his and I got a C. He is REALLY tough grader and takes off big points for small mistakes.,1
Students who are wanting to learn how to write papers properly this is the class to take. Fox lets students knows what is expected from her students on the first day of class and she hold students to it. Fox is tough because she cares. by mid semester she relaxes just a little bit . I am taking her next semester for English 102. ,1
"Super nice. Really wants you to learn. Read, it WILL BE on the tests. He gives you study guides with everything that will be on the test!! Final project (10 page essay) sucks. Wants you to be there on time. Easiest A. Gets boring.",1
"has a grading contract that guarantees an A as long as you do the assignments and show up to class. it's a really fun class and you talk about real-life, modern issues and then write about it. 2 papers and lots of discussion board posts and a final project. you can get an A+ if you go to 3 asu events as well.",1
"Mrs. Linder is super understanding, she knows that we have other classes to worry about so she understands if we have a lot of other work going on. She is super helpful and is always available if you need help. She responds to emails pretty quickly. I definitely recommend her because she is an amazing professor. Textbook required but barely used.",1
"I loved Sara! She definitely has a passion for the stage & that showed during our class time. She cares about her students' success, and the course information is really interesting. The class is a lot of work, but it ended up being one of my favorite classes. You use the book a lot too, and the plays so you need those! :)",1
"Pros: - She gives full credit on late assignments. - Difficulty is easy, except for the midterm and final. - She is helpful. Cons: - Her explanation and details on assignments and projects are vague. - If you're having technical difficulty on your assignment, she can't help you.",1
I liked Dr. Prasad for chemistry. She is really good at lecturing and helps students to understand difficult concepts. She loves participation and likes when students work problems on the board. She does not give out test reviews and rarely reviews for the test so your notes have to be clear and accurate to study.,1
"Felber gave fair grades, gave specific and clear feedback, and was easy to understand.  There are several papers in this class, some quizzes, and weekly discussion participation is required.  It is a time consuming class, but not difficult.  Put in the time, listen to feedback, and you can get a good grade.",1
"Schubert teaches slow enough for everyone to understand and is easily approachable to ask questions. He doesn't use Canvas and at times, he would go on a tangent and talk about his personal life stories; nonetheless, I recommend to take him for Math3!",1
Hilarious and super understanding,1
Awesome instructor. He explains well and if you still don't understand then he is patient enough to go over it with you as many times as it takes. I took this as a conjoined course with MA1096 and he's really chill. Tons of lectures though. Doesn't take attendance but you'll miss a lot if you don't show up to class.,1
"Completely missed entire units we were supposed to cover. I had her for ENG2 and wrote TWO papers. In ENG1, I wrote 6 papers, that says something. Also have never received a B on a paper until her class, only ever A's. Unfair grader, let's the class take advantage of her, not very helpful/seems annoyed with helping. Unclear expectations. Nice lady",0
"Zinkevich doesn't write her own exams, follows a predetermined grading system, and doesn't cover material on those exams. She will not conduct lab during lab times, and is near impossible to understand with her heavy accent. Avoid this woman like the plague. ",0
"The course contents, discussions, and readings were well-prepared. The topic discussed in class were fun. Very good communicator and moderator. The guest lecturers gave practical information and completed the theories given in the class. The feedback given was useful.",1
Attended 3 weeks of lecture and then resorted to the homework website to learn everything. Reads out of the book and is very hard to follow. I took this class online and his hand writing was unreadable.,0
"Prof Portfleet is the easiest, most laid-back prof I have ever had. She is an extremely easy grader and is understanding if you can't get all of the assignments done on time. Her class is fun, but I didn't learn much from it. I would recommend it to those who want an easy, fun, GPA booster but not to those seeking an academically challenging class.",1
Ben is hilarious and the way his homework is set up online is super helpful. If you use the tools online and come to his lectures  this class is easliey passable.,1
"Took Social Justice and Social Welfare in the US. Sara makes the class interesting and addresses political issues with tremendous knowledge. Her stories of her experiences as a social worker made the material easy to understand. She is very honest and knows how to bring the energy up. If you get the chance, take one of her courses!!",1
he is good at communicating the message.  He does a good job presenting the information.  The only challanging portion would be when he expects you to apply concepts to live senerios otherwise the class is fairly easy.,1
"Jana is an excellent professor. Classes were fun, although a bit drawn out at times as she didn't set clear boundaries with some students about making too many comments. Truly enjoyed the class overall though. The assignments were interesting, and really helped with application of the theories we were learning.",1
"Couldn't have asked for a better online course. 12 chapters from a very well written textbook. You do need to be able to ""teach yourself"" by reading two chapters a week (about 30-40 pages a chapter). A quiz per chapter and a small reflection assignment with a midterm and final. No surprises and no big papers to write. 10/10.",1
She was by far the best math teacher Ive ever had. Is attentive to everyones questions and will answer them fully and make sure you understand the topic before moving on. Sad that she is moving away but incredible experience to have. Makes learning math fun.,1
"Hes an okay teacher. He picks on people in class alot. I am his main traget in class this semester. Hes a hard teacher, some of his assignments are difficult. The papers we write seem to be graded as if we are in the writing profession.",0
"Provided online lectures during the pandemic, but they were extremely long and forced you to remember a lot. Only get one attempt for homework. Gives you a study guide, but pulls the ""not everything will be on the test"" card. Unrealistic student expectations and difficulty, especially for a low 300 level class.",0
"I took this course in summer and everything went very fast so you should practice a lot, time flies in her class. She's a picky grader, very helpful and funny. Quizzes every day, 5 labs, 4 tests, 1 final and 1 short presentation. I really learned! Book is not required just for extra credit exercises if you want to, but lab manual is necessary.",1
"Dr. Stevens is an overall great professor and person. She teaches her material in a way that is not boring and everyone is excited to be engaged in her class, she has a lot of quotes and readings in her lectures but she really elaborates on them in an interesting way, so do the students too. She is super understanding with students course work.",1
"Although he coveres the material very fast and isn't not always the easiest to understand, he is willing to slow down and work as students ask questions. He give plenty of extra credit! One test was open book open notes take home, another was open book open notes in class. I missed the last test and he went out of his way to help me get it taken!",1
"Scanlon is great.  He is really dedicated to the program and his students.  The outcome system is great and is meant for you to learn the material, which is the point isnt it?  Because if this teacher I've switched my major to Chemistry.  He is tough on his students, but only the ones he believes in and only because he wants you to do well.",1
Most of the bad reviews are either outdated or just REALLY inaccurate. You have 3 exams that are easy if you study from the powerpoint the night before. One of the test are take-home by the way. You have a case study that is tedious but not bad. Honestly Don't listen to bad comments. Take him!!! and its really easy to finesse during the tests:),1
Avoid taking him. He failed me. I took Calculus 1. He expect the students should know everything. He just write notes on board and expects students to know everything.,0
shes so nice!! loves what she does and cares about her students. awesome accent not hard to understand what shes saying. take her hist of arch class if you need to take a history class!!,1
Great teacher for Chem 167. Lectures where clear and went over all the material that was covered on exams. Take Recitation assignments seriously sense that is the material that will show up again on exams.,1
Nominally bad at giving feedback on papers and pop quizzes do not focus on the message the story is trying to convey. Grading is also inconsistent and does not give much in the way of feedback.,0
Had her for Workplace Communications. She is the best. I am passing her classs with flying colors! (:,1
"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! He's a fantastic professor. Very helpful and understanding. Class is as hard as you make it. He is very forgiving and helps in any way he can. I took him for Pre-Cal and if it weren't for him, i'd have an F. ",1
"One of the universities best calculus professors gives very good examples.  Provides notes that he posts online and follows the textbook. Makes his own lab exercises with varying difficulty to really put you up to the challenge. His exams are fair, he prepares you well so you have no excuses. Provides lots of additional practice.",1
"Your gonna notice that mosts reviews are either 4 and 5 or 1. There's a reason for that. His class is easy to do bad in, it's only 4 exams and the exams are hard. There's absolutely no homework ever, just reading and discussion during class. The reading really isn't that bad, anywhere from 10-25 pages between classes which is nothing. Cool guy.",1
"This guy is a joke of a teacher. He took us on a mandatory field trip that was suppose to end at 5pm, but due to his own inability to schedule properly, forced us to stay until 9pm. Other things are his over sensitivity to being challenged. He is not understanding at all either. He's gone downhill in the last couple of years.",0
"She is a very nice teacher and is pretty quirky. Tough grader on the first speech, but if you follow her advice given back to you, you should do fine.",1
"Good class. Used online textbook, no hard copy needed. Pretty easy math class. Very applicable information.",1
I loved Professor Okada! Hes so kind and very nice to everyone. Ive attended every lecture and every homework and exam grade I got A. Some parts of his lecture is kinda tuff to understand but as long as you keep up with the homeworks you are fine! Professor Okada makes sure you understand as well always wiling to let questions asked in the open.,1
"He didn't use a textbook, instead he sent us copies of homework reading. Lectures were really interesting and he knows so much. I loved this class and what I learned has helped me understand not only education but also politics. Only had 3 tests, 25 easy discussion posts, and a group artwork project. Easy but great.",1
"great prof, great classes.  Take his classes if you can.  bank it",1
"Great guy, has a ton of applicable real-world experience.  Very knowledgeable about pretty much all things to do with tax.  Not the quickest grader in the world but nobody's perfect.",1
"This man has driven more students out of ME than all the others put together.  I respect him, but the way you respect a bull when you're in his pasture. Do the homework, ask questions, and if you don't understand, DiBella teaches a night course...",0
"Gives actual constructive criticism, is very caring to all her students. She really wants all of her students to pass the class and finds ways to help them pass.",1
"The way she speaks in her lectures is really really monotone and boring which makes you (at least me) really disinterested in what she has to say. There are 5 quizzes, lowest 1 is dropped and the final is made up of all questions on the 5 quizzes. There is a lab due every week, a little time consuming but not hard. Attendance mandatory on lab days",1
"Prof. Rarick is the best stats professor I could've asked for to help my transition into UT. I went to almost every single one of his office hours and he would explain everything thoroughly! Don't take anyone else, I 100% recommend him. He actually gets to know you and shows interest unlike other profs.",1
"If I could add another tag, it would be ""Lecture Heavy""",1
"Ms. Fountain is an amazing lecturer who is obviously very knowledgeable on the material. With that being said, you do have to work for a good grade in her class, but she is a fair grader.",1
"The worst Professor on Earth, not only is he a tough grader hes also highly inconsiderate. If you have him just consider dropping out.",0
"Her style of teaching is kind of scattered, so she's hard to follow at times. and she's very lecture heavy. But she's very knowledgeable and very sweet and the class itself is very interesting. Make sure to read the syllabus and keep track of assignment due dates!!",0
"Best Professor i have taken so far. Weekly zoom class meetings, weekly pre-class work and article reviews. Pre-quiz before class and post quiz after class. Do your work dont wait last minute. 2 exams a tad bit difficult.",1
"This class is extremely easy, and it was super interesting. Allen is a great guy; he gives you a clear grading criteria that you are supposed to meet. Gives extra credit! It's easy so it lets you enjoy the class and have fun learning about plants. Expect several tests, like 2 pop quizzes, one group project with plant mapping, and one talk. ",1
"I really enjoyed this class and how it was taught. Ethics can be a difficult class to teach, but his approach allows you to develop your own opinion while still learning the material. The papers are short and to the point. The group discussions are great when you have a good group. I have nothing bad to say about this class or Dr. Ranft.",1
"Even if you have experience in the real world, this prof wants you to keep responses by the textbook. You think you're giving 100% only to receive a D. Assignment List: 10 Discussions, 3 quizzes, 1 Final, 1 Research Paper (based on non-profit organization), Interview Assignment with licensed Social Worker. Prof gives extra credit.",0
"If you take down good notes during lectures and do his practice quizzes, midterms and finals multiple times until you understand every type of problem, there is no reason that you shouldn't get an A. No surprises on exams.",1
"Dr. Mark is very passionate about her class, so take her seriously. Quiz information is in the textbook but exam questions are a little difficult. She grades pretty hard on the group project so you need to be as thorough as possible. She will call you out in class for participation so be ready for that. Don't use your phone, she takes off points.",1
"Good prof who knows her material and seems to teach thoroughly enough. Be sure to go to EVERY class and do EVERY reading; the exams are dependent on the readings much more than the lectures. Be sure to hand the paper in ON TIME because she doesn't accept anything at all past the due date, right down to the minute (i.e. don't make my mistakes).",1
"I've been taking college coursework since 2004, both online and in person at numerous Ohio universities, and have yet to get detailed feedback like I did on my assignments. Very refreshing.",1
"There is a lot of books and short stories to read in this class. If you do not have time to read the assigned passages, do not take the class. She is a great professor and very smart, but needs to build confidence in asking questions. If no one answers she will answer herself. Great discussions occur if students participate. There was no final!",1
So uninspiring. So boring. It was torture being in his class. He humiliated students whenever they asked a question. He offered absolutely no guidance. He speaks in a low soft voice and has major problems hearing. Avoid taking his class!,0
"She was a great teacher and would highly recommend. During the pandemic, she made sure the students were completing assignments and knew the guidelines and procedures. Once a week we got an email explaining what was expected to be done during the week. The speeches given in the class were not hard and very easy to complete.",1
"Does not even deserve the 1 star rating. Really bad professor, no enthusiasm during lectures, really heavy on readings (20+ pages every class), and sometimes she gives pop quizzes on the readings. It was a really annoying experience to deal with her in general.",0
"great teacher. very much a techie. he doesn't teach by the book, but gives real world experience in C++/Java. gives review sheet for test. study review sheet and you'll be fine. doesn't really care if you turn in homework late. however, he does want homework done perfectly. very attentive with students.",1
He was not really helpful at all. He never gave us graded assignments back on time. He was disorganized and did not follow his syllabus. He graded papers way too hard for no reason. I didn't learn really anything in his class.,0
"She was a very caring and personal professor. She was a very easy test giver, and her assignments were to the point and precise. You need to go to class, as your attendance is taken every day, and it is 150 points! Very easy and a nice, relaxing class.",1
"Terrible organization of the class. You have homework due online for chapters you won't cover until another 4 weeks in class and the tests are ridiculously hard. This class seems like it's designed to stroke the professors ego, given the material is fairly easy he just makes it ridiculously hard so he feels important.",0
JPOW THE BEST!,1
Professor Ruiz was nice but I felt as though the setup of her online course was a bit confusing and there were conflicting dates on there. She responds to emails and is helpful and always offering for you to go to her office if you have issues or questions.,1
Brilliant guy.  Subtle sense of humor.  Absurdly knowledgeable in his field.,1
"He is fun, I enjoyed this course, it was a break in my schedule. To be honest, he is not very knowledgeable about software engineering or computing in general, but I still appreciate his humor. If you go through the slides and read the book yourself you'll be good and probably this will be your best course.",1
"I took two different accounting classes from him at WCC. Since he has a great background in real accounting fields, I got into the class and found myself interested. I was just taking them because of requirements at first, but Ken caught my interests and even made me think of changing majors. I am really thinking to major in Accounting now. ",1
"wastes a lot of time letting students rewrite the syllabus until there's one week left before a test & he has 8 different topics to cover. Tests often include random & generally useless facts from articles he assigns. You don't do much in class which a is nice break, but come project time it sucks. Vote against the business game if given the choice",0
"Dr. Workman seems tough when you first start, but he's actually a pretty easy professor and a lot of fun. He has a very dry and sarcastic sense of humor that is absolutely hilarious if you like that kind of humor. His tests are a bit challenging, but open book and collaborative. I recommend taking him.",1
"De Francesco is a mad lad. We stick on one PowerPoint for two full weeks and still learn nothing. Sticks you in groups with classmates even when you tell him you can't work with them. Always finds something to say about everyone, even if it's kind of insulting. Wouldn't take him if his classes weren't required for my degree completion.",0
"Really good teacher, Knows everything about music. Very helpful. Easy grader, even if ur awful at instruments...grade based all on improvement.  Take for a Fine Arts no doubt!",1
"Walker is hands down the best teacher I have ever had at LSU so far. His lectures are very entertaining and participation does matter, but I loved going to his class so that was never a problem for me. He cares a lot about his students and is so funny.",1
"I don't know why the first few ratings are negative - She is clear and understandable, flexible with assignments if she sees the class is stressed, gives open-book quizzes/tests, provides all powerpoint slides on moodle, and doesn't give a lot of work. I would definitely take a class with her again.",1
"This woman was out of her mind.She called out students for not showing up, which is ridiculous considering the class time (T-F 810AM!) and size (well over 200 people).  She would constantly interject useless stories about her family, some prof with short-man syndrome, how Rutgers invented the pill, and how the female sex organs are so sophisticated",0
"Professor Dowding clearly outlined the expectations of the course with his syllabus. There were no surprises, but the course was definitely difficult. If you want your writing to improve, take a writing class from him. He is there to prepare his students for writing in the real world. Be prepared for hilarious sarcasm, and to learn a lot.",1
"Professor Bahr is great and always willing to help in any way possible. Weekly reading, lecture and quiz. Three exams and a cumulative final, final questions are given early to allow for study. Offers extra credit if needed.",1
"She. Is passionate about her subject,",1
Her enormous ego keeps her from teaching. Her class averages are the lowest on department wide tests. Disrespectful to students. Make friends with other classes; you will need their notes to pass. Almost her entire class is failing. Get adifferent prof. She is the failure!,0
"Ronda is an expert in her field.  She encourages creativity and helps you to develop new skills and hone existing ones.She tells you exactly what will be on the test and if you study,you will get it.The class boosted me already enthusiastic love for sewing! Imagine that!",1
Very nice prof but shouldn't be teaching anymore. You think you understand but during the exam it feels like you don't know anything. Would recommend taking another prof for ECON 227 since it's mandatory for Econ majors. Go to his office hours and work A LOT on your own if you want a good grade.,0
"This is the worst class in the history of the world. The professor is horrible, antipathetic, and has a ego problem. I had never disliked a class so much until I took this one. The course is completely irrelevant and useless if you're not going into research or Ph.D. This class shouldn't be required.",0
"this woman is out of her mind, during lecture she'll go on for an hour about her granddaughter and teach us NOTHING, come exam time, she pulls questions out of her ass about stuff she never ever taught, THANK GOD SHES RETIRING no one deserves such torture",0
"Easy, fun and interesting class that's completely self-guided & self-paced, you just complete all 5 open-book exams (the only things graded & the lowest of the 5 is dropped) by a certain date 10 weeks into the semester. You can spend very little time on it and get an A, but if you actually want to learn the stuff you'll spend lots of time reading!",1
"Monika was so disorganized. The course structure was all over the place and so last minute. 90% of students in French112 were taking for language requirements - we don't want to be doing presentations in French, we just want to pass the class! Terrible, UBC needs to reassess language requirements.. ",0
"Pretty good.  Somewhat ignorant of special education.  Sometimes a hard grader and inflexible.  But is enthusiastic, lots of great info., and learned a lot.  May be repeat of ENG 308 for some.",1
"Best teacher! Definitely take him if you're in the honors college for the Music in History and Culture. His tests are easy and even those who dislike music will like the way he teaches it. He requires you to go to 2 concerts and write 2 easy reviews, which count as 25% of your final grade. Easy A class.",1
"This is the easiest class you will ever take.  He gives you the exact answers to the midterm and final so you have to really try to NOT do well.  He's goofy but has a good heart.  Easy, easy A.",1
"Had him as a teacher for Taxation, a hard subject.  Would not trade him in for another teacher.  He was clear and concise in all his explanations.  Wasn't thrilled with the partner assignments but that was no big thing.  He knew what he was talking about, how to explain it and how to get people interested in what he was saying.  Made taxation fun.",1
"Horrible Psych experience. As a PSY major, I wanted to learn from interesting reads + classmates. Instead it's ALL text book and extremely difficult gradng. Tests are 100 M.C ?'s very hard stuff. WOULD NOT REC. Not a good Psych professor at all.",0
She is a really nice professor. I took her for heritage learners and she does give out a lot of homework. But it's necessary to prepare you for the exams. She is helpful and is willing to work with you if you don't understand something. As long as you do the homework and group projects you're going to pass.,1
"Sara is so passionate about what she does and it's obvious. After taking her intro class, I changed my major to social work. As long as you come to class, do her extra credit assignments, and study for her tests then you'll do really well in her class. I would highly recommend taking anything from her.",1
Tom is passionate about tourism and loves to share his experiences. This is his field of study so he is able to deepen your understanding beyond the lecture. I love him as a professor he was always able to inspire and help bring the material around studying to an increased understanding! Participate in this class! It will expand your understanding!,1
"just close your eyes God knows. what a nightmare, lord have mercy on her future students and may she be forgiven for wasting students' time.",0
"By far the worst professor I have ever had. Very scatterbrained, doesn't have a marking scheme for exams. All the questions are open ended even though you are given the questions before the exams. Doesn't know what is the right answer for examinations and not willing to give extra marks, even if you have one portion right, if another part is wrong.",0
"Think twice before you decide to take this class during summer. Cannot remember when was the last time that I met a professor who would disrespect students in front of the whole class to comfort his anger. Extremely harsh grader, pray for B before getting any of your work back. A condescending professor, not a qualified educator.",0
I took professor Bugaj's class over the summer online and loved it! Make sure you read the textbook chapters and his lecture notes and you'll do fine. Clear on expectations and offers extra credit at the end of the course. Doesn't accept late work so make sure you keep track of deadlines but I loved his class and would take more with him!,1
"As long as you do the readings and get the main idea out of the reading, you should be good.",1
"Great teacher! Cares about his students and makes his lectures relatable and funny. Does not post notes so be ready to write every class start to finish. Gives 15 points for missing two or less classes, and 10 points for being a registered voter. Tests cover a lot of information, but if you study 2/3 nights before the test youll be fine.",1
"By far my favorite teacher at UNCC she does not try to trick you on tests, will give you the written questions beforehand so you can prepare, and gives extra credit. Quizzes are done with groups in class so basically everyone gets a 100 if you try. Lectures are fun you're going to want to participate. Take her for rhetorical theory!!!!",1
"Took English 28 with professor Butman. Don't let the other reviews keep you from experiencing this class. Although the reading isn't mandatory, it helps to do it. He provides guidelines on his expectations for the essays he assigns and will even give you extra time to turn it in. Take your own book to read in his class and you will be fine.",1
"More difficult than the other teachers, however he scales more.  You must understand the concepts at work to get a good grade.  Tests are open book/open note, so no memorization.  Very hard. Attendence is not necessary.  Nice and helpful, quick to respond to email.",1
"His exams are hard but he's such a nice person ! If you go to his office hours, he'll dedicate his time to make sure you fully understand concepts.  He really wants you to do well and wants you to get the most out of his class.",1
I took Anne's course as my last couple of honors credits that were required. She is one of the best Professors I've had in my three years going to UW-Madison and genuinely cares that you learn the content and come away from the semester with a better understanding of the environment and yourself. I absolutely adore her.,1
"Literally the most I have ever learned in a class. It is a lot of work, lots of readings and quizzes every week, but it pays off. He made me such an effective writer and he just makes you really diligent in your coursework. If you put in the work, you will be able to succeed!",1
"Six hours of class without a break. The scores of my assignments were almost same as my classmates, but I got C they got B or A-. He doesn't reply email or messages until the day of the class next week. I chose his class because he is the only professor in the summer.",0
She doesn't like you to ask questions. She seems annoyed most of the time. Lots of work in this class! Not hard but lots of a busy work. The lab is an online program that is irritating to work with. She can't get her info correct because she's a set it and forget it professor. She forgets to make course/term updates in canvas. Hard to contact her.,0
Only have to write 5 papers the whole semester. Just have those be good papers. Very easy going and willing to help you write better papers.,1
"I would never recommend Dr. Yang. She is condescending and rude. Unnecessary amount of work. You write, take, and grade your own tests that take HOURS. She is very particular and if things are not done her way, she is judgemental and will tell you you're wrong. Struggles to give compliments to her students or make them feel worthy! Avoid!!!",0
"I frequently met with Nina for help with my papers (philosophy can be hard), and she gave amazing feedback! She really helped me increase my grade and I ended up with an A. Lots of reading,  but she does a great job making it easy to understand. She's also funny and very kind. She brought cookies every night! Don't skip lectures, can't catch up.",1
"For such a difficult class (ASL I) she makes it fun, interesting, and comprehensive. It's the best way to learn ASL. YOU HAVE TO SHOW UP... or you will have no idea what is happening. But it's not hard to want to come to class.",1
She is nice but she is a harsh grader.,1
No Comments,0
"Knows the material well but is bad at presenting it and fails to make students feel welcome or smart enough to contribute. Lots of reading, but the readings aren't too dense themselves. The material is ok, but the professor himself isn't great.",0
"He is a great teacher and I suggested him to all my friends and all the people compaining about him are just mad because they sucked at the game you play all semester. Read the manaul before playing and the class is an easy ""A"".  He is very unorganized but he makes class fun. Take him!",1
He seems like he tries but he doesn't speak english very well and is kind of hard to understand especially if taking this class early in the morning. homework assignments are once a week and take a while and tests are kind of hard but other than that its okay if you can decipher what he is saying. wouldn't recommend to anyone really.,0
"Extremely accommodating and wants you to succeed. Makes extra time for you and listens to feedback. If kids were confused or didn't feel comfortable attending classes, she would accommodate. She would push back deadlines if requested by the class, push back certain lessons to explain labs students were confused about, and always there to listen.",1
Great teacher!!! I love her she's very helpful!,1
"Incredible teacher.  Not easy, but they don't pay him to be easy.  He makes sure you really learn.  He will go above and beyond the call for his students and maybe even invite you over for dinner.",1
Encourages learning will stay after class to help of needed,1
Amazing professor and very professional. She cares a lot about her students. She helped me so much.,1
Roopa does not provide as much help as other professors do. She dont lecture enough and many students were failing/failed her course. Do not take her unless you want to fail.,0
An amazing Professor he really takes the time to work with his students and is passionate about his lessons. I highly recommend his class comm 30.,1
"If I could give him a 0 I would. Worst professor I've ever had by far. He doesn't explain anything and just reads directly from the book. Goes through at least a section a day if not more. Other classes aren't even in section 13 and we ""finished"" already. Do not take his course, you'll regret it.",0
Im sorry shes very nice to her students but her exams are just too hard for a 100 level class. The group projects will save you from failing. Dont take her unless you are good at geology or want to take a hit on your GPa.,0
"Prof. Shobeiri really tries to help everyone and make sure they're on the same page but most of us struggled since the methods he taught had better ways to get to the same answer. For example, there's more than one way to answer a question, and he teaches the extra long way when there are quicker, easier methods to get to the same answer",1
Whats really cool about him is that his passion for law rly radiates in his lectures. The content was super interesting so that was an added plus. Make sure you do EVERY SINGLE READING b/c although his exams are open-note you genuinely have to understand every aspect. Go to lecture if youre confused-- he pinpoints exactly what he wants you to know,1
A very knowledgeable and genuine professor. He is a little goofy during lectures but this makes the class much more palatable and even funny. Almost too easy at times (could be difficult if you have a different prof for a later class in the series) but great at reinforcing full comprehension of a topic.,1
"Prof. Ted Stephenson is the best Professor. He helped us find a job by showing us where to apply and how to apply for a job. He always makes his lecture fun and entertaining, which making everyone wanna come to class every week. He always listens to his students and give feedback. He is a fooood LOver !!!",1
This professor really cares about her students. She bends over backwards to help them achieve what they need to know and advance in her classes. She is just wonderful.,1
"Professor Morrow is one of the best math teachers ever!  Do your homework, attend lectures, and ask for help!  His exams are straight out of the book so you can study the chapter tests and pass with ease.  He is more than willing to help you in any possible way he can.  Highly recommend!",1
Very easy class with very straightforward professor. Tests very simillar to practice tests. Open notes. HW and projects easy.,1
"Josh will give great advice when you ask him directly, but he will not spoon feed it to you, you have to be actively involved in his classes to get ahead. Overall he does an amazing job of both explaining and teaching the material and he is a great resource both in and out of class.",1
"Mrs. Crowley taught both my Chem 211 and 212 classes. She clearly outlines what you need to do to be successful in the class. Do the homework problems, and make sure that you understand them all and you will do well on the test. Ask for help if you are having problems, she is very approachable.",1
"Bill is one of my favorite professors I have ever had. Math is daunting to many people, and he really has a way of simplifying and demystifying algebra. His homework is short and easy, and he is a kind grader. Just be prepared to talk in class, as he is a fan of class participation on the regular. I highly recommend taking his class.",1
"Awesome, caring, funny professor. Gives great feedback on papers that will help you pass, and he truly wants all students to succeed. Probably the most available professor I've ever had, he will always make time to sit down and help you. He is somewhat of a tough grader, in that he wants to see his students take their writing to the next level.",1
"If you don't like Mrs. McGee, then there is something wrong with YOU, not her. She is seriously the most amazing instructor ever. She is a sweetheart. If you disrespect her, we're coming after you. ",1
"I really enjoyed his class. He's helpful and made the material interesting, gothic literature is by far more interesting when he pairs it up with creative writing projects and comic books. In all honesty, he only seems vague and unclear at times because no one ever speaks up. He's trying his best, which is what I appreciate. ",1
"She has an accent, but I never had a problem understanding her. She seems to genuinely enjoy teaching and is clear about expectations.",1
"Business communications was an easy class and a waste of time. Mrs. Bowlin is a wonderful person, but it honestly doesn't take much to pass her class. Just do the stinkin assignments!",1
"Great Professor! He is tough for a reason, he wants you to succeed and is by far the best professor I had since being at DePaul. If you're not serious about getting in the business then you have no business being in this class!",1
"Professor was so disengaged in the teaching process. He also played favorites and treated us like high school kids. What an insecure human being. Class consisted of multiple ""projects"" (read: busy work).  Hey Jim! Drink a coffee, anything to wake us up here! Or better yet, go back to Canada!",0
"Very nice, knowledgeable, and funny. The only complaint is that he will take forever to grade assignments.",1
"She was ok, but really doesn't try to understand her students. Goes off on her own tangent. Classes are extremely boring and she is very repetitive. Takes extremely long to return papers and is very confused in class. Personally, I did not find her a helpful professor. But not a lot of tests or essays which I like",0
Wasn't sure going into the class how I'd feel about it. But ended up loving it he's really passionate about music and his stories from what he's done in his life are amazing. Really respect the guy and an easy class. Can skip if you want pretty much everyday. Would definitely take again.,1
"This class is a mess... He had no idea how to teach Unity and also was confused every class, his TA even more. He was also late to every class, cutting class time by 20 mins on average. If you actually wish to learn game dev, skip ASU & learn it from another school or online. CPI111 was already bad, but CPI211 isn't even a class, but it is an ez A.",0
"Her online class isn't even a class. It's terrible. She waits a month to grade essays and when she does, she gives no feedback. How in the world are we suppose to know what mistakes we make, if she doesn't point them out? She's not teaching. She just grades papers late with no feedback. She must enjoy killing our honors gpa.",0
Good teacher! He isn't hard at all.  He assigns blog assignments that can be tedious but the tests and quizzes are open book online without a lockdown. The only but is that he only goes over the blog topics in class but like I said the tests are open book.,1
She's a tough grader but she'll give you feedback that will really improve your signing,1
I was in the recent summer 105 course as well....and I have to say that I learned a lot.  I could tell by some of the other peoples comments during class breaks that they really didn't want to be there and they thought this was going to be a easy community college A. I have had lots of wonderful professors at NCC including this one. I will miss NCC,1
"In all honesty, McKenna was phenomenal. He made anthropology a delight, and was always open to the opinions of others. While his grading criteria is unclear, he insists his grading only composes of completion. Assignments were graded in the last day of class, meaning no student could improve their grade. Overall, the class was worth it. TAKE HIM!",1
I really don't like his class. Too much work for an introductory-level class. The final Essary requires you to find your own objects from 3000BC -1600AD (you need to secure the object when you are only halfway in the class). There are huge problems with the teaching style and hard to communicate. Doesn't care about his student. For online courses.,0
"She's a very good professor. Very passionate about the subject. Her lectures go very in depth because she fully explains every formula, theory, etc. Even when the students only need to know how to plug the numbers into the formula. HW can be frusturating because the website looks and runs like an early 2000s site.",1
"Math is difficult, especially abstract mathematics. It is not for everyone and not everyone is equipped for taking 311. It is abstract and incredibly difficult. BUT, if youre willing to work you WILL do well. Dr. Sikora is beyond accessible, responds quickly to emails, and is there for help IF YOU PUT IN THE WORK. I spent 10+ hours a week studyin",1
"Prof. Longpre brings life experience to his class. He is very respectful and expects the same. His lectures are of great learning value and have a fun part added. He tends to genuinely understand and care for his students and adds in an easy 10% professionalism grade for his classes. .Just attend, participate an do the work for an A",1
"Due to Covid restrictions and class being held fully online when I took GEOG 239, there were many technical difficulties that occurred which sometimes made class hard to follow. She doesn't typically respond to emails & posts things at 11pm which are due the next morning.",1
I thought her lectures were very entertaining. She did a great job of getting people involved. Her papers were marked hard. The average mark was a high 60. Would recommend as a professor if you do not need amazing marks. My writing definitely improved because of her.,1
"Professor McArdle is really nice and his command of the subject matter is apparent. However, he's not very responsive to emails and often didn't return assignments (i.e. a very slow grader/wouldn't return assignments at all). Each class is a PowerPoint lecture. Class overall is easy though.",1
"Worst professor I've had at Pitt. Lectures are just him deriving formulas. He never actually taught derivatives; just expected to know how to do them. Never posted any grades, just a letter at the end of the semester. Gave 3 pop-quizzes that probably didn't even affect grades. Tests were unreasonably hard and did not relate to the final in anyway.",0
She is a fabulous instructor that genuinely cares about her students!!,1
Great teacher and helpful .... Take him.,1
"Only problem I had with her is that she locks the door the minute class begins, but if she teaches that same class at another time, she'll let you sit in. The answers to her assignments are right in her lectures and the videos she puts on, and her projects are relatively easy as well. Plain and simple, just get to class on time.",1
Class content is really hard to understand. He only writes on the board so attendance in mandatory. His tests are so hard and labs make no sense. There's a final research project that has a presentation component. The presentation is so scary. Max will ask so many questions and make you feel stupid. He will embarrass you until no tomorrow during it,0
"Very, very helpful. Always has time for questions.",1
"Pretty straight forward professor, decent test and exams. Textbook is mainly used for chapter summaries. Many video reference was used throughout the semester. Would Recommend.",1
"Conta is an excellent instructor. He spent time on the street, as a Sgt, an investigator and a trainer in the academy with LAPD. He bleeds LAPD blue. He has stories for everything. Show up to class, play attention and you will do well. The only complaint I have is that some of his knowledge is out-dated, but still generally applicable.",1
"Organic II can be a hard course, but it doesn't have to be. She's very nice, but as a teacher she lacks the ability to communicate material effectively. You feel rushed, as if Organic Chemistry is some trial-by-fire all scientists must endure. It's a ridiculous notion to expect most students to absorb the material given presentation style.",0
"I love Tanush!  He's there for you 24/7, in person or by email.  He also incorporates new research into class concepts very often.  I really love that!",1
"She is an amazing and understanding teacher, and very, very helpful.  Feminist anth consisted of reading articles, discussing the articles, and writing papers.  NO EXAMS!  I love the self-directed and peer-oriented learning.  And Margo is just a great person, I loved this class, I will miss it a lot.",1
Prof Okada is very helpful and knows his area of interest very well. Group projects are shared among grads and undergrads and the difference between their levels is very (grads just get along and undergrads feel that it is way beyond their comfort zone) clear because the project requires a lot of coding and research.,1
"You do have to do the assigned work to get an A, but she provides all the information in lecture. She answers emails quickly and is more than happy to have people stop by her office. She doesn't give out easy As, but she does make it possible to earn one.",1
"I took her class in Winter. She is a very good lecturer. Her note is very clear and easy to understand. I am in a pharmacy school now, and I remember what she taught us! Her class prepares me for pharmacy school!! I cannot thank you her enough. She is one of the best professor in CSULA. MUST TAKE and DO THE WORK and enjoy it!",1
"Ms. Ladon is very helpful, she also runs the tutoring center. For a hard class like chem131, she breaks the material down very well although she tends to go off track sometimes. The exams are very straightforward and direct, there wont be anything you didnt learn. The four exams basically make up your grade. B in the class.",1
"He wanted to be funny, but he doesn't really make people laugh. He makes genetics jokes. He occasionally will have extra credit pop quizzes, so attend class daily and on time( if you are in class you get one point). Really takes the time to make sure everyone knows the material.",1
"Solid lecturer, would definitely take another class with him. Lots of readings to do, so just prioritize your time. Ask questions, he likes that.",1
he talks a lot with topics that not related to the lecture.,0
"HORRIBLE TEACHER: Does not get back to your questions, any question you have you have to post it on the ""discussion board"" in front of the WHOLE class. HARD grader, how the hell can you fail a computer class? (I am very tech savy even) This guy is a joke",0
No Comments,1
"His class was easy. This course is based on mechanical physics, which is a prereq for this class. Sometimes, his lecture seems too simple and you end up not paying attention. It is okay. I did the same. However, when it is time for you to do your homework, you might be a bit irritated by the difference in difficulty. However, watch some youtube vid",1
"Professor Leonard is one of the best Biology  teachers at Clovis Community College. You must be a serious student  in order to succeed in his class, if not plan to fail this class.",1

"The focus of the class is music but there are other things that should be takeaways from Ray's class. Great guy, great teacher, and great class.",1
best teacher at lbcc hands down. and i don't even like school. learned a lot from this professor.,1
"Dr. Day is the WORST professor I've had so far! If you skip lecture, you are guarunteed to loose points because attendance and pop quizzes count toward your grade. Also, he teaches as if everyone has a strong background in coding (despite being an INTRO class). If you don't have experience coding, you will most likely struggle in labs.",0
Prof. Lockett makes class fun and relates the theory to real life events. Her exams are tricky but overall her assignments are cool.,1
"Doable amount of homework assigned everybody class, collected 1x a week. Some of the questions are hard and werent covered in class but the test reflects the easier part of hw. 2 tests and 1 final. Dont skip class and dont zone out or youll be left behind. Doesnt use canvas/moodle so youll only know your grade after. He does go over tests",1
The best professor I have had so far. Keeps it interesting. Cares deeply for students and always replies to emails promptly. He is hilarious and understanding. Overall great man. Take his class!,1
"Felt like he has a hard time with the online format. Confusing and not updated due dates for assignments. Responsive to questions. Very little feedback on exams, but this seems almost epidemic in online courses. Pleasant instructor I got the impression he cared. He should work harder on the online class preparation I think it would help him out.",0

"Dr. H was a fantastic professor. No lecture was a bore, from intersting stories she tells to the few films we watched. She does assign a chapter of textbook reading weekly as well as two books and 3 projects during the semester. Just stay on top of things and pay attention in class-- it'll be an easy A.",1
"Nice guy, a bit strange. He is not a very good professor and the tests questions are not fair. I have a 3.9 gpa and I got a B+ in his class so just try your best if you end up getting him for 300.",0
Really hard to understand him and expect you to learn everything on your own. Do not recommend this professor.,0
"Good prof, He is old fashion and doesn't use lecture slides. Exams are more then fair, he supplies you with a short list of possible short essay questions for review and chooses a select few of those exact questions to be on the exams. Create a google docs with everyone in the class and this course is a easy 80!",1
"Singleminded, not helpful, poor presentation, has huge favorites/dislikes",0
"Loveee Cutler! She is such a fun and personable person. I have always hated chem, but with her I began to feel like I actually understood what the classes were on. You definitely have to read all the chapters and do allll the homework but if you try hard she will definitely help you. It is a lot of on your own work though but still do-able.",1
I wouldn't recommend takin Professor Ni. She lectures a lot from her head which is okay but sometimes she forgets and there is no energy in the way she teaches so it's very easy for students to not be interactive with her.,0
"She is a very funny and kind woman. However, I found her grading technique to be incredibly harsh. I have done well in other English and Comp courses, however this class has been a struggle. She is vague on descriptions of assignments. She sometimes also makes you feel stupid when answering questions. ",1
"If theres anyone that can take an easy concept and explain it in such a way that leaves you more confused than when you started, then this is your guy. He's smart but he's not a good teacher. This guy needs to go back to working for some company because HE CANT TEACH.",0
"This class is straight group activities, group projects, and outside work. Sometimes she chooses to not have class which is AWESOME! This could easily be an online class, as you can pass without studying for anything. The group you are assigned day 1 is the one you stick with for everything, so don't burn bridges. Most pointless and boring class.",0
"She is a very nice lady. Class consists of tests (not bad if you skim text and power points few days before), class discussions, chapter presentations, and lab projects. Sometimes class can be a bit unorganized but not hard. In fact extra credit from class and exams can save your grade. Follow directions and stay on top of work that can pile up!",1
She is amazing. I took 3 years of highschool Japanese and hardly learned anything. We had the best class and had so much fun speaking in Japanese. Take her and you will learn so much.,1
"I really like this guy. Unlike others, he expects you to make YOUR OWN decisions about projects. We did an awsome project, but we had to solve our own problems. He treated us like college students. NOT HIGH SCHOOL",1
Very good with feedback and answering emails. Big grader on APA formatting pay close attention,1
Josh Loar does not accept late work without a Doctors note submitted through the deans office. He was of no help when I added the class late and asked for a syllabus or explanation. He told me to check canvas and go away. He talks a big game about how he used to work in the industry but is of no help when it comes to explaining class related topics,0
"seriously dont know whats up with the good comments. she is unclear, cannot answer questions, moves through the material too fast, and reads directly from a powerpoint. DONT TAKE HER! you can get a better grade in another section",0
It's an English class so there is a good amount of reading but there are only four papers and she tries to make things easier when she can. The papers are pretty easy and there are clear guidelines and it is easy to do well.,1
"He is a really effective, interesting lecturer. He makes you want to go to class which is also a must because you need to fill in blank slides and there is no textbook :) An easy course if you go to class and now your stuff :)",1
"Professor Oakley is one of my favorite profs yet. Class seemed to be a friend gathering to discuss Geology. Always answered questions and was so sweet. She handed out study guides for us to fill in that were SO helpful, and was very clear on assignments! She wanted you to succeed and learn about Geology. I learned so much!!!",1
Learnt a lot form this prof in my course last year. Very engaging and approachable,1
Susan is rock! I am gonna take another class of her not because I need it for my graduation but because I love her style of teaching and her passion for her job.,1

"I took this class online and it turned out to be one  of the best classes I had this semester.  The grading is made up of weekly essays, weekly discussions that are done online, and a final project.  I really enjoyed this class and learned so much from it.  There are no tests.  I feel like this class has taught me useful things for my career.",1
"I took this course in the summer. We went by 2 chapters a week. There was 2 quizzes and 2 discussions due each week. She provides PowerPoints, videos, and links to help you with each chapter. She gives good feedback. She wants you to suceed. Take this course.",1
BEST TEACHER I HAVE EVER HAD. She is the most caring teacher I have ever had. Very understanding and flexible with work--As long as you tell her why.,1
I just loved this woman i had to take her class twice. Actually i failed the first time but it was so great i was able to take it over with her.,1
She is the easiest teacher ever. she provides many opportunities to get extra credit and the only tests given are the mid term and final. she also pretty much lets u turn in ur hw whenever.,1
Great instructor.  Wonderful understanding man.  Class was a thrill to attend and he made everything easy to understand and use.  Taking his 122 course. He is very passionate about math.,1
Dr Jones is a great CHE professor! I dropped the course twice with other professors at this campus bc of a lack of clarity and talent but Dr Jones is the first to make me stick around and I'm thankful I did. She expects a lot and unfortunately doesn't have the office for lab hours but is willing to do what she can to help as long as you communicate,1
he didn't teach us anything he just talked at us for an hr and gave us 30 hw problems a week. Test were weighed really heavily too so if you did poorly on the mid term you were screwed.,0
"There is one test which is about 25 questions, all multiple choice, but he gives you a study guide of 50 questions all multiple choice. Try to write all questions on notecards and he may let you use on test if you ask. Weekly journals that he'll grade at the end. One project about your topic of choice as long as someone else doesn't pick it. Love",1
i liked that he was at his office hours and spent extra time explaining things one more time : ),1
"You can tell Dr. Beck really loves what she teaches, however her lecture are still very dry and hard to get through sometimes. If you reach out to her for help she will gladly help. If you show up and put in some effort there's no way you should fail this class.",1
"Zank is extremely intelligent, funny, and kind. I did learn a lot from his class and think he is a wonderful professor. Only thing is he a little disorganized, though that got fixed towards the end. If you're interested in the Bible and can work through a little disorganization, take this  class. Not a lot of homework but very great readings.",1
"Dr. Packer is a unique prof that will teach you about stats and reality.  His knowledge knows no bounds.  He is deliberate in his lectures but if asked he is open to talk about anything.  Keep in mind, if you respect him he will respect you.  Feel free to ask anything of this intellectual prof.  Btw, exp II is end loaded.",1
disorganized,0
"Awesome class! Very entertaining class taught by the godfather of mediation. Very smart professor, but we never used our textbook. Get his outline at r/lawschool. Remember to keep it tight!",1
Agatha is Wonderful. She makes class as interesting as possible and she is very positive. I really enjoyed her German cinema class. Besides all that she has nice hair style.,1
"THIS TEACHER IS RIDCULOUS. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IT IS HORRIBLE. Mr. Weiner is a horrible professor and very self conceited that he makes you read HIS OWN BOOKS. The work is managable but only if you have a lot of spare time. He does not give constructive feedback, and his grading is very harsh and confsuing. He also cusses alot so be prepared.",0
Peggy is passionate about what she teaches and encourages classroom participation.  This helped me learn the material quickly and how it can be applied in 'real life'.  I love her style.,1
She was very nice and gave extra credit. Grading was easy. She had 7 missed classes until take points off but if you have proper excuses would excuse. My favorite teacher I had by far!!! I heard all others lowkey sucked. So take her! I still talk to her,1
"Great Class, touches on a lot of material but nothing in depth, will certainly take him again.",1
"Professor Zuber is nice, she wants you to do well, and is ready to help if you need. Answers quickly to emails and gives fun essay topics.",1
Professor Knott gives good feedback but when she gets frustrated she lets it out on her students. She is a tough grader. I like her personality a lot and you can tell that she cares but I just wish she didn't grade like everyone was becoming an English major. She doesn't realize that people take this class because it's a requirement for an AA.,0
"His a good teacher. He grades test very fast. Test are not too hard, but it'z smart to study some.",1
He is extremely difficult to contact outside of class and very rarely checks and answers his emails so don't count on him responding at all. He can be very unclear about assignments and it is very frustrating. Often time is too vague to even allow for successful assignments.,1
Great Professor!,1
Don't do it. Just DON'T,0
He's super funny and very interactive. there's not a lot of work at all if you just pay attention during lectures and listen to the music at home then it'll be a very easy class for.,1
Dr. Brown is not only the best math teacher you could ever dream of but he's also the best teacher in general. He goes slowly and explains why each step is taken. He's extremely helpful and wants everyone to succeed. He's very nice. Just don't use electronics while he's teaching. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!,1
"GOOD CLASS.  TESTS ON LECTURES, NOT BOOK.  DOES PURPOSEFULLY TRY TO TRICK HER STUDENTS ON EXAMS AND THAT IS SAD.  OVERALL GOOD TEACHER BUT BEWARE OF HER AS A PERSON SHE IS A TOUGH COOKIE.",1
Awesome and engaging professor who actually got me to care about our government.,1
"A majority of your grade is based off of group discussions, so make sure you attend class if you want to pass. Over all, she cares about her students and will help to make sure they pass.",1
"So this class is pretty lecture heavy, if you are a solid note taker you will pass this class easily. We had a pop quiz on the third day of class, so write down pretty much everything he says. We also had HW on the second day of class, we had to read and answer 10 questions on Apology by Socrates (that was great). His shorthand sucks so make a key.",0
Had a great transition to online. Great guy. I learned a lot.,1
"Shira is one of the most interesting people Ive ever met. He told us so many griping stories about his life that related to the topic of the material we were studying. He is extremely supportive and caring, and really takes time to listen to his students. This class is very easily passed as long as you do what is assigned.",1
"Worst class i have ever taken! tests were something else than the course material, tutorial was like being back in grade 6, the essay was out to trick students. Take her tenure away!",0
"Palma is an awesome professor, she makes the material extremely easy to understand and most of the problems actually relate to real life/industry scenarios. There was never a class where i felt like i didn't need to go. Her exams are very fair and based off the homework. Understand the homework and you should get an A.  ",1
She is an great teacher.,1
"Fun and easy class, great teacher.",1
"He is a nice person but a not very good professor. His tests are extremely difficult. Try to do well on the online quizzes, and the BP that's the only thing that can help you have a decent grade in this class.",0
Hands down my favourite English teacher Ive had! She gives you a lot of readings but the books are actually interesting! She has 2 essays and a bunch of in class stuff so show up and do your readings and youll get an 80 for sure! Super easy marker and gives great feedback she really wants you to pass!,1
"A very knowledgeable professor who conducts an engaging and relaxed course. I learned so much from him, and I really enjoyed his class. He may a bit rough around the edges but I feel his overall knowledge and clarity more than makes up for it. An overall great experience.",1
"hardest comm class out of the other teachers. she would teach you the chapter after the quizzes, so you basically need to teach yourself to pass the quiz. Would purposely unmute me during lectures on zoom which was weird. only would happen in this class. Grades harshly, follow the rubric, read the book thoroughly for quiz",0
"The guy is a pioneer in marketing!  He writes his own material and has an impressive background. His exams are grueling.  They're all open ended, and if you don't put down exactly what he wants he'll dock you.  He is alright with grading. He won't fail you but if you are able to get an A in his class, give yourself a pat on the back.",1
"My favorite professor at Cal, period. I agree with what others said, I just wanted to to add that she is so helpful in office hours and when she graded my essay it was the most marked up paper I've ever gotten back--I learned a lot just from her comments on my paper. In her class you never forget why you love English; her passion is contagious.",1
"Professor Kubota is a great teacher. She clearly states what expects from her students and sets you up at a high standard. The only downfall I can say about professor Kubota is that she really likes to only repeat the textbook in class. But, you should go to her office hours, she is super helpful and always willing to help you outside of class.",1
"He is a delight. You can tell that he enjoys what he does as well the the topic. Tells great stories , very approachable and engaging.",1
Overall a great professor who knows his stuff. If you are a visual learner he might be a little lecture heavy for you. He is always willing to help as long as you do your job as student and follow the rules.,1
"He's so great! I had him for Major World Religion, and he would say so many interesting things! Honestly, if it wasn't for the sign-in sheet, you wouldn't have to go in bc all the slides are online, and all the quizzes are online. He's super nice and doesn't give that much work. And his lectures are so interesting and he's a good speaker!",1
"About two homework assignments due every week. Assignments includes making up your own questions based from a textbook chapter and movie/film reviews. There was a midterm essay, a short essay and a final essay. Grading isn't too harsh but beware NO PLAGIARISM from any outside sources.",1
This professor is very laid back with assignments and feedback. Is light hearted and can joke around with students. TONS of useful knowledge and very helpful with everything.,1
"Dr. Brown is probably one of the best Math teachers I have ever had! He remembers me by name and every time he passes me in the halls he always asks how I am and is happy to see me! He is the sweetest little old man I have ever met! If I could take him again just for fun I would! He provides all his notes online, you just have to print them off! ��",1
"Professor Nuneville made this class a real breeze, honestly. She knew the material well and was able to get a lot of guest speakers in who had specialties and it made the almost 3 hour class doable. You only grades are the tests and the paper but if you watch law and order and come to the lectures, youll be fine.",1
"The work is done through mymathlab online. You have checkpoints for each chapter and a test, for each chapter she also has you do 2 discussion board posts which I just used questions from the checkpoints. Math isn't my strongpoint but this class wasn't bad. No textbook is purchased, just the math lab access code. There is a textbook within math lab",1
"While Keval is indeed a little outside the box, she has a good heart and she cares a lot about what she teaches. Show her you're interested in the topic and you'll do well. Don't laugh off reading and writing assignments, she grades them tough. Go to class and don't get behind.",1
Professor Laucella is honestly one of the best KSU 1101 teachers I think you could have. She doesn't really ask much of you. 1 easy quiz based on textbook chapters. 1 project. 1 midterm. Final was a super easy essay. Go to class bc you will get points taken off but I missed some days and still got an A. Participate and class will go faster!,1
"he's a very interesting and capable teacher, but can at times be intimidating. if you don't show willingness to learn or improve you won't get anywhere. if you have a true interest, he's a wonderful teacher. take the class into your own hands.. talk, attend class, and know your stuff. tough grader but a great teacher. good accent, and a cutie too",1
Best Class Ever!! Just a Midterm and Final. It is just three essay questions with a minimum of 12 pages. The questions are very broad and easy to go way over the 12 page mark because you have to relate it back to your family and self. He will only keep you for an hour tops in a 3 hour night class. TAKE HIM!!!!!!!!!!,1
"He is rather loud and intense during class, often making you feel uncomfortable during the lecture. His class is extremely boring but isn't hard to get through.",0
Learn the programs bert,0
The poems and stories definitely weren't for me however i managed to get a B with very little effort. She is a great lady and helps/wants you do succeed in the course.,1
"209 is one of the best classes I've taken at U of M, but I did find myself a little bored at times because Sam's so dedicated to ensuring everyone understands each concept, and how that concept integrates with the rest of the course. Other than that, he was funny, the course was fascinating, and I wish he'd teach the rest of my linguistics courses.",1
HE IS SOOOOO AWSOME HE MAKES SURE TO EXPLAIN SO THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EMAILS ARE ANSWERED RIGHT AWAY BUT DONT LET HIM SEE YOU TEXTING BECAUSE THAT GETS HIM REALLY MAD OVERAL HE IS ONE IN A MILLION,1
Hes very good,1
A passionate instructor with a lot of experience in the dog training field. Obviously anything she says is going to be controversial because that's the nature of the dog world. Not completely scientifically accurate info on behavior but the training info was great; positive methods. Sparked my passion for dog behavior and training.  Fun class.,1
She has no idea what she is talking about sometimes and often relies on outdated information. Tests are quite unique and are fairly simple.  Very condescending with no good reason and students have even shown to better comprehend the textbook material. This Prof was the very reason I switched institutions.,0
"Horrible prof, would not recommend to anyone, doesn't know what he's talking about, lectures sometimes go beyond class time (10:20pm no break too)",0
"If you enjoy submitting assignments and being deducted points for your PDF quality, then this is the course for you! Prof. Schap is your typical tenured professor: could care less about his students. Tests are super hard and do not reflect the material taught. TAKE THIS COURSE OVER THE SUMMER AT OTHER INSTITUTIONS!!!!!!",0
"Some of the assignments were a little ambiguous, but she provides great feedback to help you understand where you may have gone wrong. ",1
He makes the class interest and fun. Only thing I didn't care for was the group project. Other than that I would most certainly take another class from him.,1
Very boring professor who seems to drag on lecture as everyone falls asleep. Does not seem to care about students or their situations and is not very helpful in person individually either. Would try to take another professor.,0
She is an excellent teacher. She makes you do assignments throughout the semester that all revolve around a 8-10 page final research paper. Those assignments are not too difficult and will help you out immensely when the research paper rolls around. Definitely would take her again if I could!,1
"Was failing in the class.  She gave extra credit assignments. Work really hard, and she will give you a A.  I worked hard to get my grade up, and ended from a C to a A-.  Must work hard and be dedicated.",1
"She's a sweetheart. There are a lot of group projects in the class but they are all done in class and are super easy. Tests are common sense stuff, stuff you've probably learned in high school. Just pay attention in class or she'll call you out in front of everyone. She clearly loves what she is teaching and that makes the class even better.",1
Great easy class but must be disciplined,1
"LOVE HIM! He's so nice and helpful, especially if you visit him in office hours even just a couple times during the semester. Best math prof I've ever had. Attendance isn't mandatory but if you're part of the half that actually goes to class you're set.",1
"She is a great professor , Took english 1102 online with her she is amazing , extremely helpful , she always emails me back and looks over work if you send it in early. She clarifies very well and her assignments are reasonable . Take her if you can you will not regret it!",1
Not good,0
Very nice,1
"Uncle Denny! Oh how i miss him, greatest professor at Marywood. He has lost his mind however that makes his classes all the more interesting. Definitely inspiring and i highly recommend taking all the classes you can with him, I did and I miss his classes so much.",1
"A must for anyone with any interest in the music industry (artists, you too!). Thought I knew a bit about the business and turns out I had barely scratched the surface. There is so much to be taught and Dr. Young is so knowledgable. If you truly are interested in working with music, you will get over the heavy course load and take this class.",1
"He has a hard time staying on task and I never knew what he was trying to explain. However, once you go along with the craziness, you might enjoy it. He is very easy going and easy to get along with, but understanding his ideas and assignments is another story..",0
"I do not recommend taking this course. He is very bias in what he teaches and the content he uses. Because no sociology book or criminology book was good enough to teach his bias opinion, he used articles as old as the 1910's and as recent as the 1980's in his boundaries book so he could teach his bias opinion about government and crime. ",0
"Might be a tough subject, but he teaches it pretty well.  A straight forward guy.",1
"TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. He made class so fun and entertaining while we were learning the depths of developmental psychology. Get ready to participate and to share things in this class, this professor makes class comfortable & easy to talk about some of our own experiences with some of the topics he covers. Hands down the best professor at EFSC.",1
Reasonable. Clear. Good sense of humor. ,1
"A lot of reviews criticize him for going on tangents but I think it keeps things interesting. I love that he talked a lot about the presidential election this year, and was always making connections to the curriculum. He's a tough but fair grader and his study sheets help a lot. Shares his personal opinions which I appreciate and think is helpful.",1
"In lectures he goes over examples many times and is very detailed, and the assignments are really easy. If you contact him during his office hours he's very helpful. Participation is mandatory, and he will randomly call on students. But overall, this class is an easy A and if you're interested in music theory he teaches it very well!",1
He is all over the place,0
"I personally loved taking his class. Although the tests were pretty difficult, he curved them in order to keep everyone's grades up. The quizzes were easy and used to boost grades as long as you show up to class. I learned more from his class than most classes because he challenged us and actually made us work for the grade we wanted, surprise!!",1
"Sis. Derby is a very nice person but a very hard teacher. If you don't do things exactly like she would do them, you will be marked down. It can be very discouraging. This course is also very difficult and time consuming. There is so much information thrown at you that it's hard to keep up. Expect to spend at least 20+ hours a week on assignments.",1
"Instead of teaching in class she makes you watch videos at home (which is difficult when you work full time) and ""reviews"" in class. Does not give reviews for the test, online homework, quizlet is your best friend in this class.",1
"Professor Baez is tight. Meetings were only once a week, assigned with one homework, which is pretty easy if you pay attention in class. There is also tutoring which you may need to attend twice. Overall great instructor.",1
"Class was extremely difficult. Attendance is not mandatory and really does not help much other than that he might touch on a couple of conceptual points that may or may not help. Most of the learning needs to be done solving the book problems (Do as many as possible, not just assigned ones). He curves a lot but still easy to fail. Tough subject.",0
"He's a behavioral professor, so he's really encouraging and gives really good feedbacks to all his students. Two short writing assignments he calls projects and will take the time to email each student individually and give them good feedback and an easy A. His study guides are helpful- study them, they are exactly what is on the exams.",1
"I appreciated how much he cared about his students. He is very knowledgeable, articulate and interactive.",1
"Quite honestly the worst professor Ive had in a while. She was almost completely absent from the course the entire semester. Never answered emails in a timely manner, doesnt respond to student questions online, never made assignments available in time for when we were to do them. Complete lack of attention from professor. Do not recommend.",0
"Great teacher, plenty of real world experience.",1
"She is a very critical grader (basically an online bully) with homework submissions, if you want any feedback without a bad grade attached you have to see her outside of class. The class doesn't offer any practical opportunity to assess your level of understanding until the tests and projects which comprise of the majority of your grade.",1
"This prof also runs the skills lab and does not do anything for the students. She spends most of the time socializing with co-workers while she ignores students in the lab, or kicks them out for a hair appt. BTW the lab hours are always scheduled during class so you can never go. Completely useless...",0
"Professor Lockett is a very interesting teacher, she has a fun personality and provides thought-provoking assignments. She provides multitudes of extra credit and as long as you pay attention and do the work you shouldn't even need it. I was very engaged in this class and feel that it has been my favorite class I've taken so far in college.",1
Slightly painful but bearable.,0

"Wasn't the biggest fan of this class but she tried. Thats all that matters right? Basically, her class is all lecture based and most people dont learn well from sitting listening to someone talk (while also repeating themselves over and over using different wording) for three hours.",1
"Lai seems nice but he has his ""favorite"" students that he treats with a double standard.  He treats them very nice and treats other students average.",1
"he is an amazing teacher and really cares about his students. he gave me a second chance when i messed up in his class. very fair and understanding. loves what he's teaching, and will make you feel welcomed right away. wish i could take more courses with him.",1
"A lot of discussion board writing and 3 exams. He is a tough grader but as long as you try, I don't think you will fail this class. He wants you to improve on every discussion board and offers tips on how to write your discussions better. Highly recommend!",1
"He was an average professor that did fine for teaching online. He had videos you could watch and lectures. Your homework and QA are worth 30%, they're simple if you use your resources. three test, one gets dropped, 40%. Final is 30%. The class was average, if you study and put the time in you will do fine. Definitely not an easy A, but still good.",1
"Loved this class! Bertram provided straitforward assignments and even told us exactly what we needed to know for tests! He provides lots of homework, which in a vocabulary and knowledge heavy course such as anatomy can really help you learn the topics, but homework is graded so it can be a help or a hinderance but thats the students choice to make",1
Professor Pajer was super awesome! She is very sweet and really just wants you to become a better writer. Your grade consists of 5 essays over the semester and a couple of writing process assignments for each essay. She loves helping students 1-on-1. She explains very clearly what she wants you to write for each essay. AWESOME freshman teacher!,1
By far the worst professor I have ever had. I always enjoyed math until I took his class. The average on the first exam was a 64 and the median a 67. The average on the second exam was a 44.5 and the median was a 46. He just puts the book on a projector and reads it to himself then jumps into the example problems without explaining anything.,0
A hard class.,1
"This dude is amazing. Honestly, get ready to learn, get ready to participate, but get ready for it to be interesting. This dude talks about real world issues and relates them to the material. He makes sure his class doesn't stress you out, and he does a good job of it.",1
"Ms. Fox is an amazing instructor. She's prior military and that helped me a lot since she uses some military language  in her class lectures. She expects a lot out of her students, and she can always be reached in her office or by email and responds to emails in a timely manner! I learned more from her in two weeks then I did in my ENG 101 class.",1
"Great Professor! You have to participate in many class discussions every week . Make sure you complete all Inquizitive exercises ON TIME, that helps for extra credit. You have to read a lot, long chapters. Make sure you study the outline she gives before the test, that helps a lot. Overall, great professor !",1
"Professor Swift is friendly and clear about his expectations. His videos explains things well. This was a basic course and I should have done better. It was more on me, not on him. I would take him again.",1
"Probably the best teacher I could've had coming back to school she really made me want to be a better version of me. Her class can be easy if you take notes and participate, her lectures are always great and she is really sassy and funny .she cares a lot about her students. the sweetest and most hard working women youll ever meet.",1
"Great teacher. Very understandable, helpful, and fun. Made discussion much more bearable.",1
"Just show up, and you get an A. That shouldn't be an issue, though, since he's got some nice stories from his mayoral days and brings in a million great guest speakers (representatives, former mayors/councilmen, union leaders, Ben Carson's pastor...). Budget simulation is cool. HW is just signing a statement saying you did the readings. No joke.",1
One of the best professors! He is caring to his students and is always willing to answer questions. The tests are fairly easy as long as you show up to class. You will need the book that is suggested to pass. I would take him again!,1
His lectures are long. Take notes and record on your phone. He goes so fast that you have to go back and listen and rewrite notes. Too much information per test! Gives extra credit opportunities.,1
"Professor Bermudez is an excellent Professor. For starters, if you show up to class and do everything that she asks you to do you will get an A. Only 3 papers, after every paper you will have an individual conference, she will give you feedback, you implement the changes into your paper and you will get an A. Take Professor Bermudez for any class!",1
"If you do the work, go to class, and put forth effort you can pass his courses. He doesn't hand you an A but he doesn't try to fail you. I took purser for 440 W and I though it would be extremely challenging. I passed with an A. Also, Purser is a great teacher to take for online courses.",1
After taking Professor Perez for speech class i'm no longer scared to be in front of a class and present. She's a great teacher that gives great feedback that will strengthen your speeches. As long as you show up every day and get all of the work done you'll be fine. I highly recommend her!!,1
If you show up and pay attention you'll do just fine.,1
"Totally awful semester, we had two exams back to back one last exam and the final not to mention that the final itself was 124 questions. Thats total burnout, dont recommend this professor at all save yourself from a headache.",0
"Riff Raff is great. I've taken intro to Physics 1 and 2 with her and I'm enrolled to take her astronomy class. She has a lot of energy, cares about her students and making physics simple. She has an iPad that she draws on during the power points which records her voice and her writing and she posts them. She's very down to earth, as well.",1
Bryan was very communicative! He made sure you knew what you needed to do. He often gave us needed breaks if we were turning in solid work. Great professor!,1
"Your grade is based on 4 exams alone, doesn't collect homework, give extra credit, or even collect or grade quiz's. There's no room for improvement if you do not do well on all of the exams. He doesn't use MyAccountingLab online but it is there for reference, more than half the students in the class aren't aware of it and neither is he. ",0
"If your goal is to learn something, dont take this class. If you dont want to talk you are screwed, and if you get the answer wrong get ready to be made fun of. Its her way or you get the question wrong. She adds too many steps to everything for no reason. Simplifying is no longer simple. More than 12 people dropped. You teach yourself.",0
"Professor Kieswetter is a great orgo teacher! She's very clear and to the point in her lectures, and also posts tons of practice problems. Her tests can be difficult, but take advantage of self-checks, practice problems, and practice tests that she posts for each chapter! It is definitely a tough class, but it's not impossible to get an A.",1
Absolutely an amazing teacher. Scared me at first but she is very knowledgeable and with the times. She shares her past cases with us and tells us if she won or lost and how she argued. She is so caring and a tough marker because she knows her stuff. Definitely would take again!,1
"Great teacher, great readings (you can find them online), only 4 easy essays that she has you submit drafts for and perfect. She takes attendance seriously so show up (also its a fun class).",1
"Professor Dudrick is absolutely amazing. You can see that he is so passionate about the topics he teaches. He always comes to class energized and ready-to-go. He is also a very goofy and hilarious professor, which makes you not want to miss even one class. Favorite professor at Colgate!",1

4 week class. 2 tests (m/c & t/f 70 to 75 questions in 60 minutes). 1 cumulative final on all 16 chapters (75 questions m/c & t/f in 60 minutes) Assignments are pretty easy. 1 20q quiz per chapter & 2 to 4 assignments for each chapter (takes 1-3 hrs a day). 5 to 6 chapters per week all assignments & quizzes due on Sunday. Can work at your own pace.,1
"DON'T BELIEVE THESE COMMENTS! I had Prof. Podewell last semester in a 3 hour segment. He really keeps the class laid back. He takes his classes outside on occasion, releases you early, and gives you enough supplementary notes in class to make the tests doable. Having said this, READ THE BOOK. If you don't, you'll fail every test. Great prof, guy.",1
excellent,1
"Shes one of the best professors Ive ever had! Its an easy class, just show up and do your work. Participation matters and theres group presentations but theyre easy. Highly recommend!",1
Great teacher :),1
Interesting class but alot of work. You have a TP and a quiz every week. Content was interesting but there is a lot to do.,1
"Mayor Street is a great and hilarious in class. He just wants his students to be interested in politics, regardless of their affiliation. Fun and easy class, wants everyone to get an A. Wish he taught more courses",1
"You should engage in the class discussions!  It will help you understand the material better.  McKenzie likes students that are willing to speak up and converse.  Class is entertaining, especially this past semester.   Read the books, participate, show up for the quizzes and tests and take your group project seriously and you are gold!",1
"I really enjoyed this class to start with, but I found that Martin made the content more confusing than it should have been. You can learn the same amount from going to two weeks of his lectures as you can from watching a 12 minute YouTube video on the subject. He gives no application type questions, everything is theoretical, and only grades tests",0
"Took this as an online class. Every week there's a homework and a quiz. They weren't super hard, but VERY time consuming. Finding answers in the text were often hard. Only tests are a Midterm and Final, lots of questions and difficult to retain all that information, especially when this is an elective class and you are not a science major.",1
"Avoid this prof at ALL costs. I'm in my fourth year and this was one of my toughest classes, it was supposed to be an elective. Lectures took me 4 hours to get through, no midterm review, tons of textbook material, HARD and time-constraining tests, and extremely hard marker on essays. She was also short with me when I emailed her a question. AVOID!",0
Crazy hard grader. Reported everyone for plagiarism for no reason. DONT TAKE,0
"Dr. Ross is a really great professor. He is always clear in lecture and teaches the content well. Small tests are given practically every week, but this also means only two lectures per week. The tests are just one problem based on the content you have been practicing all week in class. Gives time to review in class before the tests.",1
"Gregory is a good prof. He will explain stuff in detail when asked, and you will learn if you make the effort. He is clear on what he expects so as long as you are willing to work to his standards you'll do fine. Most of my gripes are with the course not Gregory.",1
Okay teacher. Has a very monotone voice that can put you to sleep. Sometimes takes attendance,1
Really confusing.,1
"He's a lot of fun. I was nervous when I thought he would be teaching exclusively in Spanish but he'll say it in Spanish first and repeat in English. It may be difficult for you if you struggle with English already but if you can take memorable notes and have a good speaking-partner if you struggle, it's great.",1
"Records and posts lectures and code examples for your reference. About 10 assignments each being fairly difficult, but if you fully understand how to do them then you are fully prepared for the midterm and final. Midterm and final consists of multiple choice questions and a big coding project. Overall, teaching style is perfect. Respected engineer",1
He was great but he seemed distant and I relied solely on the other teachers for help,1
"This instructor is knowledgeable about the subject area, but he is very arrogant and talks down to students.  Therefore, because of his behavior, a student may feel belittled.  I would rate him an A for knowledge, an a F for his attitude toward students.",1
Best online prof ever! She was always clear on due dates and is quick to respond to questions/emails. She was very understanding and made things easy to understand.,1
don't take this class,0
"Sexy, and fit",1
"This is probably the hardest class I have ever taken. He is a great guy, but the exams are borderline impossible no matter how much work you put into studying. The work he has us do and the exams are made so much harder than they have to be. This class is about to destroy my gpa because I didn't listen to the other reviews on here...",0
Rebecca helped open both my mind and body to the world of dance. One thing I would like is for her to integrate more of her writing into this class. I think journaling and reflecting combined with dance is and can be a beautiful combination. But we also must wait until we are ready. Thank you for helping me explore new ways of moving and thinking,1
"I loved the learning aspect of the class but deeply butted heads with Knox. He's cool don't get me wrong but he can be a jerk through emails. He is not understanding at all and once I emailed him saying I was struggling with the amount of info we had to study for a exam and all he responded was with a ""move on & get over it"". Very frustrating.",1
Did not learn anything throughout the whole semester.,0
"While I didn't particularly care for the subject matter, I really enjoyed going to Dr. Curzon's classes because she is knowledgeable and kind. The tests are pretty easy if you pay attention in class, and the lowest test grade is dropped. She also has plenty of extra credit opportunities if you need it.",1
"Great teacher, I had him both in person and online. He's super friendly and very helpful, he was really available outside of class times and would respond quickly to emails whatever time I sent them. For online, he actually had a drawing pad and used one note to draw in his computer instead of a camera on a paper. High quality videos.",1
"very oppinonated woman.  Gets on her soap box way too much and plays favorites big time.  Stay on her good side, and be sure to never question a grade she may give you, b/c she will hold it over your head.",0
"Professor GZ is great! I wasn't sure if the flipped classroom would be right for me, but I was able to get used to it. You learn the material at home and review it in class, but Professor GZ will go over anything you have trouble with. She is very helpful and always available outside of class.",1
"Good teacher.  Read his notes online and thenotes you take it class and you will do good :) Dont bother on buying a book, you won't open it once...",1
"She is a great person, don't get me wrong, but she is way too harsh. She is accessible outside of class and is very personal with her students. She grades you on things you don't think you're being graded for. For example, a group evaluation. She will doc points off for grammar when you don't think she is. Just always be cautious of everything.",0
Excellent Prof. Loves his students. I think he cares more about how they live their lives then he does about grades. He makes you think and question your reality. He is a Marxist and a Feminist and is not shy about that in class.,1
"She is a good teacher, from Spain. gives pretty good feedback about assignments and has interesting points when teaching. She can be a tough cooking and a hard grader, be sure to do all online and homework in additions to the things that are shown in syllabus. She constantly is adding homework or asks to post things on BB discussion. I recommend. ",1
"She's smart (vast knowledge both facts and analytical), funny (spontaneously witty and dryly), and while at times the lectures are boring, she is one of Loyola's best assets. I really enjoyed her class and talking to her when I got the chance.",1
Gives 4 Essays and 1 final exam hes a very hard grader. All we talked about were poems hes mean and out of 30 students 10 were left at the end of the semester and max 5 passed the class. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS,0
I took him online for Com 2 and overall he gives really good resources to help with assignments. He prepares you for essays so you have at least a base using discussion assignments. I found it a little difficult to meet his standards and often got points off on things I thought were small.,1
Dr. Gray is so sweet and funny! Really cares about what she is teaching. I took her Environmental Conservation class and it was very chill. She posts all her power points so there is really no need to take notes in class. She likes current events and telling you where she has been so just pay attention because that could be a question on a test!,1
No Comments,1
"Frau Adam was a fantastic professor. She cared about her students, and taught really well. Class was never boring. There's a LOT of homework, but it's necessary for success. The class moves very quickly which makes it hard to keep up, but that isn't her fault. Put the work in and you'll do great.",1
Two Exams. Super lazy professor. Doesn't seem to know how to use tech or online systems correctly. Tried to conduct the class via E-mail. Only good thing is that the class is based on two papers. But don't expect to learn anything through his lectures. It's a self teach type circumstance. Oh and he looks like Bob Ross. No joke.,0
"I took this class for fun and I feel like it wasted my time. I got good grades but the load is ridiculous . This class is introductory, but does not go into enough detail. The assignment expectation seemed to change throughout the semester and feedback was incredibly vague. I could have gotten more information from a hefty google search.",0
"Honestly, the way he presents the material in class makes it so much more interesting! Always keeps you entertained with his loud and dramatic voice, loved it! One page essays are due every week with lots of requirements to it and sometimes the TA's grade way too harshly. However, there's LOTS of extra credits and will help you get an A :)",1
"I thought the course was fair. It wasn't like most Comm courses, and he made lectures funny. I liked him. PS. Don't buy a textbook for this course.",1
"A cool dude, easy class",1
English is not his first language which wouldn't be a problem if he spoke loud and clear which he doesn't. You literally have to sit in front to hear him and you'd be lucky to understand. Very Disorganized. He forgets to teach the tricks in his trick questions. Would never take him again. Avoid like the plague.,0
"Ms Apryl ,One of my best teachers at Reynolds. I've taken ENG111- ENG112- and ENG 242. I enjoyed her class and would highly recommend to everyone. Just don't miss the class a lot because some activities are based on being on class. Do your homework and you'll pass with a good grade. and the most important, she is very understandable and easy going.",1
"Professor Mark is a great, caring, and understanding professor. I have him for both 300/301(LAB) - as long as you get your work done, then you should be getting an easy A. Most of the work is from the textbooks but a lot of the exam questions are from his lectures so make sure to pay attention during lectures.",1
Honestly one of the most encouraging teachers I have ever had. She's extremely understanding and very intelligent. An absolute gem. The mid-term was a paper on a movie of our choice and the final was a reflection paper on service we have done throughout the semester.,1
"Class was unruly and prof was not good at managing it. Class was regularly disruptive and off task. I don't think we finished one lecture in its entirety before I decided to drop this class. The subject matter is dope and prof seems to know it well, but it did not translate well into her teaching methodologies.",0
"I don't think it matters how hard you study- in taking her tests I used information from her slides, the textbook, and information from other class textbooks and still received below a B on all exams. She doesn't tell you what you did wrong, just takes marks off. She can't use technology and trails off in the middle of her sentences.",0
"shes the best teacher , her class isnt boring , she explain she do reviewe before test ,one of the best math teachers , dont skip her class and do the work on the deadline.",1
"Loved being in her class! The group assignments during class are helpful towards your speech and she cares about your progress. Very helpful when you're having trouble with any part of your speech. Highly recommend taking her for speech, she made speech class so comfortable to be in even when we're online :)",1
"Pretty sick prof. He is such an easy going guy and offers a TON of extra credit which makes up for his hard exams. He has weekly online quizes that are easy with my friend quizlet. His lectures are usually not too bad but he talks really fast. Overall, he's a really cool guy who knows a lot about geology and is relatable.",1
"One of the best, if not the best, professor I've had the pleasure of taking a class under. Everyone in the class feels she is very easy to learn from. She has a lot of personality and makes complicated material a lot simpler. She's very passionate about what she does. I wish I could have taken more than one class with her.",1
"Keith is a genuine, passionate guy. He cares about students' learning and development. That being said, he does challenge his students and the class requires you to put in effort, be creative, and work well with others. If you're looking for a low effort class or an easy A, don't take this class. If you're looking for something unique, try it out!",1
"This guy may not be very charismatic but is very knowledgeable. I f you are taking his class, the things he spends the most time on are important and as long as you pay attention to those you will go great in the class. He gives you resources if you want to learn more. Very approachable and easy to work with. Does a great job engaging with classes.",1
Don't get on his bad side. Not very understanding. Everything must be done his way or no credit. Makes multiple uncalled for political jabs.,0
"Goodman was really nice, and the class was an easy A. He takes attendance, so you do have to show up. Always pay attention when he's talking about the requirements for lesson plans, because they're kind of hard to find on d2l. He lectures off of a word document, which is pretty boring and hard to pay attention to. Overall, really nice guy.",1
Definitely one of the best instructors I had. He broke all the information down so it was easy to remember.,1
"All she ever does is read off what the questions will be on the test and on the days she doesn't do that, she has groups right a paper using 5 vocab terms, and the papers can be the crappiest and she doesn't care. I didn't learn anything from her class and it was such a waste. I would never voluntarily take her again. Great class for slackers",0
This professor frustrates me. Even with extra credit work it wont make up for all of the daily assignments that have been put in... the daily quizzes can be hard and confusing. Do not recommend this teacher.,0
"Professor Walter is a nice guy. It is just a very boring class. All he does each class is read word-for-word off his power points. Definitely take him if you want an easy A but if you are actually interested in this subject, do not take him!",0
Good professor and more than fair. Discussions are clear but you have to pay attention. What you get out of this class depends on what youre willing to put in,1
Not easy pass! needed to work hard to get a good grade. Very helpful,1
Mr. Emshwiller is a caring and respected vocal instructor.  I will continue to take lessons with him.,1
"Exceptional and brilliant lecturer but incredibly information heavy. You'll feel like you're taking a history class half the time, and the readings are as interesting as medieval literature can get. Go to lecture, take good notes, go to office hours for help on the two papers, and you will probably get at least a B+.",1
"Very sweet guy, but I almost died of boredom. On the first day, he told us he repeats himself at least 3 times so that students won't forget the material and he wasn't kidding. Super easy A if you don't mind wading through busy work every week.",0
She is a great professor and I would definitely take her again. There are lots of papers but I love work. If you want to learn a lot she's just gold.,1
"A good professor, but also a good person. His lab manuals make everything easier to follow, and if youre having trouble hes happy to help. I wouldnt have passed the computational portion if it werent for his guidance. Everyone loves Matt",1
"Linda is a reasonable professor. She tries to make lectures interesting, but the content can get rather dull after a while. It is therefore difficult to pay attention during the lecture. If you add discussion to the class, it helps. The interview assignment required a ten page paper.. toughest thing of the semester, but an interesting assignment.",1
"Tom Witelski's lectures are among the best you can get at Duke. I would highly recommend his classes on Math. Modeling, Math. Fluid Dynamics and Applied PDEs. He identifies just the right application areas and examples to clarify abstract mathematical formulations for an engineering audience. As a bonus, his classes are also very entertaining!",1
"It seems most people have given up on him. Class is 16/35 full, people keep dropping out, and in the online lectures you'd be lucky to find 9-10 people attending. That should tell you everything about him. Listen to these reviews people.",0
"She is an amazing teacher and very intelligent. Her class is fairly easy and the syllabus is clear about everything. She does tend to go off topic from time to time, and sometimes speed through her PowerPoint, which she does not post on D2L. You have to take notes as well.",1
DO NOT TAKE THIS WOMAN'S CLASS. CRAZY AS HELL. HAS A FUNKY ATTITUDE AND IS ARROGANT. THINK SHE KNOWS EVERYTHING BUT DOES NOT. HATEFUL. AND FULL OF SIN!I GOT A 'D' IN HER CLASS. VERY UNFAIR & DOES NOT CARE ABOUT ANYONE BUT HERSELF. LOVES THE SOUND OF HER OWN VOICE. TALKS TOO DAMN MUCH & is to CRITICAL.,0
"I am not sure why so many students like this teacher. Calling her nice is like calling a rabid dog friendly. She grades at a post graduate level, and is not very approachable. If you take her in conduct, you will have a different professor for the first semester than the second.  Maybe she changes over the holidays. Study 8 hours a week or take a C",0
Paoline puts an outline on the board every class and it's your job to collect the important information as he lectures.  He makes it simple to get good notes.  If you study your notes you'll be perfectly fine.  Good teacher in my opinion.  He loves his subject and it translates. 3 tests,1
"Professor Gonzalez is the funnest and most helpful professor I've ever had. His questionable sense of humor makes the class the highlight of my day. His assignments are super clear and he is always willing to help students. Come to class, participate, and do ALL your assignments and you'll be sure to pass!",1
"If I could describe his class with one word, ""disorganized."" His scribbling on the board was hard to read and all over, making note taking a tedious and pointless process. Difficult to follow along in class. Not much notice was given on when tests, quizzes, and worksheets were to be assigned. Unless he changes his ways, avoid him if possible.",0
Mrs. Gray is one of the best instructors I have had. She is clear in her instructions and fair. She will answer any question and always made me feel important.  I went into this class scared and came out educated on the environment. I am thankful for all she taught me.,1
Melissa Logue is a true gem. She is a very kind and respectful professor. Is very good when it comes to responding to emails. Also is understanding that college students have lives as well. Her class is basically composed off homework quizzes and test. Which are all not difficult if you properly prepare.,1
I struggled through chemistry during high school. Dr. Cutler is helpful and accessible inside and outside of class. She comes up with ways to help students remember difficult units and genuinely wants students to do well. It's obvious she has a passion for Chem. Though she is awfully bubbly for an 8am. ;),1
"The hardest class I have ever attended. While she is a nice person, her grading system is subjective. It's almost as if she expects prior knowledge of economic perspectives before taking the class. Avoid her class(es) if possible",0
Not a tough grader at all but the time limits for quizzes and exams are rough. This professor is knowledgeable and knows his topic but if you arent crazy about art history you will hate this class. Online classes are difficult as it is but this one was a downright struggle for me.,0
"Dr. Houston is not a good choice. You have to write EXCELLENT papers to get good grades. I had papers critique by professors and adults and till received a ""C"" on it. She doesn't seem like she wants to help and majority of the class left after the 3 month of school!! DO NOT take her because she can make you life miserable and it is not worth it!",0
"Love this professor, she actually cares about her students and her class was fairly easy just study for test and participate and you should be fine.",1
"Very kind man who truly wants his students to do well; unfortunately, he is not very articulate and can be easily misunderstood. He is a good man, not a good teacher.",0
"Mrs. Spencer is a very nice teacher, I took accounting online. It was a difficult corse to take online but she makes her self very available for her students. I would really recommend students to give her the chance to be their teacher. Online classes do take a lot of disciple and hard work, but if you do your work you'll pass. She is a kind women",1
"I checked his ratings here before taking the class, I still took the class. It  this was one of the best classes I have taken at Cal State LA. Cervantes is a very knowledgeable professor he expects students to do their work. Take it, he'll teach stuff you can make easy money off, if you work and pay attention of course.",1
"Roxi was ALWAYS late to class. She grades you based on 5 essays and 25% participation. If you aren't her favorite, she is very rude and intimidating. Lots of reading and papers.",0
This was the WORST and I repeat WORST professor I have ever taken. It might be better to delay your graduation than to take this man and hurt your GPA. He just doesnt have enough experience to teach math and will simply not work with you. He expects you to memorize formulas that are just extremely unnecessary and removes points for foolishness.,0
I enjoyed the content of the class and I feel like she presented it in a way that was understandable. I liked the online format where I could print out the slides and take notes on them. The reading quizzes were difficult and really made me pay attention to the text. She knows the material extremely well. Be prepared to work for a good grade.,1
"Prof. Lawrence is the best!! He genuinely cares about his students and wants to see everyone succeed! His class structure is fun and really laid back, with hardly any homework. Some say you won't learn anything, but if you follow the class structure and participate, you will learn.",1
"Dr. Anikovskiy seems intense, but he has a great sense of humour which makes his class enjoyable. He's in charge of the part of quantum mechanics in NANS 301, which I find dry and a bit hard to understand. But he does try his best to teach and even tells the students what is to be tested on the exam. I recommend him because he's a good teacher!",1
"I was an atheist until I took Dr Harveys class because now I actually believe shes an angel. Never in my life have I seen a professor as excellent as she is. If u r lucky enough to be in her class, dont waste time and study Hard. Chem 102 is a lot of work but the A is yours if u manage ur time and study systematically. And dont skip class",1
One of the best lab professors so far. Very helpful and patient. Tests are straightforward and no trick questions.  Definitely recommended!,1
"This class was easy and I recommend taking her. I made a 98 in the class. She extends deadlines and is flexible if you have any problems in your field experience. There are 3 bigger assignments and a few weekly reading summaries. Lectures can be long, but she likes people to participate and show at least some understanding of the content.",1
"He was tough for me as I did a lot of self teaching. I would take him again only because I know how he works now. 8 Chapter quizzes and 3 exams are the only grades in the book so that makes it tough. Be ready to spend all of your time on MyMathLab - that part was hell, but he relieved us towards the end. Mainly all online",1
"I would def recommend.  Very helpful and cares about his students.  The only thing if you're absent, you're on your own!!",1
Only he does is reading reading off powerpoint and play youtube videos,0
Utterly incoherent. His lectures are a colossal waste of time - just review the slides on your own.,0
"I'm honestly very surprised that there aren't more comments about Mr. Alcala. Not only is he a very supportive counselor but he has class too. If you need more credits take his class, it will definitely motivate you to be a better student and launch towards your career. He's practical and fun, I promise it'll benefit you having him in your corner.",1
"Luttrell is a nice guy. He's willing to help you if you have already looked in the most obvious places for answers, so don't waste his time asking a question if you haven't even tried to find an answer yourself. I really liked the course load, i feel it was fair and informative. definitely not an airhead like most professors, would take again.",1
"She's an amazing professor even in her first year. She helped me out as much as she could this semester, including meeting with me outside of her office hours multiple times. We moved the schedule around to make sure all our readings were clear and took less time on the things we didn't enjoy.",1
"Most caring, sweetest, funny, and amazing professor Ive ever had in all my years of school. Had her for an online class during the pandemic and she was adjusting just like we had too. She extended due dates and you tell her when you can submit something even after the deadline. PowerPoints and lectures were fun to watch, very short quizzes!",1
I CAN'T STAND THIS WOMAN!  Literally have been in her class for a week and regretting it so much already.  She is super rude and condescending.  She gets frustrated by questions and has the same blanket response for everything.  Its going to be a LONG semester.,0
"Shes hilarious and very intelligent. Although, shes extremely unorganized and takes all the time in the world to grade tests and labs. She will contradict herself on occasion by stating one thing, and deny had saying it a week later.",1
Easy A as long as you ready and do assignments. I took online class and it is basically self taught material,1
"Dr. Yamazaki is hands down one of the best professors at CSULA. She makes sure everyone understands everything. She does go through each lecture fairly quickly, recording each lecture will be helpful. Not an easy class if you've never taken a physio class. You must put in the extra effort to get an A. In class group assignments, 3 midterms&1 final.",1
"Kathy is awesome! Definitely my favorite professor within the Journalism department so far. Attendance is mandatory, but if you skip a few and do the extra credit (which she offers a lot of) it should even out! If you turn in an assignment late, she still accepts it, you'll just have to remind her. If you can get Kathy as a professor, do it!!",1
"This man is awesome. He makes the class easy. The homeworks can be challenging but you can ask for help always and whenever in his office hours. The first three projects can be tricky but again he helps in his office. If you want an easy A & a stress less class, take him.",1
Do all the readings and show up to class. Being in class to take part in the discussion and get the notes is imperative. You will need to know the information for the midterm and final. She is very understanding of time constraints. She cut some readings when we didn't have time and modified our papers to make it easier for us. Very interesting too,1
"Dr Osoba is a difficult professor, but I learned a great deal in his class. Well worth the time and money. Very different approach. Very Interactive. Very heavy work load, a lot of time is required for reading, problem sets, papers, exams (cumulative final). He is genuinely dedicated to Economics and teaching.",1
"He's new. He's a fair teacher. He doesn't grade terribly hard. The work is not easy, but I would take a class with him again.",1
"MARK LIST IS AWESOME!!! For a subject I've always found to be completely dull, he made it the best possible. He runs a very interactive class. There's a lot of group work, and he's always nearby to help. There aren't very many homework assignments or projects, but you definitely want to be in class for the classwork and to prep for exams.",1
"Dr. Chandra is the best teacher I've ever had. very clear and very passionate about his lecture. also, best researcher on campus.",1
Very confusing on what she wanted on papers and was not very helpful. The only positive thing was the work load itself was easy. But she was way to picky on grading.,0
"The professor is very nice, helpful, and provides feedback but instructions are always unclear. Make sure to clarify everything otherwise you will be stuck. Pretty easy but boring class as long as you attend class, do the work and work with your group.",1
She makes algebra easy by teaching it step-by-step!  A wonderfully considerate instructor who helps you all that she can.  Attendance and participation alone counts for one grade of 100.  She will make you feel at ease in her class and she is at times quite humorous which is so much fun!,1
"Professor Wood is very intelligent, this course is difficult. At the start I was doing fine, but I missed handing in a quiz and got a bad score on a test and it didn't look like I was going to pass. She allowed the class to make up one test on our day off, if wanted. I studied hard and got a good score. She is a very tough grader but knows allot.",1
Good Teacher,1
"Only reads off the slides. You can download slides but is NOT very helpful. Funny Heavy accent when he says ""packet"", and hard to understand what he writes (scribbles etc)Go to his office & he will ask you rhetorical questions but he will help u in his office but is difficult to comprehend his teaching u the stuff. Take this class at own risk.",0
"If you want an easy A, take this class. There are 3 tests and the final all of which are online. He takes attendance randomly 5 times during the semester. Get ready to be bored as he reads verbatim to the slides that he does post online. You definitely do not need the textbook, so don't waste your money. Easy A, decent professor, no homework.",1
"Extremely hyper, hard to follow, lots of information all at once, tests are impossible",1
"Incredibly arrogant and not helpful.  He is right and everyone else is wrong.  His point of view is contrarian and somehow common sense, but highly impractical in real world, which is a place Jagpal infrequently visits.  Rutgers needs a pure marketing class, this is not a marketing class at all - it's a management simulation class.",0
The professor spent the majority of each mandatory class meeting to discuss her personal life and forbade working while she discussed her life. The assignments had little-to-nothing to do with the learning and the learning materials were so basic it felt insulting. Terrible emailer and communicator.,0
One of the worst economics professors i have come across.,0
"She was one of the best teachers I've ever had.  She is very knowledgable in her filed and was very accesible to her students.  Her classes are fun and insightful, especially the family psychology class.  I didn't meet very many students who after taking one class with her didn't end up taking all of the classes she taught.",1
"Gets off topic too much, rarely discusses the book, no test review. Hard to pass when we do zero book discussion and watch videos. Cool person but not a quality teacher",0
"Super easy. Go in to class with some prior experience with math. Does not go that in depth. tests every week, super easy. homework is really easy just a lot of problems. heavy accent but understandable. gives a lot of breaks.",1
Amazing teacher.  Every class is interesting; a great lecturer and discussion starter.  You do need to pay close attention in class if you want to do well on the tests.  He's a tough but fair grader and lets you know how you can improve.  Very friendly.,1
"In a lecture hall of almost 400 students, Christina did a fantastic job of keeping the lectures fun and engaging. Almost all of the content covered could be prior knowledge if you had a good chem teacher in high school. She has Top Hat every class and is VERY generous in the assignments and homework that is dropped. I would strongly recommend her.",1
"I took Mrs. Dodsons stats class online and I recieved a A. I am not a math person at all, but her online class really helped me to focus, and not stress so much. Do the discussion boards, and homework. She is a great teacher, very understanding. I would recommed taking if your not good at math, and you need a easy A.",1
"Laura seems like a nice person, but she is a horrible teacher. She thinks she's explaining things, but leaves the class confused on what's expected in homework or exams. She said it's not her fault (teaching style), but our learning style. She never releases the homework on time on Canvas, leaving students confused. I get As but not in this class.",0
"Berkson really cares about what he's talking about and that you're interested in what he's talking about. He puts a lot into his classes. Put an equal amount of effort in and you'll do great. So fun to go to class, never a dull moment.",1
Great professor! He is super funny and gets to the point with his lectures. He normally ends class early and gives everyone time during class to work on their group projects.,1
"Although she has high expectations, Knott has been a really reliable professor for me. She does assign a lot and she does expect a lot out of students, but she provides help and is completely willing to work if you are. Again, It's not an easy class but if you're willing to stay on top of things it's not as hard as others make it seem.",1
"Professor Zein is a very tough grader. And most of these things said are true. Her desired answers are subjective and she is picky in her answers. However, she is very clear and precise in what she expects. If you listen carefully, and take notes you will do good. Pass this class and you can pass any F&M class.",1
Dr hauck was very clear in lecture and encouraged interactions outside of class in group sessions (even on Sunday afternoons). An A is very very possibly with Dr Hauck if you review notes outside of class before quizzes and exams.,1
Ive taken her for multiple courses and enjoy her a lot. Her tests have a lot of questions but are repetitive so you should be able to get 4 points for each fact you know. Fairly easy grader on papers as well. Tends to assign one paper for the whole semester for all of her classes.,1
"She's such a nice person and takes time to learn your name. However, I would not recommend this professor. Lectures are very fast paced and EXTREMELY hard to follow. You need to be in class for the material to make any sense, and it's a tough class to want to attend. Expects you to read 5 books throughout the semester and have 4 tests. Would avoid.",0
"She read from book and ranted about the material. Its graded mostly on test scores. No study guides!!!!!! I read the book from cover to cover & took notes. Received a ""B"". I'm not happy considering it was a ton of work. She expects you to memory recall any given detail out of the book that she chooses for the test. Don't take if you need ""A+"".",0
Il n'explique pas bien,0
"I took Dr. Batman for UPhys I and really enjoyed the class! He does give a lot of homework, but the practice really helps come test time. He's a fair grader and provides all equations you need on the test. Took lab with him at the same time, and the week of the exam he'd just do practice problems for the test.",1
She is very accessable. Wiling to help anytime.,1
"This was the worst and most unorganized instructor in spanish.He fails to use any visual aids, no handouts, no powerpoints, spreaks only in spanish with a satuated accent, fails to answer any emails, hardly use the blackboard, grades unfairly, and gets mad if he finds out you reported him, takes it out on the class, he is a terrible instructor!!!!!",0
a calamity,0
"Professor De Francesco is a really great guyhe has interesting lessons and his class is easy as long as you pay attention. He's willing to help you if you're confused, but I would encourage you to do the reading in order to understand what is happening. There are a variety of assignments/projects about media-related majors but they are fun!",1
"Professor Doubleday makes Russian interesting and fun. You have to go to class and put in the work, but it's worth it. She cares a lot about her students and is willing to help you outside of class. Definitely a class worth taking with her.",1
Avoid unless you know VHDL. Won't assist you past the first part of the project. Everything else is easy but you will only get a C if you can't do the projects. You will not learn anything.,0
"I enjoyed this class! I have a lot of interest in environmental conservation, so maybe I am biased. This class was online. Her lectures were through VoiceThread. Very long and somewhat boring. She made the lectures the length the class was supposed to be (1hr 15min). And the lectures were necessary to watch. So they were dragged out, but doable.",1
"If I am going to take a heave course, with hard difficulty I want the professor to be just like this professor. Intensely hard on students with a lot of motivation to succeed. she is the Definition of Fitness, and health. Great Prof!",1
"She takes forever to grade things. It took her a month to grade simple quizzes to test. She waits until the semester is up to grade. She does not give extra credit, and does not help you when you mess up. She does not care if you fail. I never had a teacher like her. She is a tough grader on her papers. Takes forever to get a reply back. ",0
"Excellent prof, and a very nice guy. First time teaching Thermo this year, so will only get better in the future. Best prof so far.",1
Took him for Trig Math 40 and he's a good professor. He lets you ask questions and he explains well. If you don't understand something he'll help you and he throws no curve ball on tests. Everything on his tests you will cover. Just make sure you do the study guides he gives or  you won't pass the tests unless you really understand the concept,1
As long as you read the book you are okay.,1
"By far the worst professor I have ever encountered. This professor does not write one line of code the entire semester even though all his assignments are code based. You would think he would go over examples as a minimum. All he does is show youtube videos. Students can read the theory at home, they don't need you to read your poor PDF's for 3hrs.",0
"6 reading reflections, 1 roundtable, 1 additional book to read for the midterm. The class was more about Native American law, and Carma did not return any papers, so I did not know my grade til grades were posted at the end of the term. That being said, Carma invited many guest speakers and was very caring and enthusiastic about her class.",1
"Took his night class.... bad idea. All he does is talk and talk, and rants about other random stuff. Don't get me wrong he is funny, but that doesn't make up for other stuff. He literally has to walk up to you in order to hear what you said. STAY AWAY lol",0
"Just a great professor and a great guy. Really wants you to learn the material. Passionate about the subject, he has a somewhat sarcastic sense of humor that is refreshing in class. Lots of reading but he is definitely worth studying with.",1
Jan is very knowledgeable about the subjects she teaches. She is willing to work with you and has a lot of office hours.,1
"She was a great teacher. Very well prepared for each class, and even used problems from homework on the tests. All she asked was that you try and she will help you along the way. Great teacher, I do recommend taking her!",1
Took her Honor's class online. Professor Hartgrove is extremely helpful and accessible through her office hours. The class work is fun and if you put in the work you will learn a lot about psychology. She gives good lectures and was very sympathetic to students during the pandemic.,1
"Highly recommend. She makes the class clear and cares about your success. Honestly, a super easy course if you can write a proper essay for the labs.",1
"The content of SPAN 141 isn't particularly interesting (it's GRAMMAR), but our section made the best of it and we had a blast. Florencia is extremely knowledgeable and helpful. I wish I could take more Spanish with her!",1
"He's very inconsistent with what he says in terms of assignment requirements, and seemingly has trouble both communicating what he wants out of assignments, as well as understanding the questions students ask. This was honestly the worst and least enjoyable course I've experience. The workload was HUGE (24+hrs of drawing per assignment)& hard marks",0
"He makes the class so interesting and keeps students engaged. He uses an online tool to take attendance that has a question that goes with the lecture. This is very beneficial, so do the practice in class. He is very open to questions and further explaining things.",1
"Objectively not the best teacher, but far from the worst. I found her easy to get along with and decently clear at communicating why I received the grade I did.",1
"She's a great teacher! The class is fun and interesting. There are a lot of fun writing activities and workshops. She hardly lectures, its usually just writing exercises and group activities. Keeps the class interesting with her anecdotes.",1
I took her class online. There are a few assignments but are all pretty easy and it's obvious what she's looking for. She's a fair grader who responds to e-mails promptly. I thought the class was easy to get through and decently set up so I did learn a few things. I would recommend her for anyone needing an online class.,1
"This class made me actually regain a liking for math. Great professor - clear teaching, really breaks down problems, reviews for exams, answers questions after class. It's not an easy subject - homework takes about 4 hours to complete, but once you get into it, it's formulaic. You should make an A as long as you study the formulas & attend lectures",1
"Dr. LaBelle is the best professor I've had at Chapman University. Not only is she passionate about the subject manner, but she is passionate about her student's academic success and takes a personal interest in them. If you do not understand how the content is originally taught, she will find a way to teach it in a way you understand.",1
"Loses temper easily. Even if you have an excused absence, he will get annoyed and will not let you make up work. My friend told him weeks prior that she had a surgery and he said that was too early to tell THEN later told her if she doesn't take it on the day she was planning on leaving that she will get a letter grade off. Nice guy, rude prof.",0
"Prof. Smith loves the study of Native Americans. The book he requires you to purchase is about Native Americans, and you will watch a couple movies on this subject. However, don't misunderstand this to mean that he is flaky! He is not! Everything you do in his class is a building block for writing in preparation of the final exam. Great teacher!",1
"This professor is my favorite professor I've ever had. You do get homework every week but it takes maybe 10 minutes, his exams are easy as easy can get (he goes over the entire exam the class before) and there is no way you'll fall asleep because he constantly keeps your attention. I adored his class so much, I took this semester his Into to Anthro",1
"While she explains topics well, the schedule of this class is absurd. The norm was to have homework due BEFORE it was covered in class. The exam average grades were typically in the mid-60s, so the majority of the students obviously weren't learning the material. The focus is almost completely on memorizing formulas, not really on knowing concepts.",1
Shes very nice and very helpful and understanding.,1
She is an amazing professor. She is passionate about her job and is always there to help you when you need her. She is very responsive to email in a adequate amount of time. I wish I could take her for every course.,1
"I had Sposeto for the last two quarters of the language sequence. She is a great teacher and wants everybody to succeed. As long as you go to class and participate, you will be fine. It is graded through a lot of assignments so your grade is buffered for tests. I highly recommend Sposeto.",1
"Awful lectures, waste lots of time waiting for students to answer his questions, such as ""good mornings"" and ""have I lost anyone"". Every class, the same speech. Sometimes he is rude. He assigns people to group for major projects. He is not open to feedback. Playing music during the classes doesn't make a teacher ""awesome"".",0
I love Professor Sankara! He is extremely passionate and loves teaching French poetry.  He has never made me feel stupid and is always extremely happy to explain things and help whenever you need.  He is patient with his students and gets very excited when they understand deeper meanings in poetry. You do need to work for your grade (that's college),1
"He's a brilliant guy and knows what hes talking about, but he doesnt care about your grade and makes the exams extraordinarily difficult, regardless of the time you spent to study (average 69% on exam). Very helpful and responsive, but very tough. All of the material is through word of mouth, and he speaks very quickly. Always go to class!",1
"Lazo- Cividanes is a very well informed professor that delight us with his lectures, specially in the Latin American context where I can qualified him as an expert. What I like about him is the way he has help me in the development of my research paper, a paper I have been working since the start of the semester.",1
"Marks is a great professor. He is not the easiest, but he is very straightforward with his grading and tests. You definitely know what to expect and how you are going to do. I had him for the entire 200 series and will continue to have him as a prof for as long as I can! He is knowledgeable, funny and an all around cool guy.",1
:(,0
Shes alright. ,1
"He's very thorough, and has crystal clear lectures. He makes difficult concepts seem like a piece of cake.",1
"She has a unique way to teach math. She jumps some steps while showing the process in order to make students think and questions. It is her way to make students participate. If you ask her questions, she will analyze your questions carefully in order to help you clarify some foundation misunderstand. She sees math as a game.",1
"Decided to take a summer class forChem. Honestly was so hard I wanted to cry. Knows what he's talking about but his accent is so heavy its impossible to understand him. Chemistry uses big words so this was even worst. The whole class was failing so he curved GENEROUSLY, I mean I got a B and failed most exams I thought I was getting a D possible C.",0
"He has the ability to be the best professor, but his attitude towards students and his rudeness already makes some of the hardest classes, harder. He is nasty in how he responds, refuses to help, and treats you like a moron, yet you don't get any other options.",0
Did things to cover all you would need to know but if you aren't a woman then he doesn't seem to pay attention to you as much for answering questions or suggestions.,1
"Great professor! Especially for all the non-science majors like myself, class was really enjoyable although online course. I loved that professor provided feedback to every single assignment. Her grading criteria is pretty straight forward. I dont think there's any reason anyone wouldnt pass this class",1
This man is my absolute favorite. I have never been good at math and he made me understand and was extremely helpful. He's so sweet and really cares about his students.,1
Brother Daniel Maria is a Franciscan gem. He is so passionate about what he teaches and wants his students to feel the same way. Class is reasonable and lets you determine how bad you want your grade; no busy work. Take him.,1
"Okay, he's a great guy and hes funny, and hes a good prof. He gives you space to think for yourself and be creative with your own work. This is a pretty hard class though, and hes a relatively tough grader but its an interesting class. He uploads his slides but some slides are taken out, most likely to encourage people to attend class.",1
"In order to do good in this class you need to ALL the work and do it exactly right. He takes off points for EVERYTHING. Tests aren't hard, though.",0
Do not take her speech class! She is a really hard grader! You have to dress up for the final and it has to be 13-15mins long or you will fail.  Avoid her at all costs! I passed with a C.,0
"This guy is honestly one the sharpest minds I've ever listened to. It's like he's an AI on autopilot who was left unregulated! The guy almost never pauses, and he always says interesting things. He's also really witty and funny. I had a 16-page paper and one in-class final made up of 4 questions. It was worth it, honestly. This class was wonderful.",1
"Christina has, by far, has the best lectures. You likely won't be bored, plus she does some really cool demos throughout the semester. The class itself is really straight forward; go to lecture, read, do the homework, and you'll definitely pass. The concepts get a little complicated, but put in the effort and you'll succeed no problem.",1
"When I first took cell bio with her, it was tough. After finishing A&P, I think she's one of the best teachers. She teaches what you need to know, and really makes you work to understand it, which is essential! She's also always there to clarifyanswer anything you need!",1
"Quizzes and test do not test over lecture content. The online format is very difficult to navigate. Three-Four quizzes per unit, four or more activities per unit, and, one exam per unit. This totals to over 15 quizzes and approximately seven exams, with over forty activities.  Also, a midterm and final. Excessive work load, in one's opinion.",0
"Absolutely amazing professor. He truly cares about whether or not you understand the material, and reviews a lot. Really interesting material, and just a great overall class. He has published papers, and he really knows what he's talking about. The class makes you think deeply and question what you think you know. Highly recommend.",1
"I thought that i would really enjoy sociology going into this class, but ended up hating it. She made us watch 2 in class movies which i thought were a waste of time.1st exam was awful and she was very defensive when the class tried to talk to her. Also, in class assignments, so make sure to go.I had a 3.8 last quarter, and got a B- in this class.",1
"If you put effort into the assignments and read all the material, you will do well in Prof. Lawrence's classes. Since I took an online class I didn't have much interaction with him, but his comments were always helpful. In general, it's frustrating that BYU makes contacting your prof directly virtually impossible, but that's the school's fault.",1
I loved jamie and her classes. While she can be a little intimidating at first if you just pay attention and participate in class its really fun. She very knowledgeable about dog training and behavior and i've learned a lot from taking both courses. She is also very helpful outside of class and a great resource. Its not a fluff course but not hard.,1
"He's hard, but my writing really improved.  He takes a lot of time to comment on our work, and the comments are helpful.  He's young and really nice.",1
"This course was very interesting and Dr. Flannery gave a ton of resources for it. There was a lot of work for a one credit hour, week long course, but some days were lighter than others and I was able to work ahead so that the final day wasn't so jam packed. There is a paper and a final for this class but it was not outrageously hard.",1
"Nice and enthusiastic, but also difficult and goes far too fast in lectures. There is also an unreasonable amount of online homework. ",1
He explains things and provides good feedback,1
Great easy online course! Mrs. Robertson makes the discussions interesting and easy! Just do all your work on time and you'll get an A!,1
"As a junior biochemistry major, I've had all A/A- in all my sciences courses until this one. I got a C+ and struggled immensely. I don't blame him entirely.. i hated physics and did not work as hard as I should have but he did not make it easy with his unclear lectures and 5 point multiple choice questions on exams. Def would not recommend.",1
"The man is all over the place!  I've had instructors before that you can tell they feel it's beneath them to be forced to teach at a community college level.  I get that vibe from him.  Condescending.  His quizzes are easy if you listen to 10% of what he says.  The rest of it is just talking to hear himself talk, I think.",0
"This class was difficult but like all foreign language classes it takes time and effort to earn the grade you wish to get. Attendance is mandatory and it's also necessary that you do online homework daily. Overall, he was a fair grader and expects a lot out of you as a student.",0
"She's super sweet , class is super easy . I really loved the books we read and I don't even read ,",1
"2017: LECTURES WERE SOOOOOO DRY. i have never been so bored during a class, was a great time to catch up on other classes. She expects you to read a lot, but she gives you interesting novels. She is a very tough grader, extremely picky on exams and midterms. She can come across as sweet, but can also be very sassy (not in a fun way)",0
"This professor is absolutely awful, I would not recommend her at all. She tries really hard to sound smart but when she does it just gets confusing. She is very unclear when giving instructions and it is either her way or the highway. She is a hard grader and is not willing to work with you if you need help.",0
"Maureen has a specific set of hoops that she expects her students to jump through, do that carefully and you'll be fine. Follow the syllabus schedule carefully, read her handouts, speak up in class and don't take things personally. Maureen cares a lot and wants all of her students to do well, she is more than willing to meet outside of class time.",1
Most understanding professor. Treats you with complete respect others. I absolutely loved her. ,1
Took as a Summer Flex 2 class online which was intense. Usually a chapter every other day and the last week was a chapter a day. A 2 paragraph post and a 30 question quiz for each chapter. Quizzes were tough so you must read the chapter. Midterm was from chapter quizzes and Final Exam was based on last 8 chapters. Would take again. ,1
"Listen. This professor has a decent enough rating on here, so maybe he used to be better; however, whatever he is doing now is NOT WORKING. There are about 10 students in the class left because everyone has already dropped. He's disorganized, forgetful, and will actually make you feel like an idiot in front of everyone for asking questions. AVOID!!",0
Explains things to a T. Is extremely clear and willing to help you whenever she can. Terrible with numbers and still ended up with an A- that's how clear she lays it out for you. Highly suggest this prof. Very kind and genuinely cares about her students.,1
Amazing Prof! MAKE SURE YOU RECORD! Talks fast! Basically hands you the answers to the exam through his lectures. So going to class is very important. Also provides review day the lecture prior to the exam. Double checks and provides study guide. Make use of office hours! Do all that and basically it is an easy A!,1
"I don't know if it was because we had to be online, but there was always tons of confusion in this class. He would easily get angry if we didn't know something, even if it was our first day looking at it. He would randomly start ranting about things that weren't related. He didn't show up for class upwards of 5 times with no warning too.",0
He is very willing to help and trys very hard to make the material easy to understand but sometimes he ends up making things more confusing. ,1
She is very nice and knows a lot about photography. I entered the class already having proficient knowledge about photography but still learned a lot and went on to take Photo II. She isn't a harsh grader and she makes her expectations clear. Happy I took this class.,1
"Had Greg for Estimating I. His exams are difficult, but he teaches excatly the skills needed in the field. Wish more professors in the CM department taught as well as he does!",1
"If you want to cover an entire chapter in an hour and a half class period and be quizzed over the material almost every single class, she's the teacher for you. She sits at the front of the class and lectures with a monotone voice so it's hard to pay attention. Since she covers an entire chapter in one class, it's hard to catch up if you fall back.",0
"7 assignments (23% of grade), 3 tests (65% of grade, final is the last test not cumulative), Participation (12% of your grade, based on attendance). Offers up to 8% WORTH OF EXTRA CREDIT ON YOUR FINAL GRADE. Without it, I would not of gotten an A. Prepare to fall asleep every class as he obliviously doesn't notice you lol. Overall really good guy",1
"Took this class because he came recommended. Gotta say, it was worth it. Professor Menjivar knows how to relate the material really well.",1
"Best professor in the English department. He obviously cares about his students and made the course fun, interesting, and important. I would argue this class was the most informative American Lit course I have ever taken. His hair is fantastic and he's hilarious. Take him if you can!!",1
"wpc 101 with Dwosh was very relaxing which is perfect for being a freshman orientation class, highly recommend him, little work outside of class you just have to participate when you are there.",1
He knew what he was doing. With it being online the quizzes were hard to complete with the short time limit. He was always available for questions. Theres weekly homework and options for extra credit. He also offers final forgiveness so if you don't do well a quiz then the final grade can replace 2 of those. He definitely makes you work for it!,1
She is a great teacher if you respect her and make an effort. I would take her again.,1
"Never interacted, just the TAs haha. But from what I've seen, she's not to sore on the eyes! The classes/lecture was run by the TAs and all the hw was online I loved the TAs, but the class was ridiculous. The homework wasn't very related to the class and the tests and written exams were incredibly difficult. Pity I have one semester left.",1
He is the best Math professor iv known so far.,1
World Lit was an amazing class!!! Ignacio is the best. Take every class you can with him!,1
nesvig is one of the best teachers i've had. his class is easy and he is a really funny nice guy. hilarious.,1
My favorite professor at Wayne. Gives great feedback and how to improve in the future. Cares about her students and gives the best opportunities to learn the material.,1
Nice but personally thought it was a difficult class.,1
"Great lecturer. Expects you to put the effort in, and if you do that, you'll learn a lot. The guy has an excellent sense of humor as well. His assignments are laid out with crystal clarity on MyCourses as well. The textbook will help you clarify any concepts or events you might be confused about, and gives you good context for his lectures. ",1
Honestly the course is challenging but I love this professor. If you go to class and do most of the reading than  you should be fine. If you go to his office hours he is very helpful he will answer questions and even take the time to help u grasp the content wether it's with helping link my flash cards together with the time period and terms or just plain explaining it to me he was very helpful. Great teacher if u like a little challenge take him!,1
"People like him, but I wouldn't recommend his classes.  It's hard to study for his class because you really don't know what to study.  His tests are very difficult. he doesn't make clear what you need to know about a specific subject.  He just says ""bacteria will be on the test"" and you're really unsure what you need to know about bacteria.",1
Horrible Chem program!! my advisor told me NOT to take it here and go to another school. you can pass the class. he flys through stuff and the grading system is b.s. (outcomes). if ur not very percise the whole thing is wrong. hes down to eart but u better be ready to work for very little,1
Lots of homework; final exam is cumulative (from chap 1 to 13); don't recommend bc his finals are too much to study for; didn't review his slides ahead; can't explain but he's an easy grader,1
"This dude is the ""stuff"". Hilarious, inspiring. Hate mornings, took this guy for a 8am class. I have never been so happy with a choice before. Immediately in ""awake mode"" when you enter. Relates the ideas of the study to current events. gives small notes. A lot of ""hands off"" teaching. Biggest thing is studying for the midterm, and not slacking off",1
"He is the best Torts professor. He is a little crazy, but he makes the class interesting and clear. You will know what he wants in the final, and you will learn torts with him. Great professor!",1
"THE HARDEST CLASS I'VE EVER TAKEN. Dr. Hollis is a fantastic teacher, really enjoyed the lectures. His tests are incredibly hard and you can be blindsided by the minutiae he will ask about. A lot of writing too, no memorization or preparation for how the information will be tested. Labs are a lot of work but easy good grade Quizzes easy to mess up.",1
This professor is by far my favorite I've had here at BGSU. Super sweet and fun!,1
Very annoying. Gives zeros on papers for little things such as not having your date right. You can redo them but she takes forever to grade. Boring lectures and gets mad if you dont pay attention. Would not recommend,0
Great professor. Lets you wear hats in class and use laptops.,1
"Mrs. Jackson is a good professor. She is easy going and cares about her students. She gives lots of group activities. Do your work, and get an A.",1
"we are like halfway through unit one and I changed my major. These classes are special and if you miss out, it could be the worst thing that happened to you and you wont even know it. Carters classes are all easy if you read and are into learning ideas as ways to change how you think. Takes attendance and has quizzes but his heart is in it so ok",1
Professor Guzzone is easily one of the best professors Pace has to offer.  I always had an interest and love for music but he truly made my love for music sky rocket.  I started to appreciate different styles of music and the cultures which individuals lived in.  Thank you Professor Guzzone!,1
All my prior interest in terms of research vanished when Pam was assigned to the class. Doesn't know how to budget time to teach all material. Doesn't understand how to assign appropriate amounts of work. Her exams were a nightmare - unclear and silly. Avoid at all costs!,0
"He loves to talk about american politics, how great Trump is, and american involvement in other regions rather than the actual curriculum. He also loves to talk about the booming oil industry(its not, its actually beginning to decline)... he isnt very clear about whats on tests and quizzes but hands out a quiz ever class period.",0
"I took his class a year ago, and did everything he said to get an A in the class. First off, he will grade you tests/papers poorly if you are a Republican. I would site pages from the text books he gave in class, and would go into detail about my explanation. If you even show a glimpse that you are right wing BOOM C- on a final. What a joke.",0
"Little to no communication. Easiest A I've ever received. However, if you're looking for an extension or miss a dead line, he will not give it to you, under ANY circumstances. You could be in a coma and this guy will not make an exception.",0
I think Mrs. Bowlin is a great teacher. I really enjoyed her class this year. She had us work in groups and I made some new friends on top of learning about Sociology. Thank you Mrs. Bowlin!,1
"This course was useless. The only useful thing I learned was how to write grant applications. Dean was a boring professor who only talked about his area of expertise.... FORESTRY! He has a lot of experience working abroad in natural resource development, but is not interesting at all.",0
"His lectures were based on the book but he also did many problems from outside sources that were relevant to the lecture. I had to put in a lot of work as the class was mostly proof writing and I had never done proofs before. On the plus side, he is a very easy grader. There were times I got problems wrong and he would take off maybe a point.",1
"Unbelievably easy class. Good if you just need a class to pass easily; however, you will not leave the class with a clear understanding on the important subject of Sociology. Sweet lady.",1
"Great Prof! There is a group project and a single page paper on an article. Marking could be a bit easier. Very enthusiastic lecturer, and the class was pretty easy to understand and not a lot of work.",1
"I took this class online for Spanish 101, and I highly recommend it.  The course is clearly laid out right from the start and the weekly assignments were very reasonable.  I actually enjoyed the online work.  She drops several homework and quiz grades, so it's pretty flexible.  I took another instructor for 102, and it wasn't nearly as organized.",1
I'm loving this class! Putting in the work and getting A's. Great teacher I have actually learned new concepts!,1
"MATH122 is hard enough of a class as it is, especially to teach, but if Argerami is teaching it AVOID LIKE THE PLAUGE. The content of our class never lined up with SI, and Argerami was hard to understand with the way he went about doing his examples.",0
"Assigns TONS of homework (esp. readings) and expects you to do it thoroughly and come to class prepared to engage in in-depth discussions. She cares about letting the writing style be determined by the message, so nothing is set in stone. She wants to free you as a writer from the rigidity of the dreaded 5-paragraph essay. Great class, but tough.",1
"She is one of the laziest teachers i have ever had at any university. Her ""lectures"" are just her reading random points from the book and telling us what the test questions will be. She puts absolutely no effort into class and then is confused as to why none of the students want to participate. I would avoid her at all costs if you want to learn",0
Take someone else if you can,0
"Prof Kim is an amazing lecturer! As long as you show up and take notes, and keep up with the readings you should do fine. His exams are very fair, no trick questions. The essays are not bad at all, especially with the TAs and Prof Kim being so willing to help. Would definitely recommend taking ASA with him!",1
"Anne is a great professor and I enjoyed taking Geophysics with her a lot. She is down to earth, explains the material well, and is more than willing to help you out. The class itself is very interesting and problem solving based. Not immensely difficult and I felt like  got a lot out of the course.",1
"Prof. Muir is very well educated in the class I took- Income Tax. He is easily approachable. Uses the textbook and homework in Cengage. Class is easy and informative. Group paper at the end of the semester. Make sure you have a team, he almost forgot to place us and only gave 2 weeks for the paper to be completed.  Would def take him again",1
"You would expect a professor who teaches an online class to respond to her emails... Well at least that's what I expected. The course is designed poorly, but the exams aren't too hard. The labs didn't really make sense and were unorganized. Blackboard is copied and pasted from past years and there are a lot of spelling mistakes. Do not TAKE!!!!!!!!",0
"I can't speak on her other classes as this is the only one I've taken from her, but she provided a fun and fair experience for CMST 102. I really enjoyed her class for the most part; the in-class writings were a little annoying but pretty doable. You can get by not reading that much. Last class I took before going to UW and it was well worth it.",1
"One of the best professors I've ever had.  Unlike most college instructors, Dr. Thana provides students with challenging assignments so that they will actually learn something (if they care to).  I am grateful for all of his classes.",1
"She was terrible! She was inconsistent, and was never focused. She would tell some nonsense story for half of the class. Also, she assigned meaningless homework assignments that were subject to change the day it was due. I disliked this class immensely.",0
He was a great professor. Easy class although you do have to write a few papers and you can't skimp on work.,1
Very thorough lecturer who takes pains to explain concepts to students in a comprehensive manner. Compared to other classes in this program his exams are more difficult - but people complaining about him need to understand that compared to other universities UW EE is a JOKE. This may be the only guy in the department who tries to challenge students,1
She was fantastic!  Very knowledgeable and very passionate about the brain!,1
"One of the best professors I have had, he is very credible and always willing to help and clarify material.  David knows his stuff and keeps each lecture interesting. Make sure you do the moodle assignments and keep up to date with the online readings and links. ",1
"She really is not bad at all. She explains the work very well in class. I like the way she teaches, open book quizzes and exams so great. I recommend her and I don't like to do a lot of work so believe me she is ok!",1
"To start off, THIS IS A WEED OUT CLASS. This means that the class is required to take if you are majoring and he tries to really motivate people to do their best. Tom is a really nice guy who loves his students. He makes it known he wants you to succeed in the major and does everything to prepare you for the future. Very hard class, but rewarding.",1
Difficult to say the least. Nice guy but not clear about what he wants. Super hard for a core class. I've had A's in theology previously and it was really really hard to get a B. He's definitely not easy and has ridiculously high expectations.,0
I found him very geeky and there is so much you can learn from him.,1
Prof was cool but he reads off the powerpoint that he provides.,1
Doesn't know how to park at Tim Horton's TOTAL FAUX-PAS!!!,0
"One of the best teachers at Bates, would definately recommend to all....",1
"God awful professor, he cant answer a question straight forward for his life. Every time you ask him something he gives you more than his life story and then doesn't even answer the question. He is absolutely unorganized and every time he opened his mouth i cringed at the thought of what would come out. Would not recommend him to anyone. ever.",0
"Best. Professor. Ever. Definitely has a heart for his students and is concerned with ensuring that they succeed. He is good at knowing what to expect of his students and pushes them to reach their full potential and have them put out their best work. Also, he's Canadian. Nuff said.",1
"This is a flipped classroom, so if that isn't helpful for you then don't take this class. However, she tells you way before add/drop that this is the case and you even get to try it for a couple weeks before deciding to switch classes. I personally enjoyed this because working on problems w others in class led me to learn material better.",1
"She'll make you feel horrible! She will insult you. You'll feel like you don't have what it takes to become a teacher. Honestly, the meanest teacher ever. She made so many people cry. She's the hardest person to please too.",0
"Everyone has their niche. Teaching & explaining is not Rogers niche. One of, maybe the worst professor I have ever had!  Take someone else.",0
"Overall, pretty good lecturer. Makes his material easy to follow, and gives helpful examples. However, be prepared for homework questions that you were not prepared for on quizzes. He also posts his own lecture notes online, and that is extremely helpful. once you get used to reading the right side of the page first.",1
Tom is like an awkward teddy bear who happens to kick butt at all things math. He is the best teacher I've encountered at Duke. He reduces complicated math lingo to clear concepts. He's also super approachable and has hilarious dry humor. Definitely do not miss lecture; he teaches diff than the textbook. Understand EVERYTHING before testing. A+++++,1
Easily gets distracted. Rambles a lot. Turns a five minute information session into 20 useless minutes. She can be demeaning and talk down to you. Can make you feel very stupid. Also doesn't mind confronting and embarrassing you in front of your patients so make sure you are 100% ready to enter the patient's room with her.,0
This was a great class! He recreates local government as the final exam! (I don't think the comment below is from a former student - wrong class number),1
"Great teacher, really nice guy, would take him again.",1
"She's a really nice lady, but a boring teacher.  Lectures lack structure, just a lot of quotes on slides as she jumps from topic to topic.  Slips in political comments irrelevant to the topic (every single lecture and often multiple times per lecture), which is annoying because this is a lit class.",1
Hardest class I have ever taken.,0
"Attendance is not mandatory, but he will use the fact that you are not in class against you. Along with this, he gives quizzes every week. He does not actually teach you how to do problems, just throws a bunch of equations at you and expects you to know how to use them to solve a problem when he has not shown you.",0
"5 papers, the grade she gives you is random but never lower than a B. She says the textbook matters but it doesn't, not worth the price. Class time isn't anything special so easy to skip. She is very flexible on due dates. Very nice lady, not a great teacher.",1
"The textbook and the lecture are word for word the same. Completely and utterly useless. The lectures are SOO long for no apparent reason, but the content itself is interesting. The way it takes forever to make notes, and her tests are based on fine details rather than the general topics. -11/10 would not recommend!",0
"Li Liu is amazing! Her lectures are very INTERESTING, quizzes are based on a textbook, discussion posts are pretty easy. Li Liu has great communication skills, she's very CARING and will work with you if you have any problem or need extra help. Her assignments helped me to become a better communicator, succeed at work and understand people better.",1
Excellent proffessor. Very clear. Very interesting. Lots of energy. Id recommend for anybody.,1
"Harvey is the best professor for chemistry within the LACCD system. She clearly tells you what you need to study for her exams, gives you countless examples of every type of problem that you will encounter on the exams and makes the lab time very constructive and focused. You literally just have to listen to what she says and you can get an A",1
"I enjoyed this class overall. Prof Smith is funny and nice, although lectures can get dry after a while. I actually read the textbook and thought it helped me on the tests. The midterm and final were reasonable, just make sure that you actually study because you will not do well if you rely solely on your notes. Test questions are at times wordy.",1
No Comments,0
She clearly cares about her students but unfortunately does not meet the mark as a professor. She assigns readings and documentaries that are very long and complicated and blatantly boring. She puts thought into her lectures but unfortunately does not capture interest. She is also very set in her opinion and does not make room for other ones.,0
He tends to grad differently for each student. He is very loose on what he actually wants. He will also allow some students to turn in late work but not others.,0
Personally wouldnt take it. Its a lot of info to study and the long ppt doesnt really help. Too quick to explain and its like you dont even know what to ask because of how fast the lecture is going. Better if slow and if wants us to enjoy class but using Honorlock testing doesnt allow to enjoy. Cares for students. Didnt enjoy & zoned out.,1
"She never clarifies what exactly to study and the whole class is her ranting about her life. She's very outspoken and kind of funny at times, but she's bitter. She does NOT take any excuse for hw or test make-up, even if you were in the hospital or in a car accident, she DOESN'T CARE! would NOT EVER!Take her class again, i like my teachers to care.",0
"don't take class with him..he didn't give easy grade,and also he think you are teaching for parageraph,and i think this system for english teaching in palomar college is very bad..",0
First day of class stated that she rarely gives an A grade. Doesn't feel that students can write on that level. Don't expect her to put grades into the computer until the last day of the semester. Quizzes for the first half of the semester on homework reading. I would attempt to avoid her class if possible. Formal writing for an informal world.,0
Really cool class. requires two books. Long lectures that are all spoken with not detailed notes that do not follow textbook. Only two tests and lost of worksheets.,1
"Very sweet and helpful. Seems like a professional in her field. But she says one thing and then later says and does the opposite. Unreasonably tough grader. The class had some of the most interesting topics for me ever, and the most annoying teacher ever.",0
"Nice guy who is willing to help, assigns a lot of reading but he is very fair to the students. Take his class!",1
"Doctor Shahrrava may be good in his field, but he is definitely not a great professor. He lacks everything that a teacher/professor should possess. He teaches as if he is talking to himself, totally ignoring questions asked by students. He lacks communication, compassion, understanding, etc. for his students. He should retire as a professor!",0
"KMac's lectures are boring as he takes very long to explain each process and he usually does a lot of errors in his calculations. However, he clearly knows a lot about statistics and that's nice. Don't expect your midterm grades to be returned. We're already entering second semester and I still don't have my grade...",1
"One of the best lecturers at Cov uni, he really knows his stuff.  Lectures with passion, is open and honest but makes you think for yourself.  Doesn't bore you by just reading from slides. Can be a little tactless but that's all part of his character!  If you want an honest opinion (& be prepared to listen) see Mark.",1
"Professor Gibbons was very hard to reach beyond class; she seemed to always have an excuse. Readings were a bit dense and lengthy, but were always discussed in class. On paper assignments she was a tough grader. When I finally meet with her to discuss the papers, she tore them apart and offered no constructive criticism. Would not recommend.",0
Take Dr. K.  I would take him again.  Read material & you will past. You need the book and the exams are sort of hard.  Take note of weekly sessions because he locks them each week.  The notes will be helpful during exam time.  Awesome professor,1
"I took the web course during Spring.  Tests are straight out of Powerpoints.  There will be group projects to do, which is odd, since it is a web course.  It is kind of a pre-accounting course.",1
"Andor is one of the most caring, kindest professors I have ever had. He is incredibly educated and passionate about what he teaches. It is a heavier amount of work, but if you're passionate and interested then it really isn't that bad. He is very open to working with any disabilities or issues that you may be having as long as you bring it up early",1
"Dr. Braun is amazing and a valuable asset to the University of Akron.  She is witty and funny and an expert in her field.  Expect a lot of reading, but class is structured to be part lecture and part discussion and she really does listen to what you have to say and expands on anything you find interesting.  She is a fair grader and gives feedback.",1
"Professor Stinnette is really one of those professors that you'll never forget. She's hilarious (especially at 8:50 at night which was a welcome surprise) but she expects you to work hard. Don't think you'll be able to slack off and pass her class. She is willing to work with students and offers help and feedback, which I really appreciated.",1
"Ms. Magallon was my best teacher. She gives clear assignment instructions and gives great feedback. If you follow her feedback, you can't get below a B on any paper. The books were interesting and really engaged me. I would take her again if I could!! Really gets the class engaged as well. Fun, interesting and easy class.",1
Best professor ever . Class is super easy . Speeches are not long,1
"Professor Walter is a really, really nice guy.  Class is kind of boring and he plays goofy outdated videos on Fridays but this class is an easy A to fulfill the Quan skill requirement.",1
"great teacher, very nice, very funny, makes class interesting- just don't be late!",1
Demands alot but knows the information and cares. Tests are not easy but the class was rewarding in the long run.,1
Very Difficult. If I could give her a 0 I would. The learning style is horrible. When Ms. Lewis go over the lesson its like she never taught them before. She do quizzes portfolios and Aleks as well. Not will to work with you.,0
Prof Bertram is very knowledgeable and passionate about teaching and sharing what he knows to students. Take notes/record the lectures and do all the homework's. Test and quizzes are not easy so make sure to study. He gives many chances and extra credit so take advantage of it. STUDY STUDY STUDY!!!,1
"Very knowledgeable and seems like a nice guy, lectures can be difficult to stay focused on however",1
He was a terrible teacher. Never even taught.. just told us what to look at in the book. He would then give a quiz that no one would get right and insist that it is our fault and that we did indeed learn it when we didn't. Tests are impossible to finish in 50 minutes. Curves the course average to a 75 which means most people get a C.,1
avoid at all cost.,0
I didn't believe the rumors I'd heard. I should have. Flee this class. You're still reading. Flee I said!,0
"I enjoyed this class but she does tend to go off on tangents sometimes, especially with the current event articles every class. Beyond that, I learned a lot and it wasn't a super difficult class.",1
"This class is very time consuming. You must pay attention and come to class. If not you will fall behind and fail. He tries to make it clear and simple. He is very laid back. But if you email him, he only answers back half the time. Decent but yet stressful class.",1
"Lectures are pretty boring, but the material is interesting. The tests are taken directly from the quiz and clicker questions. If you do bad on a test, she will make it a point to meet with you and help. Very easy honors credit.",1
"Old school prof. While I don't mind an old school prof, and everyone teaches differently, this man reeked of pompous arrogance. His class was him ensuring everyone realized his importance. 50% midterm on an Econ elective to a fourth year class, and a rude class-wide email responding to the low average. 8000 word essay. Needs to check ego at door!",0
"I could not stand this professor. Dashley was one of the worst math teachers I have ever had. She was just completely rude when a student would ask a question. By the end of the semester, no one wanted to participate because she was so degrading in her responses. Also, how she grades your homework is ridiculous...",0
"interesting class, made it easier to learn",1
Her tests are not that difficult if you take notes which she makes easy by providing a video lecture and a powerpoint for each chapter. There is quite a bit of writing between the assignments and the paper but these are fair and straightforward. She's cheerful and quick to respond to questions.,1
"Loves assigning weekly APA papers. Need to read every chapter if you want even a chance to succeed in discussion forums. Learning is really up to you, he will posts material (took online). Does give very clear grading criteria which is helpful, but takes forever to grade papers and to respond to emails. Smart guy and keeps the class interesting.",1
No rubrics or clear instructions for essays.,0
"Paul is a really good guy, and as long as you pay attention in lectures and study for the two midterms and final, you'll do fine. He is really knowledgable and passionate about the music industry. There is one essay and a few discussion posts and book quizzes, but thats it.",1
She is actually really good when it comes to teaching the class because she did live in spain (and always talks about it) but she is always there to help you if you don't understand. She does go over everything on test and there is a self test in the textbook. She can be unclear sometimes I will admit but it is a very easy class. I recommend her.,1
Professor was obviously new but semester got better over time.,1
Very helpful always has a positive attitude!!!,1
"Believe all previous reviews. She posted a take-home test (a day late) with only 77 of 100 questions and didn't send an email after she updated. Several students showed up to class with only 77 questions answered. She randomly gives good papers Fs, but usually gives full credit. Final exam tip: most questions from chapter summaries in book.",0
"Best professor I have ever had, but also really difficult. I have never learned so much in a class before, but it was totally worth it in the end. If you want to really learn something thoroughly, take one his his classes. Amazing teacher.",1
He is a really good teacher. He gives you extra problems other then the hw which really really help on the test. His lectures however are really long. To me his test are easy as long as you look at the extra problems he puts on blackboard.,1
"would literally open the slideshows and skip through almost all of the slides and go ""you probably know this"" like no we really dont plus i ended with a 79.5 and the dude basically told me if i had done better on a few quizzes i would have had the grade i wanted so he wouldnt bump me like yeah do you not understand how grades work? was concerning",0
Not a good experience at all.,0
"Over the top intense in lectures but I really do think this is a teaching strategy. Very engaging, hilarious, sometimes goes off on a bit of a tangent on material not relevant to the class wasting time. Did a good job considering this is his first time teaching this course. I found the lab way more challenging than the theory from lecture",1
"Best college professor I've had yet. Polite, in touch, hip, and smart, Apryl is the type of professor who makes you excited to learn. You will do a fair amount of writing in this class, however, it's an English class, so one should expect that. Taking Apryl's class will be one of the more motivating experiences in ones college life!",1
"Although, Dr. Johansen was a fun professor in person, once COVID hit she completely forgot about us and mostly assigned reading we didn't use. Grades are completely based on tests and quizzes. Easy A, just didn't learn much.",1
"You either hate her or love her. either way an entertaining class. You learn to laugh at yourself and at her quirks...she also has the most experience you will ever find in a prof in canada who is a playwrite. i loved it and am takin a second course, but mostly for the humor of it all.",1
"2nd time taking him and still one of my favorite professors. He's a hysterical guy so even though he has the most monotone voice ever he still keeps class interesting. Exams aren't too different from slides and in-class exercises, but his projects are the absolute worst. He also doesn't give back all your grades so I don't know why I got what I got",1
"He is running capstone this year. He is terrible. Poor communication and organizational skills. We met maybe 4 times over both semesters, excluding our progress presentations, which went terribly. He told groups their projects weren't difficult enough, despite having already approved them. Just goes to show he didn't read the proposals.",0
very unprofessional. would not take again,1
"Ethan is a good professor who cares about how his students learn and change throughout the class. He is a very tough grader and there is a lot of outside work, but part of that is the nature of the course. He doesn't lecture which can make it challenging, but if you work hard and ask him questions, you can be successful and learn a lot.",1
Awesome teacher. Very thorough! The test is from the material in class and the study guides. She gives a lot of opportunities for points other than the tests which is helpful. She also drops the lowest test grade. Would recommend Ms. Smith to anyone!,1
Awesome Teacher. I would highly recommend him. We need more teachers like Mr. Edward,1
"Mr. Schlorrt, while a tough grader, helped me learn and appreciate the nuances of history more than any other proffessor I have had.",1
"This textbook was written by him, so he always makes reference to it in class. Quizzes every week based entirely on the textbook chapter with 5 written questions you're given beforehand (which you answer 3 of in the quiz) and 14-15 multiple choice. Super easy if you do the work. 1 midterm, 1 reflection assignment. Superb prof.",1
"MS is hilarious and makes lectures really enjoyable. Only grades are 3 midterm exams and the final exam, so that makes it really difficult. I got a 75% overall which was curved to a B, so there is a decent curve. Orgo is super hard, but MS makes exams relatively straight-forward which helps some.",1
"He's a good professor and his tests are super easy. He's just too keen on jazz, which I found kind of annoying",1
"Dr. SASS is amazing. Her class is easy as long as you do the readings. She doesn't do exams but has in class (open note) short essays and does oral quizzes. The quizzes aren't hard. She'll call on you for an answer, which come right out of the book, and she never tries to trick you with questions. Jokes around in class Absolutely loved her.",1
Dr. Ortega does have a THICC accent but he is extremely passionate on what he teaches. He talks very fast but EVERYTHING is on the powerpoints and the tests are solely on the powerpoints. He even highlights what you need to know. His tests are very straightforward. No homework except an occasional video. Clicker questions are important.,1
"Terri is very nice, but she can't really teach. She just reads straight off the PowerPoint and doesn't elaborate on anything. It's pretty much up to you to learn the material on your own. Her tests and quizzes are all multiple choice, but she words her questions weirdly and asks things we don't really cover in class. Avoid if possible.",0
Fun teacher. Make sure you go to class (on time) and don't get on her bad side...,1
She is a good teacher but somewhat harsh on papers. Sometimes she didn't explain well the assignments but if you put your effort you'll for sure pass.,1
"Caflisch is one of the best professors I have ever had. Her study guides are very similar to what you need to know on the exam or quiz, if you are feeling like you did terrible on an assignment or exam, she will meet with you personally and hype you up and give you pointers and she is an absolute gem. Highly recommend her!! Absolutely love her!",1
"A decent teacher for most of Calc II, but when he gets to infinite series and sequences, he does a terrible job explaining it. You shouldn't have much trouble as long as you have access to a math tutor for the topics above. If you aren't familiar with Mathematica, get familiar.",1
"I found her to be very freindly in class, but outside of class, she gave me the impression i was bothering her. work load wasn't that bad.",1
"Great professor, she presents everything very clearly. Her assignments are graded fairly and easily for the most part, and her exams are straight forward. Its easy to do well in her courses. I recommend taking any class with her. She made stats a breeze",1
she's the worse,0
"Class was garbage just like the quarter before, just as unforgiving and overall didn't teach anything well. He graded the homework at the same percentage as the tests and the final was only 20% of your grade. Absolute joke, stay clear of this man.",0
"Dr. Jaja is the most unaproachable person I have ever met, She would test us on things that we never learned, accused me of cheating when I asked her to fix my grades. Overall, rude and not nice.",0
Professor Disney is a great teacher. She is nice and very helpful. I recommend to take one of her classes in the future!,1
Lectures were confusing and long winded. He is a nice person and tries hard to convey the information however he loses the students in the process. I have been to every class and still do not know what we have been doing. I literally put in random numbers on the homework assignments and do that until I get the correct answer. There is no hope. ,1
"Very to the point with his lectures. Class didn't make sense until right before the first midterm. After that, tests were exactly what he said they'd be on, which was also very similar to the hw/quizes.",1
"He's a nice guy and gives no graded homework, just readings. His tests are tough. You have to take notes on the lectures but also about the reading discussions. He gives a super detailed study guide for every test so if you take good notes and apply them to the guide, you'll be fine. If you miss class then you'll miss a lot of information.",1
Professor Burrows is an amazing professor. She was always there to help and give good advice. I would highly recommend her.,1
"Prof. Rafferty is a good wake up call for an 8 am class. She's funny, extremely nice and helpful, and makes learning fun. I've found a great kindred spirit to come to for questions about any kind of physics, and she's really lenient with some grades. She's always willing to help, and I would absolutely recommend taking her for PHYS101.",1
"Professor Touchstone is great! He really cares about the material that he is teaching and does his best to make it fun. He does strictly follow the University's attendance policy, but as long as you show up, getting an A shouldn't be a problem. Most assignments are online, and not super time consuming. All in all, loved this professor!",1
I took this course as an elective credit. I have strong conservative values and Sara really looks to challenge those and expects you to become a different person. Some topics I strongly disagreed with but felt in a liberal space I couldn't speak up. I found it hard to write the papers for the course b/c there was no material to support my values.,1
"Intro to Animation is best after you have learned basics of drawing & self-discipline. This class requires dedication to the effort that must be put into your work. Michael's lectures are very effective, then he gives you the space to test the theories & practice. No hand holding. Loved the class & Professor.",1
"Dr. Williams provides many opportunities for extra credit which is really cool. His lectures are a real drag though, and I mean a real drag. Overall, if you go to the test reviews and do the study guide, you should make an A in the class. But, attendance is mandatory, which isn't fun because the lectures are a little boring.",1
"Probably the worst prof at OU. Flies through lectures with little to no practical explanation of the material and expects students to retain all the info (even skipped a chapter that was covered on final). Quizzes are 10 Qs that cover 5 chapters of material. Pretty much need to teach yourself with the textbook, and even that can only help so much.",0
"Mr. Paramsothy Thananjeyan was a great lecturer but not necessarily a great teacher. Personally, I found him rather bland. He's not the worst, but he could be much better.",0
I wanted to learn about foreign policy instead we learned about gender and social stuff. Is a bit snarky and elitist. Not always clear. Would avoid for foreign policy.,0
Mike Malone was very thorough in his explanations. His test questions are identical to the quizzes. So do the quizzes and you should be good to go. Homework is not mandatory but it helps with memory retention of common methods. I had him for Calc 1 Spring and now I'm taking him for Calc 2 summer term (4 wks shorter).,1
"If there is one thing I can say about the class, it is the unbelievable amount of work you will have to manage. I learned so much during 16 weeks, but I wish the grade distribution could be better. Looooooooooong assignments which take weeks to complete were worth less than a 1.5-hour exam. ",1
"I took archaeology out of a general interest for the field and prof. brown didnt disappoint, he does alot of full class lectures but keeps them interesting using physical as well as digital examples and honestly I never fell asleep in his class so they must've been interesting lectures. I would definitely take another ANT class again and recommend.",1
I really like the way he teaches history. Not only do he explain whats going on but he gives out so many examples that will help you to understand better. He likes to crack jokes a lot. He gives extra credit for missing 2 or less classes and if you are a registered voter. Honestly I wish I had more teachers like him. Very nice and caring.,1
"Very boring, no tests only quizzes. Group final project",0
"It was pretty easy. He takes attendance. He offers extra credit. You had to do several speeches, including a group presentation. You had to write some essays but there very easy.",1
"Professor was great. Do the extra credit. Test are base on power points, class info, and the book. You have to purchase the book. Test can be tricky, but most answers are found on the power point. Great class to take if you have kids or you deal with kids on a daily basis. Everyone should be required to take this class.  You can get an A or B.",1
Dr. Galatowitsch deserves an award. Take this professor!! He's an amazing faculty member in every since of the word: His lectures are quality; he gives tons of feedback; and he's committed to mentoring students both in and outside of the classroom. He deserves the highest of acclamations.,1
"Best Professor I've had at Wright ! TAKE HIM. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!**** He teaches the class in a way that makes math seem very easy. He will explain everything until you understand, show up, pay attention and do the homework and you will pass. I will sure miss going to his class.",1
"He's a nice prof but goodness is his class BORING. I took it during summer semester and I swear it dragged so slowly it was almost painful going to his class every day. That said the work is simple, he gives tons of extra credit at 5pts/piece, and his tests are very easy so long as you pay attention hard as it may be. No textbook needed to buy.",1
"Please don't give yourself a heart attack by taking her, this is not fair in pandemic putting so much pressure on students and heavy test and tough in grading. So Big NO! just run away!",0
"Not a super hard class as long as you do the work, the work is confusing as hell. His website looks like a third grader learning how to use the highlight text tool on word for the first time, and there are way to many links.",1
I'm taking his class now that he's at University of Michigan and he's my favorite prof of all time. I love that man. He is a real gem. He really cares about the success of his students and is very interesting and just all around amazing. He works to build you up (plus you can rewrite any essay for a better grade). Steve is the best. Take his class!,1
"Kim excels at teaching the subject matter in an efficient, yet introspective manner, making him pretty inspirational. He is also extremely understanding of other student's circumstances, especially considering 2020. Ask, and you shall receive. While quite serious most of the time, he's got rare moments of humor that nobody sees coming. real legend.",1
"Very fun teacher, I recomend you to take his class",1
"She is nice, but most of the times she would talk about the Cubs game. She tries to make the class fun, and time is not efficiently spent. At times she was not helpful, and would not recommend to everyone. ",0
"Great man and a great teacher!!! Truly an educator and a good man. He speaks his mind and is old fashion which i loved! Show up to his classes pay attention, be courteous, and do well on his quiz, 2 tests and paper and youll do fine...( BTW: Do the paper on something he loves to talk about! Easy A!)",1
"Super amazing women and super easy class. Theres rarely any homework and the midterm and final were both open book/open laptop. Easy A. Plus, Prof Marshall is an absolute sweetheart. She genuinely cares about the students and wants them to learn. She shows a real interest in our lives and education which is awesome. ",1
"Dr. Sankara is wonderful! He expects a lot from his students, but he is fair. He is always willing to answer questions during class, after class, & via email. This man is a true academic who cares about what he teaches and cares that his students REALLY learn it. He teaches & grades French-style (aka his classes are not for bums).",1
I took her for Calculus II.  She is a very nice person.  She is also patient.,1
He's great in helping and directing student to achieve great goals to every student. Great sense of HUMOUR.... Great Guy,1
"Easy class if you pay attention and take notes in class, as well as read the textbook. She posts the powerpoints online, so writing supplementary things she says is helpful. Mandatory clicker questions for attendance. Overall, it is an easy class if you try. Test questions a lot of the time come from the chapter quizzes and test review.",1
"Hard hard class, but all psych majors have to take it and take it with her. She expalins things and gives packets that will help you to learn and to understand. Yay for part takehome tests",1
"He is amazing professor, really chill and awesome. take him for any class and you will love it",1
Knows his stuff. As long as you show up and give an effort you'll pass. Easy A course. Highly recommend. If I could I would definitely take again,1
"He is the best, really kind and helpful. Totally willing to meet you halfway and really understanding. A super fair grader too!",1
Grading scale seems really inconsistent and he is not at all accommodating of students issues; class is super hard and the only support is super crowded TA hours.,0
She's a cool teacher. Very passionate. Just do your work and she'll help you. But you gotta do your work though. Would recommend Ms. Hayden to anybody.,1
this guy is awesome...questions? Comments? good times,1
asynchronous class but made a lot of effort to keep certain synchronous zoom field trips. always available and EASY EASY class for physical breadth. learned a lot about earthquakes too v good class,1
"This is one of the best kinds of graduate school professors: the kind that will challenge you, enrich your experience, and provide you with vital tools to move forward. She is not an easy professor and takes hits from no one. But she is empathetic and willing to invest her time in you if you are proactive.",1
"Her ECON-UB 10 Course is perfect. The workload is relatively huge in the first month but will be fine thereafter. I'm the only freshman in this intermediate-level course and I got an A. If I can do it, I think you can do that too.",1
"Such a sweet woman! She's very easy to get along with and it really isn't that difficult to get on her good side. As a teacher, she is quite laid-back and loves to joke around a lot which does lead to going off topic sometimes. Don't be afraid to talk to her, she's very understanding. Plus, she does swear in class. Super entertaining!",1
"One of the only times Ive enjoyed a gen ed class and it was all because of Kosnik. He doesnt read off slides like some people. He knows what hes talking about and knows how to teach it. He gets to and through the point quickly, so class is usually short but still effective.",1
she talks too much.,0
"She's a good professor, and is easy to follow. She goes through powerpoints every class so its easy to take notes. Gives a lot of extra credit and tells you whats going to be on a test. If you study like a good two hours for a test, you will be fine. She's really nice and the material is easy! I skip a decent amount and just get notes online.",1
"A tough grader and will nitpick your assignment for any flaw she can deduct points on. Tests are relatively difficult and you only get 30 minutes to complete them. Does offer extra credit and provides semi-decent feedback on each assignment. Failed to submit final grades for the class by the due date, so I still don't know my grade yet",0
"One of the best teachers I've ever had.  Makes class fun, grades fairly, knows his stuff, gets the class involved, tells good stories, funny, etc.",1
"I spent a significant amount of time with Prof. O'Donnell back in '81-82. Loved volunteering with the theater group.I was initially terrified of her and speaking in public. While I remain nervous about speaking in public, I do it frequently and I owe it all to her for giving me the confidence and providing me with the skills to continue. Thank you",1
Physics sucks He's the easiest out of the phys prof He's difficult af if you dk how he works to pass & maybe even get a decent grade Do ALL the mastering & written hw its a ton don't wait until last min answers on google WATCH LEC VID & WRITE DWN ALL EQ & WHEN TO USE THEM IN 1 PLACE- exams r xactly like hw but 3 ?s WRITE IN DETAIL WHEN TO USE EQ!!,1
"ONE OF THE BEST TEACHERS I HAVE HAD, BECAME A PERSONAL FRIEND AND HAS PROVIDED GUIDANCE FOR ME THAT HAS BEEN WORTH ITS WEIGHT IN GOLD FOR MY LIFE. HE IS PASSIONATE ABOUT LEADERSHIP AND GRADES HARD IN THAT CLASS, BUT IT WILL MAKE YOU A BETTER LEADER AND GET YOU GROWING AS A PERSON",1
"this is an online class; teacher made it very clear and easy to follow.  I was afraid to take an online class, but after this experience I am sure that I will take others. Tests are difficult but fair.  If you read, study and stay current you will do just fine",1
"This is one instructor that will make you laugh, smile, and cry all in the same day. His story is so amazing, everything he has been through has made him a better teacher and I have to say it was a pleasure knowing him while I had his class. When possible take one of his classes because you will not be sorry you did.",1
AMAZING! A little socially awkward but best teacher I've ever had at pbsc.,1
"Newsom-Kerr is a cool guy. He's very nice and presents the material in a clear way. Quizes every day, but easy if you did the reading (and you can make up as many of them as you want). Enjoyable and non-threatening way of learning history.",1
Kevin is excellent. He wants you to learn something. Always has excellent feedback and input.,1
This class was easy. Grade consists of a paper based on volunteer work and a paper based on a movie. I barely went to class and got an A. She's so sweet and willing to help all the time.,1
"KMack is an essential part of the 'McGill Experience'. He is a great lecturer, super straightforward, and gives questions that are similar to what comes on the midterm and final. I like to call him the gentle giant. Attendance was low for the class, which is why I think the average is bad. BEWARE, extremely unorganized, he messed up all my grades.",1
"Easiest class I've taken! Material is hard but her tests are easy! Straight from her notes, most are fill in the blank but she also has some multiple choice & matching. Even gives a few small hints on tests. She even gave us a word bank on the muscles test! Gives lots of points for homework & attending class.. Gives several ""bonus"" quizzes too!",1
"She is very helpful, gives very clear assignments and good feedback. You can tell she cares about her students! Would definitely recommend her.",1
A seminar based class where professionalism is discussed to prepare you for psychology world after undergrad. Very fun class where you get to discover what you want to be. He prepared and informed so well on how to be a true professional in the field. He is the best professor I have ever had.,1
"One of the least helpful and least responsive professors I've ever had. She never responded to my emails by answering the questions I had she always just redirected me to the tutoring center, even for technical issues that the tutoring center couldn't really help with. I wouldn't recommend this teacher to anyone.",0
"A tough Professor, shes very serious in class but very knowledgeable about the material. speak to her one on one for help. People came in with the impression of her as a bad professor b/c of that, they treated her poorly and got angry at her quickly. If you listen to her, its not difficult. She can come off as cold but shes just blunt and honest",1
Wonderful teacher. Very easy online course. Turn everything in on time. Follow his formulas and tips on becoming a better writer. He will respond to your emails and answer your questions thoroughly. You will get an easy A. I am delighted to have been taught by such a quality professor.,1
"a great dude and pretty good professor. stutters occasionally and loves to say ""out there."" he puts a big emphasis on pulling your own weight because he genuinely wants you to succeed. he's funny and keeps his lectures interesting.",1
Barcley is by far one of my favorite professors from WMU. He still gave me an BA-A in the course even though I would pull practical jokes on him. Like sending his snap chat name to his former students and telling them to send him photos of puppies. On the serious note Barcley has helped me to develop as a entrepreneur and a great mentor. -AW,1
Jim's awesome but sometimes his criteria is not very well explained. He cares about all of his students and his tests aren't terrible if you study. You learn a lot about actual practice which is helpful.,1
"Awesome teacher. The class is so much fun and you can tell he loves what he's doing. He's a very talented guy also so check out his concert, take this class!",1
"Mr. Luckett is passionate about Social Work and  truly wants his student to learn something.  Attendance matters and sometimes this counts for extra credit when you show up 100%. If you take detailed notes (especially during the text review day) there's no reason you can't pass.  Great teacher, I enjoyed his class. ",1
"If I could give Dr. Brown a 0, I would. He is by far the worst instructor I have EVER had. This was an asynchronous class, so there was no live lectures through Zoom, just videos he posted on the website. The lectures weren't helpful and he always rambled, never going back to the info that was important. Didn't give partial credit on the exams.",0
she takes her 1 credit class too serious and never replies back too emails :/,0
"He knows is stuff and will explain again and again, he reviews all is questions (Exams, Tests, Labs). Very generous with grading.",1
Johnny May is a really nice person. He hates when people question what he does though. Knows the material but reads right off the powerpoints he has provided by the book author. He cares about the students and brings in guest speakers occasionally for future job offers and information.,1
"Probably one of the worst profs i've ever had! Doesn't not stick to the textbook she assigned, the class was a complete waste of my time. Takes for ever to mark assignments, and has obscure exam questions. To top it all off, she chews gum and says um throughout the whole lecture...classy! One might question how the H she got a tenure position!?",0
"He is a really easy going guy, but he goes really nit-picky on his exams! Does give out a lot of extra credit, so attend class!! READ the book, the information on the tests is straight out of the book.",1
"He's 'flamboyant'  so be prepared for that. His lectures are useless, the papers are vague and difficult and he grades very strangely. I've never had an issue with writing, and in fact enjoy it, but he seems to find an issue with everything I submit, and gives nonsensical reasons for the deductions. If you're an engineer, not a poet- stay away.",0
"This is an easy class to pass, only if it is your ONLY class. She overloads you with work and in my opinion tries for force this stuff down your throat. I am sure she has good intentions but this felt more like a high school instructor than a college professor. I feel bad even saying this because I am sure she means well.",1
"The worest Teacher on this planet 100% sure of it. Can not get any worse. Doesnt help students, makes fun of students. He gives us projects to do and we have not even completed the lecture on what we need to complete the projects.",0
I am a criminology major so this course was very important for me. Our first test was supposed to be over 3 chapters and was only over 1 because she got so off topic while lecturing. She is not very organized and poor at communicating with students (especially during finals week). I have never been this unhappy with a teacher.,0
I would take his class again. He makes you interested in what he is teaching. Be prepared to write lots and lots of notes. Make sure when he tells his corny jokes to laugh and make it seem real. Even when they are not that funny. Overall he was a great teacher.,1
"Dr. Nguyen was my favorite professor I've ever had! He's really the only professor in philosophy who made me read the texts, which is pretty rare in the philosophy department. He will make you work hard, but in the end, you'll know so much more than when you first walked into his class. If you truly want to learn philosophy, he's the one for you.",1
"I learned a lot and worked hard, but my grade did not reflect my efforts. The highest grade on assignments/exams is usually a B. Average grade is barely passing. You will learn a lot in her class, but at the cost of your GPA; no matter how hard you work.",0
Pawkett is an awesome guitarist and an equally great teacher. His sense of humor leaves you wishing the class were longer. I can't say anything wrong about this guy! Pawkett is God!,1
Awesome and nice professor! Definitely take  him.,1
The bulk of the work in this course are papers and 1 test with long answer questions. This class was enjoyable and I learned a few things as well. The professor was nice. No complaints.,1
I don't think I would have made it past 1st quarter of nursing school without Gail as my instructor. She was a constant reminder as to why I have chosen this career path. Her lectures are very emotional. Be prepared to shed a tear or two. She cares for her students and will do her best to guide them towards success. Rubrics are clearly written out.,1
Hes a kool dood boi!!,0
"Took him online via Zoom. His lectures are sometimes a little scattered, but he is a nice guy and lets you know exactly what you need to know for the exam. Participation helps you understand the info better and he gives extra credit for it. Just keep up with the online homework and quizzes and practice before exams and you should be fine.",1
Shes great overall. There is a lot of reading by yourself. Youll be assigned chapters and there will be open discussion about what you read in class the next day. She trys to be flexible with turn in dates. Shell ask if things are too much and if we need help to call her or email her. She cares about students and want us to have #WakeTechSwag,1
"He is good in explaining things if you just ask him. He is polite and as said before, he does examples from the text in lectures and he'll be happy to go over h.w. problems before they are due. he's cool",1
"Cindy was a great teacher but because she doesn't believe in giving exams the homework is lengthy, but not hard. She requires you to read 2 books for the class as well as writing essays on both books, and one last essay at the end of the semester. She also requires 3 projects. None of the assignments were too challenging to complete. An easy A .",1
Professor Ruiz is a good teacher. You will learn in her class. I took Intensive Span for Heritage Learners and get ready to work! She gives a lot of online homework as well as quizzes apart from your tests and group projects. If you do no make time for this class you will not pass. She does have patience and is willing to break it down for you.,1
"Gives you samples for midterm and final, similar questions. Online quiz and homework, easy A if you are following, attendance is mandatory first several classes. The book is not required.",1
I made a breakthrough with prof keene . I my music is starting to click!,1
"Worst teacher Ive ever take in my life. Strict on grading, no matter how hard you try he will always find some problem to lower your grade. WORST TEACHER EVER",0
Professor O'Donnell is the reason why I can confidently public speak. People hear about her class being extremely difficult and dreadful -- that is not the case at all. I had so much fun in her class. Just follow her guidelines for speeches (easy to do) and you will get an A.,1
"I  am very thankfully that I got her for my math 163, and 083 class. I really sucked at Algebra, and she has helped me by making it fun, and easy to learn. She does get a lot of homework, and calls on you in class, only because she wants you pass her class, like a teacher should. I have recommended her to anyone who need math.",1
"Professor Gonzalez is a helpful and comforting professor who teaches his students in a fun and interesting manner. Throughout my time in his class, I and the rest of my classmates were laughing and learning. He presents the information in a simple way and allows us more than enough time to write each of our papers. Could not recommend him enough.",1
"She is amazing.  Always available whether by email or in her office and always helps.  She is very understanding and down to earth.  Doesn't even like being referred to as doctor.  Young, funny, very intelligent and helpful.",1
"Took this as a hybrid class. There were weekly readings from the textbook that would be discussed in class, 5 or 6 short papers throughout the semester and a research paper at the end. The class was pretty easy and she was a very understanding, helpful teacher. Definitely recommend her.",1
"Professor Casimir is amazing!!! He makes all of his tests, and homework online. Even his final exam is online. You will only have a couple of quizzes, but you can use your notes. Easiest science class in Howard.",1
a really great guy.,1
Her assignments and expectations were vague. She could not explain why she gave you certain grades. The class was stressful and she seemed distracted for most of it. She did not give constructive feedback. In some cases her feedback was contradictory. Would not take class from her again.,0
"I literally had no idea what I was doing in this class, and he didn't really teach much about it. You just follow along with his 12 step process and hope you don't get lost along the way or you're going to end up with a terrible grade. He's accessible outside of class but doesn't take time to read the reports students worked all semester on.",1
"Professor O'Hara is a good professor. There are 12 quizzes, a blog (which you must keep throughout the semester covering government issues in a local city), two in class stories, and a final exam of 50 questions. It's not a hard class if you read the chapters each week and complete the blog.",1
She is one of the best teachers I have encountered at UT. She is willing to reteach things that are unclear and relates material to everyday life. Whenever I have to take a science class I hope she is teaching that course. She is funny. Her notes are exactly what is on the exams. If you pick another teacher over her you are making a huge mistake.,1
"The tests were tough, so I had to study a lot. The book is not used in class, but it is helpful when studying. If you show you care, then she will do what she can to help.",1
"He is unorganized in the beginning of the semester (with assignments from last semester's due dates appearing on the to-do list on CANVAS) and will not respond to emails. There is an extra credit opportunity for all of the discussion posts, so take advantage of those, quizzes/exams are difficult. I did not use the book, but it would have helped.",0
She's a sweetheart and very clear with her explanations. Definitely a great teacher.,1
Dr Chris' classes were more what I expected college classes to be like-students are expected to know material and work hard to master it. Dr. Chris' interest is unquestionably to help equip students as much as possible for cross-cultural ministry. Students uninterested in working hard or hoping for an easy elective will not prosper.,1
"Professor Zimmerman is the worst teacher that I have had at UMD so far. She reads straight from the power point lectures, and makes what could be potentially interesting information, boring. She is also unorganized and completely useless when it comes to using any online tools for her class. Avoid if possible.",0
"The only professor you won't mind having during her 8am section. She's so lively and funny that it keeps you awake. Put the effort in, and you will without a doubt get an A if not a high B. She is the best out of all the freshman psych professors. She is able to give real-world examples behind concepts due to her being a real clinical psychologist.",1
"Un excellent professeur qui a une excellente maîtrise de sa matière. Il est extrêmement dédié à la réussite de ses étudiants même si la matière n'est pas facile. J'ai rarement eu un professeur aussi dédié à sa tâche d'enseignement. Participez aux séances virtuelles, même si elles sont facultatives. C'est un must. J'ai adoré. Bravo!",1
U NEED TO GO TO CLASS BUT IF U DO U CANT GET ANYTHING LOWER THAN A B. THIS CLASS IS VERY EASY BUT SHE ALSO KNOWS HER STUFF AS A TEACHER. SHE DOES ALLOW STUPID PEOPLE TO ASK LOTS OF QUESTIONS,1
"I would def recommend this prof. If you do the homework that is given every week from the textbook, you will be good for the exam. He basically does problems form the txtbk in class, so you dont need to go to class but I would recommend going anyway. He is also really understanding so if you did poorly on the exam, go to him!!!! and he will help!!",1
"DO NOT BUY THE TEXTBOOK, BUY THE WORKBOOK IT WORKS WONDERS. GREAT GREAT GREAT PROFESSOR, BEST INVESTMENT IN BMCC AND THEY DONT HAVE TOO MANY GOOD PROFESSORS LEFT BUT THIS MAN IS THE TRUTH. TAKE IS CLASS, GET ON THE WAITING LIST IF YOU HAVE TO. YOU WONT REGRET IT. HIS SARCASM IS GOLD!",1
"This class was good! I enjoyed it. The professor is very nice and understanding. Make sure to attend everyday, attendance matters! She lets you use the book during exams, & assignments are a piece of cake (just make sure youre doing them how she exactly describes she wants them!)",1
By far best professor I have ever had. She holds you accountable and will make you work for it however in reality just pushes you to be a better student. LOVE HER,1
"Very time restricted exams online, has habit of not unlocking assignments on time",0
"Mr. Pierce is a great professor! He cares about his students, and wants us to succeed. His quizzes and tests are heavily based on his powerpoints and lectures. He is great!",1
"She is very kind and articulate. Must go to class for notes because slides are not posted. 3 quizzes, 1 final (multiple choice + take home essay), 1 research paper. Need to memorize a lot. Never read the $85 book, but need it for the songs and discussion. Discussions are mandatory. Fun performances in class. Hard, but good grade if you try.",1
Drop and wait until he isn't teaching to take the course.,0
"Sylvester is an adjunct instructor, and as far as I know, he only teaches labs at the REEF. He provides lots of supplementary material for labs, grades reasonably, schedules lab sessions for confused students, and is definitely the coolest lab instructor in the EE program. Looks like an engineering version of Bo Jackson, if that's even possible.",1
"The class is really easy, but you kind of have to teach yourself.  He is confusing in lecture and he even confuses himself most times.  If you ask for help on a question he either does it without much explanation, or he gets it wrong and another student has to complete it for him.  I think he is very smart, but isn't the best teacher.  ",0
She is wonderful.,1
"Tests did not reflect anything that was taught in lecture, you are better off learning all the material off of YouTube. He hardly responds to emails and when he does he answers vaguely. He also emails you in the middle of tests to correct his own errors in the creation of the test. He Is not willing to work with students with questions.",0
"Dr. Capper knows his stuff and teaches it with energy.  Class was interesting, and I looked forward to it every day.  It was discussion based and involved the students.  Tests were all essay based, and the final was a 10-page paper, but they were graded easily.  Paying attention in class is a must; doing the ""required"" readings is not important.",1
"He isn't too bad, I wouldn't rave about him, but I wouldn't talk trash either. If you have to take Bio3, he is adequate.",1
"He is an amazing professor. Very knowledgeable. I took Engl250 short semester with him and it wasn't pretty. Have to admit despite him being nice, his also a tough grader. Very strict when it comes to homework submission. He also has a sense of caring. I would only recommend to take his class if you are looking for a challenge. If not don't.",1
"One of the best teachers I've had regardless of level. He makes class a joy to go to. Flexible on when the midterms are and he really encourages class discussions. He's also funny as hell, not a class goes by that's not entertaining. Very quotable too.",1
"Professor Griffin is an incredible professor who is clearly passionate about education. She isn't very clear on how she grades and she can be confusing at times but she does care about her students doing well. Professor G makes you want to be the best educator you can be. Loved her ""story times"" throughout the semester!",1
"Ms. Phillips was an OK teacher. Not horrible but not great. You can tell she has been doing this for a long time and I dont know if she cares as much as she once did. She has a real problem with time management, we were always behind. I took her class two days a week and she spent over half the time going over the previous days homework.",1
"His class was easy and had a routine schedule. It was easy to keep track of assignments. Quizzes and discussions are due on Sunday nights, but you have all week to do them.",1
"I was worried at first, but by the second class all worries went away. She expected us to be college students and study to the shock of some students. all of her test were covered well. I found most students that had trouble never read the chapter before class. I would recomend this teacher to anyone who wants to learn and go on to A&P II.",1
"Professor Dominguez is an exceptional teacher. His standards are high and he expects his students to be dedicated to reaching those standards. He spends an immense amount of time making sure that his students understand the material. Although his grading can be tough, he gives feedback that will help you improve as a student and writer. Great class",1
Wow this guy is bad. Your quizzed at the beginning of every single class about things you had to teach yourself. Then you have to sit there for a lecture filled with tangents and that is never relevant to what you read. 2 people in my class have above a B. 9 have below a C. Find someone else.,0
A good professor to take a class with.,1
"She has no knowledge on intercultural comm. Grade is based on coming to class, one paper & two exams.I dont think she even read some exams and just gave them passing grades. extremely easy if you dont want to learn anything & sit in class for a few hrs a week.",1
"She is really amazing, helpful, and approachable if u don't mess around!!!!( slacking off, or thinking you know alot and your class is too easy- then you are in trouble!)",1
"Reynolds is amazing. His lectures are fantastic, and his class sparked my interest in social sciences. I would highly recommend his class.",1
Lisa is very organized and is always well prepared. While she gives a lot of assignments they are absolutely manageable and lend themselves well to the course content.,1
Chandra was my professor for several classes during my undergrad. He was always very helpful and willing to go the extra mile to assist students. His intermediate and advanced physics labs were all very interesting and gave me experience relevant to my career after University.,1
"The man is an endless well of useful information. Brilliant at getting students to THINK and not GUESS. The day I first met him is the day school became interesting. Not the run-of-the-mill, easily the most compelling professor you will ever have. Don't graduate until you have taken his class. The man CARES and I'm a better person because of him.",1
"Ms. V is an awesome teacher. Class was very easy. I had not previously taken any chemistry. But most of her information she will give you right off the slides in class, she provides study guides for tests and is very helpful in answering questions, very kind and happy demeanor. Recommend her!",1
"Easy class if you pay attention. Nice guy, gives extra credit, class participation is important. Attendance is a must, and don't be late!  He will not accept late assignments-No Exceptions.",1
Microbiology- 2018 Spring semester. She is one of the nicest people I have ever met. Her lectures are straight from the powerpoint so any additional information will be read by the student from the textbook. She gives multiple retakes on tests so you do have a chance to redeem yourself if you fail one. Teaching is a bit dull but it is microbiology.,1
"Nice guy, witty and clever. Likes class participation. 3 exams and attendance make up your grade. Study for the exam and you'll be fine.",1
"Dr. Powell and the textbook he wrote will teach so you much in this class! He gives you the questions to the quizzes beforehand and he is very clear in what he expects. He gives hints in class, so I recommend going. Textbook is mandatory, and he shows really good videos. The reflection at the end is a grade booster",1
"Personally I felt the course was a bit unorganized and formatted in an usual way. There is a lot of reading and the course is broken down into multiple assignments. If you put in the effort, it's possible to get a good grade in this class, it can just start to feel dragged out pretty quickly.",0
"Ok class but being Philosophy you'd think it'd be more serious than just how you 'feel'.  I would prefer if his quizzes and tests actually had to with concepts rather than just to see if you read the book. E.g. ""what was the gender of the protagonist's friend?"" Instead of the actual point of the story. That's what makes this class hard. ",1
"Record the lectures and complete the study guides and you will get an A. Material is relatively easy. Professor Self is very intelligent however, boring as well. He does have a passion for Microbial Metabolism and by the end of the course you will have gained a lot of knowledge about E.coli. Overall, good class!",1
"This instructor is the only reason this class was difficult. The rubric was barely followed, if at all sometimes. She will mark you down for random things without reason, and for things I've never had issues with before. She finished grading all my milestone papers within 15-30 minutes.  Nothing was ever clear, making this class terrible.",0
This class is an incredible amount of work for what it should be with not a lot of notice in between assignments. Mandatory attendance and participation and on top of that the professor is a little bit harsh so it doesn't make for a comfortable leaning environment. You don't learn any valuable programs or anything the work is all busy work.,0
"She's a nice lady. LOTS of busy work, like, a mind numbing amount of small and meaningless assignments. She's flexible and understanding, and allows for creative freedom. She refuses to give 100% on anything, because ""nothing is perfect"".",1
"He was pretty awful! I have been a strait A student my entire life with only a couple B's in H.S. and none in college so far till this class. His expectations were confusing and made the student feel stupid if he did not like the work. I get A's on my English papers, but got a B- on what he called a ""quick and easy assignment."" Avoid if possible!",0
"Professor Bennett is different in that she really cares about her students! She's so nice, and very understanding. Also, she does not believe in tests or grading, so she has a different way of grading. There is a bit of reading, but it is very easy. Honestly an easy A in my opinion. Group project at end of semester!",1
Such a great teacher. I've learned more in his classes than I have in anyone else's just from his real world experiences alone. You don't need the textbook and he gives you a study guide with exactly what will be on the exams. He is also willing to help you with interviewing and resumes any time you need. Would definitely take his class again.,1
Kathy was awesome!! Lots of extra credit opportunities and all assignments are easy points. She was very respectful when walking about sensitive topics and was very open to new ideas.,1
She is absolutely horrible. Very unclear on what she would like done. Also very rude. She waits till last minute to tell you exactly what you need done. Would not recommend taking her class!,0
For someone who always taught online you would think she would be good but this was ridiculous,0
"I found this class to be very easy, but had a problem with ONE ASSIGNMENT and my A went to a B.  Had he answered my questions that I emailed, I definitely would have gotten and A, but due to deadline ended up with a B.  You pretty much teach yourself everything.  no help from professor at all.  Book is stupid and hard to follow.  ",0
good prof,1
"Cool guy. Three papers, best of which counts as a grade. You don't have to do the others if you like your grade on one. Exams were online, questions from his slides which he posts. Participation was mandatory, meaning you have to talk five times throughout the semester.",1
"Dr. Kosnik is lovely. He is super passionate about music, and it shows in his lectures. He keeps his lectures short and engaging. He is by far my favorite professor.",1
"TERRIBLE!! Makes a ton of mistakes. Always looks at her notes. Can't answer a question not in her notes. Didn't finish much of the laplace section. All homework online (waste of time and money). If you can take someone else, you might actually learn something. If you take her, you'll pass, but not learn anything",0
"Going to class is helpful. The subject was interesting and the homework was very doable. Every exam you are allowed a full page of notes both front and back. The exams weren't that hard, but sometimes those questions you get wrong could cost a lot. If you're consistent with points you'll do just fine.",1
"Between the extra credit, lab assignments, and lecture/lab/recitation periods, this course is easily 20-25 hours of work each week. The slides are nearly useless, but he explains things well in lecture. The textbook isn't necessary, but practice each problem set multiple times. The extra credit is a ton of work for relatively few points.",1
"I don't know what these other raters were smoking, but this professor is terrible.  If you want an easy A take her class, but you wont learn anything substantial.  This class is all business buzzwords about ""synergy"" and ""social responsibility.""  Also, the project is ridiculous and she centers her class around the project, rather than the book.",0
"Tends to focus a bit too much on female students. Also has a nutjob following of ""converted"" students. More like a cult leader than a professor.",0
"ONLINE CIT 120. He was helpful & organized. This online class was VERY easy to understand. I would totally recommend him. Also, my BF took him too & my BF emailed him asking if he would still get a ?B? in the class if he didn?t do the last project & Mr. S said that he would SPOT HIM 5.5 points so he?d get an ?A? if he did the project. AMAZING.",1
It can be hard to find a teacher to cling to especially since youre only with them for 4 months. Not with her. After 1.5 years at Tri-C she has made an astounding impact on me. You can watch her teach and know she cares about every single student. Ive never had a professor be as detail oriented and include every type of learning there is.,1
challenging but fair. really works with students who have technology problems,1
"Online Microbiology class + lab was taken over the summer with her. It might've just been the program but she talked slowly in the pre-recorded lectures. Replies quickly to messages and is clear about grading rubrics. Good for an online class but there's a lot of components to it - quizs, tests, papers, vocab, final.",1
I took Queen for the Writing 39C & English 11 combo. He is hands down the most caring and understanding professor I have ever taken a course under. He really goes out his way to meet up with every student severals time throughout the quarter to get to know them and address any concerns. 10/10 would recommend. Easy A as long as you do all the work.,1
"Super easy class! if you just do the assignments, a guaranteed A+. He's super chill and has good stories. The class counts for an art credit so i would definitely take this even if you don't like writing (it's not that much) Only allowed 3 absences so use wisely and expect homework a couple times a week but they are basic readings",1
"If you don't have previous chem experience, Bushey is not a good prof for beginners. He's willing to help if you ask questions or put in effort to see him outside of class, but in class he goes too fast. Disorganized thoughts and switches often back and forth between powerpoint, writing on paper, and writing on the board.",1
I took an undergraduate directed study with Dr. Draper last fall. She is an excellent professor who listens to students' needs/goals and utilizes her skills to guide her student towards success. This course allowed me to explore any research topic that intrigued my personal interest and help me grow with much confidence. Recommend her class!,1
Never again he doesnt teach us anything at all your book is your best friend. #facts,0
"Dr Chang teaches Probability Theory in a way that is plug chug. Does not go over the meaning of the topics in this course. Only shows how to compute Problems. The book chosen is a great book (Degroot), however, it can be hard to read at times. Due to Chang's teaching style, the proper book was not chosen. I will not be taking any courses with Chang",0
"He speaks very quickly (be ready to speed write when taking notes). He isn't mean like some previous reviews say. He has a sense of humor and makes jokes that can come across as offensive, but they're not. Just have thick skin and make sure to participate and you'll be fine! He is an easy grader as long as you do the work according to the rubric.",1
It is recommended to review your grade with other students and the professor. His grading is inconsistent therefore ask for an answer key. He did not update grades in the D2L only grade posted online was the overall final.,0
I loved this professor. The class was difficult but I felt as though he made a good effort to understand. Very nice and respectable.,1
DO NOT TAKE HER this teacher is terrible. She grades homework but doesn't tell you what you did wrong just to look at the notes. The notes are no help just all letters with no descriptions. I've held a 3.5 GPA but not after this class. This is the only class I have failed or gotten below a C. SHE IS TERRIBLE!!! Better be ready to teach yourself!!,0
"Little to no reading from the textbook needed. Class attendance is necessary for passing. Record lectures, listen to the recordings and write notes on the ppts at the same time. Incredibly easy, studied one evening for one of the exams and still obtained an A. ",1
"Professor O'Hanlon was tough and strict with grammar rules but that's how you learn! It definitely helped my writing and enhanced my communication skills. All projects except 2 are group projects (you can pick your teammates). Take home midterm (2 short essays) and final (business plan, don't wait to do it!) She works with you to get a better grade",1
"Flipped class, where you watch a pre-recorded lecture before class and spend the entire class reinforcing in the form of a recap followed by a 3-5 person group packet. One person in the group gets graded, groups switch roughly after each exam. Terrific class. HW is on MML, and grades are posted quickly to MML as well. T/A present, which helps! ",1
"her tests are difficult. Even with the ability to look at notes since its an online course, students still did bad because she words her questions odd and makes them difficult to understand. She also grades harshly on the research paper even though its a short, 4 page paper that should have been an easy A. Not an easy online course to take.",0
I had Professor Were for two semesters and I always enjoyed her class. The lectures were structured in a way that made French easy and understandable. I had originally planned on just taking this course to get the language requirement out of the way but now I hope to take more French courses in the future.,1
"CLASS WAS A BREEZE. SHE IS A GREAT PROFESSOR. STUDY, STAY CAUGHT UP ON YOUR WORK AND YOU SHOULD BE FINE.",1
"Si vous pouvez changer de prof, je vous le conseille fortement. Il suit de A à Z le manuel on Powerpoint, aime raconter ses histoires perso ""drôles"" d’après lui... pire prof dans mon parcours",0
"Great teacher! very helpful, and energetic ! love her definitely recommend taking her class",1
"She is super nice and really wants you to understand what is being taught, Her test are really easy because it is everything that she taught. She also really emphasizes important things she wants you to know. You have two group projects but she gives you time to work on them and they are not hard. You can only skip once without losing points.",1
"As someone who struggles with science, I dreaded taking it. Prof Cox has made it as enjoyable as possible by providing relevant connections, great readings and videos. She is an extremely charismatic lecturer even on video, and great at explaining complex concepts in understandable ways. The amount of work is reasonable. Take her class!",1
Class is boring and hes very forgetful.,0
Thankfully tests are open book. All of class is spent reading power points. We work in groups in a lot for participation grades. She does count points off if you are absent.,0
"She is really sweet and teaches very well. has a load voice where you can hear her across the room even outside the class room. She wants you to learn and she will help you. you do have to read for PBL, if not you can not do quizzes. test are confusing but you have group projects and labs that help. if you take her you will enjoy it but its alot of",1
Spends half the class talking about herself rather than focusing on important matters. She has a bad attitude. Reprimands students who request guidance through email which is often since she is only in her office for a few hours during the week. She does this because she is not computer literate. Very discouraging to eager students. Awful! Awful!,0
"I don't understand how this instructor got good ratings on here. She is by far, the most least qualified and horrible professor I have ever had. I don't think she would even be qualified to work at a McDonalds. This professor not only did not know how to grade correctly, she would miss class all the time, and you never had an idea of whatwasgoingon",0
Best professor I've ever had.,1
"Best prof I had. Concepts easy because he made them simple. Showed passion/excitement for teaching. Not much coursework, but more applicable in business world than any other class Ive taken. Tests were easy. Had 4 group papers for homework. I would highly recommend him with any classes you take. Has a Russian accent you may need to get used to.",1
"Kathy was a great choice for JRN 380. She was funny, and the class was interesting. She was the perfect person to teach this class. The group projects sucked, but they aren't hard. The quizzes are easy and the class is interesting to attend.",1
"Great learning experience. Has very unconventional ideas and not mainstream marketing. Good course to understand how to analyze a case from all perspectives including finance and micro-economics. He mixes his cases quite well and his case solutions are intriguing, though may not be practical. Also, clarifies some basic concepts of micro and mktg.",1
She should be teaching an introductory class. Her lectures are quite dry. She reads straight from the powerpoint. A lot of modules are online. Majority of the projects are group assignements when they don't need to be. Assignments are graded by a TA that we have never met. This class could easily be an online 8 week course. Quizes might get you.,0
Awesome teacher.,1
"For 170A he was fine. But I really enjoyed 145 (Robotics) with him. I highly recommend this class to anyone who is fairly comfortable with using MATLAB. One of my favorite engineering classes taken and the material was easy to understand but very interesting. Grading was fair, lectures were interesting and straightforward. Labs took hours and hours",1
Curtis was an amazing teacher to take for anthropology and gave fascinating lectures. She often goes way outside the box and topics are never off limits even if you think they are. Make sure you read the text for hw otherwise you be crying for quizzes and tests as little facts are on there. The tests are HARD and take a lot of studying to pass.,1
"Prof. Goldberg is really funny (dad jokes) and caring. Im a straight A student that got a C+ in his course, which is partly my fault because I didnt attend class much. He asks a lot of questions about research results on his tests, which I find useless and difficult. If you want a good mark, youre gonna have to work hard for it and memorize.",1
really good teacher,1
"He's definitely an awesome Professor! He's always ready to help, both in and outside class. His class is super organized and the grading criteria is very clear. Go to class because his lectures are useful. Use homework solutions he printed out to review for exams.",1
"Prof. Zaitsev is excellent. He is very knowledgeable and always answer your questions. He explain with details and with good examples, but in order to pass you have to pay attention in class, and read the material. The tests are multiple choice but you definitely have to read. His classes are amaizing and fun. You will learn a lot.",1
I had a great semester with Professor Wells. I felt like she really pushed me in a good way and because of her i learned a lot. From this class I learned how to edit and take a better picture. I would recommend her to anyone who wants to learn about photography.,1
"I took Mrs. Cochran's online contemporary lit class, and was extremely happy with her as a professor. She assigns a lot of reading, which is to be expected, but all of the assignments are very straightforward and not terribly difficult or time consuming. The only complaint I have is that her quizzes use obscure little parts of the book for answers.",1
"Antonella is by far the best professor  I have seen in my life! I learned a lot from her. She is a dedicated professor, so fair in grading and wants to make sure you take information away from her class . She goes out of her way to help you.",1
"I enjoyed the class itself, test are tough. But Professor Roe is available via email and even during her office hours (beware they were 8:30). Her lecture notes are pretty organized , and sync well with the book. Be ready for homework and quizzes. Also if you look good in the syllabus, it saids that you can receive bonus points for going to tutorin",1
"open minded, kept class interesting, fair, energetic.",1
"If you need a science class take him, easiest class ever; it's almost impossible not to get an A. Only gives three exams, and he gives out study guides, and literally puts the same thing on the exam. I did not pay attention in class and I just made sure I studied the guides and I got a 100%. He's also really nice and super chill.",1
Good,1
VERY knowledgeable economist. If you dont understand something speak up because hell clarify. Exams are difficult but only because theres a lot of content covered for only a midterm and a final. You will definitely learn a lot. Also his discussion board entries can definitely boost your grade but dont procrastinate them.,1
"He was using an old exam for the first midterm, and he sometimes does this for the final midterm. I know students who studied only an old exams have passed the first midterm and the course with a decent grade. While some people tell you to study hard, I tell you to find as many old tests and practice them over and over.",0
"I dont think I hated a professor more then I hate him. He was the worst math professor I have ever taken in my life. Dont take him, take cutler instead. Or you can take him if you enjoy hell",0
"Although attending class live is optional, I would advise you do your best to participate. The classes are recorded, which is nice, but don't let them back up. It's easy enough to catch up, just don't overuse the 'No late penalties' rule. I did, hence my grade. Make sure to keep referencing the Trimble readings too!",1
"The class has a few quizzes, a large project, two midterms and two long in class quizzes. The material is actually a lot more interesting that you would imagine. If you ever get confused, Dr. Hansen is always available to help. I learned a lot in this class and it was very manageable. He also might be the nicest man in the world.",1
WARNING: FLIPPED CLASSROOM. Look it up pretty much nothing is done in class(but you have to show up) and all the real learning is done on your own time. This did not work well for most of the class. Averages were in the 40s,0
"Take him for the sake of your GRADE, all you need to do is put in your very best. He has a thick accent, everyone will say that but all you need is an amazing professor who will not be so hard on you nor make the class harder than it already is. If i could take him again, I will without thinking twice.",1
Shes amazing,1
"Dr. Starner clearly cares about his students, and if you are struggling he is eager to help. He recognizes when he hasn't taught something well enough and takes the time to make sure the class understands it. Easy tests, just make sure you pay attention in class and try to understand everything as it is taught.",1
"Prof Gonzales was one of the nicest, most caring professors I could've asked for. Explains concepts relatively clearly, and has absolutely no problem going back to answer questions. Answers questions about homework too, and does them right in front of you so you can figure out where you went wrong. I would recommend her highly for calc 1a.",1
"the material for this class was very dry! there is no homework  and you do not need a text book either. There is a quiz EVERY week on the material but he does tell you what it will cover. take advantage of making notes on an index card and using it on the weekly quizzes.  Overall, good eye candy.",0
"Best teacher I have ever had. You will have no problem as long as you read the material, do the work, and show up for class. I highly recommend his course !",1
"This professor is awesome, he isn't strict, if you do your work you'll pass. Easy A.",1
"Unless you have a good previous understanding of chemistry, avoid her like the plague. Yeah, you might pass but if you learn anything its most likely because you taught yourself. Getting extra help is like pulling teeth and her lectures are absolutely brutal. Such a waste of money for this class and will probably have to retake at some point.",0
"You can try to work your way out through a problem, but you'll be told to read the book when you asking for help . If you did not get above a B in calc 1, you will struggle, and he has no shame in boasting that he's an inefficient professor.",0
"Dr. Nam is one of the few high standards professors left at UCF. So if you are lazy, mediocre, are not into learning but just want to take easy classes from which you learn nothing but get hyperinflated grades, then this professor is not for you because in his class you will be required to do actual university-level work from which one does learn.",1
She is one of the best teachers. If you are interested in marketing she is a must have teacher. you learn a lot.,1
shes very boring and often goes on tangents when she is lecturing. i find it easier to take notes straight from the book she provides us with. she also makes us do breakout rooms often. easy a though.,1
Its not a easy intro level course but she really is the most amazing lecturer. She really makes all the stuff in the class fit together. The tests are essays but they are COMPLETELY based on lectures so its doable. There is also alot of extra credit.,1
"I can't say I really learned much in this class, but the assignments were a breeze and attendance wasn't mandatory.",1
Fail me although he knows my difficult situation,0
"Huge GPA booster if you stay remotely up-to-date. Got 100% on all quizzes. No textbook needed, use her notes. Crammed for the final in 1 day, got 85% and 77% in the course. Would NOT recommend though if you have absolutely no interest in the course; I lost marks because I didn't care enough to even attempt the assignments. Yes, I'm garbage.",0
Very boring class. The work you do in her class has nothing to do with computers. She gets mad when you try to ask her questions DO NOT TAKE HER.  She is the worst professor i have ever had in my college career!,0
"Absolutely Hysterical, Really do your readings though! He likes to mess with your head on tests. watch family guy he loves it! And for the love of anything don't say good things about UCLA he hates them",1
"Class description should have included walking through swamps infested with poison ivy, being eaten alive by mosquitoes, developing neck/back problems carrying around 30pd bags for hours, walking in the middle of thunderstorms, finger problems writing for 3-4 hours a day, quizzes where you have to memorize at least 30 species,one had 75. Have fun.",1
"Gives candy out to everyone. Can be tough on grading, but teaches and explains things well. If he likes you, you'll get an A. Ask questions whenever possible, he'll help you. On final, he expects you to use all you've learn in class and use it on that.",1
"Great teacher for an already tough class. Gentry is very upfront and doesn't baby his students or under-emphasize the  of the course. Students were expected to read the book (RENT DO NOT BUY), do the homework, and come to class with questions. Not an easy A (or B) but if you learn well by self-teaching and peer-teaching you'll do fine-ish",1
"Take his class and you will wish you dead several times throughout the semester. His lectures are boring, his voice is monotone, his tests are stupid hard for no reason, the power points are not even close to what is on the test. I had him for a summer semester online and he shows the class averages on Canvas. Most of the class did not pass. warned",0
"Him and Frank Shaw are the best math professors at HU.     His HW's assignments are short. Go to class cuz his notes are very useful. This professor loves math and he really cares about his students understanding and learning it clearly. He is very helpful to students. Exams are not hard like HW, Go to his office and also to labs for help.",1
"One of the finest professors Ive had in my academic career. Teaches real world work, inspires students to learn, help student to understand whats out there in IT world when you eventually leave college. Never missed a class even though the attendance was optional but he made the fun so great with great lectures and his knowledge!",1
I never write reviews but THIS MAN IS ACTUALLY AN ANGEL. I have never in my life loved a professor as much as Kole Camaj. Hes a gift from God and truly makes me excited for class. I would cut off all my limbs to take this professor again because he is that incredible. He is my favorite professor ive ever had in my life and I would die for this man,1
"I enjoy going to her class. She is gauranteed to make you laugh more than once in class.  She is very easy going.  She will occasionally get pissed about people talking, but it is a lot of fun.  We usually leave class 10 to 20 minutes early.  If you need to take intermediate math...take gordon!!!",1
"""Intructor First"". Never respond email. Not friendly. Not care about his student at all. Hard to get an A. Worst instuctor I ever seen. No practice exam. He only says,""the exam question is similar to your book's examples"" (I took CIS 20). Lecture is lack of organized. It is detailed but saying too much useless in class. HW are barely relate to exam",0
"I took Professor Jewell my senior year for Comp 2. She is an extremely hard grader. She assigns very long papers. She doesn't put your grades on PAL until the very last day of the semester, so I didn't know I was failing until about 2 weeks before the semester ended. She doesn't ever help out, and she's strict on attendance. She will drop you!!",0
must go to class,1
"I took the computer deal of his class, where you do the course online but you're in a class with him. I liked the program and his teaching style is nice, you raise your hand, ask your question and you get a PERFECT answer, and I SUCK at math, I mean with a capital S. He's very mellow, chill, and funny at times.",1
Awesome teacher. I would definitely take her again.,1
"Super strict about guidelines, but yet confusing. The exams are headache inducing. The material itself was really interesting but she did not seem to care about the students, even if it was an online class. And the final paper had nothing to do with the material covered in class.",0
"Professor Conway is a good professor who is passionate about communications. I took this course online and learned a lot and I never once thought it was hard. His quizzes are ten questions each and you can use your notes, as well as on the midterm and final. He is also very understanding and nice!",1
"Super great teacher. Had for 101 and 199. Funny and easy to talk to. All the information can be re-found from the ppt online which is super helpful when doing group work. As long as you pay attention in class and do the work your told to, especially in your groups, because there is a HUGE amount of group work, you should be fine.",1
I wish to say thank you to this Professor. He had really helped me with when I needed it the most concerning family and etc. He gave the assignments early at a ich helped me with my schedule. I had asked him to help me and he did so and benefitted the whole entire class.  Thank you again and God bless with all my heart. Elina A,1
No Comments,1
She is very straightforward with what you need to know. Just study for the exams and attend all the lectures.,1
"Prof. Infante is super enthusiastic, kind, and reasonable. World Lit challenged my thinking but was never too stressful, and he both gave great lectures and made sure the discussions went somewhere. You can tell that he loves the subject matter, and he is really willing to help with papers. If you put in effort, your worldview will expand a lot!",1
She is so mean and never teach. And didn't be responsible for her students.,0
He is my hero! He gets to know the students and adapts to their needs. He does not have a mean bone in his entire body. He is of spoken and adorable.,1
"Professor Hanratty is a good teacher. Although she holds high standards, it really allows you to become more responsible for your work. She is a tough grader. When she provides feedback on your papers, make sure to take the advice she gives you and DON'T blow it off. The comments she gives you will really help improve your writing for your papers.",1
"An awesome professor. He tells stories and really just tries to talk to the class. It's an easy class where all you have to do is do your homework in order to pass. He doesn't assign very much homework at all. He's a super fun guy, I hope to take him again for a CS course.",1
"Mr. Smith was very caring and understanding. The course was made up of 1 persuasive essay, 1 research, and 1 final paper that was 9 pages. No quizzes or tests. Always let us out early and had short classes.",1
"Bonaccorsi was a great professor. I came into the class thinking it would be awful, but she made the class much better. She has great PowerPoints and breaks up the class with TopHat questions. You can tell that she loves chemistry and knows what she is doing. Also, she is Italian and has a great accent (but still understandable).",1
"May is pretty willing to help.  I never needed much help, but I saw him assist and make arrangements with others students.  All in all seems like a pretty laid-back good guy.",1
Mrs Schultz was a good teacher she is kinda hard to understand at times but she gives good lectures and will help you at any time,1
Jeri is an absolutely amazing teacher. I'm looking forward to  taking another class with her in the future. She grades all work very fairly and is willing to help you with just about anything. You have a lot of freedom when doing all of the projects! This was my favorite class of the semester!,1
"Great teacher! love this class! new teacher,but doing well! If you come to class and do your work, you will get an A for sure! he has a routine and sticks to it, I recommend this class, especially if you are curious about religion,you will learn a lot! he is very knowledgeable of  material and can elaborate on what the book teaches!HE GETS an ""A""",1
"Very good teacher for the lecture portion of class, interesting and with great examples.  Lab lectures are incredibly boring and drawn out. This teacher takes far too long to grade exams, to the point where it feels disrespectful.",1
"This was the WORST college professor I have had in my life. I have been in school for years. I am currently going back to further my education. He made sexiest jokes (that weren't even funny), not allowed to drink water, can't wear a hat (not even in the winter), if he sees your phone, he will take your final grade down by one whole letter grade.",0
"I never listened to any of her lectures and still got an A. However, this is because I solely relied on reading the textbook which was more helpful than her lectures. I also did the practice problems she gave before exams and listened to the attached explanations. Overall, you have to self-study and rely on yourself.",1
I have never been so inspired by a teacher. Mark uses no lecture slides or notes. Totally staggering to me how he does it. Great feedback given. beyond anything I've ever encountered during my university education. Shames other lecturers here.,1
His tests ARE kinda tough. But if you go to lecture & take notes you can get a good grade. His papers were pretty easy & he grades them easy. He gives out SO much extra credit!! I think because he knows that the material is quite challenging. The 2 below here must be Freshman. Welcome to University! Though I admit his lectures are rather dry.,1
"He's a good teacher if you follow his instructions. I often went to see him during office hours and spent 16 hours a week on his essays. Believe me you need a lot of time, because he's not an easy teacher.  Gives good feedback on essays and assigns a lot of reading from textbook. I strongly recommend finishing essays ahead of time for his feedback.",1
"At first he may seem a little rough around the edges, but if you participate or at least pay attention, you'll do fine. He like when kids talk to him one-on-one and will help you if you need it. He hates late work, so always be on time. I did pretty well in this class because I listened to his instructions, as to what he wanted in a paper. ",1
"No final exam, but rather a 40% midterm, participation, and a group essay + very simple presentation . His latin american expertise made the class interesting, and his slides were detailed. He actually gives you all the questions for the midterm beforehand. The class is extremely easy to pass, even though his english is a bit rough. Go to class.",1
"Great lecturer. Class is pretty much from the book. Easy quizzes on assigned reading by contemporary author. However, I went to talk to him during his office hours. Absolutely rude and disinterested. I found him to be enjoyable in the classroom, but absolutely impersonal otherwise. Easy A, if you work for it on your own.",1
"Not very helpful. He doesn't respond to any students e-mails for help. Also he hands homework back extremely late, so you are not sure if you are doing all of the problems correctly. He seems like a nice guy, but I wish he would explain things in class and show some initiative towards his students.",0
he is very nice to everyone,1
No Comments,1
"I loved this course, But prof is  not easy. He takes points off. But the good part is that if you do good on final exam, he will grade you according to that.Irrespective of what you got in class pop quizzes.",0
Enthusiastic teacher who keeps the topics interesting.  Homework is hard but worthwhile and tests are fair.,1
"I had him for Organic Chemistry two semesters. I think I only looked at the book twice for both semesters. He outlines in the syllabus exactly what you need to do, the homework and powerpoints provide everything for the tests. Everyone told me Organic was going to be one of the hardest classes I faced, but he made it super easy.",1
"She has been changing assignments dates and adding assignments. She will say things like ""I don't want to overwhelm you..."" then proceeds to go overboard with what it due. She is incredibly rude and if you don't do it her way then it's not any other way. She also asks students to share private health information for a grade, which is terrible.",0
"Dr. Hartman is an amazing teacher. She is really caring and understanding. Her class makes you feel ""at home"" and has a more personable class feel like high school. Only have 4 papers to write and she gives awesome feedback and helps you through the writing process. I would definitely take her. Attendance is 20% of your grade. 4 Essays are 20% each",1
The best,1
"BE CAUTIOUS: not your typical history class. A LOT OF READING. ALOT OF WRITING.. no final which is a plus you do you have to role play scenarios in history. this can be fun but quite time consuming if you need to study for other classes. McFall will make you think that this core, 3 credit course is the most important class to him. Prepare 2 interac",1
"Mrs Miller is fantastic. You know exactly what is expected of you at any moment in time. Communication on a one to one basis is a bit slower, but she always gets back to you. She shows interest in you as a person too and encouraged us to share weekend or break stories on Blackboard. Really glad I took her class",1
She is extremely generous and fantastic at helping her students. She is SO SWEET and nice and explains the material really well.,1
"Fantastic guy.  Gives great examples, tells corny jokes you can't help but laugh at, and is a very fair grader.  Does everything in a very upfront, easy to understand fashion, and presents the material very well.
 
 HIGHLY recommended",1
"Every grade comes from a group project. There is no individual work, or tests. Be prepared to work together.",1
"Mrs. Jimmerson is a great teacher. She's very informative and explains things on a pretty easy level. The first test is on history of the English language, the second is mainly sentence diagramming, and the third is vocabulary and correcting a paragraph. Very useful class. I learned a lot. Study hard and take it seriously and you'll pass.",1
"LA is an amazing prof!  she is super helpful and explains things amillion times until you understand it.  She always makes herself available for help if you need it.  If you have to take research methods, take it with Leslie Anne!!!",1
"Loved her! Very kind, very caring, one easy project, tells you what to focus on for the exams.",1
He is a great teacher. ,1
This class was interesting and touched on some topics that may be a little difficult/heavy for some and she does give this disclaimer at the beginning of the course. There was a group project and we did have the opportunity to grade our group members at the end of the course. I am not a fan of group projects but it went well. I'd take her again.,1
"This class was so informational, I learned a lot. We discussed current events and he gives quizzes almost every class which was very easy all you have to do was read.",1
"i had awesome experience in that class. i was never like English or language class in my hole life, but the way he teach that makes interesting",1
"Doug is a great professor! In 564 I found his lectures to be super boring, but in 445 when he wasn't lecturing regularly I really started to like him. He is really funny, casual and relatable. He gives fantastic feedback and is so encouraging to everybody in class regardless of skill level. He keeps it real and I'd definitely recommend him!",1
Great teacher!  Very understanding and wants everyone to learn.,1
"I gave Rick a 3 instead of a 2, because he's a nice guy, and he really tries to help you out if you go to him. But he's not very good at teaching. He hardly ever assigns homework, which might seem nice, until you get to the exam and realize that you had no idea what was coming. I never payed attention in class, but he was a nice grader.",1
"Professor Hartgrove was an amazing lecturer, I enjoyed the way she explained ideas and provided examples. Taking her in person is much more enjoyable. She is known for being unorganized and it took her the entire semester to grade essays, however if you follow the guidelines you'll be fine. Textbook is required and can be used on quizzes and exams.",1
"Her classes are boring.  Once enough people stop coming to class she'll offer extra credit.  I got by easily on the tests by just reading her powerpoints.  Books are a must have for her online assignments, but they are for extra credit towards the test.    I thinks she does a fine job.",1
"I'm currently taking this class at Northwest Vista. This professor is different from most that I have had. She actually cares about what's going on in not only your academic life, but is there with advice if you need it in your home life as  well. She likes to have active class discussions and I feel like I've learned alot from her.",1
Wonderful professor who really cares about what she does. Even though this class is online she is very interactive with the students and makes the topic interesting!,1
Most of the notes are given in class so if you don't go to lecture you won't be prepared for the test. There is a lot of homework and in class quizzes but it helps to cushion your grade for the test.,1
"This class was not at all what I expected.  The tests were completely random and hard, but at least he scaled them. Lectures are hard to sit through for 1hr and 20 min",0
"ECE 241 is a hard class for many, but Day does a great job of teaching it. He explains material very well in class and frequently gives examples of when the material we're learning about is used in the real world. He is very friendly, and always happy to help during his office hours. I wish he taught more classes!",1
"BOB IS SO FREAKING COOL! HES HELPFUL AND FUNNY.. HE GIVES A TON OF XTRA CREDIT AND HIS CLASS IS OK, BUT THERES A LOT MATH REQUIRED THATS THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES THE CLASS DIFFICULT.. IF YOUR GOOD AT MATH YOU SHOULD GET AN EASY A!",1
"After taking this class, I realized how poor my Spanish is. She is very particular with spelling, verbs and accents which was challenging for me. Overall, she gives great feedback about what one lacks and I think is very helpful. There are exams, discussion posts, homework, assignments, reading/assignment checks, 2 papers, and a video project.",1
I wouldnt suggest taking him! He doesnt give any homework or quizzes! Your entire grade is based on 3 tests the entire semester.,0
"He's a great professor who loves what he does. His class requires work, but he's always willing to help.",1
"The course material was not the greatest, and he did say he was going to revamp it, still pretty boring. His comments on papers were really helpful, though. Def not the easiest grader, but he was pretty fair.",1
"Professor Debbage is wonderful, very helpful",1
"Jason was by far my favorite professor this semester. Due to COVID-19, we had no more exams which was really helpful. Gave us all possible bonus points. TAs were really great and the homework wasn't too difficult if you put in the effort. I recommend him enough. He made class so much fun and I will genuinely miss this man.",1
"Some people were permitted late work and some weren't despite same reasons. Grading of drawings is inconsistent: a student loses 5 points for having a dimension line that is too long and another student loses 1 point for the same same line, same length. Why? I don't know. You teach yourselves, get others to help you. He does a short demo each day.",0
"I'm so thankful I transferred cause I wouldn't have known such an inspiration. Ronda is so helpful with everything, her knowledge in what she teaches doesn't go unnoticed. She helped me gained my confidence in designing again after transferring out of the art institutes. She's the most amazing teacher I've ever had and forever grateful for her.",1
SCIENCE CORE LAB YOU NEED TO TAKE WITH HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!! AMAZINGGG!!!!!!  Very helpful and he is hilarious.,1
"I took T.Flowers class, he has a different kind of sense of humor, works well with students,helps alot, offers extra credit if needed. Go to class is a MUST! he is watching you!!!!!",1
"Took his class over the summer so it was heavily condensed, lots of reading/tutorial videos to watch. That said, the essay topics were good and the papers weren't obscenely long. He definitely wants his students to succeed and is there to help. Responds to emails quickly and gives good feedback. I would recommend taking his class.",1
"This Professor is super nice and transparent with what she requires. Put your best foot forward and you should be fine grade wise :) Do all the work in a timely manner (8 week classes are hasty & tedious, but well worth the time saved) and again, with your best effort, and you should get an A no problem :) She is very kind and easy to work with.",1
"Shaw is an awful teacher. She might know about dogs, but she is a ridiculous and unfair grader, with unclear expectations. DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. I love dogs and she made learning about them unbearable.",0
"Dr. Mckibben is awesome! Yeah she may be expect a lot from her students but hey it's university, that's just the way it is! I really like this professor. If you don't like talking in class will you better start liking it because everyone is expected to participate in the class discussions. Some advice DONT SKIP THE READING.",1
"Professor Sankara is awesome- good teacher, friendly, fair grader. I totally disagree with the previous comment.. class isn't boring, it's my favorite french class yet at Delaware.",1
David is an amazing teacher as well a cool person.  His lessons are all from experience and he tells real life stories.  His test are a little hard but he gives you everything you need to know for them.  I highly recommend taking a class from him especially if you are thinking about owning your own business someday.,1
Dr. Storslee is the MVP. One of the BEST professors I have ever met. He's so humble and open-minded to every student. His class will definitely require you to put in the work and challenges you to get better each time. He looks for your effort and always hands out chocolates in his classes! Amazing man with great sense of humor. Highly recommended.,1
She was very nice and you can tell she cared about her students but the class was just too hard. I would compare my tests with students with other professors and the tests weren't nearly as hard.,0
"Do NOT take this class. He is very inconsistent and unfair. He gives pop quizzes multiple times a week and they are very different from the tests. He assigns up to 5 worksheets for homework a night. Granted it is easy math however sometimes It is very time consuming. Overall, he thinks hes never wrong and is very hard to work with.",0
"So awesome!  I've learned so much in this class!  At first I was worried about keeping up with all the reading and work, but once you see how it helps with your essays and how the topics make you think, it got easier.  Not a coaster class, she makes you work, but so worth it.  Totally recommend!!",1
"This class wasn't originally supposed to be taught by him but he adjusted and did the best he could to accommodate. He is flexible on the old professors grading scale and will go back to fix it if necessary. He wants his students to pass but this class is time consuming so if you don't put in the time, don't expect a good grade.",1
He is willing to go out of his way to help students. His work and experience is amazing.,1
"MBA class, foundation. Lots of busy work for 3 days or a week, lots of reading, articles from Harvard Business, basically preps you for school, helps you identify your goals for your MBA, gets you ready for school. Awesome person to talk to, caring, provides feedback, and guides you in the right direction, knowledgable.",1
"Took him on a short semester, teaches pertty clear and breaks down the steps. Practise test helps ALOT, if you got that down your good to go for the test. Final is accumulative of all practise test, same stlye of problems just changes numbers.",1
Great Prof. The work isn't hard at all. Fair grader. Feedback is great. Loved the class. I would take him again.,1
"Once you understand his sarcastic and sometimes cynical humor, he's an awesome professor, although somewhat predictable. His tests are not difficult if you just study the slides and skim the text.",1
This was by far the hardest class I have taken. All of his work is close together. The good thing is he realizes that and works with you on the time frame. Be prepared to STUDY!!! He does not allow enough time for quizzes and exams and they are extremely difficult!,0
"Great teacher, just make sure you complete the assignments by the due date and follow the directions carefully and you will get an A.",1
"WORST CLASS EVER!!! On top of being extremely condescending and constantly embarrassing students in the class, we have no mark going into our exam. Our exam is tomorrow and we just got an email that she hasnt finished marking our FIRST ESSAY (which was due in FEBRUARY). As well as 2 or 3am emails with assignments to have completed for the next day",0
"Never replied emails!! The feedback he gave me in the extended outline is ""plz insert page number"" and then gave me a 65%. excuse me?? Then another feedback said, ""your final results are different with the results in previous work you submitted, plz explain."" Why? because I found I was wrong in the previous one and now I wanna correct it! Can't I?",0
"Miranda is so incredible. I've had her for COMM 553/503, and she brings a really unique perspective and style to her classes. Her assignments can range in difficulty, but they're meant to challenge you, and she's very willing to help. She does lag a little with giving grades, but her feedback is excellent. I absolutely recommend her!",1
The lectures are nonsensical and she goes off tangents constantly without actually discussing the material we need. Her quizzes are unnecessarily difficult and she WILL take forever to grade everything. Her sakai page is unusable and won't be any help throughout the semester. Your knowledge of the subject doesn't really matter in the grand scheme.,0
She was a good teacher. Math is really hard for me but she made it a point to openly ask questions when you don't understand and when you did she happily answered. We had a chaulk board not a white board and she's allergic to chaulk so she was always stuffed up. I don't recommend missing class cause you'll never catch up.,1
"This class is super easy. But this professor is the horrible at explaining the content. He is a super nice guy, really caring and cool, just sucks at explaining math. I taught myself how to do everything in this course.",0
"Was really excited to take Leverson as a professor because I had heard that she was great. Was really disappointed because I genuinely didn't learn that much from her, all she did was read off of powerpoints and the study guides that she claimed would be helpful did nothing for the test. Will not take another class of hers.",0
"He's friendly but boring. He just reads from the powerpoints and talks about random things. I could never understand what he was saying. Bring your laptop and do work for other classes. Lectures are pointless but he does take attendance. 1 quiz, 1 case study presentation, 1 take home test & a final. Super easy if you study a bit.",1
"Dr. Crawley LOVES his job and it shows in the classroom. I have had him several times and would take him again. He is funny, relatable, light hearted and very knowledgeable. He is easily accessible outside of class and will help you with anything. He is one of the heads of the psych department and therefore offers a lot of help and advice.",1
"Dr. Mkhatshwa goes out of his way to ensure that each student understands the material, and if they don't, he's willing to meet with them outside class anytime to go over it. He often gives chances to make up bad exam grades. His PhD is in Math Education, so he's also just good at teaching math. He's great. Can't recommend enough.",1
"Ezell is awesome! He allows 6 unexcused absences per semester which is definitely doable, but he does give pop quizzes to ensure attendance stays up. The quizzes are straight from class work and the tests are straight from the quizzes! Super easy to get an A in if you keep up with your quizzes and review them before each test!!",1
I really enjoyed this class! Carlton Smith is a fantastic professor. He is always willing to help with papers and is more than fair with his expectations on papers. He's pretty funny too. I would take his class again any time!,1
"Dr. LaBelle is the best professor I've had at Chapman. I've taken 5 classes with her, and every time I left her class I felt smarter for being there. If you're struggling, visiting her in office hours will make all the difference as she'll take the time to break it down for you.",1
"I absolutely loved Professor Baez, he's super helpful outside of class. His lectures are very clear and informative. There's homework due every Friday at 11:59 PM and the exams are open note, open book, AND open discussion.",1
"If you want to spend a lot of time looking into the texts, this may not be the best class,  but if you want to explore the ideas found within them, you'll like it. There are four papers, no tests, and lots of group work, which I thought I would hate, but it turned out fine. Don't try to read all of the texts- you'll drown. Get a basic gist of them.",1
This rating has been removed as per our site guidelines.,1
"Professor Krutz is a good lecturer and throws some spice into lectures. The lectures aren't too important for SWEN101, but you will be working with a group to complete assignments. Due to the content and its introductory nature, a bad group is not the death of your grade as you are able to carry your team if absolutely necessary.",1
Can tell she was very knowledgeable on the subject but had to be one of my worst professors this semester. Gave piles of work but never gave feedback or grades until the 15th week (the grades). And the final was 7 pages long over a span of 5 days! In the middle of a pandemic?! Take another Professor if you care about yourself because its a mess.,0
"SHE IS THE BEST!!!!!! By far, one of my top three fav professors ever & her rate on here is 100% accurate. I can't say enough good things about her! Not only were the assignments easy to digest, but I actually learned something every week... I mean this class was a DREAM class taught by a DREAM teacher. I would highly recommend her for sociology",1
"She cares a lot about math and that future students will actually enjoy math so that is super good to know she cares. The assignments this semester have been changed/cancelled a few times due to confusion with requirements. Other than that, she is knowledgeable and definitely wants participation. Very understanding!",1
Professor Pantaleon is a very chaotic and messy teacher that cannot explain the easiest aspects of the subject. His lectures don’t cover test materials and his grading system is unclear. Don’t count on his help after evening class because he rarely has time for his students since he has to make it to the train station on time. .,0
"This is one of the best instructors I have ever had in my entire life. I enjoyed this class very much, and I appreciated how understanding and open they were. I think if you try your best, ask questions and enjoy the speeches, you will succeed! The speeches weren't hard either, some of them were even fun!",1
Jana is one of my favorite professors in the CFS program. She is very helpful and personable. If you have any questions or need extra help Jana is very willing.,1
"Carlton is an AWESOME professor! 135/136 is taught differently than his other classes, more laid back but still gives you lots to do. He encourages you to submit your work again and again and is very thorough with feedback on your piece. I don't think I took a single test, just wrote all semester long, and it was things I actually wanted to write!",1
"The professor doesn't respond in a timely manner. She doesn't check the answers on her exams, there were 5 wrong answers on our midterm (unable to determine if there were any wrong answers on the final). She is laid back in class but a tough grader. You must read the book and come to class if you want to pass. Shows up late often",0
I don't understand his class. I am just attending and for credit. I need to pass it. Attend the class and u will pass.,0
Take her. You'll thank me later.,1
Long chapters to read in a week's time yet quizzes have 10 questions over all the reading and there's review or a guide beforehand. Questions are also tricky. Does not give any lectures. Discussion participation is a must. This class made me feel incredibly jaded. There's no lectures or learning from the teacher it's just research and reading.,0
"Her PowerPoint are very visually based, lost of pictures, and it took about 10 minutes to download a PowerPoint onto my computer to study. Very annoying. Also she herself is very annoying.",1
This was an easy A class but I didn't learn anything from this professor. I took A&P which is the only reason I knew a lot of the information. Also the directions and the syllabus were very confusing to follow. She would become irritated quickly when asked questions by students. Easy GPA booster.,0
"Professor Reyes's class was the only SPA class that I didn't stress about. We had a small class of about 12, so there was a lot of attention to each student's skills. He put a very heavy focus on speaking and writing, which helped out majorly for the tests (all that was left was memorizing vocab words). He was also super personable. Great prof!",1
"I had him for Ethics of Eating.  It was a super fascinating class with lots of information.  I was never bored.  It is helpful to do the readings, but they aren't overwhelming.  Professor Egan is friendly, very knowledgeable and really helpful.  If you do the work, you'll get a good grade.",1
"I've taken two of her classes and really loved them both, but because she runs her class with a lot of small group discussion, its really important to be with other people who have done the required reading otherwise you'll be very bored. she offers extra credit on both the midterm and final so if you read and go to class, you'll do well",1
"(part 3) Cons(4): There are three exams in total and each counts 33% of the final grade, participation and the lab part of the course is of no value in terms of counting towards the final grade.  Cons (5): He gives more than 100 mutiple choice questions on the exam so it is guaranteed for you to get at least 7-10 questions wrong on the exam.",1
"Adelle has done an extremely good chance of teaching such a complex and interesting course during the pandemic, I could not recommend her enough. She was engaging, EXTREMELY organized, and her overall way of teaching is basically perfection. I wish more professors were like this.",1
I thought he was a great professor. He had a lot of knowledge and was really excited about what he was teaching. Kept it interesting. A little strict but kept us in line,1
"Super easy class. Only graded on 5 exams, and she drops the lowest one. The tests are all open note and answers are from the back of the book. Take this class and you can finish the whole thing in a weekend!",1
"Jennifer Sias is a perfectly nice professor. She's understanding with deadlines and easy to understand. However, I found the class to be EXTREMELY disorganized. Lots of overwhelming assignments due at the same time, class time is often spent sitting in a circle and taking turns reading aloud. This was a bit frustrating, but the professor is nice.",1
No Comments,1
"Professor Wiley is a great teacher! Follow his syllabus and you will do well. He goes out of his way to explain things and will help you with your assignments before you turn them in. If you have him as an option, definitely take him!",1
"I took her class in the short term. It was a 2 hour class, but she keeps it interesting with group activities that also help you understand the reading better. You don't have to worry about boring lectures in this class. Highly recommended.",1
"Cannot say enough good things, I really felt she provided every resource I needed to do well in this course. Found her lectures clear and interesting(!). The homework keys were extremely helpful too. Emailed me back detailed answers late at night before exams. Not easy material, but if you have to take 228 take it with Dr. K she is excellent!",1
"Although I had absolutely no interest in operations going in, Darwin was a great teacher who made the various topics interesting. Probably one of the top MBA classes I've taken because it exposed me to something I had no knowledge of previously, and his very dry sense of humor made it even better. Definitely take this class with Darwin!",1
"Absolutely one of my favorite professors. His lectures are very entertaining? But it's very important to attend the lectures and take good notes because you won't pass otherwise. Also, do your readings!! Your grade will suffer if you don't. There's only 4 tests and those are your only grades.",1
"I honestly thought he was a bad teacher t first from all the previous rates, but I think hes a really good teacher and seems like he cares what hes teaching to the students. I know sometimes he might be confused about what hes doing but he always gets back on track.",1
TAKE HIS ONLINE CULTURE GEOGRAPHY CLASS. This class is not that difficult. Follow course schedule you should always be on track. Only thing you do in this class is discussions and prequizzes and quizzes. MAKE sure you follow the grading criteria. Tests open book - gives plently of time to take them 3H. Final test is a breeze. He responds to emails!,1
"Professor Peterson's actually one of my favorite professors at CSUS. She's extremely kind. She never puts down your ideas. Instead, she enhances them before you prepare speeches. She offers to write letters of recommendations too! I got an A in her class. Overall, Prof Peterson's a 10/10.",1
"Disrespectful to his students and he repeats himself throughout the semester. He spams you with email everyday and doesn't teach you anything about photography. If attendance wasn't mandatory, there would be no reason to go. He brags about students that he has taught but he only does so he can find more faults in his students.",0
"Would give the weeks assignments halfway through the week, it's December 24th and the most recent assignment entered is from September. Kept on pushing back deadlines and essentially made the class last until December 23rd. Easy class. Pretty funny but posts some kind cringe anime memes but if that's your thing then go for it.",0
"Dr. Bliss is a nice guy who wants you to well. FInance can be tough so you have to put in a lot of time and effort. Watch his lecture videos and take notes before doing the homework, which takes a very long time, but help you learn the material. The tests are just like the HW and study guide questions, and you're allowed a notecard cheat sheet.",1
He is very good. He explains very well and has a very good interaction with students.,1
"Heyborne is great! He's clear, concise, and clearly loves biology. What I didn't like about the class was it was so short, because 14 classes is not enough time to learn. The work assigned was mostly written, he honestly corrected the grammar more than any English professor I have ever known, with less focus on the actual biology concept.",1
"Ben gives a lot of complex reading but pares it down to the essential (and tested on) concepts in class. The lectures are alright, usually interesting, but can be dry. If you come to class, take notes, and do the review guides (make friends & split work), the exams are very easy. Otherwise, good luck trying to understand the readings on your own.",1
"She's nice, understanding, and just wants you to participate and do your work.",1
"Honestly, I would take this class again. And, I'm not a math sort of person. Mr. Wildman is eccentric and a little weird at first, but he uses that to his advantage. His quirky analogies and activities help you understand the course material. I would say that one quarter with him beat four years of high school. Don't pass up this opportunity.",1
Northrup is wicked understanding and helpful. He is extremely accessible and even gave out his cell number to the entire class. If you ask for help he will spend a lot of time helping you. He can be disorganized at times but its nothing crazy,1
"It's hard to keep up sometimes, but she is nice and clear about what she wants in the essays. Grades mediocre sometimes, and if you need help, go to office hours because she will help you if you ask.",1
"AMAZING professor, one of the best that I have had at CSULA. She 's beyond helpful and will give you plenty of chances to maintain the grade you want. Although the test can be a little difficult, if you study and take it serious you will pass the tests. Lectures are very interesting but can sometimes be overwhelming, however if you need help ASK! ",1
Excellent professor. Loves his craft and is always looking for ways to improve his class and his students.,1
"Super hard class, lots of homework, but she's a good professor. I learned a lot in her class. She can be kind of ditsy and somewhat of a pushover, but otherwise a good professor. I would take another class from her.",1
Love her. She's an amazing professor her class is easy and reviving an A is the easiest to get in her class. She is the best professor you'll ever meet and if English is your weakest subject she is one that won't make English a weak subject :),1
"He is really young and therefore understanding. I took his 408D class (honors), and tests were really easy. As long as you do your homework, you will ace the test. His explanation is sometimes hard to understand because of terminology, but as he goes through examples, you will fully understand the concept.",1
"Steps to making an A: Take online, DO ALL OF THE HOMEWORK, take the test (grade doesn't matter.) Do whatever you want on the project. I know this is going to sound odd, because it is, the test grades do not matter that much, most of your grade comes from homework. I forgot to do some of mine, drop my grade from an A to a C, had A's on all test. ",0
"He is a great guy and has a great personality. He jokes with the class, but he had quizzes every class period that were impossible to study for. I put in 5 hours a week for this lab but it was useless. He has things weighted to where no one can get an A. Everyone in my class got a B or lower. I never got below an A in science classes until now.",1
She is an amazing professor!,1
Dr. Braun is great. Highly recommended. I would take the class again,1
"Dr. Witelski is an awesome professor, and a great guy. He's always there to answer emails/questions in office hours. His class is extremely hard, but you can see the common thread of the class from beginning to end. The course is well designed and well kept, and I learned a ton in it.",1
Dr. Guttmann is an extremely intelligent man. His lectures are both knowledgeable and interesting. He is one of the few instructors who truly lecture in the biology department. His tests are really hard though. All short answer and fill in the blank. Do know how to spell his full name it will probably pop up as extra credit on the test.,1
"Monika's a nice and caring prof. Every day in class is a bit meh, tho. We'd come in then she'd tell us to take out our travaux pratique then she'd literally call on us one by one to answer each response and it was a bit of a pain and boring. But she is nice and gives decent explanations. She is super willing to explain things outside of class!",1
"Professor Smith is a fantastic lecturer and a very funny guy. You have to do the reading and there is plenty of it, but his tests are very straightforward. He is the best professor teaching the 104 series.",1
"Awesome professor. Very intelligent, down-to-earth, and humorous. He's passionate about math and is great at teaching. He makes sure everyone understands and explains step-by-step. He gives practice exams as well. He's one of the best professors. Such a cool dude. Do the homework & bring questions to class & you should do fine. Highly recommended!!",1
"She is someone I  have so much respect for, someone I learned so much from, and someone I  look up to. I had Jayne Lobert for 141, theory, clinical, and 153 theory. . She is not easy, but she is definately an awesome instructor,and a teacher I will always keep in contact with. Be prepared to work hard cuz she doesn't put up with stupidity.",1
"Stacey is one of the best professor I've had, he cares a lot about his student. He is always willing to help, his classes are all about participation, he always available for tutoring, his test are hard, all spelling must be proper, hardly every is his test multiple choice.",1
"He's a really nice professor and he usually will give you the answer to the in-class iclicker questions. If you show up to class and do the work, you'll be fine. You do have to buy the connect online textbook which is kinda spendy.",1
She cares way too much about rocks. Its weird. She expects us all to be geologists even though the majority of our class are not geology majors. If you are thinking to take her just to get your science credit - DONT. She will make what you think will be a blow-off class way too hard.,0
"Mr. Humphrey has definitely made my college experience a lot easier. No homework, just do the study guides and you are pretty much guaranteed an A. Very understanding that life happens and will understand if you can't make it to class. (Just let him know, and do NOT take it for granted.) One of the best teachers I've EVER had.",1
Every professor should be just like him. An amazing professor. It helps students understand and to think outside of the box. No one ever missed a class because we all wanted to learn from him. He has truly inspired me.,1
I took this class in 2020 and I don't know if it was just the circumstances but this class was lacking structure and presence. Lectures were hard to sit through sometimes but it was an easy pass. If you are looking for surface level insight into the field consider this class.,0
"For having a class that was way too full, she was really good at being involved.  She always made you feel really good about your art no matter how bad you thought it was.  She had very good tips, if you were open to them. She will spend as long as you need showing you a certain drawing technique to help you out",1
This teacher is unprofessional and rude when you ask for help. Makes fun of students and talks down to his students. Should NOT be a teacher.,0
"Took Legal Negotiations with this professor. This is a good class. Material is not as cut and dry as some other graduate law courses. However, professor does a really good job explaining the material/concepts clearly. Learned a lot/practical material.",1
Professor Harvey is always trying to help his students and give them a different perspective,1
"Pretty good class.  Nelson is an amazing professor with a sense of humor.  Too bad I can't pull out a decent grade, but it's worth it.  Not all of the class time is spent on the lit which isn't a bad thing.  Wish there was more discussion, though.",1
"His class is not easy, but hes a good guy and cares a lot. Show up and study and youll do well.",1
"The problems that were talked about in class were not nearly as difficult as the problems on the test. She would always say in class that she was ""trying to invoke a higher level of thinking."" While I appreciate this, I wish that the examples in class were the same difficulty as the test. We also rushed at the end of the year which was not fun.",1
all im gonna say is that the mean exam scores were in the low 40's for the ENTIRE CLASS. Highest was in the 50's.,0
"I took his online class and it was great. I recommend listening to his lectures, writing notes, and memorizing pictures...that's all and you should get an easy A/B. I will warn you that his lectures are boring, especially since I have a short attention span, but don't worry..you can always fast forward to the important parts but dont do it too much",1
"Prof. Yelleswarapu is amongst the best professors at UMB. He's brilliant, inquisitive, genuine, and personable as hell. He is an accomplished researcher, yet he does not brush off education; his ethic dictates that the most important part of teaching is to actually help students learn. He's quick to respond, tough as nails, and beyond approachable.",1
"If you attend and pay attention on his lecture, you'll find no trouble of getting through the course. All of his lectures are 95% base on real life experience and text book use is very minor except for some necessary table requires to do home works. Otherwise, study all his notes and pass the class just a piece of cake.",1
"The midterm research paper and final count for like your whole grade, so the other stuff barely  matters! She is VERY broad on what will be on the tests, and most are short answer ques. & essay. Teacher is not friendly or helpful at all!!!",0
She definitely won't be swayed in her ways but she is very easygoing as long as you follow the instructions and get your work done. You can learn how to quickly improve with her feedback.,1
Horrible instruction. She rather talk about her personal life than explain what the class is doing wrong since apparently we make so many mistakes. She has handed out three pages so far and has not discussed any of the questions we answered for a grade. gives prompt for two passages to choose then pushes off the book never to talk about it again.,0
She has high expectations for her students. She is a tough grader and tough teacher but she is a great person!,1
Tammy is such a sweet and fun teacher! Attendance was mandatory but the classes were fun and easy. Tests were done in groups and there were assignments due Tuesdays and Thursdays based on the chapters that were discussed in class groups but they were the same 5 questions. ,1
gives us extra credit with helps alot.,1
Great teacher! Easy to understand. Very Helpful.,1
"Your grade is based on one exam, weekly quizzes, recitations, and homework. The professor flies through lecture slides, but lecture recordings are posted. She makes a lot of mistakes in class and can be rude to students. We had to fight for extra credit that was in the syllabus. If you have the option, you might want to choose someone else.",0
I think I learned more watching grass grow than being in this class. As an objective person I think his methods of teaching are a complete waste of students valuable time. All we would do is listen to other people's opinions on irrelevant topics. He is also a pretty lazy grader. Lacks constructive criticism and when he does it's a few sloppy words,0
All Im going to say is only the strong survive,1
"hated him, he needs to teach more and take more responsibility",1
Ree is a very laid back teacher but also does everything he can to make sure you understand the material and use proper safety in the shop. A great professor and an even better match for a game of MTG. Bonus points for being easy on the eyes,1
Dr Avila is a very awesome professor! She teaches the subject very well in a slow pace. Take advantage of the extra credit given to you. You have a quiz every time you meet. The questions from the quizzes show up on the exams. Study! Very hilarious professor!,1
Walker was an excellent professor. I enjoyed every minute of his class and didn't complain about it being at 9:30 in the morning because i was actually looking forward to it.,1
"So many unnecessary online quizzes that she does not mention in class, but expects u to know as they are on the syllabus. Toughest grader ion essay and if you expect to get an A in this class, best of luck to you as I don't know a single person in my class that has gotten an A. Super boring lectures as well, almost fell asleep in every single one.",0
"She tries and fails to relate to students. She lectures about the exact same topic day after day, ad nauseam. She is probably one of the most boring lecturers Ive ever had to sit through.",0
"Most genuine, caring man, incredibly passionate about the subject area and makes dry topics engaging",1
"He was probably the best math professor I had at Cal Poly. He knows his stuff and explains it better than anyone. Also really nice guy but he does challenge you a bit on tests. If you put in time, do all homework and study you will get a B or higher. ",1
"He expects that you'll read all of the short stories and books, and hopes that you'll read ahead. Take good notes while you're reading. He never belittles a student's opinion or viewpoint--in fact he builds upon it and shows how all perspectives have value. He is available during office hours and glad to help.",1
"She is very helpful with her studies, lesson are online and if you are able to move quickly you are welcome to do so. She is very helpful of making sure you understand the lesson at hand. I enjoyed her lot.",1
"What a badass. By far one of the most enjoyable classes I've taken by Pace - this dude is the bassist for the Bacon Brothers and knows his stuff. I love music and music history, so I may be biased, but this class was just COOL from start to finish. Tests are actually harder than you'd expect, but I still got an A. Try not to miss class a lot.",1
"He is a very good professor. He did not lecture in class but if you needed help he was super eager to help you. Since the class was online and let us have our space, he stays up front and his tests are easy. He's a great professor when you need help and when you don't. He did not take attendance but if you get too far behind he'll withdrawal you.",1
"Passing Calc. 2 was not easy. But this guy made it possible. Yes, you are going to have a lot of homework, but he goes over everything you need to know. The weekly quizzes are a bummer, but helpful also. Just ask question and do your homework and you will be fine.",1
"I lived in his office by the end of the semster.  He is the hardest teacher you will EVER have but he is beyond helpful because he is very knowledgable.  It wasn't uncommon to spend more than an hour per problem.  You may not get a great grade, but you will learn so much!",1
"Sociology 16 was a breeze. Much of the material was informative and intuitive. The class atmosphere was okay. The class projects / presentations were easy, not a big deal. This is a college class. Caveat - if you don't study from the book, you'll most likely receive an C on the exams. Buddy-up with someone and you'll do fine",1
"Dr. Fontenot is a brilliant professor. He is very down to earth, and is willing to help if you come by his office. He's a tough essay grader. However, if you take good notes and participate, an A isn't impossible.",1
"Made a scary class fun and understandable. Very easy to relate to and very easygoing about grades, exams, and papers. Easily one of the best professors ever had.",1
she needs to stay on top of her grades she dosent seem to be able to get them in elearning.,1
"Don't take him!! It's difficult to verbalise just how tedious he is-like a recording of an unfunny Mr. Rogers narrating lectures in slow-motion. Very unclear about requirements, however he spends 20 mins at the beginning of each class repeating the date of every quiz and assignment. Treats you like a child-don't get caught doodling or looking away.",0
"Mrs. Mcgee is the BEST science teacher! Take notes in class, review the power points thoroughly and make sure you complete all study guides. Whatever is on the study guides will be on the exams. Study the material!! Youre in a college level science course! She grades fairly. You either know the material or you don't so just study!! She's fantastic",1
Dr. Viola is the BEST teacher for a core science class. There is no reason for any grade below a B. Along with all the jokes he makes a 3hr lab (which never is 2hrs) very entertaining. His ability to help students as well as make them laugh results in a good learning enviroment whit little stress and anxiety.,1
"Not an easy professor, but Guetter is a pretty cool and funny guy.  Downside is the 8am, 4 days a week. I'd recommend him, though.",1
"Moves through material too quickly and will not pause for questions. If you have the courage to ask a question, be ready to be ridiculed for not understanding the concept. By far the worst teacher I've ever had. I made sure to take an onsite class so I would get the most bang for my buck, but I would go home and teach myself online anyway :(",0
"Heed these warnings, for they are all true. She even stated in our class that she is not fond of teaching and no longer wants to do it. Doesn't answer emails. She does not give grading criteria for big projects, and then grades very hard. I even lost points for being ""too concise"" on a big project. Is that even possible?",0
"Didn't enjoy the class at all.  The professor wasn't very helpful at all, but in the end, it was an easy A.",0
Ok all the rates cross them out. SUCH AN EASY A dont even have to stay sign in and leave supper easy course 3 exams all online easy to cheat all answers are on quizlet and one group project a 4th grader can do! Deff him take lol strong accent tho,1
"Her accent's thick, but understandable. There're many extra credit opportunities and she grades homework on completion. Her lectures aren't very engaging and it seems like her slides are just too text-heavy. I did better when I just listened instead of reading them. She'll say certain things will be on the tests that aren't. She's very kind though!",1
"Dr. Costanza varies his lecture material and explanation based on his interests, but expects the student to write in-depth papers on each topic every week. Tough quizzes that are weighted to info or details NOT discussed in class. Costanza's rigid ultra-conservative Christianity can be uncomfortable. On plus side, class is repetitive tasks and easy",0
David is the my favorite professor at the university. If you study the slides he gives you for the test there is no reason you shouldn't get an A. He also does a good job of taking interest in every student and  giving his advice of how to build a better resume and grow professionally.,1
"Had this guy for two semesters. lectures are very dry, but he throws out a lot of hypothetical situations and prepares you well for interviewing and reporting. knows a lot about the industry, but if you cant take criticism well, dont take the class. he will give you several chances to do well. The textbook sucked, pay attention to his powerpoints.",1
This class is all group projects with some quizzes thrown in. Almost half our classes were online because she was not available. The class is not hard but it is LONG and the lectures can be extremely dry and are usually just read straight from the powerpoint. LaMothe is kind but I am happy to be done with the course.,1
"I took her walking/jogging course. You will be required to track your workout 5 days a week (never 2 days off in a row).  This was difficult for my bad knees, so if you have an old injury, be forthright about it at the beginning of class.  At the end of the semester, we were required to participate in a 5K.",1
"I blame Margo, but I also blame the class. The theories she teaches are dated. If she's to teach them, it should be with a critical eye... she just explains them with these lengthy lists of examples. And, yes, her voice is really annoying.",0
"Mr. Rohan is a great teacher, extremely understanding and willing to work with you to excel in his class. Its not an easy a necessarily but if you put the work in and get with the teacher when you need help you will do well. Genuinely one of the best math teachers Ever",1
I took prof Az at NCC for Asl152. Im already fluent in ASL but i was taking the class for credits. She's an amazing professor. Explains everything clearly. Very caring towards her students and understanding. Attendance is mandatory because it is a visual learning class but as long as you try your best and participate you'll do well.,1
"One of my favorite professors I have ever had, wish I could take more courses with him because you will learn a lot. Lot of reading, (normal for the major) and I found the readings to be the most enjoyable of what I had in the semester. You will not regret taking any of his classes, he is above all very understanding. He is also hilarious",1
Does not fully answer questions and has a very thick accent that is super hard to understand at times. Asked questions multiple times that received no answer because he didn't know how to answer and often diverted away from the question. I would definitely NOT recommend please take someone else if you can. ,0
"Her tests are very poorly done, are often very confusing and seem that every answer could be right. The material is not hard, but the tests are not clear and becomes problematic.  Bring snacks and coffee to stay awake in class. she gets very off topic very easily and talks a lot about her self. no powerpoint or anything just her talking for 3 hours",0
Ferguson shows documentaries almost every class and writes notes on the board that are important for you to take down (they will show up on exams). You read 200-400 pg books per week which is way too crazy for a gen ed class. Only take this if you actually show up to class.,1
You have to do the homework and show up on time this semester half my class dropped because it was too many papers like too many he should at least put it on the syllabus before because it would be better and gets mad that we couldnt take words from the class discussion for the mc notes he is a character mainly speak and you better be right,0
he is lazy....he should be paying us to take the course.  i didn't learn a thing in this course and if you don't play like a pro then you do aweful and he doesn't respect you.,0
Professor Lipson pushes you. The pre-law classes in the department and the weekly preparation is a huge challenge for those interested. Study guides before every exam and the content is actually from lectures!,1
"Easy class! A lot of homework assignments every week: mini short essays, social media, quizzes, chapter homework, and class participation assignments. There's a mid-term and final, and one major essay that requires to do presentation on it. Teacher is really nice and grades easily. Boring lectures!!",1
"there are 3 ""tests"" which are long essays. hint: If you write over 20 pages for a test, you will probably get an A for the test. he always lets us out early, and only keeps you for an hour. our discussions are interesting and he is really funny. I would take him again!",1
"He's one of those professors that you resent during the semester because of the amount of reading and how hard his tests are, but I have to say I came away from his class with a ton of knowledge. Makes you work for it, but it's probably the class I've got most out of in college.",1
Very comprehensible,1
Mean. Gives contradictory feedback. Not helpful.,0
"really smart but down-to-earth guy, gives clear lectures and pretty laid back and likes throwing a few jokes here and there",1
She is very passionate about plants and the material she teaches. I really enjoyed lectures.  She takes the time to learn her students names so take the time to show up. For exams she is clear on expectations and as long as you put time in to learn a topic thoroughly you can do really well.,1
He was an okay professor. Does not explain concepts that well but also not the worst at it. Never responded to any of my e-mails about hw or grading. Grading is done at the end so the entire semester I didnt really know my grade.,1
I learned a lot from her and she is the best english professor a student could have. She tells you exactly what she wants from you. Great professor.,1
The best teacher in the world,1
"Dr. Tavss has a special place in my heart. He loves chemistry as much as he loves teaching, and will go the extra mile for his students. To do well, read the textbook, his notes, and complete all of his problem packets. Do attend his office hours as well; he is very insightful and has more time to break down the material further.",1
"I've never met a professor so picky about work, I'd understand if this was a more advanced course like thesis 1 or something, but 3D design is a beginners course and he is ruthless with his students, you better make sure nothing in your pieces are off because he picks it apart like crazy, he's a funny guy and chill to talk to but extremely picky",0
Do not take this professor unless you are a fulltime student and enjoy spending over 20 hours EACH WEEK doing homework. Expect work to be assigned every single day. That is not an over exaggeration. She has a firm belief in quantity over quality. I learned very little and her interactions with students are cringe-worthy and combative.,0
"Dr. Johansen is the epitome of a caring, and charismatic professor. She makes a Monday evening class something to look forward to. She truly demonstrates what true passion for teaching is. I am grateful and honored to have been in her class.",1
"Terrible experience. Very unorganized and lacks the necessary communication skills to teach remotely. Whole grade is based on 2 tests taken in a totally different format than 3rd party software she uses to ""teach"". Unreasonable expectations, passive aggressive emails, no passion. She doesn't care and it shows-don't waste your time/money.",0
"The course was very interesting and informative; two classes are hands-on dog training. Jamie can come off a little rough and I wouldn't expect everyone to love her on a personal level. She is set in her ways and tells a lot of personal anecdotes of limited relevance, but you can learn a lot about behavior and positive-based training.",1
"Mr. Brooks's class was very difficult. A lot of my class mates withdrew. I think there were maybe 7 of us left. However, I am very glad I took his class. I learned a lot from him, especially about composition.",1
"Super nice, funny guy, but not good at lecturing. Examples given in class and in Sapling are WAY easier than exams. However, study the practice exams for a good idea of what to expect. WARNING! A lot of unseen problems pop up in every exam so there's a limit-unless you're really smart.",0
"Pam is a nice enough lady and an easy and fair grader, but her class was unbearably long and consisted of mainly her talking. Overall, I would take her class again--but there were some serious low points as far as boredom goes.",1
I dont know what the other kids are talkin about. Yes it was an 8am but if your in college stop complaining. Her clicker quizes are pretty easy and you can use everyone around you to help out. The exams arent all the hard she gives you big hints if you go to the lectures whats going on the tests.,1
"WORST CLASS EVER. You will study all semester long and still struggle. Awful tests, easy quizzes, busy work assignments. You do not even learn the most important part of the course until the last week of class. ",0
"His tests are extremely hard. If you must take this class, I recommend a light load, it is very time consuming. His study guides and lectures barely cover anything he asks. The test are timed and questions and very tricky. I was on youtube a lot for better understanding. Also do the extra credit even tho it cost extra, it will help in the end.",0
"Steve is a nice guy and although he  often asks very broad vague questions, he just wants to hear your opinion and have you expand on the material. He is all for allowing the class decide what to do and how to do it. Really liked the choice of a blog or story at the end. Lastly he brought coffee for us, so he warranted a good review.",1
Due to the online only format he was thoughtful in allowing multiple attempts at quizzes and homework. It was a great option some sections were harder than others.,1
"Loved Miss Lytle, she made public speaking less painful!!!",1
Prof. Jagpal is very brilliant. This class gives you very good understanding of Marketing. Use his book and you will get most out of the teaching. Not an easy class and you need to work with him. Don’t be intimidated to talk. He encourages healthy discussions. He is one of the best professors Rutgers has.,1
"This professor is the first I have ever rated. She is the most helpful, kind, and understanding professor. I took this class as fast track (3hr long classes) but she made the time go by really fast.  Really easy projects and she lets you use whatever version of the textbook you find so you don't spend a lot.  Highly recommend her.",1
He refuses to use Canvas or email so contacting him outside of class is a hassle. He rarely takes time to explain the lessons so he almost expects you to know what he's doing. It's honestly easier to learn from the textbook than from his lectures. His tests seem simple but his grading makes it difficult. Just horrible and difficult.,0
Bob is wonderful and he provides lots of extra credit to help get a great grade. This is a fun and informative class.,1
He is on the short list 'Great Men' that I've learned from in my life. He possesses a tireless work ethic and an enthusiasm for academics that is contagious.,1
"If you want to do good in this class watch the lectures he posts online before class. Instead of taking all of my notes during lectures, I took mine from the videos, then adding anything that wasn't covered in the videos during the lecture. It's a tough class if you haven't taken chemistry in high school.",1
He really knew the material and was passionate about it. He also required a lot which helped push me and helped me really learn the material.,1
"Miller can be hard to please because he expects you to be real and talented in a way you might never have known existed before, but he is a professor who makes you feel you are in college and not high school, which is what this school feels like in most classes besides those of Miller.",1
Mr. Martin is an understanding guy and really cares for his students and their success! This course isn't hard and should be taken serious. ,1
"Professor Hansen is the best professor I've ever had. Taking critical theory with him expands your mind in so many ways and will make you a smarter person. He's very funny, and his lectures are always entertaining. He's a really nice guy, and very approachable in office hours.Take a class with him whenever you can. You won't regret or forget it.",1
awesome prof. my inspiration. ,1
"Very, very bland lecture. Monotoned and reads almost straight from her slides. Tests are not to hard if you study. A lot of questions come from the online quizzes and the book self check so that helps. Not a hard class but not interesting either",0
"She was very good at teaching Cryptography. I had her for five courses during my Kettering career and I never had the problems that others seem to have. She's very nice and she always does a good job at teaching algorithms. I had absolutely no problem learning cryptography from her, she made the algorithms very clear.",1
"Barcley is one of the best teachers I've had at WMU. He doesn't believe in the conventional type of class with a bunch of homework and tests. He gives you literally everything you need to know for exams. Try and turn in your notes for study guides, you won't regret that. One of the best and easiest classes I have taken yet.",1
"you need to do the homework, or you will not pass and i like about this teacher she helps jn her office hours and gives you allots of tips and prepair to write she gives good of notes",1
"AWSOME PROFESSOR!!! If you do not like Math classes, you should take professor Rohan because he can motivate you 100%. He is excellent! Very caring, professional, and fair with students that do well in classes.",1
"I hate the lab from his TA, seems like they are going to fail all students",0
"I love Barbara Wilson! She's very knowledgeable, extremely polite, caring, and thoughtful, and tells great stories. I wish I had her for 111, and wish I could take her for 113.",1
"If you're looking for a passive history class to coast through this GUR, DO NOT TAKE GILL. She's under the dire misimpression that her students want to take the class seriously - THEY DO NOT.   Obscure questions, tons of homework reading for EVERY class, low quality preparation material before exams, often late to class. 2/10 would not take again",0
"I am so delighted to talk about Jonathan Ball. He is and will be my best, his kind is hard to find. He is down to earth. teaches for the dullest to wake up, very funny and makes you wanna be in class everyday. please take him and you wont be disappointed.",1
"She is a great professor. Took her for both lab and lecture. Wish she went over the models a little more for lab though. She gives many quizzes, homeworks, etc. so there is room for your grade to be higher since it is based off more than just test. Also offers a bit fo extra credit.",1
Professor Mendelez is very understanding during the pandemic and he provide us with 2 options : either to take exam 3 or take the final. He add some extra credit and some curve at the end of the semester. I would definitely take him again,1
"Dave is a quick teacher for 141 and 142. He makes you work for it. He goes through material fast and you will need to study outside of class. However, he responds to emails in a timely manner and will make time outside of class for you. He's also flexible if you ask. Do your homework, do the reviews, and the book tests, and you'll get an A!",1
"Had to drop this class after a few weeks. She gives tons of homework for little credit. Homework is worth 5 points only and thats only if she collects it. She does some mistakes on exams like marking an answer wrong when its correct so you have to look out for that. Whole grade is based on tests and final, does not count homework or attendance.",0
He is sweet,1
Mrs. Holmes is one of the best teachers I've ever had. She's very personable and definitely super caring. Her class is so fun! Lessons are very easy to follow step by step learning & she makes sure everyone understands the concept before moving on. She makes sure everyone participates. I would recommend her to anybody. Definitely choosing her again,1
"This is the least representative rate my professor, I would say 90% of students adore professor Layoun. She's unconventional, hilarious, outgoing and has more energy than her students (she was a professor when my mom was a student but you'd never know) - anyways if you don't take her bc of rate my professor, that's a shame.",1
"All the assignments were focused on recording interviews. I wish there was more variety in the learning material; the class is about new media, so there's plenty you can learn! Although he is not clear on any of the assignments (but expects you to know exactly what he's talking about), at least he is willing to help out and answer any questions.",1
"Phenomenal! He is like a helpful grandpa who really wants his students to succeed.  I struggle with Chemistry and didn't do so well on the first exam but after going to Dr. Tavss's lectures he made me fall in love with the subject I hated! I still think the material of General Chem is tough, but Tavss made it so clear that I brought my D to a B.",1
Awesome professor. He wants us to understand and not just remember words. This course is hard! But he uses lots of pictures in explaining things. You must work for your grade.,1
Good prof. Makes learning a second language very comfortable. Never makes anyone feel stupid about making a mistake. Good sense of humor. Excellent class.,1
"Ms. Gordon is a GREAT teacher! She explains math in a way that you totally understand it; she even shows you diffrent ways to do it to find the best way that works for you. I've never been good at math and I came out of Math 0306 (fast track) with an A+. She's funny, she gives extra credit, and no suprises on the test (like what's that).. Take her!",1
"Wonderful instructor, will remember her and her engagement in the course.",1
"Even though she's strict and a tough grader, she was always very encouraging, and gave thourough feedback. She gave a few extra credit opportunties, which I'm very glad I did, because they help a LOT in the long run. She also encourages (and grades) participation by putting people with similar topics in discussion groups.",1
he is very monotone and has a dry sense of humor the quizes are easy since you can use the book..study and you should be just fine watch out for the curve,0
Professor Ladon was not a terrible professor but she was a little disorganized. She was not great at answering questions when asked and she was a little passive-aggressive. I suggest you study every chance you get and complete all the practices!,1
This professor does not answer e-mails in a reasonable amount of time. He barely interacts with the class and his assignments are VERY incomprehensible.,0
Weird teacher! She makes us do the most random essay topics and makes little sense when explaining them. She grades hard based on if she likes what you wrote about not on structure or style. The classes are pointless she reads out of a book or someone's essay. There are only 3 papers and a notebook and thats ur grade. Get someone better if possible,0
Tough grader when it comes to papers and exams. Not as strict as the other reviews say(maybe cause I have/had him as an adjunct prof). Has chapter outlines that are easy to follow and everything covered will be on the quizzes(15 questions). Gives quizzes back for exam reviews. Response questions on exams are from writing assignment prompts.,0
"Dr. McDonald is a great professor; he keeps students engaged by randomly calling on them during lecture (it's not as bad as it seems) and presents the materials in an easy and understanding way. He wants everyone to pass the class. Although, test grades are very important; the final is worth 45% of your grade but attend class and study, you should.",1
"She is truely one of teh best professors at WCCC she is eager to help all her students succeed in all that they do, if they are willing to let her help. I am sure she is like that in all of her classes. She really is just one heck of a woman when it comes to all of her achievements in her specialized field.",1
"omph! what a difficult class. I'm so glad it's over! But also glad I took from HIM. comprehensive. willing to start from where other teachers left off to make sure you truly understand what you need to know before you graduate. would highly recommend, but pull up your bootstraps and expect to earn the grade you receive.",1
His class requires discipline and being consistent. You will really have to work for your A. That's why I like his class. It's challenging and makes you think. He cares about his students and wants them to learn as much as they can.,1
"Reminds of School, Sending you back if you are 5 mins late to class, i am serious not joking at all! Gives a lot of Quizes and final is cummulative! Trust me guyz dont ever take her class. Lot of studying for low grade!",0
"Great teacher! Very helpful, her test are challenging but if you pay attention in class, you will do wonderful! She does a lot of group work during class and offers a lot of bonus during the semester!",1
"He's hilarious, manages to teach something that in anyone else's hands be incredibly dry, boring, and tedious in a way that is relatable and easy to understand. While he is hard to reach by email, he's always available for office hours. I'm so glad I took 301 with him, as he's the only thing that makes that class worthwhile.",1
PROS: 1.) automatic 50% for just turning in assignment. 2.) Automatic 100% for submitting completed assignment. 3.) Plenty extra credit! CONS: 1.) Little directions on how to do assignments 2.) Gives mostly busy work 3.) Portfolio worth 50% of grade 4.) Don't miss class for any reason,1
"Ok look.I got like a 95% in this class. Tons of homework and quizzes that prepare you for the exams. You can always contact him to take a quiz that you missed within a week of the quiz. He doesn't post his lectures but his lectures are extremely relevant and useful every time! Don't miss class, you will regret it. Just go to class!!!",1
"Dr. Goldenbaum has high expectations. She won't sugarcoat things and gives blunt feedback, but is also very concerned with her students' success and will help however possible. Very knowledgeable, clear, and to-the-point lecturer. She definitely helped me improve my writing abilities and was happy to act as a mentor and give advice. Love this lady.",1
who cares... look at him!,1
"Just go to class and you'll do well. Write solid papers and turn them in ON TIME, EVERY TIME. Go to every paper review day and you'll make an A. Just do the work. Pretty funny, obviously loves what he does.",1
"Worst teacher ever!!! Tough greater, doesnt even teach but expects you to know everything and she will report you if you forget to cite anything. Shes absolutely terrible this lady should be fired, not a teacher at all!",0
bad teacher,0
Best class since coming to DCCC. super funny and charismatic. Attendance is not mandatory but count for a percentage of grade,1
"He is a very self-righteous person, doesn't believe that he consists of imperfections. Claims he is the best writer, and can do anything better than anyone. Excessively talks about movies and shows. Loves to play Devil's advocate but isn't open minded enough to see other sides. Offers suggestions but will tell you that you're mediocre. Conceited.",0
very nice professor everyone likes the way he impart the class.he gives you advice of what questions would be on tests. he tell you what to study for possible questions very nice. i liked a lot his class. he won't teach for long only 2 more semesters and he will be gone so take his classes you wont regreat,1
The worst Professor i have ever witnessed,0
"Mrs. Holmes is an awesome teacher. She is very funny, and caring. After struggling with math for a very long time, I actually understand in her class. She doesn't try to trick you, she gives clear procedures on how to complete a given concept. She does call on you during class, but it is just because she cares that everyone is learning. Choice her!",1
"Mr. Brooks was not my favorite, he was very monotoned so when you are in class it is very hard to stay focused. When working from home/online he is very short and not helpful in the slightest. Once working from home he would assign tests but not announce to you that you had an assignment. they were hidden in folders and not made known to students.",0
I absolutly love Sara!  She really knows very much about theatre and she made it fun.  She has this great attitude and she really does love teaching.  She has great passion.  I feel like I really learned a lot and as long as you think about projects it is really pretty easy.,1
"This class was Fierce Sociology, a class centered around Beyonce.  Don't let that fool you, it was far from an easy class.  The class is effectively a class on intersectionality that is themed with Beyonce.  The class was very reading intensive, but most of the reading was very relevant. If you like black feminist theory, you will love it!",1
She is an awesome professor who is always willing to help and who makes the class interesting.  She cares about her students and to such an extent that she reminds me of Ms. Honey from the book Matilda.,1
"Stunning and electrifying lectures. Very easy tests if you show up and take mild notes. Very interesting, understanding, and generally cool guy. Don't make the mistake of taking a different professor. He is the best.",1
i loved his class! he is really interesting and the class isn't too hard as long as you do the work and go to class. (and he is pretty cute too),1
"He is laid back and brilliant. He truly cares and is more than fair with grading. If you need help, he's maybe the most accessible prof in Cox. Put in the work and you will do well. His lectures are enjoyable and low stress.",1
"Super insightful lectures! If you're interested in ASA at all, this class is extremely thought-provoking! There is definitely a good amount of readings & analysis involved with the course, but I enjoyed it.",1
"Exams are very tough but his curve is awesome! Notes help you understand where formulas come from. However, for exams, make sure you write down the final form of the formulas in your cheat sheet. Knowing trig really helps especially for the first 2 exams. Overall, possible to do well if genuine effort is applied.",1
"Professor was very intelligent about her subject, however, her teaching style was not fit for such a small class. Also, textbook reading was not only a requirement, we would be required to read in depth and analyze information, almost always requiring a second or third read to answer quizzes correctly. Homework was also extremely difficult.",0
"Excellent cours et excellent prof sur le plan académique, un peu plus discutable sur le plan humain (dommage pour un prof de sciences humaines)",1
Li Liu is homework heavy and her class is incredibly boring. It does feel like a chore and attendance is mandatory for a good participation grade in the class. 10/10 would not recommend this class.,0
Her tests are open book. During lectures she reads straight off of her powerpoint slides. The class is pretty boring but it's easy. There will be group participation assignments but they're pretty easy. She also assigns a short presentation assignment at the end of the semester. If you don't show up to class she will give you a 50 for the day.,1
"Probably the best professor I have taken at UC Davis. Always on time, lectures are sometimes entertaining and often provides examples from her life which makes everything more understandable and funny. Respectable and cares a lot for his students. So-so readings, one paper, in class midterm, one article critique, and one take home final or project.",1
"I loved taking sociology with Mrs. Trent. She is funny, kind and a good professor. If you put in the work the class should be an easy A. Exams are the hardest part but there are plenty of other things that you can use to bring your grade up!",1
You'll never find another professor like this guy EVER!  In order to survive you need to enjoy it and work your ASS off.  Lower plants is extremely difficult but extremely rewarding.  Best part are the field trips.  Sample exam is the way to prepare.  Must take if your interested in Nature.  Knowing your 106 material helps with the phycology.,1
"This class was awesome. Very interesting. He did a take home final which was super easy and interesting. There were online quizzes where you could use lecture notes so read carefully. He gave a lot of in class assignments and extra credit. He's funny and all around an understanding, awesome guy. Make sure you go on the cruise though!",1
Wanted to like this class so badly but it was more about memorization than anything else. Grade based on 4 tests and 1 final. BB HW assignments were so tedious and frustrating- unlimited retakes on the HW. The class just got old fairly quickly into the sem,1
"She is awesome! Always there to help you even after the class is over. Her assignments/tests are easy. She is someone that you will form a close bond with and it will remain with you after the class is through. She has a no judgement zone and she sticks to it, so you can talk to her about anything.",1
"Prof. Gentille is amazing. Took her Child Life course, and she's terrific. The weekly modules are easy (usually readings and maybe a DB post), there are 2 major hw assignments, 2 tests, and a final. Likes short answer questions, but tests are short and easy. She's very knowledgeable and involved in Child Life, so, if you want the best, take her.",1
"PROF. Ball is an excellent professor, he always makes jokes an make sure you understand everything before moving on to the next topic. I highly recommend him for this course.",1
"She is great. You will learn a lot. Expect to write a lot as well. She will help you, just ask.",1
"Must attend classes, but lectures don't help much as he reads off a Powerpoint. Ignore him and read the textbook. Overall not a good teacher; he gets angry when you ask questions and his attempt to answer math- related questions only causes more confusion. Avoid if you can",0
"He was not very receptive to opinions other than his own. He regularly talked over students when they expressed differing opinions and would devote entire class times to attempting to convince the class to agree with his opinion. Given this was an ethics class, which is inherently controversial, this was not ideal. Easy, though.",1
super sweet and very easy-going. prepares you very well for the exams and tells you what will be on them. understands college students very well.,1
"Overall a good prof, interesting class but he gets VERY sidetrack.  Really nice guy & he wants to know & help his students.  Don't be fooled by his cool attitude, he is a tough marker and he does expect quality work.  Attend classes and don't leave essays until last minute and you'll do great!",1
"When you write compositions, make sure to have a clear intro, body, and conclusion. She likes transition words (D'abord, Ensuite, Puis etc.) The lectures were just going through the homework. It's important to show up though because she takes attendance and sometimes she'll give really good explanations of things outside of the manual. Go to class!",1
"Super great professor. He loves class discussions but you won't be penalized if you don't speak, though he may ask you a random question here and there. Take notes every class and he may grade them at the end of the semester. He is different for every class but we only had one midterm and one final with little homework. Super nice and very caring!!",1
"If I'd known of this site before registering & reviews, wouldn't have taken his class & have the regret. Only way to pass is if you tune everything out to hear him clearly since he mumbles & he could explain an essay prompt w/o you realizing it. Only assigns 400 word paper vs the 1,000 criteria. Learned nothing since he genuinely does not teach.",0
typical online class where all the answers are online. easy A. only graded on 4 total exams which youll get 100% on if you have internet access,1
I'm maybe not the biggest lover of math so math courses aren't my favorite thing but great teacher for this course for sure.,1
"Great professor, very understanding and will work with you! I went in to this class expecting to hate it but I ended up with a much deeper appreciation for soils and their importance. Has reading but doesn't expect you to do all of it. Says ""I hope there are more important things in your life than soil science."" :)",1
"Maria has been my favorite teacher so far at DMACC.  I took her online Humor in Lit class and it was phenomenal...a nice segue into actual schoolwork the following semester.  She assigns great books, sometimes even movies, and is up front if they will be dryboring.  Plus I didn't have to buy pricey textbooks, most titles were free online!",1
Professor Vannier is a great option. Gives lots of extra credit assignments and don't have to do much in class other than take notes. Does in class assignments to take attendance every so often. Very friendly and funny to listen to.,1
"Professor Epstein was a really fun professor, but the subject matter of LING 209 was limited and relatively uninteresting after a few weeks. That being said, this is a great intro to linguistics and I'm glad I took his class! Lots of readings and he always indicated exactly what would be on the exams.",1
"Professor Drake clearly knows what he is talking about and conveys most of his ideas clearly, I have a few complaints. He spends far too much time referencing things from other courses and works not pertaining to the course, it is easy to get confused if you haven't taken his other courses. He assigns more reading than every class I took combined.",1
"If you are narrow minded or lazy, this is not the class for you. With proper attention and effort, it is the best class anyone could take to become a more well rounded, politically correct, level headed person.",1
"Dr. Jones  was one of the best professors I had. She truly cares about her students, and wants you to succeed. But, she isn't an easy teacher. She really makes you work for the grades you receive. But, she lets you redo any assignments you want to. She's a very straightforward person. If you show up to class and do your work, you'll do great.",1
"She is one of the best instructors I've had! I highly recommend taking her class!! Her class is interesting and very educational, I learned so much about communication. She cares about students and always gives great feedback. We had small group conversations and then shared with the class, so we got pretty close with each other.",1
He's a great professor and I would definitely take the class again. He makes biology very interesting and he is very kind.,1
Lots of reading,1
"just 2 papers per semester. easy to write but long, i wrote between 20 and 25 pages and got an A. takes attendance. don't buy the textbook!!! easy A if you write the 2 papers and show up to class",1
Maria is an amazing instructor! She is very knowledgeable on the subject and has some great life experiences that she will sometimes bring into the lecture. She explains well and is very clear when it comes to her expectations for the exams and projects. I wish I had another class with her!,1
She's straightforward and smart.,1
"Selgrad is a fantastic lecturer. He makes all of his course material very interesting with fun anecdotes and jokes. However, he is generally a pretty disorganized guy. He's not good with responding to emails quickly and his slides are riddled with errors. Overall, I would recommend him if you keep those things in mind.",1
If you have the chance to take him as a teacher I would avoid him. He makes makes things WAY harder than they should be. He gives plenty of worksheets and practice problems to prepare us for tests and then makes the tests unnecessarily hard. Elementary Math should not be a hard topic to teach but he makes it more complicated than it should be.,0
"I FREAKIN LOVED FRAU ADAM. Very organised, prompt on returning assignments, clear handouts, quick on answering emails - an amazing, caring person as a whole. Her personality was sassy and outgoing and it was the only reason I never skipped our 8 AM class. She's also from Austria so it was really interesting to get her cultural aspect as well!",1
"Dr. Curzon had AMAZING lectures! They were so fun and informative, and as long as you pay attention, the tests are super easy. She also lets you drop your lowest test grade. Her class isn't a ""give me"", but if you pay attention to her lectures and at least skim the readings, the tests and quizzes aren't a problem.",1
"I haven't been to school in almost 20 years, and I was able to understand what he was teaching.  Enter as an adult, ready to learn and he is willing to help, I'm sorry he won't be here to teach Math 96.  Its true he does require a lot to pass, yet its broken down and he's always willing to help.",1
"Tough teacher, but cares about the subject and students. On one hand, he doesn't give A's often, lectures for long periods of time, and sometimes wings class meetings. On the other hand, he will work will anyone struggling and make sure they understand what is expected of them. You will actually leave his classes with new knowledge and skills.",1
"Skelly is an amazing (and absolutely insane) professor. If you're looking to do something in the Telecom industry, she is definitely someone you should get to know. As far as T206 goes, the class is relatively easy. There were like three tests the entire year, and most were open notes. Just don't procrastinate on the final project- it takes FOREVER",1
"This was the most challenging online class I've ever taken! Notes- don't have much info Tests- Not easy to understand (75 Qs, 15 Point), most of the time the notes didn't even have the answer Exercises- long and really confusing (3-5 pgs, 1 point) Discussion Qs- 5-6 Qs asked, you answer 2, long and time consuming! 1 point Save yourself #Honest",0
"Grade is based on online work, a group project, online open notes exams, and showing up to class. Very easy class as long as you dont fall behind. Very chill and understanding teacher.",1
Dr. Nikkel is an excellent teacher. He responds quickly if you send him an email and are unsure of something. Watch his videos several times because they are helpful when doing the homework assignments. He is fair in his grading and will leave feedback. This class is a challenge but you will learn so much. Give him a try!,1
"took her for bio lab, she is the nicest TA youll ever meet. shes lenient, nice, and actually gets back to your emails fast. would definitely take her again and would definitely recommend",1
"Fairly simple material, but goes over it well. I see a lot of the reviews says he ""penalizes students for groupmates' mistakes"" - he gives group projects, but you have the opportunity to review what your groupmates do just like any other group project. He is accessible via email. Nice guy, can go on tangents that at times are ""out there""",1
"He had some pretty cheesy math jokes.  Also, he liked to explain the history of what we were learning.  However, that was all he explained.  He didn't explain anything that he did which was hard for someone who hadn't taken a Calc class before.  Also, his weekly quizzes were different from what we did homework on and studied in class.",0
Best teacher I've had so far. He makes everything easier to understand. Definitely recommend.,1
Very interesting course. The course material provides a great scope of Earth science. Recommend it to all students interested in the natural wonders and processes of Earth. Great prof!,1
"Dr. Kelley is an amazing professor and I thoroughly enjoyed this course. I appreciate that she took the time in every lecture to make things clear and interesting. By far one of my favorite courses I've taken. Also, she is so understanding and compassionate.",1
"Great Teacher! Ton of group work but still got a lot of this class. Take him, he makes class enjoyable.",1
"Sometimes difficult to understand.  He also talks very fast during lectures.  However, he is helpful and very knowledgeable.",1
"Pros- She gives great feedback.  If you've hit a roadblock, she's there for help. The final is extra credit worth 50 points. Cons- Get ready to basically live in the writing center if you aren't a strong writer, and if you're looking to get a good grade in her class. Can be a little confusing at times. Very strict grader.   ",0
Leftists will love him. He only sees his side of things and grades accordingly. Will never take his classes again.,0
He is the best teacher ever!!! Very helpful and his exams are easy. You get a study guide and if you learn you should get an easy A! TAKE HIM!!!,1
"Dr. Tour is an extremely good teacher.  However he expects you to learn your material.  He will often throw questions on the test that require a person to apply their knowledge, rather than regurgitate it.",1
"What he was looking for in a paper is never immediately clear. I would turn in three essay drafts (2 more than required) trying to get them to his liking and he was never satisfied with them. The class structure was unorganized, but he says some pretty entertaining things. Would not recommend this class if you can take another elective.",1
"She is great, makes you work for your grade-but all worth it. There are mostly improvs with direct instruction, 1 monologue and a paper about yourself. The class is worth the while, fun, and laidback. This is the only class thus far that I really enjoyed at Stony Brook. Take It!!",1
He's new at teaching and is still learning which means he's awful at the moment. His study guides have typos and his answers aren't even right. He takes away points if you want to check your online connect homework to see if its correct. His classes are slow and he often goes on tangents about Greek philosophy.,0
"I really enjoyed Prof. Ferns' course. She encouraged me to understand in, which area's I could improve my work. She is a very efficient and fast grader. She replies emails promptly. Her class was very interesting, interactive with real life issues and I learned a lot. Prof Ferns expects her students to put in the work, if you do it pays off.",1
I had him his first semester he taught undergrad when he was really hard. I hear he's gotten better since then though.,1
"Don't take unless you want to learn from the book and YouTube. Lectures are barely helpful, overcomplicates the simple things and rushes through the hard parts.",0
"He's a great professor that keeps the class engaged, does not give too much homework and is a fair grader.",1
"Tests are a few long answer questions, but VERY broad. She expects you to be an absolute expert in the subject matter, even though her notes are useless. The question may seem straightforward but it's not. In lecture she normally just rants about her experiences with plants and how amazing plants are to her. Go to the review sessions! Good luck lol",0
"GREAT CLASS! Professor Allen made Ecology VERY interesting because he related the class with things occurring locally. He's kind of nerdy. The class had some homework which was very easy to complete. One presentation which, if you practice your presentation, is easy. He made class fun by bringing in plants and insects for us. GREAT CLASS!",1
She swears.  It's great.,1
As easy as it gets. S=how mild interest and he'll be thrilled. Never ontime. You won't learn much.,1
"Professor Day is a fine professor. 241 I thought was a relatively easy course, with him dropping one of the three exams in the semester. His lectures aren't always on topic, and the ZyBook textbook is a good resource. As long as you show up to the lecture and labs you will be fine.",1
"Loved this class. It is very heavy on reading and writing which was a lot, but he is a very fair grader and super enthusiastic about the course. He gives tons of feedback on your writing to help you improve. He also only speaks French which is super helpful and helps you improve pronunciation too.",1
Average professor and average class. Do the homework and you will be fine for 111.,1
Great professor all around. She makes the class easy but you do have to do the assignments which aren't too hard. There are incentives for attendance at the end of the semester so some to lecture on time.,1
"Awesome teacher! you get out early, and is extremely helpful if you have any questions.",1
"Dr. SASS was amazing! I hate political science but she made the topic very interesting.  There are no tests, but you have oral quizzes.  They are very simple as long as you take notes.  Make sure you read the chapters that are assign for the week, because she always asks questions from the book.  You also need to keep up with current events!",1
"His tests were almost impossible unless you reallllly understand Physics.  If you made a 7.5/15 on the test, you had a A.  The stuff on the tests isn't covered in class.  I would recommend taking someone else!  He is very smart however...too smart to teach a general physics class.  Has awards in nuclear physics, etc.",1
"At first, Dr. Fontenot came off as very rude and unapproachable, but once you get to know him he's very helpful and is willing to work with you. As long as you pay attention in class and do the things he tells you to do you will get an A. Have to be a good writer. Very few grades given.",1
"You pretty much have to do the readings, and if you do the work, you can definitely make a high A.  It helps for 111 if you've taken AP- Bio.  He's witty, interested and interesting.",1
Great teacher! ,1
Course is set up so you basically can't fail because 45% of your mark is weekly quizzes. She basically reads word for word off the slides and it's very hard to stay engaged during her lectures. It also doesn't help that you already learn the majority of what she teaches in SOCI2445. If you do your readings you don't even need to go to class.,1
He is not very nice very insulting and makes rude comments,0
"Excellent professor! She understand our situations that English (poems, literature ...) is hard with us.  She asks you to do a lot but she never hurts you by low grades.  DON'T LOSE your chance to attend her class.  Most people are always happy with her class.",1
"Patrick is an easy-going guy, extremely lenient too. I had him last semester for a night class and he always let the class out early. He's really sweet and exams are easy-peasy. If you want the easiest 3 credit class, take CS 101 with him :)",1
I have nothing negative to say about Mr. Butman. I tried the class out and did not comprehend with his way of teaching. So now i am retaking Eng. 28 with a differ Professor (SANGHA) and it is a dramatic change. I am learning the concept that needs to be met for this english class.,0
Dr. Squire's Hardware Course is pretty simple and straight forward. He does everything he can to help you pass the course.,1
"If you submit your work, she will give you full point for the class work and the home work. You'll get an A, if you do your work and read the book.",1
Dr. Z is nice. She respects students and always answers questions. I was in her lecture and lab sections and had a good experience.,1
"Tough but fair. Interesting, knows her stuff. Pay attention & put in effort, & you'll be fine. Quizzes/tests mostly short answer/essay. All PowerPoint lectures, but not on BB, so take good notes. Only homework: textbook/outside readings, all relevant & on quizzes/tests. 3 papers/projects: easy, due at end of semester. Recommend her class for GenEd.",1
Class was very boring; all we did was go over the grammar concepts we already learned for homework the night before. Everything I learned was from reading the textbook. Lots of homework but it helps your grade. It was his first year here I'm sure he will get better! He is very clear about what to expect for the tests and the class is pretty easy.,1
"Took the class online and thought it was easy to pass. You upload your speeches online. Weekly tests, discussion postings and written assignments - none are too tough. If you do the work it's a no brainer.",1
He never tells you what he wants bc he doesnt want to stifle your creativity then takes off points for stuff that wouldve been clear if he gave rubrics. feedback sucks and gets annoyed when you try to talk to him/clarify things. His lectures are cool and so is he but he rambles and is unhelpful. he doesnt realize that hes condescending ALL THE TIME,0
"Great professor and you think the class will be easy, but you HAVE to study. His tests are very very intense and you have to study the study guide and have it practically memorized to get an A on the exams. I took him for human sexuality and I learned so many things for the real world. Very smart man and writes his own textbooks. You need the books",1
"EOSC 310 used to be an easy science requirement course, but not any more. Now you have to use a poorly written, unclear book with difficult, confusing weekly quizzes. Longridge was not helpful in answering questions or clarifying anything.",0
You will not learn anything. Have to memorize a lot. Get an Iphone thats what most of the class did? I didnt do that otherwise I would also get a descent grade. You will cry and memories of class will not go away. You will regret but have no option. EE dept doesnt care about us they onlycare bout money. You be ready to kill your GPA.,0
One of the best profs at PSU hands down.  Fair clear engaging.  You will learn and love it while you do.  It will change you as a student for the better.,1
Great class,1
Dreaded this class everyday that i had it. Couldn't wait to be done. This teacher takes alot of pleasure out of insulting kids on thier work and pointing out thier mistakes. He emails you late at night and gives you 50 pages of crap to read for a quiz the next day. Dont think he's an awful guy but dont take this if not serious about graphic design,0
If you do all the discussion posts and actually try you will do just fine in this class literally. Lisa is great and makes everything really clear with grades and deadlines. She keeps up with grading and posting new assignments.,1
"Mr. Edward Warr  is a great professor! He is the best teacher I ever had in my life. He makes his class easy to learn and interesting. You learn a lot of helpful information and a lot about biology. Anything you need help with, he is willing to teach and explains very well. Awesome teacher, friendly and very helpfull. I would highly recommend him.",1
Dr. Hemmings' section was right at the end of an already dense course and her section contained more specifics than any of us really anticipated. It also did not help that she never gave us practice questions. You have to work REALLLLY hard for her section - memorize even the diagrams on the slides. She is very detail-oriented. I had a tough time.,1
Erickson might be the best bio professor I've had. His lectures make a lot of sense and I actually feel like I understand the core concepts of molecular biology now. The material is hard but the final is easy and you should easily do well if you study. Make sure you take advantage of his lectures and actually learn the stuff. Great professor!,1
"ECE 241 is an intro class for Computer Engineering.  Meaning that nobody knows anything about computers in general.  From the first day, Dwight spoke to us as if we already knew everything we needed to know about Computer Engineering.  That put us in mass confusion.  Not to mention that the labs took three weeks to grade.",0
"Dr. Kosnik is a great professor. The class is pretty easy and he is always willing to help. If you go to class and take notes you will get an A. The tests are relatively easy, if you study. Overall, he is a good professor and the class is interesting",1
"Mostly discussions followed by a quiz, per week.  Not very involved with the class, dishes out assignments with no specific lecture/power points.  Just A LOT of reading. Not very involved with the class.  Final was difficult, did not even provide a prep sheet or study guide and most of the questions were not part of earlier quizzes.  Not great.",0
Easy to talk to. If you like to question things and have your mind mess with then his class is for you. He challenges me with questions after I ask him questions. Don't have to go to class if you are sick or he will kick you out.,1
"If you actually want to enjoy class, take Mr. Martin. I absolutely love him. He's the best teacher I have ever had. He's nice, caring, helpful, sweet, and funny. He's a great teacher to have. He makes the class fun and easy. TAKE HIM! You won't regret it.",1
Class is meant for students with disabilities so it goes a bit slow. It helped me decide what I wanted from school.  I learned study skills I did not know before. There are some fun excercizes. Do the workbook! He uses the workbook a lot!,1
"The lectures are easy to sit through and content isnt hard. youre graded off of only 4 tests, 40 questions a piece. 12 of the questions are about a clip of music. He doesnt talk enough about content thats actually going to be on the exams and its up to you to study",1
"I enjoyed this class a lot more than I thought would. Mr. Lulejian was very engaged in the discussion posts and always made sure to answer all students. Very prompt and in-depth feedback on assignments. Lots of reading involved and the tests are heavily weighted but as long as you keep up with the readings and discussions, you will do fine.",1
"Denise Preston is a really nice and caring person. She kinda goes over the basics in class that I knew in high school and builds upon them. If you thought you were a good writer, think again. Denise Preston will take the time to look at your paper and give good feedback on how to revive it.",1
"I would not recommend this teacher to anyone looking to fulfill the credit that this class gives. She takes a long time to respond to emails and requires attendance. She also uses the entire class time  each class session. If you take her, you will never be dismissed early.",0
Professor Logue was amazing!:) I learned so much with her and her grading and expectations were very clear from the start. I have had her for Spanish One and can not wait to be able to take Spanish Two with her!:),1
She is such a good professor if you must take this course with this professor go for it we did not use a book for the class.no final no midterm which was awesome!we only had to do group work a lot of assignment but hey what professor doesn't give a lot of them.once again i strongly recommend. class work is very clear yet challenging but doable.,1
"She was assigned to my lab portion of Biology class. She never interacted with us outside of a welcome message. The labs are all online and are ""do-it-yourself"" point and click in style, then a quiz on each lab set. If you aren't a science person, the labs are kind of boring because they aren't hands-on. But, it fulfilled my lab requirement.",1
I really loved her class. She was friendly and helpful. ,1
"she is the sweetest lady ever!! she just makes me smile b/c she's so sweet. her class was so easy, her test were too. as long as you pay attention to her lecture your good...even if you dont, alot of her questions are common sense. the papers were super easy. I recommended her to my friends and they love her!!",1
She was very helpful with homework and quizzes. Helps you work the problems you missed for 5 percentage points.,1
"He is nice, but I wouldnt take OChem at OC again. He doesnt know his stuff enough to answer questions at all.",0
Dr. Ba is hands-down the BEST professor I EVEVR had!,1
"She was the best professor I ever had! Very caring, gives lots of feedback and tests are very straightforward. If you have a chance to take her, Do it!!!",1
You will pretty much have to teach this course to yourself. He only goes over the examples from the textbook in class and is unclear. Nice guy but horrible lecturer.,0
"At the beginning of the class she told us she didn't like the new curriculum. We wrote on one topic the whole time and if she took the opposing view point, she would make it known that she didn't agree with you. She grades based on her own thoughts and she isn't very clear on what she is looking for in the papers.",0
Takes attendance every class. Easiest class I have ever taken. He truly does care about his students. The only assignments you'll ever have are a midterm and a final which are both take home essays which he assigns the first day of class. He is all lecture but he tries to engage the class and realizes that some stuff is boring. Really amazing.,1
Dr. Braun has to be one of my favorite professors! She tries to make the classes fun and informative with lots of discussion so it's not just her talking. She grades easy and truly just wants to see you succeed. I definitely recommend her!,1
"An exceptional teacher. I took her immunology course as a nonmatriculated student updating coursework for a second career. She inspired me and I have built upon what she taught; the stuff I learned from her proved truly foundational. I'm a veterinarian now. Among the undergrad profs who inspired me the most, she ranks among the very few at the top.",1
"Amazing professor, good course where he gives a lot of personal stories in his life of business",1
"boring class, but easy grades. very repetitive and i really didn't learn anything new at all. good professor, just boring teaching style.",1
"Mr. Perez was by far one of the best professors I have had at riddle. No matter the size of the problem I had he always responded to his emails fast with an answer that actually solved my problem. At the end of my online class, we had a group project where I worked alone. Mr. Perez worked with me to help with the lack of team effort.",1
He is very awkward but knows what he is talking about. He just goes over the notes and we do group work about once a week along with webassign. Be prepared to live in the MLSC if you take Trig at OSU.,1
"This class should be called the History of Ethnicity and Race not an Intro class. Basically talks about how horrible white people were and all the horrible things they did. Does let you bring in a notecard for the test but the test question is so broad that you don't have a chance to answer it in a short amount of time. Big book, lots of reading.",1
"Dr. Klatzke is amazing!  Very well organized online class.  Weekly reading assignment with discussion post/response, and lecture.  One paper, 4 quizzes.  She's very helpful and quick to respond.  Do the work and you'll well.",1
I was in a class of 20 people and only 8 showed up everyday. I missed some classes but completed all of my work and when I went to turn it in she told me to just not finish out the class and stop coming. She refused to pass me even though I did all of the work! She is too tough of a grader and you never know what she wants from you.,0
"Tough when she sees potential, and one of the best professors I have worked with.",1
"An absolute delight; poised, extremely knowledgeable, and has a good sense of 'intellectual' humor. Brilliant while remaining down to earth; took massive amount of information and made it digestable and incredibly fascinating. Grades fairly while motivating us to do our best. Inviting and interesting in office hours. Will return to Berk Fall 12. A.",1
"Honestly, if you procastinate I recommend you not take this class because he is a tough grader! He doesn't care for excuses he will give you the grade he thinks you deserve. If you show up everyday, pay attention, and take very good notes then you'll most likely pass but very few people pass",0
"Ning is awesome!  He definitely has an accent, but is easy to understand if you listen.  He is really funny and cares about each of his students and the class as a whole.  His test are multiple choice, and he does in class assignments rather than assigned homework, which is awesome.  Attendance is a must!",1
"This Class Is Tough! But Scanlon is a great teacher. Will help you with whatever you need. I came into 1105 with a very small back round, and Scanlon was glad to help me with what I didn't understand one on one.  I love the Outcome system, but I do understand why some don't.",1
"I loved this class and this professor is so sweet! The actual nicest guy ever, always is down to help others when needed. Due to covid, the class was asynchronous, so if you do decide to take this class make sure you watch the lectures and listen to the music he gives in order to do well on the tests! Highly recommend taking this class!!!!",1
"This dude makes up every single on of his test/quiz answers FROM SCRATCH so nothing can be found on chegg or quizlet or anything, this really pissed me off initially cuz what a little nerd. Other than that he's actually a nice guy and his class is designed for you to succeed if you do the work.",1
"If you can get past the language barrier, this guy is great for DE.   His tests come straight from homework, he grades incredibly easy, and you can bring ""cheat sheets"" with you to the test.   Plus, he's a pretty cool guy.  Highly recommended.",1
"This class was definitely hard, but you have to know how to take notes according to his powerpoints. He is a tough grader for the tests, but ultimately it helps your writing. USE HIS OFFICE HOURS! He's very helpful. Overall, I loved having him as a professor!",1
"Dr. Kosnik is amaXing!<3 His class is very enjoyable and you can tell he really enjoys what he does. He is also really sweet and helpful. Seriously take this class with him! Oh and you will LOVE his ""Kosnik's Surprise"" towards the end of the semester!  OH BUY THE TEXTBOOK WITH tHE CDs!",1
"long and boring classes but easy. if i took his class again i would not buy the book, just use his notes he hands out for you.",1
Professor Marlowe is Amazing! Three tests and one 8-10 page research paper. She grades papers really easy but is strict on grading when it comes to her tests. Be sure to do the study guide and you can get the easy A. Professor Marlowe is the best professor in the history department. Take her !!,1
She is very unorganized. Doesn't give clear instructions on what she expects to be turned in.  You must teach yourself. Exams are almost never similar to the study guides. At first seems nice but it all changes. Class goes from being full to only 17 people by the end. If I knew she was this bad I would of never taken her class. ,0
I missed class due to medical issues and had the papers she did not want to help me catch up and asked me to withdraw so i wouldn't fail,0
"Great professor, take her! The only reason I didn't get an A was because of procrastination and my lack to study for the final exam. Lectures may get a bit boring but it's because she tries her best to cover everything and helps students as much as she can. The pandemic didn't stop her lecturing so greatly unlike other professors.",1
"I've taken Professor Richmond before and wasn't a huge fan, but I think this semester changed my mind. She's very supportive and is always willing to help if a student is having issues. I wish we had delved more into the material, but I understand that this semester wasn't conducive to that. Would recommend.",1
"Hands-down the worst professor I have ever had. He rambles every class, never following the syllabus. He is a really tough grader and is unwilling to discuss his grading techniques/reasons for giving you the grade he gives. If attendance wasnt absolutely mandatory I would never go because he is very disrespectful and talks down to students.",0
"Professor Guttmann is very knowledgeable, he will ask you to understand and explain all the materials to him. The lecture is amazing, you will learn a lot. Take him! The exam is a little bit hard and homework will ask you to write a lot (discussion board), but if you write more than he expects, you will get extra credit (will boost from B to A-).",1
He is a very good professor give pop quizzes almost every class but tells you what chapter to study. If you dont like to read this class is not for you though textbook is a must and give extra credit if you go see the taping of democracy now it was a good experience.,1
She was awesome,1
He was a really great teacher! The pandemic took a toll on our class but he worked with us! When we did have face to face class he let us use the study guide on our tests and he worked with us if the majority of the class felt the topic was difficult!,1
-Grammar checks contradicted each other throughout the drafts of an essay. -Directions are mostly unclear and vague. -Talks more about her other jobs than finishing a chapter lecture. -Exams are not based on power-point lectures but unnecessary information from the textbook.,0
Really good lectures and gave good detailed feedback IF YOU ASK. Only two papers for the whole class. You miss a lot if you don't show up.,1
"I had the lab with this guy and it was a dope class. I highly recommend him. No homework, in class work is somewhat challenging but he allows group work and is very helpful with explaining things. It was a 3 hour class and we were often out after an hour. Good class overall.",1
"This class was a huge waste of time, the class was 2hrs and 45 mins and for at least half of each class Bert would just ramble and try to make jokes. He was never prepared for class and would usually freelance his classes, and he also didn't explain how to use the programs and expected us to know what we were doing.",0
"This guy has traveled the world and knows his stuff. He brings the topics to life with clear explanations, photos, and personal experiences. Like any other class, if you do the work, you will do well.",1
This class is one of the WORST classes i have ever been in. He is so monotone and boring and he jumps from place to place when hes talking so im not sure what exactly im suppose to know. He also seems to have an attitude when your coming in and out of class rolling his eyes. I would NOT take this class again if i ever had too!,0
"Easy. Slow Paced. You can show up and do nothing, Take the review sheet for test and study it, and then get A/B's on tests and coast.",1
I enjoyed taking this course. There were 3 papers but he graded fairly and gave positive feedback to help you.,1
Señor Newall cares about his students and this class shouldn't be hard if you're decent at Spanish and keep up with the readings and homework that every SPAN 210 class gets. He gives good lectures to supplement the homework and leaves a lot of his class for practicing grammar and conversation. Would take again.,1
Took his online class and he was incredibly invasive with Lockdown browser for all test and exams. Lots of tests and two final exams. VERY heavy on lecture and horrible youtube version to watch his lecture. I would never take his class ever again. And during Zoom reviews he cuts off individuals when they try to talk as well as speaks over any input,0
she may be a brilliant playwright but she is far from a brilliant teacher.,0
"Professor Wood is a great person, will do whatever necessary to make sure you do well. However, this was NOT an easy A. I really worked hard in this class and still only ended up with a B+. I took her for sociology of gender and it was a great class even with all the writing and reading assignments",1
"This class was way more difficult than it needed to be. The quizzes were 10% each and had over 50 vocab words and 10 listening examples to memorize for 20 Q's. Reading ""requirments"" came from an $85 online textbook that students hardly used. Lectures were material heavy and dry and slides were not posted after or before lecture if you missed class",0
Genuinely caring professor- the best :),1
"Ok class, lots of busy work each week, but not hard. No textbook used. 2 papers and 2 tests. Not hard if you show up and do the homework. Papers will take lots of time.",1
"Professor Flores is one of the best on campus. I would recommend going as often as possible because she talks about stuff that is not on the slides. The worst part about her class is that her Smartsite is SO UNORGANIZED! It's hard to figure out what lecture is what. Easy class, interesting material, a lot of small assignments. Overall, easy class!",1
"Be careful when taking her online class. She is very hard to understand and has a tendency of making the material more difficult than it is. She has also sent out numerous emails threatening students that if there are power outages during testing they will fail the test, no exception. Totally unprofessional and harrasing!",0
"Susan is all over the place in her lectures both in class and online (has in class lectures with her previously). She answers questions very broadly and confusingly, she just wants people to laugh at her jokes and be her friend. It is hard to communicate with her during online classes, she is very selective when replying to emails.",0
He went off onto so many tangents that seemed irrelevant to the pieces we had to read. None of the class got to have an input because he was the one always talking. He also was so disorganized and didnt seem like he knew what he was doing. We had a midterm and final.,0
"She is a great professor with a lot of knowledge, but GET READY TO WORK. Requires 2 discussion board posts a week and has weekly homework assignments and quizzes. I spent about 5 hours on each assignment. Her tests are HARD, make sure you know the material 100%. She takes a long time to grade and respond to emails. I would take her again though.",1
"I'm normally not the type to be negative. I'm a hard working student and do my best. This wasn't an English class, more like Political. All our papers were on politics. She would spend endless time ""sharing"" her opinion. She gave me and another a C when he didn't even finish the paper and I only had 2 errors in five pages. I do not suggest. Awful.",0
"Alex is one of the best professors I've had since being at the university! The material is difficult, but he explains concepts well and responds quickly to e-mails. Not to mention that the difficulty is mediated with test corrections and extra credit opportunities. He made the class interesting and he really seems to know the material!",1
"Butman is a very tough grader however, is very easy once you get the hang of the essays. Learn from mistakes !!!! First 2 essays were an F and a D. He explained mistakes not to make and once corrected i became a B student. Point is, don't let his attitude make you drop he actually does care about his students in his own way",1
"Professor Rogers was one of my favorite professors! He takes the time to make sure students understand, and after class takes a little time to go over assignments due. He was understanding, helpful, and is an effective teacher. There is a big research paper due at the end of the semester but you turn in sections throughout the semester.",1
"Online class, she did a horrible job at teaching the material and when asked for guidance she tells students try not to overthink it or read the book again instead of helping you understand. DO NOT TAKE HER. She also made us write a 10-12 page paper and it ended up being only a completion grade.",0
Il est un bon enseignant et répond aux questions. Son cours est très facile à passer depuis que tu lis les romans et fais les travaux.,1
Be prepared to have Lab and bookwork ready by test date. She does give twothree chapters in one day. Does not review before test. You have to download labwork grades or email but if emailed sometimes you get a zero. ,0
"if you dont like sarcastic dry humor then he is not the teacher for you. i had him for lab and his practicals areVERY straight forward. if you study, you will do well. if you dont study, you wont do well. simple as that",1
Too much material for him to teach. I've never heard anyone say anything good about him. Very arrogant and impressed with himself. I am a little confused why he teaches this class since he mentioned he had a degree in engineering. He forgets about the PP behind him that goes along with his lecture and clicks through it at the very end. Avoid.,0
Great all-around professor. Homework is pretty usual and consistent and tests are pretty basic. Very helpful.,1
"Very hard class. I am a non history major and found this class very difficult, I read all the books he assigned, but had a hard time doing well on his test and quizzes.  The class is interesting, but not worth the low grade that is to be expected.",1
Lots of reading and basically all lectures. New teacher so he has been rough edges but honestly cares if you put in the work and show him you want to do well.,1
Great Proffesor!! She is really caring and really fun. Her work was always very good explained and quite simple. She is always willing to help. I would definitely take her again.,1
"Professor Castano goes on tangents a lot about Spanish countries and her background. The online homework matters a lot, don't goof off/ talk back in class she doesn't respond well to it. If you participate and communicate with her you will be fine.",1
Don't bother to take the online class.  You will receive little to no specific or constructive feedback on assignments.  You will do tons of useless busy work.  She will have you write rough drafts that she will not bother to grade or provide feedback on before the final draft of the paper is due. She is one of the worst teachers I have ever had.,0
"They made all the FIGs sound really interesting and geared toward freshmen, so I decided to take his class. Big mistake. Nothing he talks about in class is on the test. And the tests are ridiculous. Unless you have a pretty good grasp on politics and your own views in general, i would not take his class. Lots o' rambling.",0
"By far one of the best profs I've had. MUST GO TO LECTURE. Everything that he goes through in his lecture is important and it will show up on tests. The lab portion is like a free 15% so make sure to go to lab and work hard on your poster. His slides are mostly pictures and few words, make sure to write down what he says. no textbook ",1
Amazing teacher,1
"8 weeks are usually loaded with tons of work but this one is pretty easy. 4 essays, no midterm or final. Lectures are boring but make it enjoyable for 3hrs. I would highly recommend taking her if you want an easy class in English.",1
I never take the time do write reviews on professors but for professor Peruyer i just had to! Professor Peruyera is the BEST professor MDC can offer. He knows what he's talking about. All of his lectures are given with plenty of examples. Very caring. Defiantly taking Buisness law 2 with him.,1
"Dr. Prasad is one of the smartest and the most hilarious professors in the university. She makes the lab interesting by giving mnemonics and sometimes funny names to better remember the structures. Some people who say she is hard, we need to understand its Biology class, of course no one will get easy A without studying. Thank you Dr. Prasad",1
"I took this class in preparation for my CGBP exams. Introduction to Exports is naturally a tough class, so i was happy to make a B.  Professor Chii is a nice lady, she really did her best to help.",1
"He is one of the best professor I have ever seen in my life if you want to get a good knowledge about history and of course, if you want to pass I will definitely recommend gis class he is the best !!!!!!",1
"Awesome guy! Made the lab fun and was always willing to help out! Even though it was at 8am, he still engaged us through the whole class.",1
"One of the best professors I have ever had. Extremely intelligent, very nice, and a fair grader. A lot of readings but she simplifies them in class. Very approachable outside of class, and you learn a whole lot. She is the absolute best.",1
"If you take this class just know you will need to read and watch a couple of films. You will have to do homework twice a week based on the readings and the films. However, he only gives you 2 exam (midterm and final) and one short paper. If you have any questions you can e-mail Professor Pfeifer and he will respond right away. Easy A if you read.",1
Learned more than i could have imagined and i have been playing for years,1
"He is an AWESOME PROFESSOR!!! Smart and charismatic, full of quotes and a seemingly never-ending supply of stories and first-hand experience. I am so happy I took his class. He is sweet and nice and I look forward to going to his class every time it meets. Favorite class I have taken thus far!!!",1
My boyfriend and I took her class and loved it. She was recommended by a lot of past students. If you study and come to class it's pretty chill. She stays after to help you with anything. Mrs. Garrisi is a cool prof.,1
"I have ms. smith for anatomy and physiology I this semester. the material is very challenging (not difficult to understand, purely memorization), but she tries her best to give you little tips to help you remember the info and study tips. her tests are hard, but not impossible. i like her style, she has many extra assignments to collect points.",1
She was super helpful always and really cared that we learned. Really only had two big group projects and that's it.,1
"This guy is really genuine, helpful and easy to talk to. Any question you have, you email him and he literally gets back to you within half an hour with clear, helpful and usefull answers. Would really recommend taking him either for interest in Social Media, an elective or just for credit! A lot of material, but its all very short.",1
"Austin is one of the best profs I've ever had...he's incredibly intelligent but makes the material easy to understand.  The midterm was a bit freaky, but he was really fair in marking it.  He's awesome!",1
"I love Ms Magallons way of teaching. She is a very hardworking talented and dedicated teacher. She listens to the students problems and if you need help in assignments, please make appointments. She makes everything clear but if students have difficulty she asks for appointments. She makes students to study and work hard and think critically.",1
"This is one teacher who makes it really hard for you to fail. You would literally have to skip every single lab and lecture. If you try, you will pass. I ended the class with almost 120% and didn't even have to take the final.",1
"This class is very informative and easy. Just complete the two projects that she gives and you'll be one step ahead of getting an easy A. Professor Persampieri gives great feedback on your assignments, she's very elaborate when it comes to her powerpoints/lectures. Extra credit is also given after the midterm, and for the final project.",1
DO NOT TAKE. There are 2 quizzes every class on the reading which was homework and the lecture he gave to make sure you were paying attention. Both quizzes and all of the exams are online tho with is a plus. I had a C all semester but the class did so bad he had to scale everyones grades at the end so I finished with an A.,0
I have been out of high school for 20 years and Math was my worst subject. Dr. Ande explained everything in good detail and would not move on til everyone was able to understand the math. She is an awesome instructor. Open to questions or concerns about grades and homework.,1
"Dry sense of humor, but the good kind. Makes it possible to get that A, but only if you deserve it. Put in the effort for this class and you should be fine. She provides you readings and has a question or two about them on her exams. Study guides are provided so use them. Loves what she does and it is pretty obvious. Overall great lecturer. ",1
"He was fun, entertaining, and kept the class interested. He was also incredibly helpful to those who struggled. He even took the entire class out to dinner for study time, in preparation to the final exam. That was the best, because everyone felt at ease to ask questions. He is a great teacher.",1
he is the nicest sweetest man ever in RCOE. The class is super fun and informative. I can't picture anyone else to teach this class. if you are conservative you might not like the class but people should get out of their comfort zones. would take his class a billion times.,1
"AVOID THIS MAN AT ALL COSTS. He is the meanest, most arrogant professor I've ever had. He is not approachable. When you do talk to him, you will walk away feeling like the dumbest person alive. He is incredibly condescending and rude. His criticism is often unnecessarily CRUEL and unhelpful. He should be teaching grad students, NOT undergraduates.",0
A top-notch professor! She was completely knowledgeable in the field and the clicker tool sharpened my listening skills beyond belief (and was fun too!)! I was totally interested and NEVER bored in this class! DO NOT believe any negative comments posted about her. Her teaching style is untouchable! Only regret: she only teaches one class at RIC!,1
Professor Liao is really good at teaching. He explains different techniques and gives recommendations. His homework is online but he gives you plenty of time to finish it.. It sometimes can be difficult to understand him but overall great professor!,1
"Reading, a discussion post, and 1-2 assignments and quizzes per week. Everything is pretty simple and Prof. Lirenso is very understanding of people's situations. I took this class along with a heavy course load, but he provides notes and a good study guide for the final which made studying easier and I passed with an A. I recommend him for GEO 001.",1
Chemistry isn't easy. Professor Heske is really nice & VERY helpful! He will bend over backwards to help you understand chemisty. He is very approachable & has great office hours. I had a hard time with some of the material but he was always willing to help. Take him if you really want to learn chemistry and want a teacher that will faciliate that.,1
"I don't know if it's Covid or what, but this semester has been a disaster. She doesn't return emails or check in with students for WEEKS. The quizzes are filled with mistakes that she refuses to fix and sent a defensive email when she received feedback about it. Classes are poorly organized. I got more out of my interactions with peers than her.",0
"Dr. Jones is the best professor I've had. There is a lot of work, but it all goes into the final paper for the class. If you chose a topic that you're truly passionate about, the class is very enjoyable and something to look forward to. She lets you revise assignments within a week. intimidating but really cares about her students. Would recommend",1
"Doc is awesome.  Very laid back though can be a little absent minded sometimes...who isn't?  Las Vegas quizzes (roll for quiz or no quiz) make sure to read for that matter.  Reading assignmts but not hard, actually helpful.  Several papers to write but pretty low stress topics.  Overall, helpful for college essay writing!",1
He is the best guy that you can meet. He knows everything about his field and is willing to help at anytime. I do not have his class anymore and we still talk frequently. He is just so dedicated to his students.,1
"Awesome professor, and an awesome class",1
"I loved Crawley both times I had him, for physiological psych and for psychological apps of stats. Tests are tough and there was a quiz every class for physio, but that was only to help us stay on track and ensure we were reading our books. You can tell he knows what he's doing and he loves it. He's always gone out of his way to help when needed!",1
Really hard to understand. Goes over practice problems in class but the way he describes them is really confusing. Business calc is extremely difficult with him. Would recommend another professor.,0
He was horrible the book would say one thing out in way left field... then in lecture would be something well right field... and the tests... yeah who they hell knows where that came from... never having him as a teacher again,0
"Wow. Where do I start? This is the best Professor I have ever had in the history of my college career. He is sweet, caring, passionate, engaging, accessible, adaptable, and overall awesome!!!!!! I 10000000% recommend you to take ANY course given by this professor. He genuinely cares about you and your success in his class. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!",1
1 word- BORING! It was honestly the worst class i've had so far.,0
"Nancy rocks. She seems unapproachable at first but she isn't. She knows her stuff. This class is all lecture, but she's clear and makes it interesting. Sometimes she's monotone, but she has a sense of humor. I highly recommend her.",1
Not only in college but my entire life hes the worst teacher Ive ever had by far. He sets the class up like a videogame so no one knew what was going on most of the semester. You have to teach yourself through videos. He requires you to get an 80% or better to pass a test or its a 0 and you retake it. If you don't play his games you get nowhere.,0
"You have to work for a good grade, lectures are important, he doesn't give out good grades, gives good examples, the book helped me a ton on the homework, TEST ARE HARD. I always feel awful after I take them but the grade turns out better then I think it's going too.",1
"His tests are tough, make sure you really study. His lectures contained a lot of material, and were live one day and recorded the other of the week. He took forever to respond to emails with questions. His weekly homework assignments were challenging. The lab reports are challenging, make sure you get a good group.",0
"He's a good guy and he knows what he's doing, but, he always speaks about how there are extra points added into his class, however they never manage to show up.  At the beginning of the class, he bragged about being able to teach Logic well, he doesn't.  However, he has a genuine skill for confusing the hell out of me.",1
"I usually hate online classes, but this ended up being one of my favorite classes that I have taken while at UT. The grading is made up of weekly essays, discussions, and then a final project at the end. There was no unnecessary work, and I feel like the essays and discussions actually helped me. I definitely recommend taking him and this class.",1
"Class is HARD, but Dr. Dave certainly knows how to make learning English interesting and does do through comic strips and modern world examples. There's barely any homework. Just a small paper for each chapter (like 500 words), five quizzes, and the final paper. Final paper is difficult, but I would take his class again in a heartbeat. Also works with you during personal emergencies. Thanks Dr. Marlow!",1
"All in all, I liked his class. Hes a good teacher and builds you up to speak in front of the class. I do wish he would have incorporated some impromptu, ungraded individual speeches to take up class time and get more public speaking experience before the major speeches. I know people would have appreciated the extra time/practice. Highly recommend",1
Easy A!!! She lets you use your notes and textbook on the tests and final. Almost all the questions come from Quizlet. She teaches from a PowerPoint and she is the sweetest lady. TAKE HER!!!!,1
No Comments,0
"Prof Zuidervaart is a gem of a teacher, take her! She used to be the English chair and stepped down a little bit ago if I'm not mistaken. If you're good at English, this class will be easy. The lectures are straightforward and you do 4 papers (3 over the summer). Each one is to hone in certain skills; show her you can do those, and you'll do great.",1
"Pretty good class when he lectured and super helpful when you ask for more help. Pretty cool guy too, super passionate in general.",1
"Definitely not a hard class/teacher. You just have to show up, do your homework, study and ask questions. Nothing super crazy though, easy A in my opinion.",1
"Easily the best math professor I've had, he makes a very involved class much more manageable.  Prof. Witelski is excellent at clarifying topics if you have trouble with the first explanation.  If you put in the time at the beginning to learn the solution process, you will do much better than if you try to memorize specific cases.",1
Cool dude. Sounds like Nick Cage. Easy Class overall. <3 Do the quizzes and the tests are easy. If you find this class hard you shouldn't be in the class. :),1
"Have pop quizzes from the readings you are supposed to do which are kinda hard. I went her for help and she let me redo almost all the quizzes I failed!! She is really caring if you go to her and she wants to see you succeed. However, her classes are so boring and you take at least 7-8 pages of notes every lecture. She does not post the slides...",1
"Her classes are always interesting and she obviously cares about the topics a lot.  Go to class and participate, this is what she is looking for, but for a 4th year class, that shouldn't be too hard, should it?",1
"If you show up on the every class, read the textbook, and do the assignments, you will get A.",1
"all he talks about is God, he relates everything to God, and it's not  bible class, very annoying when it comes to cell phone, completely felt like a elementary school teacher, and he never shuts up, let us watch the movie, he stops it and just analyses sayy to much.",1
"I had him twice and I have to say he's one of the best teachers I ever had:)He communicates well with his  students, very helpful and will do whatever he can to help you become a better artist. He makes class fun with his sense of humor and explains his lectures very clearly. I highly recommend him!",1
"Paul is a wonderful man and a great storyteller. He is, however, not as well versed in Foreign Policy as I would have appreciated. I pay for this, I want to learn something!",1
"Professor Stein is caring and straightforward about her expectations. She was very accessible outside of class to talk through assignments. You complete a lot of assignments but most are simple and she'll likely give you a 100. On larger papers, she grades a little harder but she is super willing to meet with you so you make the edits to get an A.",1
Professor Marks was the best Spanish teacher I have had throughout high school and grad school. Very helpful. Very willing to answer questions. Very passionate about Spanish and well-versed. Easy to understand. Fair Grader. Wish I could take all my Spanish classes with him.,1
"She's funny, witty & caring like a mom, but is a hard grader. I think she's allergic to grades 85 and up. Class is not boring but limited to Canadian culture. Knows the course she's teaching but more on the Canadian field. She's not racist but sometimes her emotions are biased to side more with the white (caucasian) students. Loves group work.",1
"Worst proffessor EVER. All she talks about Is her family and how she lived in Spain, without understanding that no one cares. Always makes you participate and if you pronounce something wrong while speaking out she makes you look dumb. Gives a lot of hard test, you must complete the online homework, and you can only miss 2 classes. DONT DO IT",0
You can tell that this professor cares about her student's well being. The class is fairly straight forward and easy to pass. There are a quiz and discussion posting due every other week. Every once in a while there is an essay due but the topic is fairly simple and all of the material needed to cover the topic can be found in your textbook.,1
"I has this class blended, so it was 70% online. Quizzes are online and very easy. Projects are in groups, and she's not a tough grader. Easy A and if you mess up you can make it up at some point with the extra credit opportunities. She is also a super nice lady!!",1
Unnecessarily strict with grading. Gives poor feedback with little to no reasons as to why a low grade was given.,0
"She makes the subject interesting, her lectures are easy to listen to and she brings in a smattering of guest lecturers that are as erudite as she and just as fun to watch. She always makes sure you know what she expects and what you are expected to learn. Best teacher I've ever had.",1
Class was boring. I felt like I was having to teach myself the material out of the book,0
"The most insulting aspect of this class was the fact she using cross-word puzzles.  My God, I thought I was back in elementary school again.   This is not a college-level instuctor and I will never take another class with her.  The Department of history has the best professor on campus and the worst.  Very sad.",0
"Tom is very nice and a clear lecturer.  He is always willing to meet outside of class, but at least for this class, had some trouble explaining difficult material in a way that undergraduates would be able to understand.  Before I took this class, I heard very good things about him, so take one of his tried and true classes like 103x.",1
"I love Richard! I took him for Advanced Swim and Water Polo. He's a really great guy. He can swim really well. If you love swimming and are halfway decent at it, take his classes. A few online modules, but it's not hard at all.",1
"If you can, definitely take Stat 105/305 with him. His practice exams are almost identical to the real tests and he is very nice. Would highly recommend him over any other stats professor.",1
"She's young, but she's great. Awesome non ppt lectures. I was fortunate to have her for my class. Our average was very low (I don't know why), but I'm pretty sure it was my cohort's fault. She was always there for us and offered PLENTY of extra credit for us to earn.   If you are in trouble, GO TO HER OFFICE HOURS. She'll help you succeed.",1
"It's not professor Bliss's fault that finance is hard but it very much is. However, he makes it as manageable as possible. He is the most accessible professor I have ever met and genuinely just a nice guy. The Skoolers reviews are pretty much necessary to do well on his exams which, as other people have said, are brutal. Book so not required.",1
"Dr. Webb loves math and it shows! He relates mathematical concepts to real life examples, reviews hw in class, gives bonus points, and makes learning fun! He even films math videos for Youtube. If you struggle in math, take his class!!! He cares about student success and is always motivating his students to try thier best. Take Dr. Webb's class!!!",1
Professor Alexander was an extremely motivating teacher. One of the best that I had at Georgetown. He has a knack for making complex concepts fun and digestible. His passion for learning and teaching is contagious and inspiring. Take him if you have the chance.,1
Recommend if you are a graduate student. She is not approachable. Loads of reading and tests r hard.,1
Dr. Schmitz is my favorite prof ever.  She is a wonderful professor and really cares for her students and wants then to succeed. She is willing to do whatever to help you understand the material. Dr. Schmitz is simply the best.,1
I really love this teacher. All the prior reviews are right on. Plus I think she is pretty cute. Take the class!,1
She was a miserable teacher to learn under and almost drove away my drive to learn Japanese.  I refuse to be taught by her ever again.,0
"Mr Conta is the best teacher i have ever had. He makes the class very interesting. I have taken over 6 AJ courses with him. He loves the law enforcement and he is passionate about teaching it. He wants everyone to succeed , if you need help he will help you. His tests are very easy just make good notes. Take his class you will love it!!!!",1
"Very lazy professor, have him 2 times a week. On the monday or tuesday class we spend half the time watching videos submitted by students explaining a problem from the hw which is a waste of time. The other day of his class he sends out pre recorded lectures. If I had to describe him in one word I would struggle deciding between lazy or disengaged.",0
"Her tests are what killed my A grade. They are hard because there isn't always one right answer, you have to use her teachings to figure out the best answer. I got 's on every assignment but D's and C's on every test. Other than that, I really liked her. She's extremely organized and she always responds to emails and questions. Very personable!",1
Keval is a decent/mediocre professor. It should have been a fairly easy course but somehow she made it very difficult when it came to grading.,1
"Knows what she's talking about when it comes to reading material; there's always a lot to talk about and none of that ""let me stare at you in hostile, awkward silence until someone speaks."" If there is a time that no one has anything to say in response to a point/question she brings up, she'll get the discussion going somehow. Lots of essays though",1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. I took this class for a breadth and regret doing so. It's is incredibly boring. All she does is drone on and on and no one listens. Awful teaching. There are 5 pop quizzes that the class average is always a 60-70%. If you're going to take this class, take it with a different professor.",0
"One of my favorite semesters in nursing school was third. That's because I had professor Waller. Now we have her again for 4th & that's b/c we're super lucky! She's straight to the point & clear. Doesn't try to terrorize students or scare them about how ""hard"" her tests are. as long you put in the effort you'll do good. She's very encouraging!!",1
"Probably the worst professor  I have had so far at Schulich (MBA). Clearly isn't well suited to teach the MBA curriculum, as all he knows are theories, but has difficulty relating back to relevant work scenarios. AVOID - take with Friendman.",0
"REALLY nice guy, the course material is sort of hard to grapple with, but if you make an effort and show up to class, he's very helpful and understanding. Decent course but really great professor.",1
"Professor Tidwell was great! She truly cares about her students and wants them all to be successful. She is more than willing to assist with any questions. We did end up reading almost the entire textbook, so be prepared. Quizzes were pretty straightforward if you've read the material. Follow her grading criteria and you will do well!",1
"Professor Buck makes it easy to understand the material. He really makes sure everybody is on the same page when it comes to each lesson. He is a bit slower-paced than Calc I in my opinion, but that is good for many people. His applications are great and his lessons are accessible. The cat in the background is a bit distracting though sometimes.",1
"Professor Vannier rambles a bit but is an okay professor. You can easily pass the class by completing the weekly quiz during lectures and briefly skimming the lecture slides. Anything difficult is pretty easy to figure out with at most a couple minutes of searching. The text book is a waste of time, the internet can suffice.",1
"She really knows her stuff. She's nice but be prepared to do the assignments on time. She asks questions to make you think. Project is not hard, just show you learned from it and you'll get an A.  Gives study guide for tests but they are just concepts so you have to read up. Gives some extra credit when you need it.",1
"Great professor, always looked forward to class!",1
As the others have said If you want to major in poetry take his class but if you are just taking the class because you have to for your GED or your major then don't. We were required to have five different books. He wants you to write in a similar matter as Aristotle and Plato. I took the W on my transcript rather than staying in his class.,0
"He's a decent professor and the lectures are pretty entertaining sometimes. If you do the readings and the mind tap assignments (like for real, not just skimming and guessing) it will really help. The tests are pretty difficult but he gives you tips on what to study. He gave homework on multiple chapters we weren't tested on which was annoying.",1
"Tom is a fantastic professor. The amount of real world topics brought in to the class was amazing, with many guest speakers and real world experts. He also allowed for fruitful debate about a variety of topics, especially political elections and their implications. 10/10 would recommend, one of the best profs in the faculty!",1
"Dr. Braun is a tough grader, and she gives a lot of assignments. However, she is a very nice and helpful professor. While the workload was wayy more than I expected, I still earned an A. I do not reccomend her if you are looking for an easier class, however, she is very nice and helpful if you put in the work.",1
"A super sweet woman, but just showed documentaries every class. She lectured maybe 3 or 4 times all semester. She gives you like 3 autobiographies in the beginning of the semester to read that are very very very important for the final so definitely start reading and highlighting them super early. She will help you but only if you seek her out.",1
"Prof. Perkins is honestly a really great professor. He's funny and relates to his students very well. His course does require some extensive readings, but overall they are pretty interesting. 4 small papers, and then one long paper at the end of the semester. Lectures are interesting concepts and require student participation.",1
"Dr. Gelderloos is an extraordinary person. We are so lucky to have him at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. After reading all of the positive comments about Dr. G, its clear-his passion for students, biology, and the environment is contagious and moving. This class is the most level-headed and engaging introduction to environ. issues. TAKE",1
No Comments,1
"Terrible feedback. Tough grader. Choices in reading are okay, but she tries to make you think HER way, not critically. It's only HER interpretation & you have to guess. Makes a class that could be great miserable. Contradicts herself; is all over the place with the syllabus. Take this class with another professor! Not worth the aggravation.",0
He's a really  funny guy and it made his lectures a lot more enjoyable. He's very vague however and it's nearly impossible to know for sure what's going to be on the tests. So expect to have a lower grade. But he's pretty awesome so it's kinda conflicting.,1
"She is the best teacher ever. Honestly I wish all teachers were like here. She is funny, sweet, and nice. Her lectures are easy to follow. Exams are self explanatory. She gives out a lot of extra credit. Trust me you would want to take her.",1
He has A LOT OF NOTES but they help and make you understand the concepts needed for the hw and tests. If you don't understand then you need to ask. Trust me you would want to to understand the concepts so you can take the tests. Group project: you work as a group for your topic but you are graded individually. YOU AREN'T RESPONSIBLE for others work,1
"She sees students as peers. Anyone can stop her while giving lecture anytime, she will pay tons of patient back. She has a really good temper if you don't try to bully her. She also uses her academic life experience to encourage students. I am little bit afraid of math, but I believe I can even choose this as my major at the end of this semester.",1
This is the best online class I have taken. The lectures are very clear and easy to understand. Teacher is very open to communication. The material in the tests is fully covered on the lectures. Li Liu is a very good teacher and cares about the success of her students!,1
"This Professor has a clear grading criteria. There  are 4 tests. Each test is 30% take home and 70% in class. His tests are very clear. Just go to the mathlab if you do not understand his explanations. His explanations are not the best, but you can easily get an A if you do the homework and prepare for the tests.",1
Je ne sais pas pourquoi ce prof enseingne encore. il est vraiment sans compétance aucune... oh qu'il est médiocre ce type ....,0
"Professor Holztblatt is a nice guy who makes class enjoyable with a sense of humor that's dry but is still refreshing in an accounting class. There's homework due every class which can be hard to keep up with. Exams are fairly easy, most of the class finished the final within 40 minutes.  He's passionate about accounting and cares about students.",1
always helped me when i asked...easygoing,1
"Straightforward and super caring. Keep up with lectures so you understand the next one, and take good notes! Obviously problem sets are essential. The extra credit sucked (hours for a couple points) but helped in the end.",1
"Avoid! Class is extremely boring and he teaches half the course based on his own bias and beliefs, homework heavy, but he gives you the answers. Content is extremely specific and useless. Not friendly or caring, very loud, often wrong about things he teaches as facts (google fact check him). Says ""out there"" and ""makes sense"" so much I kept a tally",0
"the best professor at umd. very easy class, he understands that education is about learning things and not memorizing a few terms and spitting them out on exams. he teaches you life changing aspects in class and is just in general a very good person. very easy class, show up, do the work, read spark notes the day before, and you'll get an A easily.",1
I had her for so many years-- I wish that I still did.,1
"Professor Infante is great! World Lit is a really interesting class and he clearly is very passionate about it. He chose some really great texts and always gave insightful lectures. He is very laid back and approachable, enthusiastic about what he teaches, and is a pretty easy grader. Overall it is a very casual atmosphere and highly enjoyable.",1
Dr. G is one of the few professors that I can say made a profound impact on my life. I am so proud to be one of his students. In June 2013 I will graduate with my PhD and he was one of my inspirations. The Env. Studies degree was one of the best decisions I ever made. It allowed me to have a minor in computer science which complemented my Env Ed.,1
"Even though Flannery can be silly and animated during his lectures he knows what he is talking about and does a great job of teaching the material. If you don't attend class you won't be deducted points but you will miss a lot of material. Overall, I really enjoyed this class and his teaching to the point where Economics is now my minor.",1
"In lab or out of class, Mr. Dr. Woodard is very nice and approachable. Makes jokes and usually discusses things with you if you have questions/need help. In class, however, can be irritable to a fault and often changes mind about what material we are studying (I.E. changing worksheet for our weekly quiz about five times every week) Lots of writing.",1
I took her online PSY class. There are weekly assignments a couple projects that are simple and weekly quizzes. She is extremely helpful and gets back to you quickly if you email her with a question. I highly recommend taking her class. She is great!,1
"LOVE Professor Dent! Hard class for sure - lots of reading, unfamiliar topic, and a hefty 10 pg paper-BUT she is fantastic!! SO helpful & understanding if you communicate with her. GO TO OFFICE HOURS! even once, she will help outline your whole paper. tests are hard but not bad if you study the outline. also has amazing resources for sources, etc",1
"Amazing professor! Shes really sweet, and caring. Her papers were difficult but she was VERY accessible and willing to help. She made transitioning from on campus to remote learning super easy and helped us through it with no problems at all. Take her, shes a gem!",1
"I loved her! at the first part of the class she is very tough, but she is trying to show you that you need to be serious as well, as the class goes on she opens up, and made learning fun. The class itself is common sense, however study for the test because they are very tough!!!!! Overall i enjoyed her class and would take more of them in the futur",1
"He doesn't ever stay on topic, he is late to class and he keeps you over the time alloted. His opinions are never backed up an if you dont agree with him your mark suffers.",0
Professor Hunt is the nicest lady ever. She is very helpful and her lectures are very informative and clear. She is great at explaining tough subjects. I thought it was so amazing that she learned all the names of her students in a 40+ lecture within the first 3 classes. Can't wait for A&P2 with her next semester,1
"It seems like a lot of work but its really not. There is an online quiz for every chapter which makes up a lot of points for the class. One presentation, and one group book. Gives amazing feedback that will help you succeed and pass the class. I wish I could take more classes with Heather!",1
"Cool professor! Took him for Comm 30 and very easy to connect with. Do the work and communicate with your groups, he also gives a little prep beforehand so passing the presentations shouldn't be hard. He also gives a couple of small paper assignments and peer evaluations. He lectures are easy to understand, participate and get involved!",1
"Ok, I have NEVER done a professor review. But Guetter is that bad. He is the worst professor I've had in my entire schooling. Get ready for LOTS of mathematica & nothing that expresses your Calculus knowledge. Get ready to be laughed at, belittled, & mocked for trying. I did well in the class, but I can't believe hes still employed. -stars for him.",0
"If you are an EE major, this is the professor you want for EE205.  We were all better off in EE206.",1
Dr. R challenged me to meet my potential. She is tough as nails but sharp as a swiss knife. Outstanding researcher and great fashion sense)))) Oh and she is soooo pretty)))) Definitely a role model for women in research professions,1
he is not as bad as all of these comments. yes talking to him in person is a bit challenging because he talks over you. you can literally sign in and then leave the class. he gives extra credit and the project is a group presentation (easy). 2 take home finals (really easy grader) other 2 are multiple choice so you get what you get but its easy.,1
boring teacher. showed up to office hours and he was not much help at all. lectures are boring and its hard to stay awake especially if you have it in the morning,0
"This was a terribly easy class. All of the exams were open book and really, that gave no incentive to actually learn any of the material. Ultimately, this class is what you make of it. If you really have the time to learn the material, go ahead! If you already have a heavy schedule, you can still very easily get an A with literally no effort.",1
"She's great. Class is easy and somewhat interesting. Honestly, you can skip class as long as you go online to do at least one of the Mastering Nutrition questions during the class.",1
Nice guy - but he knows nothing asbout MIS - this is not a computer science class - it should be about business.,0
"He doesn't give extra credit, even if you are failing. You ABSOLUTELY have to show your work on his tests or he marks the question wrong even if you got the right answer. You cannot use a graphing calculator only scientific. He goes through lessons really fast so if you aren't good at math, this is a difficult class. I had to drop his class.",0
"Okay so Professor Clara is a great person and all but her class is kinda eh, nothing to be excited about. Long lectures, don't be surprised if you gotta stay throughout the whole class. Tests are based on that BS quizzes she gives instead of attendance but doesn't give back to study. Other then that she is a great professor, she is helpful.",1
Hard considering its supposed to be an intro course.,1
Without a doubt the best Torts professor at Hofstra!,1
her grading system makes no sense and I have never had more panic attacks than I did this semester when taking her. do not take her. worst prof at westconn.,0
GREAT! Instructor. You might need a tutor and to dedicate lots time for MATH125. She is one of the BEST instructors!,1
"Dr. Feige was so much fun. Just be prepared to work hard, his class is not easy. He was amazing as we had to switch over to online because of COVID. He's super patient and he's so much fun to be around.",1
She's a nice but this is for your own good when i tell you to not take her. You can be writing the easiest paper but she'll still manage to fail you or give you a low grade on it somehow. IMPOSSIBLE grader. I get great grades but definately not in her class. Im seriously worried i might fail a class for the first time. Get out now while you can.,1
Really fun and enjoyable class. I enjoyed how we walked through the instructions as a class so that no one would get lost.,1
This course has been the most difficult class Ive ever taken However max is funny and caring prof even though he doesnt look it The labs in this course were BRUTAL and the midterm was equally bad(46% Ave after curve) the exams need to be more fair he should also consider gives us a heads up on what is explicitly gonna be tested.,0
"i was nervous about this class,required for psy majors but i suck at math.prof packer was great,he seemed a little annoyed if you asked too many questions, but he explained things in simple terms. emphasis is on learning SPSS, not doing arithmetic. let us out early every sat. morning and gave us option to exempt out of final if you ace the 3 quizes",1
The class is very irrelavent to English and Literature and the professor also uses biases in his teachings and towards students. The class is very boring.,0
"Easiest math professor I've ever had. He explains the material very thoroughly. The review is almost identical to the tests. The sample tests are take-home and in class for the real test, you're able to use your review and take home test. He always lets out early for night class and won't make you stick around, unless you need help. Very helpful.",1
"Don't really like the way he teaches -- in fact I don't think I would call it teaching.  He's not clear and he doesn't teach you the stuff he tests you on; he expects you to learn it by reading it on the web.  If I wanted to do distance learning, I wouldn't be going to class every week.",0
"Class consist of attendance, pop quizzes/in class activities, 4 tests (drops the lowest), and assignments. Assignments are written and are short. Beware of pop quizzes though. The first test was online at home, the second test was in class with no use of notes or the book, the third exam was in class with notes, and the fourth was online . Got an A",1
"Take him is you have to. He is a kind person, but very very very boring. It is very lecture heavy and he goes off on tangents that do not pertain to the subject you are learning about. He quizzes you every class and the quizzes do not correlate to the chapters that you read outside of class. He is nice though.",0
"I liked the structure of her class. She contextualizes the reading assignment from the night before, and then poses questions that generate class discussion about it. Lecture-heavy, but manageable, as she gives an outline of what each test will cover. She comes off as a little condescending at times, but just get your work done. Pretty standard.",1
"Passionate about his subject, but lectures can be hard to follow. He tells stories with no relevance to the curriculum. What you read and what he lectures does not always equate to the same. To do well on his test, take notes on what he says in class and write that as your answer.",0
This professor is impossible to please. I have never had a professor at ASU grade papers the way he does. He is a stickler for EVERYTHING. I am an A student on the deans list and have written A+ papers for over 3 years at ASU and never have had a professor treat me like I know nothing. Do not take him if you can avoid it.,0
"AMAZING professor!! Makes the lectures extremely fun, and with him you will easily  learn any language you signed up with him for. Wish I could take him again for german 3 but unfortunately that class was not offered. I 100% recommend him. Ich liebe dich Herr Morales!!",1
"He is a very nice person, but too jumbled/distracted in lectures to stay focused easily. As long as you do the hw, and STUDY it for quizzes/tests (they are both solely BASED OFF THE HW, don't study your lecture notes like I did and completely fail a quiz). Take him if you can, others are worse. You'll pass with him. Remember, 77 is easier than 76.",1
"She is the best clinical intructor i've had. I had her for med surg 1. She's a tough instructor, but if you put in the effort, you will learn a lot.",1
"All the information presented is clear and coherent. If you have any questions, she is willing to answer them. The workload is light, even in the 6-week semester. Homework was graded on the basis of completion rather than correctness. Papers were very easy. Exams were also easy, so long as you pay attention in class.",1
it's a lesson in life,1
"Scribbles vague notes on board, and cannot read handwriting whatsoever. Tests are way too hard- covers too many chapters in one exam, and are not permitted to use any notes, and entails excessive essay questions. Each individual test is worth 20% of your final grade. 70% of the final grade is based solely on these test scores.",0
"She was fabulous! I had her for my food for thought class, she made it interesting and engaged with the class. I would take the class again! And for the work, she helps you along. She helps guiding you in the right direction.",1
"Went completely off the course schedule and scheduled tests and assignments so they were only available on weekends. While her courses were well scripted, she could or would not answer questions. Classes quickly dissolved into tech issues (zoom era, I hope this is over when you're reading this) and into arguments with students.",0
His assignments & lectures (monologues) provided little groundwork for success in the class & his teaching (telling) was far from thorough. Pretty much nobody had a clear idea of what aspects of his teaching to digest & remained hopeful that a miracle would occur on an exam. It was hard to prepare for class/exams... I would consider other options.,0
"Online class. Everything is laid out for you + there are no lectures. You read the textbook + do weekly assignments. This might seem nice, but I see no point in having the professor when the textbook does her job for her. Also, midterm/final have 100+ questions that ask you to memorize VERY specific info from the text - poor, lazy test design.",0
Easy online class if you listen to lectures and take notes. Use the book to look up paintings and artists and you will be fine. Good teacher who is willing to help.,1
"Mrs. Griffin was a great professor. She made sure to cover the material well. She made us study guides and even tutored students before and after class. She cares about her students and their success. If you ask her for help, she will help you. You do have to do your part as a student, which means you read chapters and study notes.",1
"Mr. DeFoe is the greatest English professor I have ever had! If you can, take him! He is a really understanding guy who works with you and not against you. ",1
There is entirely too much work. I worked more in this class than any other. The material is fairly easy. Lectures teach you nothing. You learn everything from the homework. Probably 5-6 hours a week.,0
"Great professor and the least stressful language class out there. It is still sort of hard though since it's Japanese, but she makes it easier than even some of the lower level professors do.",1
"Nicest professor ever! You learn a lot of useful relevant information in his Social Media class. He isn't a tough grader, if you put in effort you will get an A for sure. He really cares about students. He is willing to go out his way to help students understand the material. Responds fast. So nice and caring and too pure for this earth. TAKE HIM!",1
"Mr Wildman is the best. Take him if you can, you won't regret it.",1
Super great and funny. Awesome teacher !!,1
Very tough cookie. Seems ominous at first but turns out to be very cool and helpful. Make sure you read all the assignments thoroughly!,1
"Worst teacher! I took him for A&P 1. Its hard to understand him at first but eventually you pick up what he's saying. Yes, his homework is unlimited but he gives you like 70 questions, each question has 15+ parts. Gives you a review of 200 questions a week before exam and expects you to know them all for 150 question test.",0
"Nice and chill professor who made sure his students were engaged in learning German. Homework was due every class, but it was very easy. As long as you participate in class, you'll do fine.",1
"Got to be the worst professor at PCC. His lectures are so boring, I would actually find it more entertaining to watch paint dry on the wall. And his tests are ridiculous. I feel bad whoever is taking him next semester, they don't know what their signing up for - AVOID this guy.",0
Suggs is awesome and the class is great. A lot of people will probably only say that because it's easy but the content itself is really interesting and I learned a lot about a topic that I didn't think I would enjoy. I didn't need to take the class but I'm really glad I took it anyway. This is one of the few classes at JMU that I'll miss.,1
"Doug was great in J564. He is super engaging and has great stories and examples to support his ideas. My only criticism is that his lectures are a bit unorganized: there seemed to be one long lecture for the entire semester with no clear-cut stopping points for each class period. I would recommend the course, but know that readings are essential!",1
"Prof. Peterson is such a sweet & soft-spoken lady. She wants everybody to do well & learn alot. The lectures, weekly quizzes & 2 papers all stem from the textbook! It's fun because you get to choose your research topic, but they are time-consuming papers! So START EARLY! (She does walk you through the entire process tho, so don't stress!) :)",1
"Well we had Marek as a professor for 4 semesters out of 6.  I agree first couple of months you have him as a teacher, everything seems complicated. But once you understand his style of teaching, grading and lectures (which is not everyones cup of tea), you can extract a lot out of him because he very educated man.",1
He is very partial teacher. He just gives opportunities to students who are doing research under him or whom he knows. He is very bad for others.,0
"Dr. BA is a wonderful professor once you get to know him. Although, he reads a lot from the slides, you just have to read the book to be able to understand everything(after all, that's what the book is for). He has a very thick accent, but if you are a very good listener you should not have any problem of understanding him :)I would recommend him.",1
Professor Royce is a very intelligent man but doesn't know how to teach. He is very unclear about what he expects and goes way too fast in class. He's a hard grader and gets frustrated when you ask questions. Avoid if at all possible,0
I am a senior getting ready to graduate in March and Professor Bradley is by far my favorite professor thus far. She is engaging and draws class participation from everybody. I only hope they allow her to teach one of my remaining clusters.,1
Easy class. He curves a lot too.,1
"This was a great course. At first I thought it would be difficult because of the diverse nature of the ocean, however the professor provided all the tools needed to succeed. She also didn't have any hidden or tricky questions and the course was very straightforward. I also walked away with a better understanding of the way tides worked.",1
"All assignments are worth 100 points. If you do bad on one, your grade goes down a lot.",0
"I really really enjoyed taking her class. I did have to miss some of class due to work or being sick which brought my grade down.... I should've had a 90%, but I have a 75%. So seriously attendance matters in this class. Learned a lot and she's a great professor would definitely recommend.",1
He's horrible. Tough grader. Not clear. Not helpful. Don't take his class or you will fail.,0
"As long as you annotate the readings, skim through them get the main concept , you'll be fine",1
"Doug is great.  Really helped me increase my skills in drawing. He is honest with you on your drawing, which is great if you are looking towards a career in Art.  Great class! would take again ",1
"its very easy to get A in his class, I just attend his lecture and finish the HW in time, I didn't do anything else to get extra practice , and easily A for me.",1
Truly an amazing professor. She makes it clear how caring and committed she is as a professor. Would definitely take her class again.,1
"Absolute gem of a professor, an old master of the natural world. Take one of his courses (Higher Plants, Lower Plants, or Ornithology) and you'll walk out feeling like you know everything on the subject. Field trips to all sorts of great places. Just MAKE SURE to study the practice questions and DO NOT walk in late.",1
MUST do all of. the homework to pass. She use Hawkes for homework and test. The test is online but you have to take it at the school. Homework will save your grade and always do it on time plus the discussion board. If you do the practice test you should do good on the actually test because its similar. She will go over questions if you ask.,1
I took Queen for Writing 39c/English 11 Combo. He is a very caring professor who wants you to succeed. There are a lot of papers for both classes but he doesn't grade very hard. Papers in English 11 are group papers and the papers in writing go through lots of drafts before submission. Recommend!,1
"Pchem was one of the hardest classes bcuz a lot of the stuff in lecture didn't make sense, so I would have to supplement with the book. That being said, Atkins isn't great but it gets the job done. Heske does a good job @ dissecting relevant info from the book and does a good job at presenting the material. His attitude is one more professors need",1
Good teacher,1
"Half of his lecture notes are nonsensical abbreviations that only make sense to him. Class is very conservative/ Christian based. Very much emphasizes what he agrees with in the class (lectures pro life for a hour and 45 mins, then 15 mins of pro choice coverage). Claims theism is the only logical choice, bases it on the watchmaker theory.",0
Mr. Baumgartner is very helpful!,1
"Matt is the kindest professor I've come across. He goes out of his way for his student's no matter the expense. He is very responsive and considerate. The course material is not too difficult, and if you do the assignments you will succeed. Each week has a pre-lecture quiz and in class quiz based on the weekly textbook reading.",1
"Dr. Ayadi is very enthusiastic and passionate about health economics. The concepts are not easy to understandremember. She is very straightforward, does not give easy grades and no late submissions You have to study really hard, but the issues are interesting.",1
"Dr. Collins is such a sweet woman. Her lectures can be a bit boring sometimes, but she is super caring and reached out to students all J-Term. She really valued learning our names and getting to know us. Beware of memory verse quizzes, basically daily pop quizzes, and being called on to read or answer questions. Lots of reading, plus the entire NT.",1
"One of the best playwrights in the country, and one of the best teachers, too. Fiercely intelligent.",1
"Faith Lamprey is a nice lady. Her lectures are clear and easy to flow. Attend class, do the homework and you will pass. If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask her. She does not have an office at Rhode Island College, but she is pretty good at responding to emails.",1
My first semester with her was an awesome one. I wish I could have her for the remaining 3 semesters. She gives you all you need to succeed in the class. She will not sugar coat and there will be no misunderstandings from her. She says what she means and means what she says. If you have the opportunity you should select her for 1300/1451,1
Awesome prof! Knows and is enthusiastic about subject matter. Very helpful and willing to explore your interest with you or extra material.,1
This professor is amazing. A younger guy with experience in the field who teaches with excellent humor and has focus on getting the whole class involved. To succeed in this class simply don't be afraid to ask for help and PARTICIPATE.,1
"Don't take this class. It is dull and didn't teach me much about acting etc. I was bored and disliked Sara and her attitude. Her work is so extensive and detailed, that I spent hours on writing her papers and doing the homework.",1
I was so excited to take this class but it's definitely hard to take online. We didn't have scheduled meeting times (but there were office hours). My only issue is that it was hard to follow and understand what was going on. You really need to live by the syllabus. Not hard once you figure everything out.,1
Lots of dense proofey material. I took him for the honors 408D-- mistake.,1
"This class is super easy to pass. All you have to do it go to class and have a basic understanding of physics. However, he has a super soft voice and can make you go to sleep. There is a presentation at the end , but gives you full credit if you try enough. Super easy class.",0
"will teach yourself, hates to break prob down, shell be annoyed but be sure to ask all the questions, vague teaching, shes lazy & uses a math app for hw & grading & because of this she wont know how a student is doing on their own, the midterm/final is in class & must show work this is when shell know if u can work problem but still wont care",0
Amazing teacher.,1
"I've taken multiple classes with Dr. Curzon, and I would take her more if I could. She is an amazing professor. She is very lecture heavy, but her lectures are amazing and informative. Her tests and essays are relatively easy, and she offers plenty of extra credit. Also, she has been one of the most understanding professors during the pandemic.",1
Sociology what? Is there such a science? Don't know cause I didnt learn anything.,0
"She... sucks. She's not a good proffessor at all. She will spend 70% of class time rambling incoherently about her life in Spain. Very liberal. She's immature and disrespectful if you dare to counter her liberal views. Tests are hard. Spends last minutes of class doing what we're supposed to, and keeps us there assigning last minute past class time",1
Very Very tough if you are not an english major.  Do not take this guy lightly.  He definitely helps you write for the reader.  If writing is not your strength DO NOT take his class.  Otherwise he will improve your writing dramatically. BE ORIGINAL and interesting!,1
"Terrible professor, it's sad too. She isn't very good at teaching and explaining. If you're not one to study and work REALLY HARD then this class isn't for you. DON'T TAKE HER.",0
"One of the best professors in the psychology department! He is so inspirational, and knows what he's talking about. I really enjoyed taking behavioral psych with him. Take him!",1
NOT THE MOST INTERESTING OF CLASSES. GENERAL LECTURE IS INFORMATIONAL ABOUT HOW TO BE A SUCCES COLLEGE STUDENT. THE INSTRUCTOR IS ALSO AND COUNSELOR IN THE ADMISSION TOWER ON THE 3RD FLOOR.,1
"The class is both lecture and textbook oriented, you need to do the reading and go to the lectures if you want to pass. There is not really any homework assignments other then the reading, which makes it a test heavy class.",1
"Very surprised that anyone doesn't like Adelle. She is a brilliant woman and her lectures are engaging and thorough. You have to do the readings and go to class to do well, but her course is quite fair and I would recommend it to everyone who is interested in the subject. I honestly didn't mind the readings or going to class because I loved it!",1
"Kim is a good lecturer, although things can get boring sometimes. He is very open-minded and kind. After taking this course, I plan to take more ASA courses.",1
Amazing professor super easy and straight forward,1
"She's not very clear, sometimes she runs off tangent many times and forgets what she's talking about.",0
Nice guy and incredibly flexible. He seems kind of shy but he is really willing to help students out of his own time. I really enjoyed his class.,1
She was really easy! I despise writing papers and English but I loved the class. I definitely would take it again.  It's one of the best english classes I have ever had! She's a wonderful teacher!!,1
Really knows what he's talking about but much better professor for a higher level class. Tests are really hard and require you memorize the content. Lectures are pretty standard. Knows a lot about research. Definitely stop by his office because it can clarify things that were hard to understand in lecture.,1
She's amazing. She really cares about students and wants you guys to succeed. Just make sure to keep up to date with all homework assignments and she even lets you make a study guide for the test! SHE ROCKS! ps: she likes green apples :),1
"Professor Ross knew his material. He made sure that he had many hours worth of office hours per week. He claimed you needed the textbook, but I got an A without reading anything. Get ready for Mastering Physics assignments every week. The 4 ""exams"" are not comprehensive. The hardest part is that his voice is monotone and makes it hard to stay awake",1
"He knows his stuff, and respects his students.  Good guy.",1
Burke is great!  He is always willing to help you if you need it.  If you do the work you will go good. ,1
Graded mainly on 3 essays. You learn nothing useful in lectures because he is too busy talking about his own life or other people's lives. You will need to read a few articles but they're all pretty pointless. He is caring and wants to be close to his students but not a great professor. You won't learn anything. Most people get Cs on essays.,0
"Words can't describe how great Steven Ross is. To borrow a word from a previous review, ""legendary"". He breaks down complicated concepts into simple concepts. He relates the material back to examples that make sense to us. Never boring whatsoever, his passion really comes out in his lectures.  Best professor I've ever had, and it's not even close!",1
Mark is a great teacher always helpful and interesting; He supervise for 5 yearsd and He still cannot get rid of me. Don't bother with him if you are not willign to put the effort and run for your life if you just even think about plagarise a small section.,1
"Grading is not clear... professor does not follow Her own rubrics or syllabus, do not take this professor",0
"She's very young which means two things: one, she likes to have fun in her classes and frequently opens the floor for class discussion or personal stories. Two, she's a hard grader. Younger teachers tend to stick to the book, and she does more so than other professors. This is likely because she wants to demand respect outside of her gorgeous looks",1
The course in general is pretty bad. Berthiaume doesn't seem to care much and doesn't explain things particularly well. The exams were difficult.,0
"Professor Capper is awesome! His lectures are super interesting but they are pretty long, around 40 minutes each. I'm not sure how he is in person (mid Covid time) but online he's super easy. The only thing you really have to do are watch the lectures and take notes. You're supposed to read the readings as well (no textbook) but I never do.",1
"His lecturing isn't the worst, but he makes you fill in blanks and you have to add textboxes when you could be paying attention to his lecture. He tests on very specific and arbitrary details and the marking scheme is unnecessarily rigid (good luck reading his mind when there's five missing words in a row for fill in the blanks).",0
I had her as as a first year first semester student. Her class at the beginning is based on the comm 100 textbook but slowly it goes to be more presentation based. The feedback she gives on your presentations is harsh but fair and you will improve if you follow them. She is also very understanding and cares about you succeeding.,1
"Kevin relies a lot on videos, and his lectures are pretty easy to follow.  I skipped probably a quarter of the class periods, and I still got an A.  Not much heavy-duty writing in this course (outside the midterm and final).  Take Kevin's class if you need some cupcake upper-division level history credits.",1
"Awesome professor. He will most definitely work with you if you have any issues or questions. He also responds to emails rather quickly, which is nice. As long as you put in effort, a good grade is not difficult to achieve in this class.",1
"Yes, this class was absolutely atrocious. I tried twice; both times I got completely left in the dust. Quizzes are due in the middle of the day with arbitrary start/end times instead of at midnight, so I always missed quizzes with no make-up. Complains about students emailing her, but if you have so many students emailing you there's a PROBLEM.",0
No Comments,1
"Dr Day is a very intelligent man, but he isn't very good at teaching to a class. He fails to break down what he is teaching into easy to learn chunks and instead slathers equations and algorithms up on the projector. Don't expect for him to teach you the MatLab language either, you will have to teach yourself 90% of it.",0
"This professor is the worst!! She is rude and mean. She does not care to help students, Laughs at us when we ask questions. She is writes rude emails and is rude when you go to her office hours for help. Despite her being hard to understand and confusing, she is not nice at all.",0
"Awesome professor. He will help you through this class if you are unsure. Take home final, project, and 2 artical critiques. Really easy.",1
"He is a very nice man. Helps with proofreading papers more than any other professor I've ever had. As long as you participate in class, always come to class, and meet with him to discuss and revise your papers (3), you should do well.",1
This class was easier than any class I have taken ever. Super easy credits and Caitlyn is great. The tests are legit the practice jeopardy games.,1
"Great teacher, gives youtube videos as lectures so you can watch them multiple times, gives good easy to understand overviews of the weeks and is a great teacher, really helps you learn the material rather than memorizing it.",1
He's an ok professor. The class disscussions don't help you much for the quizes but he does give you study questions that go along with the books you read. There are only a few papers which is always good but he does grade pretty harshly. You also have to do volunteer work as your 4th hour.,1
She kinda became the permanent sub for Murphy's ENC1101 in 2017 so I didn't really get a look into the way she would organize the class. She wants you to succeed and gives you many resources to do so but is a tough grader. If you enjoy English than you could thrive under her expectations but if you're looking to just get by take Eileen Murphy.,1
"The tricky thing is the online part. It's much harder to ask questions when you're not on the same page, or get feedback. The math program definitely not helpful--responses to wrong answers is a generic explanation to every attempt. The professor never lectures. The answer box is tiny & 4 spaces so you can't see if your whole answer is correct.",1
"I've never had class with KC, but she is in choir with me and she is so awesome. She is so nice and friendly",1
If you do not take him YOU WOULD MISS ALOT.  Amazing person.  I LOVE THIS GUY    Take him take him take him for any class ....   fun fun fun fun,1
Feedback is not helpful. I wouldn't recommend taking him.,0
"Although he is a very nice and funny man, I do not recommend him. He moves very fast compared to the other teachers and his lectures were incredibly unclear. He sorta just skims through the chapter and tells you what to look at- doesn't give examples just draws a few sloppy pictures and tells you to do the example on your own. Tests are hard.",0
Horrible teacher she doesn't explain at all she expects you to know everything she give a lot of homework and she grades super hard DONT TAKE HER CLASS!!!!!,0
"Dr. Prasad is the best! If you work hard, she wants you to succeed in the class! Would definitely recommend her",1
"I highly recommend Dr. Sharma's pov and soc welfare course. Reading isn't required due to her power points being based on the book. All assignments are easy and the videos she has us watch were interesting. Lectures can be repetitive but if the whole class participates, it can make it more interesting. Also, she wants her students to participate.",1
"He's very new to teaching & it shows. He's VERY difficult to understand & has an extremely hard time with being wrong & being called out on it. He's absolutely brilliant, but clearly not meant for teaching. I'm majoring in chem, so I didn't have a hard time w/ the class, but I read the entire book & ignored his lectures. Thats the only way to pass.",0
There would be time when she would tell a joke in spanish and laugh at her own joke and rest of the class would stare at her as none of us would understand what she is saying. Talks a lot about herself. overall she is not that bad you can survive if you do the homework and quizes on time and do well on exams.,1
"Anyone who thinks he is hard just doesn't want to think. He makes you do that! And, yes- kinda hot - and not flaming!",1
"I took her intro class online and ended up signing up for another one next semester. As far as online classes go, shes a good choice. If you don't get full marks on an assignment she explains why. The course format is consistent throughout the semester. You have to do work to get an A, but its not too hard.",1
"She's the worst prof I've had. Sweet but cannot teach. My friend and I compared assignments and we'd have the same answers but one of us would be wrong and the other right. Expectations were unclear, lectures boring, extremely unorganized and if you ask for clarification, she just repeats herself. You have to teach yourself. I don't recommend her.",0
Professor Cox is great. Her lectures are fascinating. The only drawback is that she talks very fast. Some pauses would be nice to let the concepts sink.,1
"Amazing lectures, easy to understand, very helpful if u don't understand",1
Best professor by far at the University of Iowa. Super fun and helpful. Clearly passionate about her field. I am currently a Social Work major and I cannot emphasize how much I enjoy Sara's classes.,1
"Sheridan is a fantastic professor. He does expect a lot - there is a lot of reading and the lectures are heavy content wise. However, he does a great job clarifying what you may need help with and if you put in the work, you will do just fine. Taking him again in the fall and I am so excited.",1
"Overall, I would say that he is a decent teacher. My downfall in the class was attendance. You do receive an attendance grade and trust me when I say it will affect your final grade. I would've had an A if I would've came to class more often. Sometimes he will get off topic, but he has a good sense of humor.",1
"Easy for those who are dedicated, and those who have the taloent. She is amazing in every way. I consider her my mentor, and I think everyone should look for her mentoring if they want to be better. Just don't expect to be as good as me.",1
She is ridiculous,0
His response to the events of the pandemic was unfortunate and unprofessional. I was embarrassed for him. Seemed to lack any self-awareness. He provided no course schedule and his materials were unorganized. He was very vague in his communication and defensive when it was brought to his attention that a student was having difficulty with the course,0
"Dr. Marshall is amazing. Her case studies are always interesting and current. She is extremely nice and very open to any topic. The midterm and final were both open book. You do not need the text book at all. However, it is helpful for the tests. It was easier to pull the answers from the book than to google them. Half of the final was a  paper.",1
This class is really easy but she does not give out any grades higher than a 95. Usually you will get between an 85 and 90 on an essay no matter how much work you put into it. She is super flexibly and very nice. DO NOT GET THE TEXTBOOK OR ACCESS CODE it is not worth it. We used it once and it was not helpful and you can just say you forgot it.,1
"The course could have been structured better since 5 percent of your grade for each module was riding on a 20 question quiz. However, I feel like this difficulty is made up since she offered quite a lot of bonus marks (3.5%). The lecture notes were great but if you want a high grade (A or above) you will need to work for it.",1
"Tina is such a great professor! I was terrified of public speaking but she made it a safe place, all of us were super comfortable with each other after a couple of weeks. She made lectures super entertaining and fun! She offers 100 pts of extra credit, you can literally bump your grade by a whole letter grade.",1
Had a quiz every Wednesday. The quizzes are kind of hard. He goes over everything on the quiz but talks really fast so it's hard to catch everything. The final and midterm are really hard.,1
"I basically taught myself this entire course. He wrote the book himself so it didn't make any difference to go to his class. The material is already so dry, his monotonous voice made even worse. Nice prof but my GPA suffered from this class.",0
"Dr. Hinton knows what she is saying, but it's kind of hard to understand if you don't know biology already. There are four tests and she curves them. She messed up reviewing for our final, so she doubled our highest test grade for our final grade. YMMV",1
"Great professor, very kind and understanding. I enjoyed his lectures and that some weeks there was class and some days it was just recorded (to give a break from zoom). Only complaint, wish he would send out if zooms were happening early in week. Would send out past 11pm for an 8am class. Overall, great class and professor though.",1
"Dr. Wildman is an amazing professor, easily one of the best at SFCC, and his class is a lot of fun. I personally didn't get along with him, though. Whenever I sought help, he made me feel as if I was wasting his time. I've never experienced this problem with any other professor. I was never rude and never felt deserving of his borderline neglect.",1
"Highly recommend his courtship and marriage class! Its fun, interesting, and engaging. You do have to study and do some work but its very worth it, I was never bored in class. Hes very knowledgeable and the information is relevant. Definitely take it if you can!",1
She's very passionate about what she does and her lectures are very interesting. I wouldn't say that the class is easy but it's not incredibly difficult either. It's crucial to actually read the recommended readings because we discuss them in class.,1
"This class has been REALLY terrible. It has been impossible to follow, the answers to test questions cannot be found in any of the material he provides. He rarely responses when contacted. He disappeared for ten days and neither explained or apologized. DO NOT take this class from this professor, you will regret it.",0
"Lectures are terrible, and to make them worse, she quiz at the beginning or end of the lecture. Not organized and I felt genuinely did not care about teaching.",0
"I took Professor Richmond's class during COVID. Throughout the entire semester, she was very understanding and supportive to all of her students. Grades consisted of 3 exams and 1 paper, but they weren't very hard. Most of the answers can be found on her powerpoints and lectures.",1
"Dr. Lawrence is incredibly kind and considerate, and I think he's a good teacher. He knows what he's talking about, and he's open minded. However, this class is tough. It's a ton of work, and I feel like I missed a lot of good information from the readings because I felt rushed. I liked the content--there was just too much of it.",1
Loved it!  Some stuff was related to my field. Thinking of minoring in geology now!,1
Shes one of the nicest professors Ive ever had. Shes very understanding if you just talk to her about any issues. There are a lot of group projects but she grades individually and if anyone isnt pulling their weight just talk to her.,1
I took Eng. 101 and 102 with Dr. Ferriera and she is the BEST! She is very caring and wants you to succeed. She's easy going and funny. She is not tough at all but you should participate in class and do the work she assigns. You also do group work which is great. Amazing lectures!. I got an A in both classes. EASY CLASS!,1
"Tompson is awesome. She is knowledgable and passionate about psychology and is animated and fun which keeps you awake for 8 AM lectures. only thing is- you need to go to the lectures or you'll be lost on the exams. If you go to lecture and take good notes, you're set! definitely recommend.",1
Thought this class would be sooo easy but then there was a professor change up. Richard really cares about what he's talking about but this class was not easy by any means. The material was confusing for non physical scientists but you don't have to go to class though. I had to P/NP but didn't have to do much work.,1
Excellent professor! Go to OH and do all the practice problems.,1
"Too many pointless, time and paper wasting assignments. Boring class which is only offered for 2 hrs and 45 min",0
"She is funny, and definitely passionate about the subject matter. The poor TA's do most of the grading, so get to know yours well. There is a quiz maybe once every two weeks, but she will sometimes let you use notes so it's not that big of a deal. However, the final project is time consuming so do NOT procrastinate! Stay organized. You'll be fine.",1
"Sam is a really chill guy. I had a question one day after class and we ended up strolling around campus talking about random things for an hour.   That being said, he's not a very good lecturer. His lectures are really repetitive and confusing, especially for being so early in the morning.   The class is easy though; there is hardly any work.",1
"Très rapide dans la matière, difficile de suivre adéquatement. Il semble trop connaître sa matière et pense qu'on la connaît déjà aussi on dirait... Moyenne de 53% à l'examen est normal pour lui.",1
love this teacher if you need an astronomy lab take him..cares about your grades and is a real nice guy :) 2 thumbs up :),1
"Awesome guy. Awesome teacher. I would go as far to say one of the best at Salem State. He's hard on grading and definitely gives you tough love, but his heart is in the right place. He wants to see his students actually take something away from the class. I hate 2.5 hour long classes, but this one was easily my favorite class so far.",1
Excellent Professor! I loved Professor Endlich. She is very understanding. Lets you turn in late assignments. She explains very well. Gives plenty of student examples to gather the concept of the assignment. Highly recommend!,1
"professor ferguson is a brilliant man, and he is well aware of it.  an arrogant guy but deservedly so.  learned more in two classes with him than i did from the rest of the faculty put together, squared. but make those essays worth 50% and just give a final.  20,000 words i gave you for 25% of 1.0 credits!!!",1
Sweetest prof. ever! Cares so much about her students. Take her if you can... she's the best.,1
"Beyond some very dry humor, Professor Davis is great in providing valuable feedback and keeping lectures very straightforward. Exams are based on practice problems, not looking to trick students. Group Projects are assigned throughout the semester. A paper as a final project giving you the freedom to pick your favorite topic.",1
She was very nice but did not explain the material that well. At least one person in our class would end up crying out of frustration. I would not take her again.,0
Well-organized syllabus & lectures.  Really knows  subject (Med Anthro) & challenges students to think critically about material.  Generous in pointing out areas where students could undertake further research. Communicates clear expectations re: exams and papers & gives very specific helpful feedback about student writing on same.  Excellent prof!,1
The best professor I've had yet. Very helpful and clear when questions were asked. She's flexible and provides students with many resources in order to pass the class.,1
He's my favorite professor and my role model; my goal while at Bradley is to learn as much as I possibly can from him. Expert at technical animation. Lots of wisdom to impart. I plan to take Independent Study with him multiple times. Talk to him outside of class! His teaching is slow but I don't mind. Very understanding with assignment due dates.,1
She tends to stomp on many students if she does not hear the answer that she wants to hear. She doesn't take in other peoples' opinion and expect everyone to agree with her.,0
"Dr. Bricker is the worse professor I've ever encountered. She has no respect for students, makes them feel dumb, and actually called our class of 120+ students ""stupid"" multiple times. She was the only teacher for this course, but if you can, DO NOT TAKE HER COURSE",0
"He is genuine and very passionate about his field. He is one of those professors that can keep the class interesting by relating topics to relevant issues. He is a tough grader, ask him if you have any questions but always answers his email. His main goal is to teach you the information but he does look out for your best interest. Would take again.",1
"Professor Cox is seriously the coolest professor ever and teaches such interesting course material. I recommend her classes to anybody. The work is all interesting and the lectures are actually engaging. Take her classes, any of them, it'll probably be your favorite that semester.",1
"Dr. K was fantastic, I very much enjoyed his class. He was very flexible and fair. I would recommend him to anyone! Great at explaining things so students at different skill sets could understand.",1
She is a very helpful teacher and takes the important points out from the book and puts them into notes which are very helpful. Reviews are about the same as the test so it helps alot..She teaches and you get alot out of her class..Great teacher!!!!,1
"Absolutely take Professor Stevenson if you have the opportunity to, she is amazing! Had her for lecture and lab and received A in both. Tells you exactly what to study for exams and what's on them. Holds her own review sessions outside class so attend those! She actually cares and wants you to learn. Is a very hard grader though, so know material.",1
"Vet Tech majors, beware. Dr. Woodard, while intelligent, has not a clue on how to teach. Consistently changes his mind about the material. Write down everything. He often veers off topic and rants about how students are not doing the work rather than teaching so that we can complete it. Will make you want to change majors. Just stick it out.",0
"An easy class to get your writing intensive requirement out of the way. Attendance is 20% of your grade and the classes are pretty boring if you're not a GEO major. Two big papers with four smaller ones in between. Try hard on them and follow the requirements, you'll get an A.",1
Thank god for Pam - I was terrified of research methods and she made it completely amazing!,1
"Her tests and quizzes are extremely hard. Even if you improve and try hard at the end, if you don't reach certain points, you won't pass. She's not student friendly, imo. There's no extra credit. She write/drew notes on board until the class end. This class need 100% attention or gg. Won't take her class ever again. Not a fun class.",0
"Jeff is an awesome guy, he makes the material interesting even when it is boring. He explains everything and is willing to help with any problems that you have. He is easy-going when it comes to handing in assignments, he will understand if you have to hand something in late. Definitly take him if you can!",1
This course needs to be revamped prof anikovsky needs to learn to teach stuff more throughly and test stuff that he actually taught us. literally buddy goes and tests on stuff he skipped in 10 min and is amazed that we did so bad. I am so happy to be done with this course.,0
"The guy is an absolute champ, who cant be stopped. I went to the Ryan wise school of bowling and I learned a bit but what I learned in battaglias class really upped my game to a whole new level.",1
"Sweet lady, gives out bonus opportunities, but tests are hard. Whenever she gives out the reviews, its hard to understand what she is asking for on the test. Overall, the class is good, but the first test made half the class drop. You must study a lot in order to pass her exams. Also, she mainly refers to the textbook, so read lots of that.",1
"Assignments are not specific. Whenever I ask her a question, her response is ""refer to the assignment."" Poor grammar that makes the assignments confusing. Posts assignments in modules that are not due that week. Would not recommend this teacher to anyone. I've taught myself more about communications than she's taught me. Teacher's Rate: 0",0
He doesnt have a good online class system.,1
"Dusseau is a great professor. There's a lot of homework online so don't miss it or you won't get an A. Also the class is very test heavy but don't worry because he curves. He usually gives all the iclicker questions so you'll naturally get a 10/10, so don't skip class. If you put in the effort this class is an easy A.",1
"Jim is a good person but a little confusing on the grading criteria. He is a great person to know with a TON of knowledge on many subjects. I highly recommend getting to know him outside of class because he can help you with resumes, write a letter of recommendation, and lead you in the right direction.",1
"Loved her!  Great instructor, funny too.  Not the easiest, but if you pay attention in class, follow the power points, and take notes, it's not so bad.  Study and it will pay off.  She is very fair and the tests aren't the easiest, but if you study and can critically think, there is no reason not to pass them!",1
Really kind! Respects and understand her students. Really wants to help and make students succeed. Also give reminders if there's an upcoming exam or something. Best teacher.,1
he's the best teacher ever!!!!!,1
"She can be a difficult grader but overall, this class was pretty easy to pass and still learn a lot. There is a lot of weekly work even though it is an online class so get ready to read and write a LOT more than you do in other classes. You also have to do a research paper which is more like a short 4 page informal paper than anything else.",1
She was really sociable. She joked with the students sometimes too. She was esy going.,1
"Lecture were extremely boring and tough to pay attention to. The tests were online and pretty difficult. It's possible to get an A, and I would take this class again. But it's not a fun one to get through.",0
Great class. Homeworks are doable. Tests are tough too but not impossible. Attendance is mandatory. (part of participation grade) The material itself is interesting and challenging. You can reach him by email and he'll email you back soon.,1
"Took honors intro to music with him, and he is a great professor. He just writes notes on the board, but he is very clear about his expectations and what to expect on the test. Read the text, go to class, and study even just a little and you'll be fine. He also offers extra credit and I ended up not having to take the final.",1
"Brilliant and fun professor! Took differential equations (MATH 215 I think) and notation & proof (MATH 325) way back in 2009; as a Ph.D student today, I still remember what he taught, and how amazingly well he taught :). Don't ever miss taking class with him, you'll learn well!",1
"She is an amazing professor. I was intimidated when I first started because I knew nothing, but she is so helpful and super nice. There are quite a few projects but if you work hard you will have plenty of time to get them done. If you apply yourself and come to class this class should be easy but you will learn a lot and enjoy it!",1
"Awesome teacher, enjoyed his lessons and his availability after and before class'",1
one of the best classes I've ever taken. Prof Allen is an excellent teacher and he makes the class extremely enjoyable and interesting...and he's cute too ;) the midterms are detail-oriented so you do have to study but the material isn't too hard and the amount is reasonable.,1
"Fun guy to talk to! Classes, you actually gotta study. Pop test every now and then and a lot of papers due!! Enjoy!",1
This class might be one of the worst I've taken at WashU. They are getting rid of this class and replacing it with a 500 level class which we have been told is supposed to be the same difficulty. About 50% of students dropped this class. The midterm was a failing average.,0
"Seriously an amazing professor! Yes, he is very lecture heavy so be prepared to take notes, but he makes it interesting!! He makes jokes and relates history to now. I really wish I could take him again! As long as you attend class and take notes to study you are completely fine!",1
Dr. Piland was the worst teacher I've ever had. He made things more difficult than they should have been. He changed his grading point scale multiple times and nobody could keep track of their actual grade. He doesn't answer questions clearly; he just tells you to look it up yourself. Avoid this teacher if you can!!!!,0
"He makes you go home and watch videos instead of lecturing. You have to write a reflection on each of these videos, and each are around 10 minutes long (some days you have more then one video). You have to do this everyday on top of the homework online. It makes the class very difficult.",0
"Second time taking a class with Dr. Chang and I must say it was just as pleasant as the last. As always, he was well prepared and taught the class with great clarity. His corny jokes kept us attentive and he was also very helpful during his office hours. He definitely knows his stuff.",1
An awesome professor to consider a course.,1
Boring long lectures. And not many opportunities for points.,0
"Goes by Noel, very great man. Could eat along with him easily, every class is lecture so I hope you're ready to pay attention. He is very knowledgeable especially about precolonial America. Over all good teacher.",1
Sara is by far one of my favorite professors at Iowa and is the reason I became interested (and got into) the school of social work. She truly cares that you enjoy and pass the class and will help you as much as she can if you don't understand something. I can't express how amazing she is,1
His grading is the worst.  He does not answer quistions.  He explains for himself.  Always make mistakes and then says you can fix it at home.  Too long exams where you cant do them on time.,0
Prof Nelson is a very sweet person. She does give lots of homework but its super easy to do and its to prepare you for the tests and lectures. Her class is very easy and towards the end of the semester she gives out lots of in class extra credit.,1
"Dr. Norris is a great professor that loves this course. Class itself is very dense with information, however as long as you record his lectures and study PowerPoint slides you will be okay. He emphasizes topics in class that will be on exams. Majority of grade relies on exams so make time to study!",1
Professor has a great sense of humor. Keeps the class very lively which was very helpful because of the late timing. His notes really helped me to navigate the course material and his test reviews were helpful and concise. I thoroughly enjoyed the class and would recommend his class to anyone who needs/wants to take BIO110,1
"Greg is a good guy! He gives you a chance to rewrite everything. His grading style is different - He doesn't give number grades, but rather leaves comments to improve your writing. He emphasizes learning rather than the student going after a certain grade. I would recommend him. I ended up with a 3.7 and the workload wasn't overwhelming at all.",1
"Good at explaining things and teaching. But can be extremely difficult to deal with. She can be rude and unnecessarily sarcastic and negative. She gives fair grades, not too tough, but while her comments can be good, some are unnecessarily harsh and given in a un kind way.",1
"Excellent prof., excellent class. She knows her stuff and gives great lectures. She also has a good sense of humor and is an easy grader, and isn't hard on you if you need to turn in your paper a day late. Only gives 3 quizzes and 4 papers (including the final), plus a presentation. I definitely recommend this class!",1
"Kristi is a great professor. She takes her time to help you, and if you follow her guidelines, and assignments she sets you up for success. I would highly recommend her to anyone. If you are looking to take any Communication classes, go with Wilkum!",1
"Studied extremely hard but didn't understand anything (as a chem e with a 4.0). In a normal class, I would've failed but got a B because of the huge curve. Brown's presence makes the whole NCSU chem dept look bad. He should not be a professor.",0
"I was so nervous about taking this class but Mr. Baumgartner helped ease the pain. He gives great resources and notes and provides direction for study material. Hands down, best professor I've ever had.",1
Talks too much and doesn't listen to what students have to say. He also tends to talk down to students and never gives a clear answer. His grading is straight forward. Expect multiple long emails per day.,0
I have returned to college after 30 years.  I found Simone Peters was very patient and explained problems thoroughly.,1
"Barger is very into his class. He tells you everything straight up though, and he's a pretty hard marker. Other than that he's an alright guy, you won't be bored but his material is a little odd for an English class.",1
If you're taking this class for a gen ed then don't take it because it is a lot of work and projects for a gen ed. It's an interesting class and I would recommend it because it's enjoyable but it's a lot more work than I expected.,1
"I learned a lot in this class and really enjoyed it.  I would recommend this class as long as you don't mind watching very powerful films that affect you deeply.  Some of the films were very hard to watch.  Other than that, it was a great class",1
"Professor Heilman does an excellent job engaging with her class through lectures, both asking and answering pertinent questions. She provided excellent lectures that kept students engaged and interested. Tests were fair and marking wasn't too harsh.",1
"Her teaching style is kind of weird and I think she struggled teaching a class that had never been offered before, so I can't speak to her efficacy in other courses. You absolutely need to read the assigned text, because she doesn't go very in-depth during her lectures. More like an overview. Overall, she isn't terrible and is pretty easy.",1
Very Good,1
She doesn't clearly explain the assignment and grades extremely harshly. My friend took the same course with another teacher and I have been helping her quite a bit. She has managed to ace the course. I have put in a lot of work into my assignments and her topics are extremely boring and there isn't much room for brainstorming.,0
he is great but really hard. I learned a lot from him.,1
"I LOVED Professor Goldiner's Soc class. He is so knowledgeable, and his lecture style gives you a really clear and relatable understanding on the subject. He provides study guides for exams and is very clear on the things you should know. The only thing I didn't like is that he doesn't post grades on canvas. Overall he is such an amazing professor!",1
"I took him for CEE 202 and it was awful. He isn't very helpful, and doesn't post his notes online. The online website we used (WileyPlus) was a hot mess. His tests were also really hard if you've never taken a probability course before. Overall, a very bad experience.",0
"Easiest class I have ever taken! There are only a few assignments, and 2 listening exams, but they are super easy if you study a little bit. You also have to attend 2 concerts as assignments, but they are ultimately an easy A+ and grade-booster. Take this class!!!",1
"Professor Mullen is kind, awesome, and inspiring. She made a difficult class easy as possible, but makes you work for your grade. She was eager to teach with an amazing attitude each class and always willing to help.",1
College Algebra. By far best math class I've ever taken. Don't be dumb and buy the textbook or the access code though. They have it in the library. We hardly used it.,1
"Dennis was probably the only teacher that gave us knowledge of the actual business of art. Not only does he know a lot about the profession of illustration, he brings humor to the classroom and puts you at ease. He rocked!!!",1
Ms. Robertson really cares for the success of her students. I feel that she kept us informed and prepared this course for a high level of critical thinking about social issues. I did e-mail her and she was prompt and very encouraging of my own success. She is another great professor that I would never had thought would be teaching at a community co,1
"Ericka is super nice and relatable. She's very real. The only downside to her class is not having a study guide, but she really knows all about voice. When it comes to fluency, study the powerpoints! She will bring in an expert too. EC is given through videos shown on the day of the test. 4 tests, 10 short assignments.",1
"Had him for Eating Ethics. He is so passionate about the topic, but he doesn't impose his views on you. In fact, the whole class you're not even sure what his view is. He introduces perspectives from all schools of thought and lets you draw your own conclusion. Exams are easy, final is optional, couple short papers, and a zillion extra credits.",1
"Good professor. I liked the subject & textbook for this class. Only one discussion post per week, but the mid-term was harder than I thought, thus the B, just missed it. Lots of reading, postings were easy!",1
There's a lot of required participation. She's empathetic to the textbook issue and provides alternatives if needed. She is a nice person who would often play podcasts for the class to listen and comment on.,1
"Yesterday (14-Feb-13), John Jay was on a Tuesday schedule. I rushed from work to get to class only to find a class cancellation notice on the door. No email, no phone call. Very disappointed that neither Professor Russo nor the Public Administration department communicated with students.",1
Super easy A+ as long as you study the main points she posted before tests,1
"I took her for micro in the winter (hybrid) and summer macro fully online. You have to get the txtbook for mindtap assignments, but it's free points so. People did better on the macro exams but because the median was high we actually got curved down but we got curved up with the same curve in micro. Just be aware that the curve can go both ways",1
"Has opportunities to do extra credit, and he is upbeat and funny. Gives excellent curves!",1
"Professor Knott is tough, but she genuinely cares about the success of her students. Take good notes and ask plenty of questions to clarify EXACTLY what she wants from you. She is more than willing to help students, but requires that students show great effort on their end as well. I developed a passion for writing by taking her class.",1
"I enjoyed Professor Mehmeti's class. He's a good teacher, and his lectures were engaging. My only complaint is that the language in some of the study guides and tests was unclear.",1
"Great teacher, but he talks softly so make sure you sit towards the front and youll be fine!",1
Travis is awesome so don't judge the class on the first two weeks of class. It gets better I promise. If you are a visual learner or can learn by example then his method of teaching will help you. He does lots of examples and helps with homework during class.,1
"She was very disorganized, and would come up with assignments at the last minute, but she explained things well, and by the end of the semester, I could understand her easily when she conducted the class in Spanish.  She would talk a lot about her life in Spain, but it added a really interesting cultural component.",1
"Professor Trower is a very kind professor who really cares about his student's success. He can be a little difficult to understand sometimes, but he tries to make things clear. He is not tech savy, don't expect tech help from him, its not his job anyway!",1
"FABULOUS instructor! My favorite one yet, take notes and you'll do fine on the test, they're straight from the notes. Extremely friendly and a great professor. His class helped me make up my mind about my major(I'd been going back and forth)and I changed it to Music Education. Best Professor at ODU!",1
"From my experience with Ken, people either love him or don't. He expects effort, and values you consulting him with your project before handing it in. He assigns a lot of work and sometimes it is  overwhelming, but he also asks for feedback about the size of the workloads and changes it up. He's a very decent guy who is good to have on your side.",1
"Great professor. Her lectures are very clear cut. She tells you what you need to know for the test and what is just ""FYI"". She is very funny and tries to relate what we learning to our level as young adults. She keeps you paying attention during her lecture and not in a bad way. No homework, except tests, which are easy if you know the material.",1
Take this class.,1
He coo,1
This is my second year in college and I have never been so excited to come to class! I wish she had more lecture classes I could attend. She is super helpful and full of energy. She was always ready to help her students and gave reminders on papers and exam dates.,1
"Just don't go to the lectures. You won't know what he is talking about. Read the powerpoints and maybe textbook by yourself. You could get a nice grade if you know when to use those formulas (don't need to know WHY the formulas could solve the problems). Anyway, don't go to the lectures to waster your time.",0
I really enjoyed interacting with this professor and learned a lot from her. She is not an easy grader and has no patience for smartphones in class. Just do your work and you'll be fine.,1
"Steve was a very clear grader, and tends to grade more on the student's side. He always answered my emails very quickly. This was intermediate algebra, which I was just taking this to fill out my degree (I've gone up to Calculus and was looking for a break), so I didn't think the work was that hard. I also took Steve for Calc I, and he was helpful.",1
"very bad teacher , no examples",0
"Dr. McDonald gives you everything you need to do well. He will meet you halfway. Put the work in and youll be fine. Be prepared to get called on though. Very scary in the beginning of the semester, but youll get used to it. Dont be embarrassed if you dont know the answer, he will guide you to the right answer or just skip to the next person",1
"Save your GPA, don't take Casimir. He's a nice guy and you can tell that he's very intelligent but he isn't a great teacher. You barely hear him when you sit up front and he explains terribly. His quizzes and homework are okay, and he goes over them but his tests are so hard! He always gives partial credit though. Just be safe, and don't take him!",0
This class sucks. don't take it. you will regret it.,0
Jeff Allen is a cool guy and it is a really easy class.,1
"I loved Erika! She is so funny and really seems to care about her lectures and her students. She made the long lectures easier to listen to. The tests were eh, and there are NO study guides so you really have to know the material to do good.",1
"He doesn't use much words, leave the thinking to students to ask questions. quizzes and hws r pretty straight forward. Final is hard. Notes help but just to get brief idea. Requires large amount of time to do well in this class.",1
This class is asynchronous during COVID-19. The lectures get a bit dry but I can tell Doug is a kind professor. He seems to be easily accessed (I just never have). The TA gets a bit confusing with deadlines and assignments. The class is 5 exams and theyre kinda hard. No extra credit this semester but I think he will give us a bit of a curve.,1
"He is a good guy but not the greatest professor. His lectures are very unclear and boring and it is very hard to understand him. He has a very strong accent. Although his class is easy and an easy A. Just go to class and you will pass the class. But be prepared to sit through long, boring and unclear lectures.",0
Class is interesting . I only missed one class. My attendance grade took a crazy hit all because my phone was on my desk. The TA Keely doesn't give the benefit of the doubt or hear you out. I did well on all four test and ended up getting a grade lower than all my test scores. Absolutely ridiculous how attendance is weighted like a test and faulty,1
"Dr. Mahlingappa is my favorite professor. She is really kind, she always listens to students, and is ready to help. Her classes were really engaging and interesting. She is also an amazing advisor!",1
"Do the assigned problems before the lectures, take notes, and create a thorough 1 page of notes for the tests. Jameson truly cares about his students understanding the material and succeeding. He has tons of energy in presenting the lectures and interacting with the class. He also gives extra credit opportunity and drops lowest test score.",1
"VERY strict, needs to lighten up on grading. He will not give partial credit for anything!  Even if you worked out the problem right but put it into your calculator wrong. Since he doesn?t give any homework, EACH test is worth 15-20% of your final grade with only 16-27 problems per test;  meaning those small stupid mistakes will cost you big time.",1
"If you want an A you have to live and breath French. Always push the limits of the language during class and with the tutor. Remember all those little finicky rules you dont think youll need (but you totally will). She want everyone to know the exact right way to use french, so remember the rules. Also, learn all the vocab before you useitinclass",1
"You will have homework due every day, but it is pretty easy and he usually gives most of the answers in class the day before. Goes over everything you need to know. The material is surprisingly easy if you pay attention. Tests are too long though. Most people run out of time. Too much reading and writing. Nice and funny guy though.",1
"I've already left a review, but I'm leaving another one because I STILL have not gotten a final grade posted for this class and it's almost Christmas. I can't even enjoy being on break because I keep checking to see if it's been posted yet. Seriously don't take this class unless you absolutely have to.",0
"Professor Bahr is awesome. He does lecture based classes and loves discussions. His exams are optional (can choose to do smaller easy projects instead.) He likes you to buy the book but honestly, you don't need it since he teaches from it and then never has you use it other wise. He's young and understanding of working students.",1
"Dr. Mike was by far one of the best profs I have had at umich. He is hilarious, helpful, and explains the material clearly. Additionally, he has a ton of the office hours in the help room which are really helpful and I recommend attending. I was dreading taking physics and Dr. Mike made the experience so much less treacherous and manageable.",1
"THIS PROFESSOR IS HORRIBLE. I STRUGGLE WITH ESSAYS AND  AS I TOOK HIS ENGLISH 21 CLASS, I FELT LIKE I DID NOT LEARN NOT ONE THING. YES, I PASSED HIS CLASS BUT IT WAS A STRUGGLE. I HAD TO DO MY OWN RESEARCH ON HOW TO DO A PAPER. EVERYTIME I ASKED HIM FOR HELP HE WOULD COME UP WITH SOMETHING TOTALLY OUT OF THE SUBJECT.",0
"Terrible professor. Only professor that offers the management specific courses, and they're all online. I wanted to take in person. I know what you're thinking, online is easier right? Absolutely not. He makes them so hard in that he grades everything so tough. TONS OF WORK. Then he gives exams that are so hard and cover 4 chapters at once.",0
Amazing!! Very helpful and informative. She cared if we passed her class and took the time to help each of us on a individual level if we requested it. I went to her office on a few occasions and she was more than willing to answer any questions I had for her!! Ask her about the ?tree pose? She will crack up laughing!!!,1
"Grading criteria is never clear. Susan has developed a bad attitude towards students and if she doesnt like you, you will know. You have to participate to get in her good books and even then, if your opinion is doesnt match hers she wont like you. She has no passion for the industry at all anymore.",0
"Super easy class, no homework because everything is in-class. All test questions are taken from the in-class problem sets, and you can get everything right if you check your answers with the TA before submitting it. Grissom uses lots of cat videos as a visual aid and everything is very easy to follow along to.",1
"2 Major essays, 2 minor essays, and a group project. He isn't always clear about what he wants on the papers but asking for his thoughts 2-3 days after the due dates is a great choice. All he wants is creativity and to develop your VERY OWN style of writing",1
"i can see how this would be a great class in person but online wasn't great. It's read from the textbook then do the quiz, no notes, no lectures, no pre-recorded lectures. not impressed by this course delivery for online because of covid.",0
"All you learn in this class is editing videos. You don't learn anything else about media. He is picky on how the videos need to be done. He does mot teach anything. You just film, edit, & present in class. He also has favorites. You make 6-8 vids throughout the semester. He thinks we will all become reporters ugh. If you cant use imovie, good luck.",0
"Not as bad as people make him out to be. He seems to genuinely want to help those who make an effort, and changed things based on class feedback several times.",1
I did not really understand her explanations during the lectures. Better off studying on your own.,0
"Terri was an amazing instructor. She answered my questions promptly and gave every student a chance to increase their grade with extra credit. Read the book, do the discussion questions (only 8, maximum of 100 words) and do your tests. You will pass! If this is your first internet class understand that it will move much faster than a normal setting",1
The best Professor I have ever had. Completely engaged and passionate about what she teaches. She is incredibly compassionate towards students and really makes an effort to make everybody feel comfortable. Offers many extra credit opportunities. Must complete 45 hours of counter work to pass course.,1
"If you do the reading, and a little in depth thinking applying concepts you'll be fine. ",1
"I really enjoyed her class. She's a younger professor, but she is very respected. She seems intimidating at first, but she is very nice and loves one-on-one time, so take advantage of her office hours. Attendance matters. She gives quizzes every class, so read your material and show up. She will mark up your paper, but she doesn't grade too tough.",1
"Really helpful professor, knows what she's talking about and how to explain things for those who are struggling. Make sure you complete the homework and take notes in class. The exams aren't too bad, just don't study at the last minute and you'll pass.",1
The lectures were great and he constantly made sure that everyone understood the material. No textbook is needed but you will need to pay for a program that provides access to the homework. Very easy to contact via email if having issues understanding the material or using the homework website. The study guides for each test are very thorough.,1
"Dont take if you care about your mental health and GPA. Run. I really dont know how people give him good ratings, they must only have time for his class. Worst professor ever, shouldnt teach GED classes.",0
"She is very liberal and will call you out in front of the whole class if you are conservative. Papers are very controversial. She makes you sit in alphabetical order and bringing materials is mandatory. Basically, you are repeating eighth grade. She makes you do peer review and it is not very helpful at all. I dislike her but it is an easy A.",0
"Alison is incredible. She is funny, caring, and one of the most amazing people I have ever met. She can help with anything from your resume to interview practice/skills. She knows what employers want to see and she will help you get it. She is a great and amazing friend so if you get a chance to be around her outside of school, do it.",1
"Not a professor i would want to take for Math 201. Very out of it and always did things that wouldn't help someone out as a teacher. She made a lot of problems harder then what they were. She would teach you different ways and you had to use those ways! Study Study Study if you haver her, tests are killer!",0
Great professor! The class itself is difficult but he provides you with a lot of extra materials that other professors dont. Very sweet guy and tries to crack a joke every once in a while.,1
"Professor Ivanov is great! Super easy class and gives a good introduction to music, his only flaw is his thick accent which can be hard to understand at times, but overall he is a great guy. He really cares about his students learning the material.",1
Wow! she is an amazing teacher. Extremely organized and very clear in her explanations. Lots of work but you will learn.,1
I have read a lot of comments on here for Professor Butman and I have to disagree with most of them. I like his class and understand they way he teaches. He expects yo to put your time in your work. He goes over exactly what he grades on in class and gives examples. He does try to help students during class but at the end you get what you earn.,1
"Dr. Hill does a fantastic job presenting material. If you dont understand, you can reach out to her and she will go above and beyond for you. She is eager to help you learn and truly enjoys teaching. She makes psychology fun. Youd be interested in a career in Psychology after taking her class if you werent already. She wants you to succeed!",1
"I absolutely love Professor Stevenson. She made learning anatomy and physiology extremely interesting, which is hard to do. She is always accessible outside of class and dedicates as much time as she can to helping her students achieve. She does reviews before the exams and if you go, she gives extra details about questions she will ask. Take her!",1
"This teacher is the worst one I've had in the Comm Department so far. Her practice tests online are super easy and then when you get the in class quiz, they are much harder. This course is only two credits and she makes it way harder than it should be. Impossible to get an A. ",0
"I don't recommend him, but unfortunately he's the only one who teaches this class. Rarely comes off as friendly, is quite intimidating, and refuses to answer assignment related questions 99.9% of the time. He also rounds the final grade down instead of up. Um, didn't we all learn the basic rules of rounding in 3rd grade?",0
"Great teacher. Work load isn't horrible, tests aren't too hard, and she's very very helpful. Tries her best to teach you Spanish. And she's cute. No, adorable. And hot.",1
"She is very knowledgeable and helpful regarding the material.  The problem is she is very inconsistent, and does not follow her syllabus regarding when assignments are due or when to expect an exams. She also loaded on a lot of work that was not in the syllabus near the end of the semester.",0
The best. She is so much fun and makes each assignment creative and interesting.. Not one boring class. Just hand in your essay's and show up. Easy A,1
His class is very difficult and was very frustrating. He assigns no homework or review. The only graded assignments are 4 essays and the final. You almost never receive feedback on assignments so it is impossible to know what you did wrong and how to improve at writing. Class started with 32 students. By finals only 7 showed up.,0
"Mr. Ball is the BEST math teacher EVER. He is funny, nice, and wants you to pass. He explains things so perfectly that it's hard to fail. Everyone should take him!",1
"Not a terrible class, but way harder compared to all the other COMM profs. Her lectures were stupid considering the homework readings went way more in depth - but she checks attendance. You'll do a lot of reading, only to take weekly quizzes that are worth just 10% of your grade. 1 solo presentation and 2 in groups. Rubrics are sometimes unclear.",1
"Only 1 final paper about 8-10 pages. 10 small assignment to lead you to your final paper. Those assignment were really helpful. She gives good feedback, and you will actually learn how to write a great paper.",1
"You will work in this class, but she is always clear and helpful. I felt like I became a stronger writer.",1
"I took the half-semester version, so I had a 3 hour lecture twice a week from him. He gave a good break and I never got tired of him. He is Romany so he has an accent but it's ok to understand 99% of the time. He loves students who participate and ask questions. His office hours are helpful and he will go over a paper with you no problem at all!",1
Very Hard to Understand. Had to teach myself everything. Tests weren't like the problems we learned to do. Do not take!,0
"Jan is an amazing professor. She has inspired me to become a college professor. Although her courses are difficult, she presents material clearly and is very fair in her grading. Study hard, take lots of notes and you will do well.",1
"She doesnt teach the material in class, instead she makes you watch videos at home at teach yourself. Videos have bad audio and do a poor job of teaching the material. Exams were long and difficult, good luck finishing them on time. If you use a different method than the one from the videos, she docks tons of points and accuses you of cheating.",0
more than just a great teacher..... a great person all around very caring and passionate about the hospitality industry,1
"Professor Ramamoorthy is not a very good teacher. His accent is very thick and hard to understand, he's very unclear about the assignments even when you clearly ask him, and it's hard to get anything done in his class. Lectures are boring and the labs are torture. He's an easy grader and gives out an extra 5% if you attend every lecture and lab.",0
"She is one of the sweetest Professors. Easy to talk to. Show up, do your essays, easy A!!! She gives you feedback and plenty of opportunities to fix your essays. I took her for ENC1101 & ENC1102 and passed both classes with an A.",1
Easily my favorite professor. He is funny and makes the lectures and material easier to understand and will help you along the way. Would highly recommend you take this professor.,1
"Professor Chidinma is very thorough , her 'A' does not come easy and you are unlikely to fail her class  if you show some seriousness.",1
Dr. Heilman is very knowledgeable in the subject and wants you to succeed. If you can not write fast I wouldnt recommend because she talks for the entirety of the course and does not post notes/slides. Office hours are very useful and gives great feedback if you go talk to her but not much written on the papers itself.,1
"Tony is the BEST professor I have ever had. He is so understanding with everyones situation. If you have issues with speaking in front of class for participation points, he has alternative options. Ask for an extension for the next night? He will give you a week. He is so accessible and so amazing and I wish all professors could be like him.",1
"GREAT TEACHER!! If you wish to pusue acting or just have an interest, take this class with her!! She will push you, hard! I enjoyed every class. There was not a boring day. If you enjoy being silly, dramatic, fun, or wanna break out! TAKE THIS CLASS. Nothing but good words for it. Attendance is deathly mandatory, but you woundn't want to miss it!",1
"I had high hopes for this class, but Maria is a really strange professor. She assigns papers that she ""sort of hates,"" and we can't figure her out. I desperately want to like her, but her abrasive attitude and how she treats anyone with a question like they're stupid is quite off-putting. Easy A; not-so-great professor.",0
"She is the best teacher in the world! She has her doctrine, SUPER SMART IN ALL SCIENCES. She will do anything to help you understand the material, very patient, and funny. She loves her subject! And I love her.",1
"she rambles a lot and has trouble sticking to the topic. she also kept pushing things back forcing us to cram writing two papers in the last month of classes. we had a week and a half for our final paper because she ""forgot"" to assign it. shes really tough grader too. lots of unnecessary stress I definitely don't recommend.",0
If you dont take him for PPS you must want to fail it.  He's the man and always willing to help.  I had him at 8AM and it didnt bother me.,1
Dr. Schmitz is incredibly helpful and knows what she is teaching. I highly recommend taking a class with her! I would definitely hope to get her as a professor again,1
SO sweet and caring. The nicest guy ever. Lectures can be boring but study guides are posted before the mid-term and test-just memorize it and you'll get an A. Often plays his cello and other instruments in class. Lots of listening and videos. As long as it looks like you tried on assignments you'll get full credit. FAVORITE CLASS I'VE TAKEN,1
Professor Oakley makes this class harder than it needed to be. She takes pride in how hard her tests were. Truthfully you have to study for hours to get a C/B. The one perk is that she does provide study guides and 3% extra credit for your total grade. No homework and group projects will balance out failing on tests.,1
she's when one of the nicest teachers i have had. She explains every topic very well. i am currently in my first year. Shes very sweet and caring. i would love to have her as a prof again,1
"Patti is one of my favorite teachers here. She's kind, helpful and very understanding. It's so easy to talk to her and I have had no problem asking for extensions on assignments. I would definitely take one of her classes again and recommend you take her class.",1
"So. Much. Homework. Each module had an insane amount of reading required to answer the THREE discussion posts per week. It was annoying because it wasn't worth the amount of work required, but also worth too much to skip it. On top of that, so many little assignments and huge papers. Doesn't give you a HW break on weeks of papers. No exams.",1
"I took him for both Higher plants and Wetlands. True, his exams are hard, but he provides you with all the information that is covered. Sometimes hes a bit spacey, but if you ask him for help he jumps at the chance to teach you more. Wonderful man and great teacher. If you are willing to work and get messy (field trips) you will like his classes.",1
"Great teacher, hard to understand. He knows what he talking about, but limited with his English. Still a great guy, i would have him again if possible.",1
He is the worst and does not care how hard he makes a 100 level class. I hate this guy with a passion.,0
"He is an incredibly sweet professor, his class seemed difficult at first, but he allows you to send in your drafts and will give you amazing feedback. With his essays, they were long but not really hard to complete.",1
"The class was the most organized . All modules were clear, we peer reviewed but it was for a GRADE!! and she explained things over and over again. She also curved the finals and added points to all questions that were not covered in class. The finals was long but it was all multiple choice. Do not listen to whiners. DO your work and STUDY!!!!",1
"Katselis tends to just copy straight from the ECE313 course notes when he lectures. Occasionally, he'll bring his own examples into the mix to try to help, but this class was still difficult for me. He is willing to do review days before exams if time permits. Probability and stats just aren't my thing and his teaching methods helped very little.",0
Dr. Mark was absolute hell to deal with. This courseload is beyond ridiculous and she is not understanding about you being in another classes that require your time. She does not respond to emails and if she does she is beyond rude to you and does not offer any help. There are major projects due each week. Her husband also attends every class.,0
"Probably one of the easiest classes Ive taken. You get discussion assignments per chapter, along with quizzes per chapter. Quizzes are straight forward. We had 2 groups projects, 2 major exams worth 100pts each, again pretty easy and straightforward. She gives feedback on assignments which is great because it allows you to correct any mistakes.",1
Terri is a very nice lady however this semester I did was not a fan of flipping the classroom teaching method. I had to drop after talking to my counselors. in Will try taking Into to Psych in the spring.,0
"Love love love this class, makes me think about who I want to be as an artist and Jeri is just so great at helping you achieve that goal! Can't wait to have her for future classes. Love her! ",1
"Great professor. About 8-9 homeworks. You get 3 tries, though. Takes attendance. One midterm and one group project. DON'T CHEAT, YOU WILL GET 0. Ask questions in classes, he will answer!",1
"She is one of the best prof at FIU. They should really hire more professionals like her. She knows the material and likes to answer questions. The class was really interesting. 3 exams, which are not that hard, you get a review for it. There are 4 group assignments, if you have a good group, you should do well. Attendance is mandatory",1
"Class on policies in Canada, if you know a lot about social policies and social issues in Canada it's quite easy and rather interesting to just listen to. Tests are made to be tricky because it's multiple choice but if you do process of elimination based on what you've learned, you should have little problems. Quiz questions given beforehand.",1
Funny and sweet! No books required (although she said she was in process of writing her own book for her class). Her class has been one of my favorites. I definitely recommend.,1
"Amazing professor. Her homework and class work is harder than the actual tests. She gave 4 tests and a chance for extra credit. The homework usually took me like an hour or so but definitely do it. I learned a lot from her. She doesn't ask trick questions, tests are straightforward. The final was the easiest test out of all the tests.",1
I love this professor! Programming was very tough but he made it better. I made a 75 on his midterm but improved on the final exam with a 90 because I studied better. I made an A in the class but that was with a lot of hard work. He was very good at returning e-mails and answering any questions that students didn't understand. Please take him.,1
"Her class is a bit boring for the 2 hour and 45 minute TOSS class, but she really does care and she yearns for her students to be interested in what she has to say. The course load is pretty minimal compared to other TOSS classes, and the textbook readings are short and sweet. All that she goes over is relevant and useful.",1
"By far the sweetest woman I've met here, absolutely love her class",1
"Great Professor overall, would recommend him to anyone. Very inclined to help students outside of class.",1
this teacher is very knowledgeable and real. She has opened new endeavors that challenge me and how will I handle my career. She as taught me to be myself and grow with life.,1
"Took this course summer 17'. All we had to worry about was reading our required chapters for the pop quizzes she would hand in class. For tests, she would let us use notes. The final paper was 6 case briefings, which were really easy to do. Her lectures were interesting. She was an awesome professor. Do what you have to do and you will pass.",1
"Dr. Sankara was always super friendly and engaging. He has a good sense of humor and I learned a lot about pronounciation, vocab, and phrasing. The work isn't difficult, but there is a fair amount of homework/writing assignments. It's REALLY necessary to come to class, I would have gotten an A instead of a B if I hadn't missed so much...",1
"i absolutely adore professor ferguson. i had her my freshman year and every semester i tried to take her again but there were always conflicts �� super interesting subject matter, and she is really nice and understanding. keep up with the work and this class will be easy but if you fall behind on reading it can be hard. also she brought her dog.",1
"Great instructor, really know his stuff. He explains everything detailed. A really great lecturer. Only flaw, miss class, miss a lot. If you attend class you should be fine. He covers a lot of material in one class. Great instructor, one of my favories, wish I could take his class again.",1
Caring. Helpful. Friendly. Easy grader. Gives multiple practice sets that pretty much is the actual exam. Holds extra review sessions on Sundays before Monday exams.,1
"Rick is a great professor that truly cares about the students. Banking can be a boring topic, but Rick totally loves it. He is there for you if you have any questions and can usually be easily reached. Great Guy.",1
"Great professor! Clear and straightforward with assignments. Actually has thought-provoking, in-depth discussion questions compared to many other online family studies classes. I'd definitely recommend taking a course from her!",1
"Peter really cares about his students. Extremely easy to talk to, never makes you feel stupid for asking questions. Office hours are extremely helpful for clearing up concepts. Fair grader.",1
"I hated this class. She talks about nothing! She is more interested in elephants and cheetahs then she is about anything else. She rambles and goes off topic so much its really hard to stay on track. She also likes to say, ""well we'll cover that in a later chapter."" instead of staying in the chapter we're on. Be prepared to study hard!",0
Kelm really doesn't care if you pass or not all of his lectures are done through online videos and he does not teach in class. He simply goes over questions that students have. He assigns a ton of homework so I recommend only taking him if this class is your main focus.,0
Papa George will change your life. He is by far the best teacher I have ever had in my whole life.  I have never been good at math until I had him as teacher. Everyone in my class looked forward to coming because of how much we were inspired by him. He is Hilarious and you will learn so much more then just math! TAKE HIM! You will have no regrets!,1
"He doesn't explain what to do for projects clearly so you might miss up on some. He doesn't stick with the syllabus. The experience was weird to me, I ended up passing with a C.",1
Ms. Bekka Trapp Is my English 101 professor at MCCC and I do enjoy going to hear classes even though I feel like I am not a good paper writer she is gives us a chance to revise a bad paper to get a better grade. Her class load feels like a lot less than when I took English 101 and withdrew from it.,1
"Make sure you follow every single one of her directions when writing a paper. If you forget to even number pages, she counts off even if the material is spot on. I feel like she would have served the class better by recording lectures and assigning reading but it was all reading. The feedback came too late.",1
"a genius at thermo, not as good at fluids though. He will be one of the hardest professors you'll ever have. Quite a funny guy and pretty chill. You can literally text him about homework problems. Its very likely to mess up at least one of his midterms in the course. But he curves a lot, so an A is not impossible if you review all the homework",1
Took History of Baseball.. he was so easy and wicked nice. Definitely take this class. Attendance isn't mandatory but there are days you definitely should show up and take a few notes to help with the homework. Awesome guy.,1
"Attendance is mandatory. He is hard to follow in class. If you don't have any prior knowledge of accounting you will be very confused. Do not take it if you want to actually learn accounting, because you won't. It is easy to pass without knowing anything. He knows what he talking about but doesn't know how to teach it & don't bother asking question",0
"He's a good professor. Gives a lot of extra credit for students who are struggling in class. The exams can be tough so the extra credit really helps out. He is a cool professor, really makes the class interesting. His lectures are long and can be boring but he tries to make them as interesting as possible. ",1
Flannery is a great professor. He is very young and I assume this year is his first year teaching but you wouldn't know it by how well he constructs his lectures. He can be a little over the top at times with his silliness but it makes a boring class easier to understand and more interesting. He is great at answering questions if you ever get lost.,1
"Professor Rohan is an experienced, caring and skilled lecturer. He makes such a difficult subject like Statistics easy to understand. He is dedicated to students and is always available to answer questions and clarify doubts. I enjoyed my classes with him and I would highly recommend statistics 2023 to anyone.",1
"only one thing to say: a final exam, in college, consisting of 11 fill in the blank questions??????? you decide.",0
"African-Americans in film ... don't take this class. most of the time we get out early, but class discussions are 5 minutes long and mostly consist of him saying the same things about one movie as the previous one. The book is good. won't learn much. harsh paper grader",0
"Teacher goes through the section, is pretty organized, and keeps grades posted. Is a little bit confusing as trys and adds extra information that is not needed, but is a pretty good teacher!",1
"She is truly invested in making he students succeed! I highly recommend her. She's kind, intelligent, and will help you when you need help! She uses power points that are helpful! She makes Chemistry fun! I enjoyed Chem 130 with her and plan on taking Chem 151 with her!",1
"Mr. Wildman is by far the BEST math instructor I have ever encountered. He is  incredibly funny, sings math songs, celebrates pi day with real pie, and brings donuts to class. I take a long time to understand new math concepts but Wildman makes it a breeze. He is very friendly and accessible outside of class. Would DEFINITELY take him again.",1
"His tests are based on lectures, and he'll explicitly tell you what questions are going to be on the tests and in what form (essay mc etc). Write down everything don't just look at the slides. He explains SO well and is so knowledgeable. Just be sure to take handwritten notes and do the study guides. He writes his own tests so they're not tricky!",1
Absolutely loved Dr. Wisner! I've been out of school for 20 years and this class was an easy A. Just read and follow instructions for all assignments and you will do fine. Only complaint was feedback was not given in real time which would have been helpful for future assignments but would definitely take him again for 1102 if I get the chance!,1
"Never disagreed more with an art teacher's teaching style. I've had art teachers in the past that simply irk me because their strict guidelines disallowed students from truly expressing themselves through their projects, but Besemer completely discouraged me from wanting to complete her assignments bc of how particular she was abt the outcomes.",0
"He understands that math is not everyone's thing and makes the effort to answer any questions you may have before, during, and after class. He gives great organized lectures and tells you exactly what's going to be covered on exams. (Also, really funny)",1
I have very few good things to say to her besides the fact that she is nice. Her teaching is reading off a PowerPoint and her tests ask the most obscure and irrelevant questions that are not important Big picture questions. When half the class was struggling through with the pandemic she just said suck it up and would not offer much help.,0
"I had a mixed experience with Prof Rubin. The labs are clear cut and easy to do, but the final exam was a mess. There's no real study prep and questions were given that we did NOT cover. She is very dated and gives advice no longer relevant. Avoid this prof, and if you get stuck w/her, be sure to do an HONEST AND DETAILED evaluation.",0
"Dr. Trubatch's lectures could use better structuring as it is sometimes hard to discern just what he is doing up on the board. It  feels  extemporaneous. This causes some confusion. However, he knows his material deeply, is extremely helpful, and a truly nice guy to boot. Read the book. Do the homework. Study for the test, and cut the guy a break. ",1
"Participation will win you serious brownie points with her, and you'll need them, she assigns a ton of out-of-class tests/quizzes that are easy to forget about (she let me retake them for full credit). Won't give you fluffy feedback for stupid answers in class. A relatively easy A if you participate and keep track of the Blackboard assignments.",1
"Val in one word is amazing. The class is quite easy as long as you volunteer for the exercises and make an effort. Show that you care and you'll do great. She gives great criticism in a positive way. Best THR class i've taken so far. I would highly recommend this class for a DEC D. Class requires 2 shows, 1 essay & memorization of a short script.",1
"Dewey's not the best COMS teacher. He doesn't answer emails at a timely matter. He also doesn't post grades on blackboard. He evaluates every speech but never passes back what you got so you can't really improve on anything since you don't know where to improve. Also, he did say that there will be reading quizzes but won't tell you when they are.",0
"Find another professor. Shes vary vague when answering emails whe she answers them. All test are closed book. Instructions are sometimes hard to understand. If you can, take another professor. She complains about the number of emails sent to her and seems to get irritated.",0
"He's super chill & nice but tends to explain things in a way thats rly roundabout and can be a bit confusing/boring, but if you ask him questions he will explain happily. he encourages group work and the practice tests are almost exactly like the exams so thats rly nice. also he was really accommodating when i had to take a test late bc i was sick",1
A really really nice prof. Interesting classes. Good knowledge of the course. Speak English with accent but clear to understand. Feelless nervous in her Language class. Very understanding and helpful. Flexible with due dates if u have reasonable excuses:P,1
Alex is an amazing prof! Entertaining lectures combined with interesting readings. I highly recommend taking a course with him!,1
"Her teaching style is for you to learn the material yourself, on your own. She is very disorganized. She drops tons of paperwork on you at the last minute. This semester, over half her class is failing the department wide tests. A ticket to her class is a ticket to failure. Go with another prof; don't waste your time with her.",0
"Professor Layoun is one of those people you either hate or love. There really is no in between. I agree with the other student who called her lectures ""thought provoking"". Interestin indeed.",1
Dr. H is hilarious! I really enjoyed attending her class. The books that she assigns are actually pretty interesting. She also assigns textbook reading but the tests focus on her lectures and the assigned books. Most of the test is from lectures and in class materials so make sure you pay attention and be ready for essays on test day.,1
"I felt like he covered the material well. I had him the first semester going back after COVID so we didnt get to do many activities which he said he enjoyed and when we did they really helped. The quizzes and exams covered the material well, although there were 6 exams. There were several assignments but I feel like they helped me a lot.",1
"She's very knowledgeable, but somewhere across her career shes saw $ signs instead of actually teaching. She's the head of pace's bsn program, adjunct at Columbia, works at a law firm, works here and there, she does short cuts with her kaltora videos. She doesn't teach, its reflections on rotations, if she gets paid thats all she cares about",0
Good information learned from the class. Make sure you show up to class.,1
Jenn is a real gem! Had her for diff eq and I hate math usually. Her study guides have everything you need for her exams and the homework helps. She gives extra credit on exams which is great. Always happy to help and office hours are always open pretty much. Just make sure you study her guides and ask her if you're stuck on anything.,1
Dr. Strait is one of the best professors I've ever had. He has the best stories and never ending knowledge of music. He is dedicated to the success of his students.,1
"If you do the HW and understand it the exams shall be straight forward. She eve gives a list practice book  problems, which DO come out on the exam. Very willing to work one on one.  Attendance isn't required but she does work out problems step by step that are in HW/Quiz/Exam then some days you get a problem you try on your own for points. ",1
One of the best Accounting professors at CSU. Reasonable amount of homework & challenging but fair exams. Highly recommend.,1
"Wasn't as easy as I expected. The most challenging thing about his course is that he has been recycling material for over a decade now. The lectures, homework's, and projects are vague. At times he can be very rude, and at times he can be helpful. Be sure not to put off the projects until finals week. No late penalty for submitting late homework.",0
"Not a fan of professor Sikora whatsoever, terrible lecturer, not easily accessible, taught myself the whole course the textbook. However, his tests are a joke so I guess that helps.",0
He's a nice guy but doesn't teach. Just hands out packets during class so you basically have to teach yourself the material.,0
"He is a solid professor, it's just the material is boring.",1
I was really scared about this class but Erika was incredible. She makes sure that you are comfortable and prepared for your speeches and your final exam. She is available right after class and during her office hours and never makes you feel like your bothering her! She is super willing to work with you!!,1
At first I was like OMG what did i get myself into. I thought he was a really nice guy. Gives work but he is really helpful if he sees you are trying. He tends to ramble off and loves to listen to himself talk.,1
Very funny professor! He explained the basics of economics very well. This class made me consider a degree change!,1
"I am not even done with the course; however, ""hear me roar"". As a professor who teaches an online course, you would expect one to be more involved, detailed etc... She isn't. It's a good class, informational, & good discussions, but at the end you ask yourself: Where's the teacher? If you email her (a good long email) expect a 3 sentence response.",0
"very good strings teacher, but knowledgeable in nearly all music fields",1
"She is nice, approachable and teaches very well. I would recommend her for chem 111. She gives a lot of extra credits and if you go to class and take note form the lecture then you should be OK during exams.",1
To pass this class you have to be willing to put in the work. Professor Wood wrote a lot of notes ALL of which help you get through the semester. I looked back at the notes while doing on-line quizzes and it was very helpful. She was good at responding to emails and would spend extra with you if you need it. She is very intelligent and helpful,1
"I love this class. Prof Stone is such a nice guy who is always willin to give you another shot at something. His tests are pretty ""off the wall"" as said before but i disagree, if you study the studyguide youll do ok, he really wants opinion.  Def take him for this class!",1
Tough but you learn learn learn!!!,1
"Love Mrs. Gentry and her kinesiology 1301 class. Definitely not an ""easy A"". Although she provides online slides of each chapter and topic, you still need to read the book to pass exams. Some exams will be in class and some online if she had other engagements. The assignments are fun. She gives lots of opps for extra credit. if you fail it on you",1
"A very fair and knowledgeable professor. Mainly a discussion based class, but people aren't forced to participate if they don't want to, although it helps with participation grades. I do feel like I learn a lot in the class, and he's a really nice person. Lots of reading though, mainly reading based. There are writing assignments but not a ton.",1
"She was a great professor! She knew that we didn't really care about the complicated stuff so she broke everything down, making it super easy to understand. You must study to get an A but it is not hard. no textbook required as she teaches from power points. She really cares about her students' success. Would recommend for any student!",1
"Albert Cervantes is a joke of a professor. Late to class, sometimes doesn't bother to show up, doesn't grade anything til last minute, gives less points for everything, and overall just a mess. Office hour is non existent as only his assistant are here to help. Probably busy with his other job but that is not a excuse to have poor teaching/ethics",0
"5wk summer course. I highly recommend taking this class if you are looking for a simple class. It was one discussion post every week, 1 response to a classmate, 1 journal every week, and 1 quiz every week. For the quizzes, i wrote down page numbers next to bold headings and got all A's without reading chapters. Legit strategy! klatzke was great!",1
"there are a lot of assignments but if you do the work correctly, youll get 100%",1
Awesome teacher!! Took her for all comps & world lit!! ,1
"I took her class through teco, so we met 3 times for the speeches and the rest of the homework online. She's really sweet and will answer any questions. I like how she gets everyone involved (less anxiety). Overall i would recommend her, she's a sweet women.",1
Hardest class ever. The tests and group work were almost impossible. The amount he had to curve this class was absolutely ridiculous. He curved some tests by 4 letter grades and curved the entire class by a letter grade and a half.,0
Mr. Randolph was extremely knowledgeable and helped us understand the content. He's reasonable but doesn't like you to not pay attention or be on your phones-typical professor. You'll enjoy his class.,1
I LOVE THIS PROF! She really is AMAZING. She explained things clearly and when they were unclear she took the time to sit down and explain it until it made sense. She is the best professor in the chemistry department in my opinion.,1
"Brother Daniel is awesome! He is very knowledgeable and passionate about what he teaches, and it really rubs off on his students. He gives fair tests and assignments and is willing to help his students however he can. All around great person and awesome professor. Be ready to participate in discussions, they are a big part of his class.",1
"amazing teacher, really passionate about the subject and makes you think way past the text. sometimes reading could get boring but it wasn't always necessary to read. discussions were usually really interesting. not as hard of a grader as i thought he would be. definitely take this class if you're even remotely interested!",1
"I really enjoyed the class discussions and it it seemed that as long as you show up, participate, and do the work you will probably get an A.  There was a substantial amount of reading, which can be a bit much if you have other classes with heavy reading.  Overall she is lovely, knows her field, and makes class fun.",1
If you aren't interested in History do not take this course. Too much reading to do especially if you have more important classes to worry about. You basically teach yourself which sucks because for exams she says herself that she's a tough grader. The review sheets are difficult to complete and memorize for the exams. Impossible course. AVOOOIIDD!,0
I took this as a general art class. let me just say that if you are not an art/ history major do not bother taking this course. Her lectures are a bit dry. The exams are challenging(unless you love writing papers). Again unless your an art major do not bother taking this class. it will just add to your stress,0
"I started at URI in 2002 and registered for this class every semester and dropped it until Fall 2004.  First assignment I hand wrote and when I turned it in she said ""No, type, type, type."" Instead of being scared off I stuck with it. She always  wasavailable. Dr. Ferguson gave me the firmness I needed. Currently finishing my Doctorate! Thank you.",1
fav prof ever,1
"It's unfortunate that Paul is the instructor for two required courses for the minor. The amount of work he gives is ridiculously unreflective of how much is actually required to make the course effective. 2 midterms, 9 graded responses, 3 essays, 1 term paper, 1 cumulative final exam. That's like 2 courses in one. Please learn how to balance Paul. ",1
"He is a super cool professor, and loves teaching Intro to Cinema. This class is an easy A. He does everything he can to help you pass with a tremendous amount of extra credit. I would highly recommend this class. ",1
I took her class online and I enjoyed it. It requires a lot of work like essays and blog posts but she is lenient on her grading. She was always nice/helpful when I emailed her. If you put in the work to meet the deadlines and do your best the class is an easy A or B and she will help you if you ask her for it. Do not slack off/put in low effort.,1
Confusing professor who is never available during her posted office hours. Will belittle you when you ask for help outside of class. Out of 24 students she sent emails to 19 suggesting they see the calculus tutor instead of asking her for help. Very confusing way of grading exams with no partial credit. Do yourself a favor and skip this professor!,0
He ipu ka'eo. It's been over 10 years since I've taken his classes and a lot of people are surprised at my pronunciation. They say the way I speak sounds similar to the older generation.,1
Sandy is a nice person but a bad professor. She simplifies everything to a level that makes you feel like a child. She takes points off for not showing intermediate steps that are already implied within the formulas that are used. She also gets mad and takes points off of test and quizzes if you use different methods even if the answer is right,0
"Mr. S. is one of the best instructors I've had during my 3 years at SLU. His lectures are clear and easy to follow.  Quizzes are easy if you've done the reading. Exams are reasonable and there are great study guides. You can tell he's excited about the material. Overall, a fun class!",1
"She is extremely ignorant of special education  and grades as such. The strategy presentations are entirely Gen Ed and if you adapt for SPED, you get graded down.  Couldn't stand how fake she was.  I sat there entirely tuned out b/c she obviously didn't want to be there, nor did we.  Don't take her!",0
"Absolutely wonderful professor. I learned the most from her in one sememster then i have from the other professors i took italian with, (and i took 3). She taught from the heart and really cared about her students and genuinely enjoyed teaching!",1
"Konen is awesome. I thought taking a class on soil would be not my fit, but I loved it. He is a good guy and he truly is there for you. I wish I could have gone to his office hours more. Great guy great teacher fun class. ",1
"TAKE THE 8 WEEK!! Usually 8 weeks are more difficult, and looking at her syllabus it would seem like it, but NOT AT ALL! The 4 essays are so easy, and she is an EASSYYY grader and gives feedback to resubmit to better each grade on every paper. You use the textbook, but it's not used for papers. Also the book is super cheap $30?!? AND NO FINAL EXAM!",1
"Great professor! She is clear on what she expects, and if you do the work you are golden. If you fail this class, you are lazy and careless.",1
"Mr. Susott is an excellent teacher. He relates well, and keeps things interesting. If you are looking for a history class where you are going to talk about battles, stratagies and generals, this is not for you. You will learn something, and it will change the way you look at history. Take this class",1
No Comments,1
a lot of homework ,0
"Serpell is a kind and thoughtful mentor. She welcomes student input to her classes, and she's really responsive and helpful in office hours. I really loved taking classes with her because I feel like she really values our ideas. Would recommend; it's a not an easy A, but totally achievable if you are willing to do the work, and you learn a lot!",1
Terri was one of the best profs I've had at Westfield. She really cares about the students and is very available to talk outside of class. Her grading is very fair if you do the work and Terri is very understanding if something comes up. Would recommend and would take again!,1
"If your a sensitive person he will offend you let me start with that, but if your a fun outgoing person who can take some criticism and jokes take shawns class, he cares so much about his students and really wants to see everyone succeed, he can be borderline mean but he has the right intentions, to bring out the best in you. Also SO FUNNY",1
tests vary from easy to hard..notes come from slideshows,1
Procurement Law (PROC 5810) taken with this professor. This is a tough but useful class. Very informative. Professor has good understanding of subject and explains it well. Very good class overall. Would recommend.,1
"Morra is passionate about the topics he covers and wants students to succeed. There are three essays that students are graded on and as long as you take notes, its an easy A. He makes learning fun and of all my professors, he is easily my favorite since he made me actually want to go to class each week. TAKE HIM!!!!",1
"He was so bad I had to drop his class. Grades quizzes and exams only, assigns homework, but wont grade it so it cant help offset a bad exam. He is nice, but his lectures are confusing to the point it looks like he has never taught. I talked to ex-peers and they all told me he is pretty bad and were at major risk for not passing.",0
"He's very nice. The course load may seem high as the class is mostly graded on doing observations at a school of your choice, but overall it was very insightful observing real life teaching and getting information from him as well. There's three exams and he gives out a study guide. There are also assignments connected with the observations.",1
"Class is very unorganized to the point where self-researching the quiz/test topics is where I actually learned anything. Tons of topics that are tested on and required to know yet only briefly mentioned in class, so studying for tests became looking up all the given 'key terms' on wikipedia. Lectures skip around and make no cohesive sense.",0
"The course itself was easy and interesting, but the prof made it difficult as some of the material discussed would be completely different from the quizzes.  I enjoyed the class but not the prof who taught it.",0
Kept things interesting as much as possible.  A lot of reading and pretty boring reading at that.  Reading the textbook is a must.,1
"You will never fall asleep in Graham's lectures. He keeps them very interesting and rarely goes on tangents. The course work was difficult as expected, but whatever you do, do not get behind on homework. All in all a great professor who loves what he does, answering questions, and has a deep understanding of math.",1
"Attend his study sessions and ask questions. His classes are easy if you use his help, don't rely on the text book to learn especially in pchem, his lectures are more useful.",1
"I truly enjoyed Dr. Ortegas class. Not only did I learn a lot, but I was also inspired by his passion for what he teaches. If you want to learn and enjoy a biology course, then take Dr. Ortega! Make sure you go to class as well!! Tests come straight from lectures and powerpoints.",1
Schubert's Math 5A class was difficult. He expects you to know everything that he's teaching already. He works on problems on the board and basically solves it & talks to himself and asks the class if what he was doing was right and that's basically the whole lecture. He doesn't teach you how to solve the problem or say why he's solving it that way,0
Dr. Guerrio is such a sweet Lady! Our class was combined so most days were online and some were in class. She provided real world examples and gave very clear lectures above what I was expected online and in person. Very easy and gives extra credit! Do the work and you'll do great!,1
"If you aspire to be a poet (do they even exist anymore?), or would like to experience what it feels like to learn English inside prison walls, then this is the adjunct warden for you. GOOD LUCK!",0
"very smart prof & interesting lectures that basically talk about the reading assigned the night before to help you understand exactly how it relates to class. weekly 1pg writing not very hard, papers suck but not impossible. no text book just had small books to read for each unit.. great class over all highly recommended :)",1
"The BEST hands down!! Take her class, don't take anyone else, unless her class is full, better yet, wait for her class to be open. She is great & a breeze!!!! Take this online if you can. She is amazing! Easy A",1
"Material can be difficult if you weren't paying attention during your ACCT classes. Many students weren't prepared with sufficient ACCT knowledge, and as such suffered. Group project, one paper, and a lot of online homework. Online platform wasn't too helpful, and very tedious, not very helpful for passing the course.",1
"Dr. Miller was an easy A, but his class can be very boring. He tends to go off topic a lot, almost every week we would have a class discussion about President Trump even though it didn't have to do with the class. We watched two movies and some videos. One presentation on anything you want, and a 1 page final paper about the class. Easy A.",1
"I took professor Jassen for Cell Bio as well as A&P 1 and 2. Let me start off by saying that she is very nice and always open to talk if and when you need to. As for her teaching style, I found her extremely hard to follow. I put in a lot of effort but unfortunately it did not show with my grades.",1
"Lisa Jo's experience in mediation means she has lots of great stories and an ironclad understanding of how this is applied in environmental issues. This course is especially reliant on classroom participation since, well, you need to practice mediating. It's not easy, but Lisa Jo creates a positive, constructive setting to learn in. Recommended!",1
Dr. Meyer genuinely cares for his students and makes it clear and easy for students to pass! He let's you know exactly what he expects of you as a student. His lectures are engaging and beneficial for anyone going into counseling. I also had him for CSG421. Both classes were taught the same way. He is also flexible on deadlines and over-skipping.,1
"She is literally one of the best Biology professors at Ryerson. So caring, approaching and friendly. Loved her lectures, learned a lot and she really brightened up this pandemic semester.",1
"You have to read the book and there are map quizzes every class, but he gave us good study guides for the tests. If you read the chapters and take the time to do the study questions you will pass his class.",1
"Mr. Eisenberg is really helpful! Like he doesn't try to trick you. If you show up to class take notes and do the homework and study like a normal class you will do great. If you need extra help he is available, zoom, in-person, over email, office hours, and that is something I really liked. Tests are fill in the blank, but not too hard.",1
"Super easy class, I missed a couple of quizzes/assignments and still got an A because of all the extra credit offered. Discussions are interesting most of the time. Book used for weekly quizzes.",1
"she is a friendly woman.First English teacher since my junior year of highschool who ACTUAKLLY taught how to WRITE AN ESSAY. As far as grading goes, hand in you rough drafts everytime. you will save yourself a lot of stress when you get your grade. pay attention and participate and she will see the effort you are putting in. overall great teacher",1
"worst professor, giving thousands of homework and expect you to finish it in less than a week. her precal 165 is the worst class to take online, please run, do not take her online",0
A very nice teacher!!,1
DO NOT TAKE DR AYADI! She is a horrible professor who has no interest in her students.  quizzes come from powerpoint and book. there are 3 group projects that she wont elaborate on. I would suggest you have a study buddy for this class. Good luck!,0
Terrible. Heavy accent. Unorganized. ,0
I took this class as a distance learning course from Armwood.  The professor never replied to any form of communication and was not at all understanding when I was unable to upload videos of my speeches due to internet restrictions at school and deadlines conflicting with mandatory afterschool activities.,0
Ms.P was the coolest teacher I've had so far. Very detailed and makes you think outside of the box. This was a great class and if you take her you will be glad you did.,1
Angie Kolen is the reason I was excited to wake up for my 10:15 chemistry class.. just because her human kinetics class came right after it ended! She is son inspirational and her lectures are never boring .,1
"He's a good guy, but not my favorite professor. He makes attendance worth a test grade (plus some extra) which is nice if you go to every class, but his lectures aren't very helpful. I and most of the people I know in this class only learned from the book. So definitely buy the book.",0
"Absolutely my fav professor! He is such a funny, genuine, and great professor! Also gives great lectures!",1
"Avoid this course. -The exams aren't limited to the learning objectives. What's the point of the learning objectives is, if not to focus studying? -Exams focus more on memorization than on conceptual understanding. -The textbook is custom, with chapters from different books. This sucks if a chapter refers to a page we don't have access to.",0
The worst teacher i have studied with. His grading is ridiculous even the lecture is so easy (since it is a basic class). I would never take his class again,0
"very good teacher, but she makes you read a lot and do a lot of quizzes.",1
Professor Kendall is a really nice guy and a great teacher. I'm not sure what others are ranting on about? If anything he is too easy... If he spoke any slower or dumbed down the materail any more they would have to make a special hooked on phonics for AutoCad. Just go to class take notes and you should be able to complete homework in class.,1
tough teach and lots of work but she made me realize how much i love math again which is something i could tell she appreciated... if you put in the effort shes an excellent teacher but if you don't care you're screwed,1
Literally the easiest class I've ever taken. She's amazing. If you don't end up with a A after taking her...... chile.,1
"One of the most amazing human beings you will encounter. Teaching: very patient, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic. Personal: extremely caring and understanding. Don't abuse her kindness and motherly figure, she will snatch your head off. Hence the negative feedback. Easy A if do HW and revise 2-3 hours a week. You'll have nothing to complain about.",1
"Dr. Provost is an incredible professor. His lectures are the best I've had in my four years of university. His courses are not easy, but they are truly interesting and worth the work. I would take this course again in a heartbeat. Go to class and participate in the discussion!",1
Knows what shes talking about. Always so prepared for class and explains things great. Makes a lot of handouts and is very on top of things,1
Great professor to have.  Explains everything really well and will even explain it different ways if everyone in the class does not understand fully.  Follows the syllabus directly - well organized and thorough. Definitely plan to take him again. Nice that he is a working paralegal to share experiences.,1
One of the greatest professors at Purdue so far. Lectures are interesting. Lots of relevant information. Strongly suggest.,1
"Love my professor, very passionate, funny and educated!!",1
"The lectures were boring, long, and he often went off onto a tangent. Being that I am a business major, I want to learn in business courses, but I didn't in this class. He is very vague with instructions and doesn't give feedback on grades. He also waits until the last weeks of the semester to put in grades so it's hard to know how you're doing.",0
She was unhelpful and confusing. Her grading was nit picky. Her review of the papers of how you got the grade made no sense at all. AVOID THIS CLASS. She does not work with you and is very rude. Talks down to you alot. Not flexible at all. I could go on and on but just dont take her class!,0
"Never gives tests, but you do have to complete a lot of ""annotations"" over material you read. However, these are purely completion points. She also allows you to redo any assignment within a week. Also, you can redo the assignment until you get your desired grade. This class isn't easy though. It has a heavy workload.",1
"Great professor, he gives weekly assignments but they're only 150 words and they're easy. His lectures are all online so it's easy to follow along, and he tells  you exactly what's going to be on the test. He has experience in the field, and he knows what he's talking about. He's leaving to go to Worcester State next semester, I'm happy I had him",1
"Honestly, one of the worst experiences Ive had with a professor in general. As a person, hes a good guy but when it comes to teaching the class and grading not so much. Very specific on his grading and will deduct points for missing a lim or parenthesis or something minor. No study guides. Gives hardest version of questions on test.",0
Hameed is one of few teachers who actually cares about each individual student passing.  So he helps alot in office hours and even meets you when he is busy.  But he takes you through hell and back before you can pass his class.  Over 10 hrs of HW a week.,1
"Professor Sankara grades fairly.  He looks for improvement from the beginning of the class to the end.  I really found myself knowing the tenses we learned, and being able to apply them to my writing.  Professor Sankara is very passionate about the stories read in class, and goes through a lot to make sure you understand what happened in them.",1
"Steve was such a great professor. Really funny, really relates to his students and is always there to help them out. He breaks down difficult texts really clearly. As long as you listen well to what he says in class you'll pass the tests with flying colors. Great guy, great beard. I'll be taking another one of his classes as soon as I can.",1
"I didn't ever meet him. He left his class to a TA who made the class absolutely miserable. There is no professionalism whatsoever. I would have been nice to have an actual professor teaching this lab course, or at least having more of a handle on the way the TA was teaching. She was so condescending and rude people refused to ask questions.",0
"First off not an easy class. Secondly he is a bad teacher, very smart, but bad.  Makes it up with the exams very easy.",1
"Great prof Extra credit on most exams, homework is graded very leniently, gives plenty of partial credit if you show work.",1
"Seriously, to echo everybody else, never ever ever take. The cutoff for a B+ was an 87.  I got an 88 and he gave me a B because he told me he didn't think I deserved a B+.",0
"Easiest class ever. Three 50 question tests & a 75 question final. He gives you the exact word-for-word questions that will be on the test, which are all on quizlet. He checks attendance randomly 5x for points, so it's not mandatory but I'd recommend going for the 25 points. Sometimes hard to understand, & pretty boring material, but he's funny.",1
Her test were way to hard and had tricky wording. Her study guides were not the best either so that was no help. Wouldn't recommend her if you have a busy schedule!,0
"I have had the opportunity to take two classes with Dr. Buhler.  He has high expectations and often teaches classes that would be demanding despite those, but if you put in the effort you will leave the class impressed with what you managed to learn in a semester.  If you're expecting to coast through 584 or 541, I must urge caution.",1
He is the best professor I have had in a while. He really cares if you pass and gives you plenty of opportunities to do so. I hope to take him again next semester he gives extra credit and has old test in library to study from I Would not of been able to get through A&P 1 if it wasnt for him. Take him you will enjoy his class.,1
"Have a question in class? Don't bother asking, she will tell you ""you should know this,"" (and move on). Want to know the subjects on your upcoming exam? Too bad, she will beat around the bush as much as possible to make things 10x more difficult. If you are looking for a teacher that will make learning almost impossible, this is the one for you!",0
"She actually breaks down economics and makes it easy. I've never taken econ before. Not in high school, not during undergrad. She is organized with her deadlines and as long as you study, do your work, you can get an A. I got an A- mainly because of the quizzes since there's not enough time to learn the material by the end of the lecture.",1
"Marks entire letter grades off reports for minor mistakes that isn't even an out-of-order lab report. (Insert graph after the wrong line? A -> C.) Don't take if you're looking to get a good grade for your hard work. Also, experiments are uninteresting and always inconclusive. Almost no equipment; Take a lab somewhere else.",0
"Often explains concepts in ways that just confuse many students; I frequently spent time with classmates re-explaining the concept because Selgrad just rants. He just spouts his knowledge, which is never absorbed because he doesn't provide students with enough opportunities to program. It's a lot of wasted time, but still leagues above Chen.",0
Melissa is a capable professor and I appreciated the quality of the class discussions. I suspect that some other students who didn't participate much or at all were disappointed with their final grade - as class participation was probably more of a 'real' criteria in this class than in others.,1
"Great all-around professor. Lectures can sometimes seem a little slow for those who are comfortable with the topics; although this is usually helpful to others. Always easy to reach and eager to help. overall a great guy, and Professor.",1
"Cool guy, funny, recent grad who went to bradley so he knows the school and is pretty chill. easy class if you pay attention and follow directions. Little to no outside work if you pay attention and get your homework done in class. Got an A.",1
No Comments,1
"Easy A and a very nice professor, take it.",1
I found Dr. Strait fascinating. Highly recommend taking a class or a lesson with him. ,1
Clover Leary is an amazing professor. She's very supportive and organized.,1
Great teacher!! He makes the subject interesting and easy to understand.,1
"This class was challenging but well worth it. Definitely an upper-level anthro course I would recommend to anyone, especially with Dr. Prussing teaching it. Quite a bit of reading but nothing is busywork. ",1
"I absolutely loved Mrs. Jimmerson. I'm taking her next quarter for Advanced Grammar and cannot wait. She is fun, tells interesting stories that relate to the topic and is the most brilliant English professor I've had. I could talk sports with her for hours, even though she is a Yankees fan.",1
I took Profesor Prasad PBL class for the spring of 2018 and I have to say I've never learned so much in a class. She made chemistry fun and easy to learn. It's chemistry and it's obviously not an easy class and with any science course it' one in which you have to work for your grade. If you don't plan on putting effort into the class do not take it,1
"Prof. Marlowe is an excellent and very intelligent teacher who makes learning easy. She is very organized and responds to students' emails and needs right away. Although she assigns textbook readings, she covers all the material you need to know during class time. She thoroughly prepares students for each test (no cumulative final!). MUST TAKE!!!",1
I think the online component for Finance classes is not taught well.  If they had lectures with examples it would be much easier for Non-Accounting Students.  This instructor definately has favorites and grades accordingly.,0
"to be honest, although I re-watch his recordings, I still don't understand his English at all for both lectures and questions on exams, so I don't learn anything useful from this class. The good thing is he is an easy marker and his exams aren't hard (due to open book). Unfortunately, he is the only person who teaches 4115, 3225, 3235, KPU IT sucks",0
No Comments,1
Horrible is the only way to describe her. She does not respond to emails and the assignments make absolutely no sense.,0
There is a lot of homework in this class. I don't like that we learn most of this stuff on the computer then he teaches it afterwords. The thing I don't like is the test heavy part of the course.,0
"Professor Reznitskaya is very intelligent, therefore, she expects a lot from her students. Her class isn't extremely hard but it involves a lot of reading and a lot of work.",0
Loved Mrs. Gray. Her class is an easy A.,1
"Arevalo is a sweet person but shes not great at teaching. She runs through the slides and crams things in at the last second. Her thick accent makes it hard to understand her too. There arent many options for bio 104 , but if you can, avoid her. You can pass this class but you WILL have to teach yourself. Tests have little to do with taught info.",0
"Although some may not like her, if you listen you will pass!",1
"It takes a certain personality to be in Prof G's class. He lectures quickly and it is difficult to tell what to write down. This class is extremely hard if you don't ""think like a philosopher."" He allows students to resubmit homework assignment to maximize grades, which I why I was able to do moderately well. He is helpful at office hours though.",1
"Dr.Johansen is fairly easy to understand, provides a lot of examples, curteous, and helpful if you ask. always on time and very proffesional. Fun class , great discussions",1

"Avoid this professor like the plauge. Unclear lecture, unorganized examples in class, constantly is looking stuff up while giving his lecture, and the class is doing so bad that my 72 might end up being an A.",0
"Would not ever recommend. He knows his stuff but he expects everyone to get it as easy as he does. Gets upset/irritated when you have questions and dont understand. He will mock you or try to belittle you, Im a good student come to class every day on time and hes still a pain.",0
Taking this class with Professor Goldman is something I would absolutely recommend to everyone. Everything she tests over is in her lectures. She lectures slowly enough for her students to catch everything she says. She offers so much extra credit and has such an unnecessary curve that earning 35% of the offered points would get someone to pass.,1
Took Gene for a 3 hour course and it was hard to stay awake. His tests are straight from the lectures but very difficult. Hardest criminal justice teacher i've taken at UCF and i just completed my minor.,0
"I've had this professor for AJ 2 & AJ 3 & he is awesome!! One of the best AJ professors at LACC. He has a great teaching method. If you read the chapters and study, it is easy to get good grades.",1
"Ms. Magdaleno is the best, her art work is inspirational, her knowledge and approach to teaching is amazing. I have learned so much from her. Its a lot of work at times, shes tough, honest, but also fair and straight forward. Shes also happens to be incredibly hot and has a booty that you cant take your eyes off of. Shes one sexy artists",1
"He was very quick to respond to e-mails and gave great study advice! He's an easy grader. Midterm and Final make up 60% of your grade. Even though they're open book, you must read all the material and study/outline to do well on them. The Midterm was harder than the Final. I put in the work and got an A.",1
"Great Professor! Ive taken him for 121 & 122. One of the few instructor at wright I would recommend! Over all the lectures are always interesting. For 121/ 122..expect to have about 4 (mini) test, 1 group project, and 1 exit exam.",1
"extremely boring and extremely easy. there is not much work at all for this class and the work there is, you can easily get 100's. there are two online tests that you can work together with, and two book discussions (say one thing and you get a 100). a chill class but get ready to fall asleep every day. also very liberal",0
Dr. Amid is hands down the BEST teacher at Windsor. He sincerely cares for his students and is always willing to help and explain hard to grasp concepts. He takes time out to make sure each student is getting the core concepts down for the step exams and for clinical practice. Truly AMAZING and I am glad I had the opportunity to be taught by him!,1
Super interesting lecturer,1
"He is an amazing instructor. Makes class interesting with his story telling. Technically there is a lot of reading, a few hundred pages, but you do not have to necessarily read it all to get a good grade. I only did half the readings, showed up, and tried on the exam and got an A+. Easiest A I've ever had. Only dedicated 30 min a week to this class",1
Steve is a very understanding professor. Although he didn't always help you understand the concepts very well. But he did allow note cards for most tests and even gave a take home test. There are online quizzes for each section and book work that isn't graded but is required. Very easy to get an A in this class if you are good at math.,1
This class is not that hard. As far as teachers go shes pretty average but as long as you do the work you should get an A.,1
"the BEST math prof @ CSM! a literal blessing bc he managed to teach ME stats. effectively too. very accessible outside of class and is very patient with you if you dont understand a concept very well. everything is connected so dont worry abt things popping up on tests. long story short, take him for math if you can, you wont regret it",1
"There is so much reading for this class! Moreover, I feel like this class is mandatory on attendance because she reviews the articles and goes over a lot of things that is on the exams so if you don't do the readings but go to class, you should be fine on the exams. Also, her exams are short essays. Jacki is really sweet and is willing to help out",1
"This class is awkward and hard to follow. He has his own rogue opinions about marketing and teaches it from an econ/finance perspective. You basically have to disregard everything you know about marketing, econd and finance and just answer his questions the way he wants you do. Hard to follow his lectures. Heavy case based  with group presentations",0
"Overall Professor Perez is pretty cool. He made the class concise and clear, but I guess it helps that I had him for discussion. There is plenty of reading, so if you are one to skip the readings, don't take this class.",1
"Best teacher, so nice and caring of her students. Tests are not hard if you study from her guided notes.",1
I took world geo online and it wasn't too bad! Discussions and quizzes are worth a big chunk of your grade but they aren't hard at all. I suggest that you do ALL of them or your final grade won't be so pleasant. Only thing that sucked was that he never answered my emails,1
Bad communication skills,0
"Professor Lipson is the most disorganized professor I've had to date. He takes multiple weeks to get our exams back to us, and doesn't give us adequate time to study for the exams (ex: posted our study guide 2 days before the exam). He's a really sweet man and obviously cares, but is just flat out not a good professor.  He goes on and on in class.",1
"Dr. Hollis is a very chill professor. But, his class is very hard. Extremely hard. His tests cover very minute detail from the lectures and they are plentiful. There is a lot to be graded by, which is a blessing and a curse. It helps that there's a cushion for your grades but you also cannot miss class since there is a quiz every Tuesday over Thurs",1
"Mr. Burt does need to structure his lectures better, but he is not a bad prof. if u expect an A/B in any college class w/o touching the book & only going off some lecture slides and hw, ull never get the grade. If u read the book, & do the hw + the additional probs he gives, ur good. DONT CRAM. The material is not hard but requires time to master",1
Sooooo easy!!! Take her!,1
don't take her. she has people do the most ridiculous assignments. nice lady but very hard grader. also holds grudges,0
"A really great professor! I took him for statistics. Everything on the homework is on the exams (if I remember correctly, there was 4 of them). I took this class online and the lectures were really easy to follow. As long as you watch all the lectures, take good notes, double check your home work, and ask questions, you will definitely pass!",1
"It would be very helpful if there were reviews prior to each test, such as worksheets or crossword puzzles throughout the course. When it came to the Geographers, the test could have been clarified to match the notes.  Tests and book reports should be returned in a more timely manner.",1
Marvyn is one among those instructors that i would like to have in all my classes. You just need to complete all your assignments and get it corrected and handed back in the following week. His quizzes are easy. He has a lot of spelling test. He does not use moodle so buy your own books. He is hilarious sometimes. But he gives good grades.,1
"If you had Pasqualetti for ME18 during F2014, you have the right to complain. It was on of the most confusing and nerve wrecking classes I've ever taken.  For ME145 it is one of my favorite classes in all of undergraduate. It's really interesting and builds off of ME120/121. VERY HEAVY MATLAB for labs.",1
"Very sweet woman. Her grading seemed a bit arbitrary. She also didn't seem especially qualified to be teaching collegiate English. I would rather have taken a harder professor that actually made the subject interesting. Nearly every class was just ""filler"" and I never looked forward to going.",1
Good prof. went through the material pretty fast but gave good explanations of everything. You can skip a few classes here and there but don't miss too many or you will fall behind.,1
Professor Vair has been one of my favorite professors while at STU. Unfortunately this is her last year of teaching and therefore this review doesn't even matter because none of you reading this will get to have her as a prof. So this is just an FYI that you missed out on one of STU's best profs! We'll miss you greatly professor!,1
I absolutely do not recommend her! Online class is terrible! Gave tons of assignments at beginning of semester without any kind of discussion/lecture. Never replied to emails. Kept saying her computer was broken when the students went to her in person. It's midway through the semester and still no contact? Please! Try using other excuses!,0
Awesome Prof. Always willing to work with you as long as you keep her in touch. Would take other classes with her in a heart beat.,1
"The content he has to teach is very difficult, and he doesn't make it any easier by assigning tons of mandatory homework every week. He does not engage class, in fact he hates when he has to stop the class to answer questions. Very difficult to approach outside of class. Exams are very difficult, know what you're doing and study hard, don't slack.",0
"Horrible planner and doesn't know how to use online tools and basic technology. The pacing of homework was irregular often assigned entire chapter readings the night before a class. On top of this, he is extremely slow and has no humor.",0
"Doesnt use cuLearn to release grades & requires students to hand in hard copies of all assignments which wastes time & is outdated. There is only 1 knowledgeable TA & the others are basically useless. The prof doesnt answer emails professionally, nor is he helpful in office hours or explaining concepts during lecture.",0
Dr. Houston is a fair teacher. If you don't read and study the class could be hard. Her test aren't easy. They require a lot of reading and studying. She's not as bad as these posts make her out to be. She is a very friendly professor outside the classroom but she is strictly about business when in the class. Just be prepared to work extra hard!,0
SHE IS THE BEST!!!!! she is very great!!!! when i was about to fail she told me what all i can do in her class to get my Grads up and inspired me to do BETTER in my studies! Great teacher hands down!!,1
"Not a hard class. Had lectures, occasional pop-quizzes on chapter readings, 4 speeches, a midterm where you evaluated a speech, and one speech about a concept in the book. Do all of the work and you will easily pass. Not the best professor I've ever had but he's a very nice guy and this class is very doable.",1
"Professor Riffe has been my favorite professor for my time at UNCC. She has a clear layout for class with 4 or 5 speeches with outlines and 2 midterm tests that she preps you for. Professor Riffe truly cares about making her students better speakers and making the class enjoyable. Please take this class, you will not regret it.",1
"The class was fairly easy but, wow, is she boring. She reads from the book half the time and the other half she's going off on a tangent. If you do the homework, you will pass though.",1
Tom is by far the best teacher I had at UNL. He cares about your future and the class has helped me prepare for my career. Definitely try to meet within at least once throughout the semester as he is very knowledgeable and can help you with almost anything. Very inspirational class.,1
"Mrs. Hanratty is nice to you if you're nice to her. She is a pretty tough grader but her expectations are about as clear as they can be. If you think you wrote a C paper, you'll get a C, if you think you wrote an A paper, you'll get an A. Nothing to complain about from her.",1
"She is deceiving, she seems pretty nice but is strict for an intro course. She is clear with what she wants. It is impossible to get full credit because nothing is good enough. Definitely a difficult class. If you like history you will do well but don't expect a good grade prior to the course.",1
Dr. G's class is so much fun. I took this class in the rarely offered fall term. The field is the heart of the course. Students learn the basics in field id and recognition of plants and animals. Highly recommended for students with the ability to commit time and effort to biological studies in the field.,1
"She's always start her lectures right on time, some of her lectures are mandatory, not all. She want you to turn in your assignments on time (one again: timing is very important in her class!). A lot of extra credits are given during the course. You also need to buy the textbook because your homework is in there.",1
Amazing professor!! Doesnt slack on teaching and teaches really well.,1
"This has been without a doubt the worst fire tech class I have ever taken! It's an online class so we have a quiz every week after completing two discussion boards and reading the textbook. The PowerPoints with ""notes"" are useless since nothing in those notes have anything to do with the questions in the quizzes. Just take it with someone else.",0
"Dr. Arevalo can neither teach nor speak English sufficiently to make herself understood.  She spends most of class mentioning most of what we will talk about, then rushes through what the students need to have explained to them.  Her tests do not reflect the information she teaches and are worded poorly as she does not have control of English.",0
Claudine is the best instructor I could have asked for in a mental health rotation where I didn't know what to expect. She is so supportive and not the least bit intimidating! If you show her you genuinely care about your patients she will love you. She truly just wants you to succeed and makes you so comfortable. Wish I could have her again!,1
"Professor Weis is one of my only favorite classes , she makes class worth it you actually learn something , she doesnt just put the notes on the smart board she explains it and puts in her own personal examples and jokes she very caring and well would recommend ! Would take her class again if I could",1
Professor Stevenson is by far the best professor I've ever had. Her class is tough but thats because Anatomy is a tough subject. She takes time out of her day and outside of class to teach you and make sure yo understand everything. She is extremely helpful and such a nice person. Would 100% take again. Amazing!!,1
Shes very rude and doesnt even do english its all about plants,0
"I liked her, realtime experience and genuine.",1
Worst teacher in the world Do not take the class Doesn't know how to teach confusing Not helpful  Bad gradin,0
hands down the best professor at UMD.,1
Super easy-going teacher. Very accommodating with her timelines and gives little homework while still being exceptionally knowledgeable in her field.,1
"I love Dr. Scoville. He's not the most organized professor I've ever had, but he's very flexible and helpful when there's confusion. He really cares about all of his students, and is very passionate about what he teaches. Definitely one of my favorite Arabic professors.",1
She is very knowledgeable but her class is hard if you don't pay attention. Dr. Yamazaki seems like a kind professor. She goes by very fast when lecturing and her tests are very hard even if you study. Take this professor if you are willing to put in the work and like Biology. If you're just trying to fulfill the requirement try another professor.,1
"very unorganized, and i hate group projects, and in this class everything is a group project",0
Dr. Maragh-Lloyd is real. This was her first year as a black professor at a predominantly white university and she embraced it. She fostered a comfortable environment where she genuinely valued our honest opinions but she did not tolerate prejudice. One of the best professors I've ever had. I would take her every semester if I could.,1
"He is seriously the most unfair grader I've had in college.  His exams test reading comprehension and whether or not you know WHAT he's asking, not whether or not you know the answers and have covered the materials. His TAs are unhelpful as well and if you ever have Kassuhun, your grade is seriously doomed, no matter how much of the work you do.",0
The best professor I've had at UM so far. Classes are interesting and fun. He has a very witty personality and really cares about his students & their success in the class. Grade is based off 6 2-page papers. Attendance in class is extremely important as he covers a lot of what you will need to write the papers. 10/10 would recommend for any class.,1
"She's a nice teacher, but does get mad/annoyed when questions are asked or if you don't know the answers during class. She is always available during office hours. She can be very condescending when going over problems in class.",1
I have had Smith for several classes he is essay and EVERYTHING is open book,1
"This guy does really messed up things like give problems on tests that use notations youve never ever seen before, or material you've never seen before. Need to put a lot of effort in to pass, but he does know what hes talking about and will help you if you go to his office hours. Does not curve and is the most unfair teacher in math department.",0
He was great! Class was C++ online. We had to attend lecture virtually twice a week. He understood if you had to miss and had many resources including extra videos as well as recorded lectures on the topics being covered. Answered all questions asked and very helpful when students needed more help. One of the best professors I have had no doubt.,1
"Instructor was inaccessible all semester, checked in once a week in a 6 week course, which led to a lot of assignments with no submit links, or being posted the day before they were due. Assignments are convoluted busy work, that she grades harshly for something she isn't available for questions about. Students had to answer each others ? instead.",0
boring class ..cant keep students attention ..knows his material but has a hard time putting it into simple terms,0
"May is very knowledgeable in the field of computers. His first impression he seems ""dry"" but really he is a nice guy- willing to help in any way. He is to the point ""no BS"" kind of guy, but as long as you attend class and do your assignments, he's great and more than willing to help you pass the class.",1
"Amazing person and prof. 101 has more work than you would expect, but everything was very clear. She is very understanding, even extending due dates. Would recommend for 101 to anyone. Everyone has the opportunity to earn an A",1
"Dr Self gives lectures with a lot of energy and I swear he has ADD. Study the slides and do the test review throughly. Random clicker questions on previous material. Gives test reviews before the exam but only talks about questions asked to him, so ask!! The class wasn't nearly as hard as I thought it would be.",1
"As much as taking this class sucked in the moment, I'm so glad I took her class! I'm now in math 20 and for once in my life math is making sense because she gave me a solid foundation for math. She makes you work hard, but it's so worth it. Do her extra credit if you can, participate, ask questions, go to office hours. The hard work is worth it!",1
"ya rick's good ****, take his courses",1
"One of the best teachers I've ever had. Lectures were a tad boring due to the type of content being taught. But he really did his best to try and make it more interesting. Gave really good advice, and genuinely cared about his students. There was a decent amount of notes, and relatively easy assignments. Would definitely take him again.",1
This semester was awesome the mayor brought in pizza with bugs on it and the hot dogs were prepared by his food cart,1
"Explains material wonderfully, chapter HW due on test day, 4 ques. pop quiz for each chapter, very understanding and helpful. Highly recommend him for anyone who has a tough time with math, or has a very busy stressful life!!! If you try you can't fail in this class!!",1
I took her online for English 101. Professor Bailey was a great communicator and kept us all up to date on the upcoming assignments as well as reminders. She was responsive and gives full credit for the Journals and Discussions as long as you participate. 5 essays and 10 Journals on one novel. Great instructor!,1
"Graduating in April, and she truly was one of the best profs I have ever had. Very considerate and caring towards the students. Always had a loving vibe to her and made sure everyone did well during the pandemic. Amazing prof.",1
Nice prof!,1
"Dr. Hunt is awesome! She makes her lectures as interesting as possible and her tests are fair and from the power point lectures. If you need help, she always has office hours which are extremely useful. Take her for anatomy!",1
"Mr. Narin is an awesome teacher. You need to attend every class and stay on top of homework. His expectations are high for his students, but he is always available to assist with any difficulties you may be experiencing. All tests must be passed in order to pass class. He does allow some make-ups. His lectures are thorough and simple to understand.",1
Professor Dryja is a great professor. I really enjoyed having her class she really shows that she cares about you. If you ever need help with anything all you needed to do was ask for help. If you do your work and turn it in on time its an easy A in the class. I recommend students to take her.,1
"Professor Marlowe is really passionate about history. She'll ask you to write up 3 discussion essays but you can turn in more than 3 if you want a better grade. Quizzes are usually unannounced but she drops the lowest 2. If you want to maintain a good grade, you must participate. She keeps track how many times you do, but overall she's very sweet.",1
never take his class never!,0
Very easy going class. Introduces students to the school and you get to know each other. There is a peer advisor which co teaches classes. Very easy going guy. Very helpful if you go to his office hours.,1
Great guy and good teacher .Plays real loud.,1
"He is probably the only professor that was able to teach. He teaches everything that you need to know for the exams. If you do not get the grade you want, that is on you cause he gives all the study material needed for his exams. Also, participate and make an impression, it really helps.",1
"great teacher!  A lot of hard work, but if you attend class (like your supposed to) and do your homework, it's no problem!    And he's funny and knows how to relate math to commonplace things/situations, too bad he's retiring!",1
"Judith can be all over the place, and she is great at what she knows. However, she is an extremely empathetic person, and as long as you're being honest with her, she is understanding. If you try to just get out of things, she will catch on. She is challenging to work with, but she is so respected in the theatre community, it is worth every minute",1
"Cons: This was Professor Israel's first year teaching freshmen. He went very quickly and tended to skip steps in a problem, assuming you would do the math in your head. The tests are multiple choice. Homeworks are on Quest.  Pros: Dr. Israel definitely knows what he's doing. The class is easy if you took BC Calculus.",1
Great teacher... I attended his lectures then would go home and watch them in 2x speed. Do the hw early and go over the test review heavily. He knows his stuff and provides you with all the tools necessary to succeed so take advantage of it. Would highly recommend Mr. Sylvester to anyone.,1
"I took a class with Al 1st semester and gladly took another 2nd semester! Classes are lectures with a few assignments, quizzes, and tests so not the most interesting but always manageable. Do the homework and study and youll be fine. Al is very organized and has very clear expectations. Hes funny, quirky, and overall very likeable! I recommend!",1
"She explained simple things in really confusing ways, genetics was easy, but she explained everything out of order with no good explanations of anything. She also gives two ten minute breaks in lecture then speeds through all the material to the point where you can barely write fast enough let alone understand the material.",0
"Amazing lectures, she is amazing",1
"She is very attentive and always wants to keep the lectures lively, she hates when they are quiet and dull. She is a stickler for no-phone use in her class and if she catches you, the entire class gets a pop quiz so beware. Other than that, she is a very respected teacher and I would highly recomment her class.",1
She is an awesome professor. Brooke cares and seeks to challenge us to learn but helps us to be successful in both learning and receiving a good grade. I would definitely take her as an instructor again to learn more economics.,1
"Great teacher. You learn so much! He makes math fun and easy to learn, and teach. I wish that he taught more educational classes because I would take him again.  Amazing teacher!!",1
"Professor Freedman is a great instructor. He is accessible, extremely knowledgeable, and passionate. He pulls together lectures in a way that made me connect the dots about big issues on globalization. Style: lectures (he does best) and class discussions (ok facilitator) He is realistic about college level work so you might have to do some.",1
"Great teacher, really makes you comfortable.",1
I loved Professor Kopp! He was so kind and I appreciate how hard he tried his hardest to make the material more fun. His class may seem intimidating at first but honestly it became a real cruise once you start! Make sure you practice your speech beforehand thoroughly and utilize is grading rubric! Would take his class again!,1
"she's funny, nice. not so hard to archive an A at her class. she gave us a lot of example during course to make sure you can fully understand. i would recommend her",1
This is the worst professor I ever had.  Does not answer questions.,0
"You will work for your grade in his class, but you will be appreciative for it afterwards. I've had him for two classes, both of which were tough, but I came out truly knowing the material. Gives solid feedback on the homework - which there is a lot of, but I actually liked it! TAKE HIM!",1
I WISH HE WAS TEACHING FOR THE SUMMER TERM BEACUSE I LOVE HIM!! I AM IN HIS CLASS NOW AND IT WENT BY QUICK!! WE USED OUR TESTBOOKS MAYBE 3 TIMES THE WHOLE SEMESTER!! HE TEACHES FROM SLIDE SHOWS AND IS VERY NICE ABOUT MAKE UPS AND TURNING IN ALL WORK..HE MAKES STUDY GUIDES AND WHATS ON THERE IS ON THE TEST(HELLO!!)..I RECOMMEND HIM TO ANYONE!!,1
This class really is NOT hard. There is a lot of homework and a lot of reading. The chapters for homework assignments were to be turned in before we learned about that chapter. This meant that you needed to read before class. The tests were easy as long as you went to class and did the review slides online! Don't miss class bc lectures matter more!,1
"He calls it passion, I call it narcissism. Most of the lecture comprised of his personal life and work relating it to the class; lacking the true teaching aspect. He didn't give real notes either. The book was mandatory and even with the book for the take home test, I still failed. It's more about his expectations than the course itself.",0
I like the way he gives clear expectations and though I am very used to easy A's I am glad that Professor Reese does not simply hand me my grade.,1
LOVED him. He is awesome he just wants his students to succeed. I love him and have taken all my classes through him. Way to be the BEST trower!,1
"I took Numerical Computations with him. The class is super easy- 3 quizzes that are open notes (and he gives a study guide with all the answers), 6 homeworks that he practically does for you, and one project that isn't much harder. His lectures are well organized and he has code samples in a ton of programming languages. Very nice guy.",1
"Fantastic professor! Great to see someone who is so passionate about the material. Tough exams and tough marker, but a real teacher.",1
Dr. Israel obviously knows what he's doing but he's not always the best at watering down concepts. My biggest complaint is that 90% of the test is multiple choice graded on a right/wrong basis with no points for work. Easy to tank your grade by making a small mistake. This class has the same curriculum as BC calc only with tougher problems.,1
"He gets sidetracked a lot, and sometimes he cant answer questions, but he gave good study guides for the quizzes. Those make up a lot of the grade.",1
"I made the mistake of taking this class over the summer. The good thing is that it's fast-paced, the bad thing is that he grades super harshly. He is a little unclear in his instruction, he'll give you examples and then penalize you when you follow it. It's really hard to get an A.",1
"She's very sweet and knowledgable on all the topics. Sometimes she is a little disorganized in her lectures, but as long as you skim through the textbook and study the study guide before exams, you can get an A! In 230 there were 4 exams, 1 group presentation, & 5 quizzes. Homework almost every week, but it was just the definitions from the chapter",1
It really doesn't get much better than Mark. Knows his stuff; his dialogue is clear; even his choice of words seems chosen to avoid any kind of confusion. The assignments and tests are relevant and you leave each course knowing something useful.,1
"Class definitely is full of heavy content, but if you put the effort in studying you will pass!  He is ALWAYS available for his students to explain any topic not understood. Study guides are clear and concise to what will be on exams. 3 midterms 1 final. pwrpnt slides on moodle & written hw. You will wish to have every prof be just like him! a GEM!",1
"This professor is an excellent teacher. Her classes are always fun and information filled. The criticisms so far are completely unjustified. I had and excellent time learning from her, as she was very clear. Rough start, but flawless victory in the end. Her class is very informative with great use of time. She is new, but has a lot of potential!",1
"This was my first class as a college student. Sandra was a very pleasant person, you just have to put in a lot of work to pass. ",1
"It's true that she is sweet, but what's best about her is her ability to teach. I learned the core aspects of essay writing in her class. She goes over everything she expects and has great exercises for the class. I owe the A I received on my midterm for English 1A to Professor Fujimoto whom I took for English 111.",1
No Comments,0
"Dan capper is an awesome, down to earth teacher. His tests are absolutely killer and are the only reason I wouldnt take him again.",1
Lectures/ stories seem irrelevant but is actually super helpful in getting you to remember the material.,1
"I don't even know what's going on in the class 95% of the time. He supposedly teaching us data structures but yet he never writes a single line of code in the class. What's going on? He has this code which is all from the textbook, and he ""teaches"" us with that. Assigmts/exams are difficult, and don't get me started on the vids he makes us watch...",0
"Routers was a tricky class for me especially once we got into GNS3, but he definitely helps you get through the labs. Lectures one day lab the next day. First half of class you use Cisco Routers and Switches to get used to the CLI and how to set them up. Next part of class goes to GNS3. He gives you all the information on GNS3 you just have to look",1
"Great, keep it up",1
She was a great professor! Would take her again!! Didn't use the 'textbook' but used her Study Guide like crazy!!!!,1
"Great professor, you will have to practice and show improvement in order to get a good grade. Sweetest lady ever. She has been playing for decades, an amazing performer. I started not knowing how to play and in one semester she had me already performing classical simple pieces, this is my second semester and I am already playing Chopin. Work hard",1
"DONT TAKE HER. VERY UNPREPARED, ALL OVER THE PLACE. DOESNT TEACH. EXPECTS YOU TO LEARN ON YOUR OWN. THIS SHOULD BE AN ONLINE CLASS. SERIOUSLY.",0
"At first when she explain the grading curve I thought she seemed like a fair professor. Then my semester of hell started. She was terrible at explaining physics and she was constantly unprepared. She would blame the students for ""not reading"" the textbook when her examples were wrong. She would lose everyone during her in-class examples. Terrible!",0
I loved having Dr. Jones in class. She is very respectful to her students and she is a highly respectable professor. I do however suggest DO THE ANNOTATION GRADES! I believe I would have passed with a higher grade if I actually did them.,1
"Clawson is really caring and interested in his students so it's an easy class to pass, although there is A LOT of reading which is important to quizzes (a pretty big part of your grade) and the final exam. There's a big paper but its very doable and Dan is very easy to work with. Lectures get a bit tedious but can be though provoking",1
He was a very helpful teacher. I can definitely see the changes that he made on my writing until today since the class tow years ago!,1
"Dr. Hale is the best! He is very challenging, asks a lot of questions, and pushes you to think, rather than just passively receive the information. He incorporates a lot of different media for class such as film clips, music clips, and artwork, which makes class interesting. If you are into history, I highly recommend this course and Dr. Hale!",1
OK teacher I don't think he's truly a bad person but may not realize the condesending attitude he gives students when he picks on them or they don't know an answer or ask a question. Find it ridiculous at this level 2 take attendence & that actually effects your mark. We're paying his salary so if we dont want 2 show up it's our problem if we fail,0
"Jaymie Heilman is an incredible, engaging, and REFRESHING professor. She has the ability to make history come alive in her lecture and you can tell she cares so much about what she teaches. If you have the chance, I highly recommend you take one of her classes (especially HIST 127!). She's always incredibly helpful one-on-one and speaks concisely!",1
"His in-class assignments were a tad ridiculous, and the group project took a crazy amount of time to complete. He expects everyone to participate in the class, and would call upon people to talk if no one volunteered. His exams were really straightforward and fair. Textbook helped if you missed a class or were unclear on some of the concepts.",1
"I'm so sad this is my last class to take with her :( AMAZING professor! I was fortunate to have taken her for BIO 1 AND 2. She makes lectures interesting, she's super funny and helpful. She has the greatest personality.I've never seen her in a bad mood! Shes very respected by her students. Dont hold back on taking her, Her classes fill up QUICK!",1
It's impossible to not understand what she is saying. She is plain awesome.,1
"I ended this class with over 40 points of extra credit. All of the difficult assignments are done in class with her, and she walks you through all of it. She's super funny and nice, and the homework is pretty easy. The tests are fine as long as you know what you're doing. The midterm and final were pretty difficult, but the extra credit helps!",1
"Only 4 main speeches and 1 chapter speech from the book. Occasional quizzes from the book/lectures. No impromptus which are nice, only on the 1st day of class. He's a hard grader, and since you have a few speeches you gotta try on all of them. Full class to begin with, but 1/2 as time progressed probs cause his grading and lack of updating grades.",1
"Professor is nice, kind, and informative. however shes not on time with anything, always adjusting her schedule of the syllabus changing dates for assingments due. talks about her jobs and is constantly asking for feedback which pushes time back for assignments due. Heavy grader for a class to improve for poor writing. DONT TAKE HER!",0
"great lecturer, very interesting. Keeps class engaged. Readings are important. Not too many assignments and no midterm. He doesn't post his slides so you won't get the content without attending lectures.",1
Mr. Luckett's teaching is thorough and matter of fact.   He is extremely knowledgable and expects you to learn the material he dictates.   His passion for Social Work is evident in his teaching style.  I learned a lot in his class.  I loved the structured outline of his class. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone.,1
"Awful PHD instructor. This class is all about organization and the most unorganized class I've ever taken. Funny how that works, right? Her assignments make absolutely no sense and when you ask for clarification she sighs and rolls her eyes. On top of that, she deducts points for going above and beyond and takes months to grade assignments.",0
"I don't like science but Mark List made it easy. You will need the textbook for the homework,he is pretty lenient of accepting late assignments & still gave full credit. The exams were easy as long as you review the clicker questions and there is at least 1 pic with terms on the exam. He also rounds up.",1
"I actually took this class before all of my programming fundamental courses. I was nervous at first, having zero  programming knowledge, but he made the class super easy and fun. i didn't open the book once ( so dont buy). He explains everything thoroughly and with the class. All work is based off of what the class work was. Id take all his classes",1
"This was my first online class and it was very easy. Although, you did have to write a lot. Every week you would type 600 words and 10 sentences to your peers. You also had open book quizzes every Monday. The professor always leaves comments and grades fast. This class was a easy A.",1
One of my favorite professors!!! He grades every speech but it doesn't go in the grade book. Only your midterm and final will be put into ecourses and used for your semester grade. Both tests are online.,1
"This man is the best PE teacher ever. You can hardly show up to class and you will get an A. He is very helpful, he will work with you to improve your skills. Nice, funny, and caring. Take him if you have the chance. He is the best!",1
"Really good professor, you absolutely need his lecture notes for the exams (which are tough), but they will help you forever. Helpful in office hours, really really likes getting questions, and everything was graded SUPER quickly. 10/10 loved the class",1
"Prof. Sheridan is a good professor, teaches clearly. He is balanced and can be pretty funny. Theres a bit of more reading than you might expect in a 100 level class, but its manageable. Interesting books and clear study guides.",1
"I took his class on How Surfing Colonized California and the World. It was so so interesting, I genuinely enjoyed this class and going to lectures, very cool prof! Every day we studied a new surf break geographically and its cultural nuances as well. I didn't know much about Hawaii and its rich history, this class is a great opportunity to do so!",1
"The class was very easy. It honestly isn't necessary to attend the class. His notes and the homework are online. He does a study guide in class (which is also available online) before exams, and provides extra credit oppurtunities to add points to your tests as well.",1
Picks favorites. Make sure she likes you within the first few courses or she'll tear you apart. Is unnecessarily rude when giving feedback. Worst class with the worst professor ever. ,0
"Mr. Wofford is a great professor. He is very knowledgeable about economics, and his dry sense of humor makes his classes entertaining. As far as tests go, study the notes and you shouldn't have a problem. I highly recommend him.",1
"If you have proficient writing skills you will be fine. Her workload is very average, and you have lots of time to prepare for each essay (4). She offers great feedback that really helps your writing skills. As long as you put effort into every assignment you can definitely end with an A.",1
"By far best teacher at Cuesta. Helpful on exams, provides food at study groups. FUNNY and informative. Take this class if you want to learn something!",1
"He is a pretty good teacher, especially for someone exclusively online",1
"The best business teacher at MU. Incredible person, sincerely cares about you, where you came from and where you are going. His classes are generally fairly easy. All tests and quizzes are online. He lectures throughout the class but keeps them interesting. For any business class you should take regensburger if possible.",1
"Was not a fan at all of the class and material. R is hard and confusing, as with the other programs. Not a good class or really a good teacher.",0
"This man is an amazing person who teaches you lessons of life and being a good person! Also his lectures are rich and concise and you learn from every single word he uses! I would definitely take other classes with him! Very intelligent, helpful and humble! ",1
She only allows 3 absences. If you're on your phone or daydreaming she counts you absent. She is super hard grading on papers. You have to read short stories and take quizzes on them on very specific things from the story. She barely smiles and is very monotone. I would not recommend taking this teacher.,0
"Such a great professor and class.  Her notes are very thorough and easy to follow.  The class is very interesting and will definitely teach you a lot. I wouldn't say it is an easy A, you have to do the work, but if you go to class and actually try there is no reason why you wouldn't get and A. I would highly recommend this class.",1
Professor Gentry is a great man! He does assign reading homework that you have to read bc he does have frequent pop quizzes. Be sure to take notes of the reading & try your best during class and youll have an A.,1
Prof Zubin is one of the best teachers I've ever had.  Wish he could teach everything here!  The guy is a stand-up comedian but really knows his stuff.  You spend the whole class laughing at this jokes then the rest of the week thinking about what he's said.,1
Clear grading criteria. Do the reading and youll do fine on the homework and exams.,1
"Brilliant and smart man! He gives alot of reading but what do you expect for a lit class. MUST READ because participation is ALOT in class. If you participate, you will do great but it is really awkward when no one reads, he gets really mad when no one participates. Expects you to know your stuff so DO NOT try to b.s. your way through the class!!!",1
She is ok I guess but gives different review than actual test,0
"He likes to rant and go off on tangents.  Homeworks are rough, tests are like long homeworks.  I find him annoying, but at the same time he's like a hamster at the front of the class; I can't take him seriously.",1
"Great Professor. Easy to understand and responds to email quickly. Took a World Religions class and I'm glad I took his class. He used a variety of material and would make the class fun. All in all, I would recommend him to anyone taking any philosophy or religions class.",1
"She never follows the rubric. Gave me a 57 out of 130 for ""not developing my thesis enough."" The only reason my SOC 112 class was difficult was because of her. Drop the class and take it with someone else. I was a 4.0 student before her. Now I have a 3.8",0
"Really fun guy! As long as you study the textbook and do all of your assignments, you'll get a good grade. Very understanding and makes long classes interesting with his examples. Offers really nice extra credit opportunities too!",1
"Professor Brown was a good, but the tests were a lot of material. It was nearly impossible to remember all of the specific sites and dates required to know. The powerpoints were somewhat confusing the way they were written, especially towards the end. Do not take this class if you want a simple elective! Too much irrelevant memorization",1
I was so incredibly disappointed. I took her for online semester of psych 002 and she responded to the class maybe 3x. I had to call the psych dept. and even called and emailed the dean. She never clarified why she wasn't giving us lessons or exams or homework. Halfway we were given a new professor (Monica B Coto) and she's an angel.,0
"Stephanie was a good professor.  Sometimes lecture on Tuesday was a bit long, but she usually made sure that the Thursday activity was engaging and helped to reinforce the lecture from the last class.",1
"Absolutely Ridiculous. Way to much reading its as if she thinks that her class should be the center of our universe. We read 2 3/4 books, the whole books in one fricken semester. She is not helpful. I would never recommmend someone to take her. If you get her as a professor switch classes immediately.",0
"Awesome prof.  Goes over everything in class in  a lot of detail, makes midterms and exams easy. If you can write an essay, you're set.",1
I really enjoyed her. Her lectures are entertaining and never too boring. She really knows her stuff which helps. She gives 3 papers throughout the semester and if you follow the criteria you'll do well. The quizzes are very easy if you read. I would take her again if I had the opportunity. It's an easy A if you do the work.,1
"I thought he was really funny at first but once we started getting into learning, there was no effort on this part. He used material from other profs (didn't even bother to change the name) and would only tell us to go home, read, and answer questions. whenever someone made a question he would say ""that was a stupid question"" and not answer. :(",0
MacEwan is extremely lucky to have Claudine as she is simply the kindest and most caring instructor I have seen! She knows mental health incredibly well and you will certainly learn lots from her. She is very encouraging and helps ease the nervousness which is natural at the start. She will make sure you are safe and advocate for you!,1
"He is an alright teacher, giving it was his first time teaching here. Exams were a bit tricky to me, but I probably just haven't studied it extremely well. Covers a lot of material in this class. His writing on his notes is bad, but legible to an extent. Do well in your lab reports and you will do fine in this class. ",0
"Jesilow was amazing. He's really clear in his lectures and you can tell he knows what he's talking about. He's really funny and blunt so that's always fun in a crim class. The tests are pretty easy (34 lectures & 14 readings), but you have to read. Super easy B class but you have to work for that A. ",1
"As tempting as it is, ""Sharks with lasers"", is not a correct answer on any of his quizzes.",1
"DON'T TAKE HIM FOR ONLINE CLASS. It's an easy class, but he does a horrible job giving you the information to learn the material. Expects you to learn material from a poorly constructed powerpoint and videos that take 10 minutes to explain what could be said in 1 minute. Also he is very bad at communicating the basic guidelines of the class. plz no",0
Awesome teacher! Project at the end seemed like the scariest part but we got 100% just for doing it. She's super funny and cares about the individual person you are,1
"She is really sweet. I have statistics with her, which is obviously a lot of work, but she makes it as easy as possible. Lectures are very thorough so its easy to understand the material. I took Stat at community college and it was way harder than Dr Reiser-Danners class",1
"This profesor is one of the best I have had at UM. She cares and is very understanding. Took this class in the summer, online during the pandemic and it was the best experience. There was a lot to read, some easy some hard about Post Colonial. The subject is a bit boring but discussion boards and 3 essays were required. She is very flexible.",1
"Professor Peters is great at explaining everything and doesn't rush through things. its easy to ask her questions as she responds very well, she does not respond to emails at all. my advise it to NOT miss class",1
"Dave Boden is great! He is a great teacher and his power points are very lucid. If you just go to class, take notes, pay attention, you will pass this class. Dave explains  the material so well, and he is always there for help. This was definitely one of my easiest class, but he loves when you are very very very very descriptive in all the labs.",1
Grades are based on tests but if you study you will pass. Professor Bronie makes sure you understand and is tough sometimes but is caring.,1
"Her exam questions were more comprehensive. Her lectures contained a relatively dense amount of material. However, she missed her first couple of lectures since she misunderstood the syllabus. She uploaded an asynchronous lecture the night before reading week ended. Told everyone the final was non-cumulative when it was cumulative. Unreliable.",0
"4 tests, all based off of lectures and listening examples. Kind of monotonous and the lectures are pretty long, but he's also very kind. Offers ec for exams which is easy. Overall grade is based on the tests and ec if you do it. Very knowledgeable and played music at the start of lectures. Hard to pay attention so I'm not sure if I would take again",1
"Ms Mahon is the most amazing professor you could ever hope to get! She is genuine, and works to make sure everyone is on the same page. If anyone came to her with an issue or suggestion, she worked with them, never shut anyone down or had an attitude. If you can get in her class you need to take it! She changed my perspective on education. The BEST",1
GREAT TEACHER! VERY HELPFUL! ALSO KIND. MUY CALIENTE!,1
GREAT PROFESSOR HIGHLY RECOMMEND HIM he seems like a gem of a guy,1
AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!! I have NEVER had an online class with as many assignments due each week. If you take this professor you might as well quit your job if you want to pass. Professor also wants nothing to do with the students so good luck getting in touch with her. Also all tests require computer lock down and webcam.,0
Provides organized notes that does wonders for you. She has basically done almost half the work for you by picking out important concepts from the book to her notes. Although that doesn't mean you should abandon your textbook. She is really nice and lectures are clear,1
If you need to get an A take him! He gives  you study guides for all exams which are all multiple choice except lab exams which are super easy he gives guides as well.  HW and quizzes online easy use book! Quizzes you get 3 chances and HW is unlimited chances. Super easy cant stress it enough!!!!!,0
"One popquiz the whole semester. Tests were pretty easy in my opinion, just study from the sheet he gives you. DO THE HOMEWORK at the back of the chapter as he spontaneously checks them. Overall, he's offensive. he says inappropriate things in class, but I managed an A without trying too hard.",0
Dr. Horzempa is so nice and extremely helpful! He will do anything to get you to understand the material. The class can be a bit difficult at times. You definitely have to study the material a lot and attend all the classes. I highly recommend taking him--one of the best professors I've ever had!,1
He is nice to look at but not really saying much.  His lectures are boring as he mainly is reciting book material and doesn't care much about student's opinions or input.  Asks lots of rhetorical questions not really wanting answers.  Overall good eye candy.,1

"I cant stand you slackers who give her a bad rap. This woman is a genius and tolerates no BS from anyone.  Compared to Zoghlul Kabir, she is a biology goddess.  I will miss her when she retires :(",1
"Thomas-Reid is an eye-opener. The man is fantastic and wants to see everyone do well. He does not care about your grade he just wants to learn, but he helps so you can get that A that you want. Take him and you will really enjoy it!",1
"dr kennedy is a good man, but doesnt seem to be good at communicating. he's an awesome chemist though. listen to his lectures and you will do well",1
"I would only recommend you take his classes if you READ!  There is no need to go to class because he posts pp's & audio online.  Tests are 3/4 lecture material and 1/4 reading.  Again, only take his classes if you plan on reading.  Losing points for the reading questions will have a HUGE impact on your grade. There is easy extra credit.",1
"Super fun if you engage her, just participate in class and you will do fine.",1
Dr. Fontenot is a very uninvolved professor. He lectures every class period but is essentially saying the same thing every class time. The class also required at least 5 books when I took it. He does not really give clear instructions on tasks and is reluctant to work with students who need help. He does end class early almost every day though.,0
Heather is an awesome professor. She is very clear tells you exactly what is on the exam. Doesn't test over the book only the notes. She compares to real life examples and makes it easier to understand material. Would definitely take her again if i got the option. Sometimes gives extra credit for attending lectures,1
"Olzman is extremely knowledgable on a wide range of topics discussed in class. You won't only get Communications knowledge, but you'll also learn a lot about social topics in the world. They're really a great human being and you'll be taught a lot about yourself. Show up and enjoy the class and you'll pass.",1
I enjoyed this Psychology class very much. I took this class for winter session and Professor was very organized and professional. She made the class fun and interesting. She related life issues to the lecture which helped remember the information during the test. She is also was very attentive. I hold this professor to very high regard.,1
"You will pass easily if you attend and do the work on time. Grading was fair. She gave good feedback, and had a couple of model papers posted which gave me a good idea of what to do. Don't forget things and make sure to turn in things on time. You do have to take the time to understand the course organization.",1
"A very poor professor.  All he does is throw formulas on the board.  He will brush questions off to the side because he has no interest in engaging with students.  Exams are very tough, but he puts his head down and does not care if half of the class cheats.  Overall, quite a shame since the material is very interesting.",0
"I dislike science, but this is the best breadth course!! I learned a ton of important info also. Attendance not mandatory, but definitely watch the lectures. He's super helpful, passionate, and knowledgable, willing to answer any and all questions! I highly suggest taking this class.",1
Took this course in winter; departmental Final 50% and MindTap works 50%. The Final is 40MC questions in 2 hours. Final is much easier than practice tests. so do the work and you will be fine. Prof is willing to help and respond soon. Make some efforts and you will be fine for this course though she grades based on ranking.,1
Awesome teacher! Very helpful and wants see her student succeed.,1
"Matthew truly cares about the success of his students, as well as the topics he discusses in class. This class was eye opening and I learned a lot about topics I didn't know much about. Matthew created a class community where we felt like we could discuss issues as a class. 10/10 would recommend him.",1
"Prof. Thompson is super kind, caring and approachable. So glad I took his class. He's accessible during office hours and helps you figure out how to get the grade you want based on your scores. Lectures are worth your time and exams are fair. Also, do the extra credit opportunity! If you put in the time, you will do well.",1
"Prof. Olzman is an amazing professor. She is passionate about teaching and it shows. Also, go see her during office hours. She appreciates out -of-class participation. She's great one-on-one too. I got so much help on my speeches and helped with my grade.",1
"Amazing! He really cares about his students, he wants you to become a better writer and he relates to his students and lets that be what the papers are about. You can choose topics and as long as you show up and put a little bit of effort into the class you pass with ease.",1
great,1
Interesting lectures. Makes you interested in mental health.,1
"If you enjoy taking 3 hour tests online that requires u to memorize 3-4 chapters of the book plus his power points and theeen an in class quiz the day after the online test which you know ur gonna fail because its so hard he even knows it himself, take him :) Other than that he is a very knowledgable man and you will learn a lot about business lol",0
Tom is a really great guy but his 8am lecture about Family Business seems pointless to go to most of the time until he starts randomly taking attendance. There are no tests which is super nice but there are 2 pretty big projects and about 5 reading summaries which just take time.,1
Mr. Schultz is a great down to earth instructor. His lectures are short and to the point. I would extremely recommend him as he is one of the best instructors in the program. Wish I would have found him sooner in the program.,1
I always tell fellow science undergrads to take a class with Anne. Incredibly passionate and thoughtful teacher. Definitely would like to have her as a professor again.,1
Love this class. Tests is multiple choice  and they're easy if you study only! He truly cares about his students and wants you to learn. Definitely recommend him.,1
"She was a very nice woman but definitely bad at teaching. Her lectures are all powerpoints which she basically just reads off of and posts them, but she takes attendance. She gives extra credit and has weekly homework but they aren't hard. Also gives study guides for exams that are so long. Exams were harder than expected though.",0
"Personality in one phrase: Hey, man, before you can learn anything about math, first, you gotta to learn to chill. Teaching method in one phrase: The shortest distance between two points is a straight line. He has a super chill personality, lectures very directly, and grades fairly. He breaks down confusing math issues into coherent step by steps.",1
"Patte is a great painter/sculptor. She is very respectful to anyone who wants to seriously Learn, if you are just taking classes and not wanting to be an artist, she doesn't favor your hobby!",1
I was unsure about her at first but she was an ok teacher and she is nice. I didn't learn much in the class but there weren't many assignments and she is an easy grader. She can be hard to understand sometimes and struggles to communicate what she wants from an assignment. Her class is pretty boring and we really don't do much while we are there.,1
"Sullivan is an interesting person and knows his material, however, I did not enjoy this class at all. If you have the opportunity, take with someone else. Very disorganized! His exams are completely ambiguous and not related to the material. We had a project/paper with no direction. He never answered email and wasn't available during office hours.",0
Dr. Nikkel is a great teacher. He responds quickly if you send him an email and are unsure of something. Watch his videos several times because they are helpful when doing the homework assignments. He is fair in his grading and will leave feedback. There is no final exam. This class is a challenge but you will learn so much.,1
"Costanza was my favorite professor this semester by far! He was interesting, fun to listen to, and all around just a really great guy. His lectures can be a little long, but as long as you review the chapter for the test that week and participate in class discussion, you should easily make an A in the class!",1
Whip smart redhead with a wit to boot. She is extremely passionate about sign language and loves to watch students improve. Take her class seriously and you will do fine.,1
Show up to class and do your homework,1
Lectures mainly consist of going over slides in class and some demonstrations on computer in programs/commands. Seems to care little for student success. Understandable in lecture but posted documents and assignment descriptions are absolutely awful. Very hard to understand what is being asked of you for many assignments without further questions.,0
"Graham is awful. His quizzes are unscheduled and so much of the quiz material isnt taught before the quiz is given. The tests are worth way more than they should be. You can fall as many quizzes as you want and be fine, but if you do bad on one test you may as well kiss your grade goodbye unless you do amazing on everything else.",0
"BEST TEACHER I'VE EVER HAD. Math has never come easy to me, until this class. He is SO patient and caring .. he really cares and makes sure you understand! i will be taking him again for my next math!",1
"Goldenbaum is such a great professor.   She is extremely knowledgable, and presents super complex concepts with clarity.  This class forever changed my understanding of religion, science, philosophy and history.",1
"Instructions were clear as to the submission requirements.  As with any online class, the disscussion board is an important part with clear writing requirements.  I thourouly enjoyed the online environment.",1
"okay whoever said jeri is bad is an idiot. shes not the head of the art department for nothing people. shes compassionate, caring and ALWAYS makes time for people. she helped me get my art program up and running. im so happy MU has her, and shes the head of the department. great professor, great person.",1
"Charlotte is great! Understands the difficulty of learning a new language, explains everything clearly, flexible with work, will meet with you if needed, and conducts a fun class. Knows english and french equally well so professor-student communication is clear.",1
"I loved having Birkett as my professor, her lectures are interesting without deviating from the information, she adds an interesting neurological spin to PSY 101.",1
This teacher is one word. RUDE. she is passive aggressive and kind of a bully. She asks these long winded confusing unclear questions and when no one answers them she lashes out. god bless the poor souls that try to answer the questions. Oh but don't ask her to repeat herself because she'll just tell you she doesn't remember what she just said. ,0
Class is impossible and professor does not teach. Only class I did not get an A in this semester.,0
great class very easy!! Reconmend for Comp. Sci. 201,1
"Nina is fabulous! I had her for philosophy of literature, and it was excellent. Not only is the content super interesting (lots of different readings, but they aren't dull), but she gives you room for creativity in the assignments, which isn't very common (at least not that I've found). Take her class!!!!!!",1
"I'm telling you now, never write about abortion and race. Dr. Kelly is very opinionated. You know how most teacher are paid to grade you on content, well she doesn't do that. If you write about something she doesn't like, don't be surprised if she argues with you in a conference and gives you a C because you dont feel the same way. DONT TAKE HER",0
"Took her course on Mad Men. Awesome class. Cool show to watch and I actually like the readings. The show really did its homework. Dr. B gives grades and feedback quick (journals, posts, essays). Definitely going to take her again.",1
Pretty cool class. Try not to fall behind. Do the weekly review!,1
"Great professor! You have to read and go to class to get a solid grade. Very fair, group project can be tough but totally worth it you learn a lot from the class. Professor Carr was completely engaged and office hours were great resource. Last note the quizzes are the hardest part, recommend flash cards and Read in class notes.",1
"Excellent professor. His class is not hard and his lectures are great. Even though I had his class at 8am I still enjoyed showing up. His exams include some topics that are discussed in class and not only in the slides and reading, so much sure you show up. He is very friendly and funny!!",1
"Whitaker is a very knowledgeable professor. Informative and entertaining lectures, and a light work load. Only a few assignments and quizzes, and two exams (mid-term, final). If you want to retain the material from this course, I would strongly recommend taking this class in person instead of online. If you're just looking for a grade, take either.",1
"Great prof. Cares deeply about the subject. Definitely is invested in his students. The method he teaches is pretty niche though, so it is hard to find a mediation center that practices it.",1
I recommend Donna to everyone. She's amazing!,1
"Honestly he made this class bearable and enjoyable. I tried 3013 once before, had to drop it, then took it over the summer with Alek. He's passionate, intelligent, and genuinely wants to see us do well. His lectures aren't boring, and he's very helpful in and outside of the classroom! Don't skip out on taking his class!",1
"Mrs. Atwood is an awesome professor. I took her class for Intro to Criminal Justice. There is a textbook and some textbook readings, but her lectures are awesome and informative. She is well respected and returns grades in a timely manner. Would definitely take her class again!!",1
Judith was a playwright who steals ideas from her students.,0
She is so sweet! Go to her office hours to see the exam or for help. She'll answer anything and tell you how to study. It's really nice to have a professor who doesn't ridicule you for your questions!,1
"Had a bit of a problem with this professor,  I am slated to walk across the stage and get my diploma in 5 days, and the man still has not graded any of our assignments....  I will give credit where it is due, he is very knowledgeable, and intelligent.  But a poor teacher, he slacks very hard and just curves the final exam and passes people.",0
Birch was very knowledgeable about Latin America.  I enjoyed the videos and case studies we went over.  I would recommend her class and I would take another class from her.,1
"She has a very thick Russian accent, can be very difficult to understand at times. If you plan on missing class much, she isn't the professor for you.",1
"He was one of my best Professors of my first semester. His class is super easy doesn't care for attendance just be aware when quizzes are due because if u miss one your grade will drop significantly, just study for the quizzes and you're golden. He is so fair with any sort of test he gives! I respect him so much, Highly recommend !!",1
"Prepare yourself to read and watch a few videos, then discuss the information. If you read the textbook you should do well on the quizzes and tests. I took this course over the summer,  it was intense; and since it was online discussions, homework, and quizzes were all online. Good class, informative, and if you do the work you should easily pass.",1
"Professor O'Hanlon is a very educated professor, goes off topic from time to time but makes the class very interesting and I enjoyed her class! Comes off as a very tough woman however she truly cares about her students and is a softie..",1
"Great guy, very intelligent. The comments that call his attitude into question: he can be a little sarcastic, but he never lets his disagreement with a student turn into disrespect. He would speak to me during class breaks; very personable, very intelligent. Recommend as a professor, especially if you can get him in a small class setting.",1
I have had Kubota sensei for several classes now and she definitely stands out as the best Japanese teacher at EMU. However she is very strict and sometimes brutally honest. If you can't handle that sort of thing don't take her class.,1
Eh,1
Horrible.. no passion to actually teach. Seems like she likes to assert her authority or dominance onto students. Constantly makes kids feel uncomfortable in the middle of a lecture. Very unprofessional presence in the classroom. Doesnt know what partial credit means. All She is good for is putting your test threw the scantron.,0
"She really is a nice lady, but I cannot recommend her online class as a full-time student. Extremely heavy workload. Final exam ruined my grade when I had been passing for most of the semester. Only half of the students earned a B or above, and the average was 71%. I felt like the course was way too challenging for an introductory language class.",0
Joanna is my favorite professor so far! She teaches language in a way that gets you very comfortable with speaking as the classes are mainly conversational while all the very technical stuff is covered in the textbook so we can just focus on specific questions and utilization of things in class. Joanna is also incredibly caring and reasonable.,1
"He's kind of all over the place, we pretty much focused on the same topic all semester so I didn't feel like I learned all that much. He has a very specific way of thinking so on assignments and tests you have to keep that in mind. Overall I really wish I hadn't taken this class.",0
"Helpful and detailed lectures, but they can sometimes be very confusing and the graded Top Hat questions can be somewhat vague. The homework she assigns also frequently does not line up with what was learned in class that week. For example, we've had several concepts on homework that we didn't learn until the week after the due date.",1
"I have always struggled with math, but I ended up with an A in this class because she was easy to understand and gave many examples. She was very kind and worked with me. I have never had a professor as patient as this woman. I really enjoyed her class. Do your best to show up to class. Be sure to walk in with a smile. :)",1
grad student. Cares about students' success in class. Quizzes every class. Lab is harder than lecture but lecture exams are very fair and only test important material.,1
"Dr. Capper is by far one of the best professors on campus.  He is extremely helpful and kind, and always finds ways to help his students understand the material.  I had Rel 131 with him, and I also went to India with him last summer.  Do not believe a harsh word anyone says!  If you want to learn, take him!",1
"Super nice guy and very understanding. The only reason you really have to go to class is because there are a lot of in class activities that add up for points in the end, other than that the material is really easy if you have basic scientific/world issue knowledge. The only thing is that he's very specific with what he wants you to write for tests",1
Debra was a great possessor who certainly cared about her students. She is honest and funny too. If you're struggling definitely reach out because she will help you no questions asked.,1
"Great teacher. He is there to help and he makes sure that you understand everything. Take his class, I highly recommend it.",1
Extrememly easy! Cancels class ALOT! Do all the homework assignments! Guaranteed an A!,1
AMAZING! Gives great feedback on one's work and he will tell you straight up what he thinks. Listen to what he tells you! I would take him again. Attendance is mandatory so always show up if you don't want to fail.,1
"You get 5 or so exams throughout the entire semester and that's it. Homework is voluntary and can be done for extra credit. Chambers is entertaining and is one of those professors that if you take the time to communicate with him and are vocal about your needs in the class, he'll do everything in his power to help you.",1
"Mr. Papageorgiu is one of the BEST teachers I have ever had. He's very social, down to earth, and makes the whole class laugh. He gave us good points on how to be good teachers to future students, to try to interact with them more. And that's exactly what he did with us.. You will not regret his class.",1
"I took Prof Ryan for a 7 AM 4 day Winter Physio class and it was a lot eaiser than I expected. The lectures were long, but informative, and everything he tested on was from his lectures and some from the free textbook's chapter review questions. He's a super chill guy and has an upbeat voice to keep you awake. Take him and do your work, youll pass!",1
"Good online class, if it is a 7 week course expect every week one or two easy assignments will take you no more than 1 hr and 30 min to do it. Then every week you get a quiz. ( take your time on the quiz because she gets little specific things from the book) plus quizzes are not timed. You definitely have to get the book just for the quizzes.",1
I am absolutely not interested in Biology. I realized a month into the class I was naturally tuning him out. Curves & extra credit is how I achieved a B. Overall a polite & funny guy that gets the struggle is real; occasionally veers off course on a random tangent that is quite entertaining. Read the chapter Show up Take notes STUDY Ask questions.,1
"I don't understand most of these negative reviews. He is probably one of the best math teachers I have ever had. He breaks down the information well and makes it easy to understand. I honestly think that if all math teachers taught math like him, more people would be better at math.",1
"Don't take her awful class.  It's easy, but not worth it at all. I would explain but moderators would rather me not,just,.keep looking for another prof. Rebecca Mugford, if she's still teaching is amazing. Had a friend take her course while I took this, so much more interesting of a lecturer and can actually say learned more from her than Adelle.",0
Such an amaizing teacher.,1
"(This course was taken during COVID, so take this with a grain of salt) Falk is a nice, kind man, but he is the worst professor I've ever had in my life and I no longer want to pursue a math minor because of him. I feel like I am paying thousands of dollars to teach myself the content on YouTube because he never provides solid, concrete examples.",0
Prof. Tompson is the best!!! Absolutely loved PS101 :) Very funny and helpful during office hours. She really cares for her students and wants them to succeed.,1
"Nia Mahallati's Procurements/Contract Law course at Webster university is extremely informative. She is very knowledgeable and well respected in her field. She also brings her government contracting experience to the course, which is very practical (especially for those of us working in this field in the Washington DC area). Recommend this prof.",1
She is too strict.,0
Marks is not a teacher I would recommend. All we do in class is read the book then do homework online which is not helpful at all. I hate going to class and he is a very tough grader. It has made me loathe Spanish this semester. He is nice but just not a good teacher.,0
"she is stern but really wants you to do well.  if you care about your work then she will go out of her way to help you.  she is always available to help and is really nice when you go see her.  i loved her and wish i could take her again for all my english classes!!! Take her but don't expect to just ease through and get an A, you will have to work",1
"Dr. Fetter is one of the best professors I've ever had. The person hating on his MK 384 class clearly did not take the time to study or go to class. You will have to do a lot of studying out of class, but he lectures about really useful stuff and provides great real-world examples. Take this class if you want to become smarter not as a easy A.",1
He's funny and good at explaining things.,1
Jana is an amazing professor who really cares about the classes she teaches. The class wasn't mandatory but to really understand the class and be able to write your final paper you should really go! Only graded on a few things and a big final paper.,1
"Easy papers, use good MLA format and get good grades.",1
"This was honestly one of the hardest classes I have ever taken in my life. His tests are extremely hard, and the Excel chapter of the course was the hardest test ever. All in all he is a great professor. He offers a TON of extra credit, you even get extra credit by participating in class. Just know that you will have to do a ton of outside work.",1
Outrageous expectations for students in an INTRO(!!!!!) to ASL course. Will not slow down to help students who have trouble. Syllabus full of threats...serious attitude problem.,0
"This was a very challenging course for me. Graded on few things and the final is worth 60% of the grade (cumulative exam). Very caring professor though, pretty hilarious, and easy to get ahold of which is key for difficult concepts. Cool guy. Podcasts his lectures so I never had to come to class, but WATCH. Also, OPEN TEXTBOOK EXAMS, BUT NO E-BOOKS",1
Here is all you need to know. He is NOT a good teacher and will not respond to emails or calls. He WILL give you the TEST as a study guide the week before. You are dumb if you don't get an A in this class.,0
Class was an easy A. The hardest thing was sitting through two and a half hour lectures. His accent was difficult to understand at times.,1
Spencer is one of the clearest professors I've had at BYU. He makes difficult concepts easy to grasp and he's very fun and skilled. He knows Arabic!! His class is organized in a way that requires you to be prepared for each class. Your Arabic will dramatically improve. He's not the easiest professor in the world but it's doable and you'll learn,1
"What everyone else said.  Very hard, 5 hrs of homework a night.  A really good teacher willing to help you.",1
"Mrs. Holmes is an incredible professor and does an extremely good job at helping you understand the concepts of the lessons. No one gets left behind and always a fun lesson, I wish Mrs. Holmes could teach every math class I have throughout the rest of my college career.",1
"Great professor. He's understanding, accommodating and helpful (very accessible for extra help!)... Takes the time to remember every students name, which reflects his dedication to his class and students.",1
"Professor Vanhorn is literally one of the easiest English teacher's I have ever taken. 90% of assignments are discussion board posts, which she won't drastically reduce points for going under or posting a day late. Her essays are easy as well. Very non-academic in nature. She lets you write in first-person, and doesn't really require sources.",1
Alisa is an amazing teacher!! I was terrified of taking math and I passed with a B! I would suggest to ANYONE needing to take 015 to take it from Alisa.,1
"If you show up, you'll be fine. However, just warning you that the tests are a bit difficult. If you are on top of your assignments, you will be fine. Just know that the tests are EXTREMELY DIFFICULT.",0
She never replies to emails,0
"He is a great professor for Music class. If you won't be able to catch up easily, he will be going to repeat it again. Get ready because he will have you do a term paper, listening logs and concert reports. You can ask him to extend the deadlines for all of these. He gives a lot of extra credit points. Be sure to attend and never miss class. ",1
"This is the worst History professor that I have met so far! she thinks that her class is the only one that we take during the semester, and make you read a lot for every single class. Avoid her at any cost!!",0
"SF STATE, had him for Stats. It was his first time teaching the subject so he was just getting the hang of things which is completely understandable. Very chill guy. Exams based on lecture and/or homework questions. Can be a bit difficult to understand him as he confuses himself at times, but is willing to answer questions for clarification!",1
"Her grading criteria sucks! 60% is based on test 10% is on hmwrk.  If your not good in math, My suggestion is keep looking.  She purposely makes the test hard so you can fail. When she grades your test she marks you off for every lil thing even though it is correct.",0
Lectures about his own time in politics,1
Very sweet ! Brought food every class and not that much work only did 3 essays and I passed !,1
Terrible. Toughest pickiest grader ever. Terrible long boring lectures. Unfair in general. Takes 6 tries to say something. Babbles way too long ab irrelevant things. 0/10 avoid him if possible,0
You can tell he knows his stuff but it is kind of difficult understanding what he's teaching. Tests are difficult.,0
"His grading is extremely hard, loves to talk down to people and seems full of himself. This is a capstone course, so it's required. Before taking this course, make sure that you ask your regular legal research instructor to teach you how to write up legal memos and how to prepare legal forms b/c Wiley will not. Good luck!",0
"She gave great examples toward real world expierences. Her slide shows may be boring but she gives you the information needed to know for all test. she prepares you for test questions with her teaching. she makes sure you understand the topics and the material. Plus there is ZERO homework. All you need to do is take notes and study, no busy work.",1
"He is an awful professor. He is very condescending, very mundane and boring and makes you feel stupid for asking questions. Advisors and tougher professors alike dislike him and tell students to avoid him at all costs. He's simply not a pleasant man. He doesn't know how to teach students that aren't science majors and teaches them all like they are",0

Zeng is a good teacher. She gives a lot of homework and quizzes so exams aren't heavily weighted. She curves all exams and even the entire class at the end of the semester. I ended with a 100% in the class.,1
"I loved how organized the class was, and you knew your grade at any given time. His exams were quite difficult, and I found myself studying for hours just to get a B. However, there are lots of ways to rack up points with easy class quizzes and labs. You definitely learn the material well in this class, and I suggest finding a study partner.",1
"Dr. Draper's Environmental Policy, Law, and Society class is great. She is well versed in her profession; she delivers clear and concise lectures, and she uses real-world examples. Even with all her credentials (Ph.D., J.D.) she is very much in touch with her students. She genuinely wants her students to succeed in and out of the classroom.",1
"Decent professor. You will think you don't know squat based on the quizzes (pop quizzes, by the way). Study hard for the final and do the homework. The material might seem hard in the beginning, but it really isn't.",1
"Ridiculously hard for online classes. Be prepared to either know math beforehand, know someone who can tutor you intensely or teach yourself. I'm an A student and worked my rear off to barely get an A. I can't even say I learned a much so it wasn't helpful for future use... Would not recommend.",0
coolest teacher ever...,1
The class is hard just like any statistics class but he explains it in a way that you understand! He leaves videos of step by step how to do it before your assignments. Its up to you to view them and study.,1
I really like her teaching style; really recommend her. I spoke almost fluent Italian when I went to Milano because of her. She's got the skills; no joke,1
This class is only hard if you don't use the resources available to you. If you complete his review sheets and ask for feedback you'll be successful in the class.,1
"Dr. Batman is a great professor and is absolutely hilarious. If you answer all the questions on a test, it's almost not possible to make below a 50 because he gives half credit on missed multiple choice questions. His lectures are good and interesting due to his dry humor, and he is almost always on campus. He is pretty awkward outside class.",1
"Good professor, keep him on your schedule he is definitely worth it.",1
Dixon-Brown or DB as we call her gives out a lot of group assignments. Her class is by no means easy but it will definitely help you in the long run. Her projects require community involvement and her quizzes are sporadic. Be ready to work hard and step out of your comfort zone.,1
"Dr. McCorquodale is kind of unusual given he is from industry so he has a different style. He's also kind of funny. He doesn't like administration much. I did get the sense that it was difficult to organize such a large class. It was really a ton of work, but I think I've learned more from his class than any class I've taken at Michigan so far.",1
Really genuine and interested in making sure everyone understands the information! And very open to suggestions on how she could make the class more enjoyable and clear.,1
"First two weeks was terrible but after the first Exam it got easier and easier. Prof. Simona gives a lot of Extra Credit. She is heavy with lectures. It was hard to listen to her long lectures at first, then I got used to it and was able to get a solid A.",1
"3 Hours means three hours. You have snow days? Be ready to stay till 10-10:30. The man wants to get his point across. Only problem with him is if he didn't tell so many stories, we'd be out at 9:15.",1
"BEST TEACHER!! You'll never find a teacher who cares more about their students. Take her!! Do not buy the book, you won't need it. She gives out study guides that are pretty much the test and the tests are open notes soooo its pretty easy.",1
"The best teacher. Motivates you to do better everytime.Extremely helpful and guides you to your goal. Take Mehmeti, you won't be sorry. Whoever sais anything else, they don't know what they're talking about.",1
"Classes were alright for the most part. However, she expects too much work out of students, especially for pretty unclear, uninteresting ""projects"" in class. You won't know your grade until you get it. ",0
"I agree with the last comment - No one bash Jeri! She is the best prof at MU in my opinion. She grades fairly and is very positive, kind, helpful and smart.  She really knows what she's talking about and explains it very well.  I wish more teachers were like her!",1
He was a very interesting professor but do try to stay on his good side so that you don't feel intimidated asking for help or clarification. His lectures were a bit confusing because he often goes on a tangent and you're not sure if you're going to be tested on certain aspects. Spec half of the course is more interesting than the kinetics aspect.,1
"Prof. Kolluru is a good professor. However, I believe she is bored with teaching. Her in-class lectures are great, she engages with students. The tough part is the exams. They are nothing like homework or practice material. She will ask you to remember formulas never covered in her class and has questions and has sections designed to trick you.",0
Mr Holt was an excellent teacher & the class was super easy.I'd recommend him to everyone!!!!,1
She's a sweet women,1
Does video and written feedback. Respond to more than required for full discussion credit. Pretty good teacher. Would take her again.,1
"No lecture. Asynchronous. One discussion/quiz a week. Weekly assigned readings/sometimes film. Easy workload, interesting assignments, the amount of stuff you learn is amazing and you never get bored. Favorite class I've taken. Prof has a pretty passive role, gives class as a whole feedback, quick email responses if you reach out. Easy A.",1
"Professor Cintron is experienced, knowledgeable, and caring. I have taken a few classes with her and enjoyed them all. She genuinely wants students to learn and to feel prepared for real world applications. She is warm and friendly and listens to student feedback. She cares and it shows. If you want to learn, take her class.",1
"Dr. Hollis is very enthusiastic about Biology, which makes his lectures engaging. His class is a lot of work with 3 assignments per week, but that helps to cushion your grade. His class requires you to be on top of your work, but he is very helpful  and seems to genuinely care about students and his class. DON'T SKIP CLASS. You will miss quizzes.",1
Dr. Leikind is a sweet man. His class is worth it. Every class you have a quiz when you first get to class. People complain about it but there are tons of quizlets of the answers so its not hard to get good grades on the quizes. The exams are the quizes. Its not a hard class if you pay attention and not mess around on your computer the whole time.,1
nice dude,1
"One of the nicest people at NAU! It would be a sign of the apocalypse if she yelled at anyone. The classes for PSY 101 are always too big to be anything but lectures, but Dr. Birkett tries to make her lectures interesting with examples and activities. Very straightforward regarding expectations and assignments. Overall good experience in this class",1
"Dr. Sun was a great professor, fairly easy class if you pay attention and review the powerpoints. She was a little hard to understand but all in all a great intro class.",1
"Amazing professor. Had her for engineering 102 and I wish I had taken her for 101. This class was not super easy, there was plenty of work to do, but she made it interesting and was really helpful with anything I needed help with.",1
"He moves too fast in lecture. When he ""works out"" problems in class he just puts a previously worked out problem on the projector and has a contest with himself to see how fast he can go through it. ",0
"He mumbles too fast to understand anything, it always feels scattered! I have needed to read the textbook to understand a concept he tried to teach a few times in class. Quizzes/tests are inconsistent in difficulty. If you are thinking of taking astronomy, take it with the other prof. She's much better. I'll get a good grade but its so frustrating!",0
One of the best professors at ISU. she is very knowledgeable and approachable. Her class is very interesting.Highly recommended.,1
"McKenna is a real human being with a heart worn on his sleeve. I didn't really get the whole thing until after the class was long over. Then I really came to appreciate this amazing man. he is trying to get students to think for themselves, to see beyond the veil. Quite a character and about as down to earth as it gets.",1
"He is a very helpful professor. We transitioned to zoom because of corona and he has been so accessible and always loves when you participate. He doesn't really specifically teach you certain verb tenses or things like that, but encourages you to ask him about them.",1
"Pentateuch was so good and the book he wrote I actually read back to back. Schnittjer is the bomb. So good that I took him for another class. But hey, I'm a good student who isn't lazy sooooo if your a lazy student looking for an easy A you might not get it with this class. But if you are ready to learn then his Pentateuch and OT class are for you!",1
"Show up to class and you will be fine, Definitely do all the homework she assigns and you will pass the class as a lot of it will be on tests. Only issue I ever had with her was me oversleeping during a test which I was up studying for, she did not let me make it up, so I only got 3 tries to get it all instead of 4. Still made an A.",1
Scanlon is rude. No way around it. I was afraid to ever ask questions and he made me uber nervous in lab. Avoid taking him at all costs. ,0
This Professor has very broad and in-depth knowledge in several areas of science. His vast research experience makes him explain any difficult topic with nice examples. He possesses hands on technical experience.,1
"Dr. Nifakis is beyond amazing! She makes the classes very engaging that you look forward to having the class every week. She is extremely knowledgeable, kind, and caring.",1
"Aight so Idk if other bio curriculum has the poster project, but it was pretty time consuming especially near the end of the semester with other finals. There are 3 exams, 1 final. There should be a 4th exam instead of that poster project imo. 6 quizzes with lowest one dropped. Bio MCQ are always tricky so go to her office hrs to review em. Gluck",1
"This is literally the nicest teacher I've ever had! He helps out students SO MUCH even when they're completely undeserving. I mean he will let you make up the written compositions (which there's only three of, and he grades them so easily). If you want an EASY A take this class!!",1
"Very sweet woman but a bad teacher. I've found myself sitting in class looking at her with my mouth open and my brain being fried by the confusion. she understands that we don't speak Spanish fluently, so she teaches ONLY in Spanish. yea... not good. needless to say, i have 3 classes left and can't even imagine if Ive passed or failed. ",0
He doesn't excuse being sick even if you have a note. Almost never uses chalkboard. You do homework online and its very disorganized. I had to contact Dr. Baretta for specific webpage as the prof required it but had no idea how to assist us.  He is not helpful and is never at his office during office hours. It's pathetic. Good luck if you take him.,0
He starts the class by asking simple questions about marketing/companies and drives the marketing concept from that simple statement. One of the best classes I've taken so far. Highlight of the course is student's presentations on cases and professor's solution. So it is very hard to forget the case - I am a mba student;,1
"Nice guy but I hate his class. A lot of homework and projects. Also, have a midterm and final. he grades really harshly and ridiculous. If you're not very familiar with excel and access microsoft don't take his class.",0
Amazing professor!!!!!,1
This class is the best class you will take at WSBE. It was helpful and you'll learn a lot about yourself.,1
"Kathy is so so funny. Online quizzes (open book/note) ... I never took notes, I only showed up to class and participated in discussions and passed with an A. No ""Final"". You literally just have to show up. interesting content, she is great at what she does. Book is free online as well!",1
No Comments,1
"Chances are, you are taking 282 with Benny because you have to. The class is difficult, and Benny does not make it easier. That being said, if you ask for help, advocate for yourself, Benny will make your life easier. The textbook is wonderful. Benny will teach you. He will not be your best professor, but he will not be your worst either.",1
"Ronda is a fantastic teacher.  Truly an inspiration.  She does have definite ideas on what is right and wrong, but she has a good sense of humor and is a true pro at what she does.  She enjoys teaching, and it shows.  She will truly teach you how to sew.  After one class with her, I got ""the bug"" to learn more.",1
"Is angry before the class even starts. Yells every word for no reason. Takes enjoy in humiliating you in front of the class and loves to make you feel stupid. Ive been taking classes for a couple years and Ive never had a professor so inappropriate, rude, and condescending.",0
"Uses Matlab to avoid teaching. Super nice and has a lot of talk but cannot explain the topics. I think she is still faking it till she can make it. I had to retake course on transfer. Stay away. I don't understand why she was hired, they clearly did not ask students their thoughts.",0
"If you're ok with paying $600 to read research papers, this class is for you. Weekly quizzes and assignments based on a paper. Midterm and final are also on a paper. Expectations are very unclear and lectures are fast, disorganized and very little useful information is ever provided. Worst class I've attended in three years at UBCO.",0
"Best professor I've ever had while at UNCC, you can tell she actually cares about her students. I highly recommend taking any class she offers! Class was only held when it was needed and the days we did attend a class she made it fun and easy. She is also the most reasonable professor I've ever had.",1
"Intro to programming and problem solving. Midterm: 30% and final: 35%. Probably the toughest class to take. Assignments 20% but there's no help. There's no tutorial or anything, and book doesn't help. He expects you to figure out java coding by yourself. Lets just say if you have no idea about programming then you will fail.",0
She is indeed rude on email. Everything is online. You study by yourself and take the exams online. The Examity she used doesnt work sometimes. And I missed the midterm for some tech issues. Not recommended!,0
"Very nice, enthusiastic in her teaching, builds good relationship with her students, always concerned for student progress, and very helpful.",1
I am TERRIBLE at math and Bella made sure I did not fall behind and that I passed. She is definitely one of the best teachers out there.,1
Killed any interest I might have in Spanish. An incredible amount of class time is spent with her rambling about her family in Spain. Please read other comments on this page--they are absolutely rght.,0
Val is one of those teachers you try desperately to please for some reason. She is amazing  but if you aren't her favorite you will feel left out. She coached several of us for URTA's each of her favorite students got more time and ended up benefiting from her contacts at colleges.,1
"Not many tests, just 3 big speeches and a couple of smaller ones. But when you do get exams they can be difficult and graded hard, don't go over studying for exam as much as like the speeches. Can be a tough grader during speeches. She does offer help for your speeches you just have to ask her and she'll tell you a clear answer of what she expects.",1
Very relaxed professor who knows Music Appreciation. It's a great class.,1
"I came in HATING math but after taking the class with Prof Wells I understood the material very well. Show up to class, do the work, and Id recommend visitng the tutoring center if you dont have the time to visit her during her office hours. Class is easy as long as you put in your time and effort. Prof Wells is amazing 10/10 recommended.",1
"Don't even get me started on this dude. Went into the class with 6 years of studying French and after it, I dropped my french minor. Took him on Tues, and Thurs and don't expect anything less then 2-3 hours of homework per class period. Tests are ea breeze but good luck getting ANYTHING above a B on each homework. don't take. Seriously...",0
"if you are a science major i highly recommend this prof, you will learn the material if you apply yourself, chemistry is not a class you cheat, you either learn it or not and avila puts you in position to succeed, do all the work requested and you will get a b, slack off and be lazy you won't do well, put the time in and an A is very attainable",1
"I really liked Steve personality wise, funny dude, pretty easy to get along with, total nerd, definitely likable. As far as the math goes, it was college level algebra, which is not a basic class, but it's not a really hard class, and I feel its a bit beneath him to teach it, so he teaches it that way and its not always easy to follow for some.",1
Great photo teacher. Though he does make it obvious that there is a such thing as a dumb question so you have to pay attention to detail.  Very venerable for knowledge photography. Has lots of cool gadgets to show you historical things and also things you need. You watch many videos. Aced every test. Always available.  Semi-hard critiques. Cool guy,1
Horrible! She hates her students is the simple way to put it. Never responded to my email from 3 weeks ago. Does not care at all,0
"He is a great young professor from Germany. Once you get past the accent which isnt that bad, the material flows quite easily. Just ask any questions when you have a problem, and he will help you. We used Connect for all of the HW and quizzes. However, quizzes didnt mesh well with lecture notes. Overall, one of the better picks for intro econ.",1
"At first I thought class would be difficult, but he was very helpful, and stayed after class to provide extra help. He even inluded his home number. I received a B in the class and did not purchase the book, although it was highly recommended. If you pay attention and go to him for extra help you will pass this class.",1
"If you don't go to class you will not pass the tests. Lectures and content is easy, it's just the listening part on tests that is what kills you. Very clear about expectations from the start, nice guy but comes off as kinda arrogant. Hard class to have as an 8am. Bring coffee or find a different time.",0
"Frau Adam was the best German professor I've had at UGA. She is very caring and strives to make sure that every student understands the chapters and language. Classes are very much application-based, comprising mostly of interacting with classmates and speaking German with one another. Tests are very straightforward.",1
Louise is a very caring professor that you can freely talk to about concerns. Her assignments were a bit confusing and her tests were very tricky (to avoid cheating she asks questions like which one of these statements is false). Her 4 midterms were all open-notes and multiple choice but you only have a limited-time so be careful.,1
"Very conservative, and almost only points out viewpoints he agrees with.  Dismissive if differing views are presented in class.  Reading material included text on global warming not being real, and ""all poor people choose to be poor or are disabled.""",1
"There aren't a lot of lectures involved. She gives a very large amount of homework but as long as you go through the lectures before you do it, you should pass pretty easily.",1
oh my god what should i start with. first the class is way harder than it seems. u have to do so much work besides walking in the field for 4 hrs regardless of the weather. carry bag full of books 4 every class. quizes are redicules. be prepared to know all the trees and flowers that u see and know everythiing he says. ton of memorization.,1
"I have taken her online Math 108 and found that she is extremely helpful when I need something. She has reopened all of our quizzes and homeworks to get a better grade, if you choose not to do this you need to live with the grade you were given. I would suggest not taking all your quiz chances the first time and save a couple later.",1
"She can be hypocritical at times, will expect coding to be done in a short period of time. But the content isn't too terrible for an entry level class and she usually provides good help",1
"I highly recommend Professor Harvey's prose class. Our class discussions were engaging, and the readings were (often) enjoyable. As for professor Harvey, he was a kind and funny guy whose mellow attitude never intimidated me. You can't go wrong taking his class.",1
"I LOVE ADRIANO. I had him online this semester, and he was the best. He is so caring and made class enjoyable and interacted even through zoom. Homework is not that bad either. He ended every zoom with ""Have fun, be safe, and don't drink"". I love this man!!!",1
She might not be the best instructor but she really cares for her students & very understanding. She is still new & getting used to teaching; there is not much to teach in crit think & philosophy! It's all self-study. Gives good feedback and respectful towards students. A lot better than other teachers for the same courses in SAIT. Super Nice!!,1
"Dr. Mirsurda is really passionate about the material, but I don't think he relates it to the students. He doesn't give a lot of homework so I you don't do well there isn't much of a buffer. He often speaks the whole lecture, so it's hard to follow for 75 minutes. He often gives snarky responses to the students when they ask questions.",0
"Lectures can be slow and boring. Aside from that, the material is interesting . Professor Coleman is clear on due dates and he posts all the work, study guides, power points, and notes on black board. Very helpful! He also post grades the day he hands you your papers. Love it when teachers are this on top of it! you have everything you need.",1
"One of the best professors I have had, ever! She is so nice and helpful, and is also great at lecturing. Her tests were hard, but really encouraged me to study and I ended up learning more in this class than any other science class I have taken at SU. I REALLY recommend her.",1
Brings up controversial topics a lot. Does not control class when topics get out of hand. Does not allow for differing points of view. I learned nothing new from this class. She is a fair grader but monotonous during lectures and class discussions got way too argumentative. Also homework was not always clear. Should really focus less on discussion,0
"I really liked his class.He is really straightforward.Exams are not bad.What I DONT like is his grading scale.Even though you have a chance to bump up your score,it still makes life more difficult.The reading is only a little intense but as long as you get the main points, you'll be good.I didnt even finish reading and I got the right answers.",1
"Professor Nia C. Mahallati, J.D.-PROC 5840-Legal Acquisitions Graduate Law course at Webster. Recommend attending all class sessions as tests based on class materials. Very informative class, exceptional professor. Provides extensive coverage of Uniform Commercial Code (Sale of Goods). Highly recommend this graduate law course and professor.",1
"Class is disappointing. Supposed to be a translation class, but time is mostly spent on grammar and vocab. We have to figure it out mostly on our own. She often starts class by yelling at everyone over things that annoy her. Required story book we all purchased has never been opened. No real instruction on translation techniques.",0
"Lectures are a little boring, but the professor's a nice, understanding, guy. He knows his stuff and the class isn't that bad as long as he isn't teaching the course with Polentz-Bernard. If she's in the class too, get ready for a lot of work and crappy grades. She will suck the fun out of any course he teaches.",1
"Glenn is laid back. Was graded by 3 papers, best 10 quizzes, and best 10 weekly paragraphs. Did assign weekly readings about the concepts but after a while It became easy to take notes on what's important from the text without actually reading it. Asks 2 EC questions per quiz and papers were easy to write.",1
She was a super good first professor to have coming into WVU the work isn't too challenging and if you need any help you can get plenty from her.,1
"Hollis is really hilarious. He keeps his lectures interesting, and he knows what he's talking about. His sense of humor is on point. He is very helpful and he's one of those professors who is adorably excited by his subject. His class isn't easy, but he's awesome!  ",1
"His class was awful! I would avoid if you could. midterm is fine as long as you attend lectures and do readings, although his lectures weren't clear and all over the place.",0
"Dr. Cutler cares about her students like her kids. Chem II is a very hard course no matter who teaches it, but Dr. Cutler teaches all she can to help students understand and apply concepts. Class is hard, and requires lots of out of class work, but can be done. Work hard and pay attention, and Dr. Cutler will help you",1
On top of grading usually within 24 hours. Gives feedback along with participates in the forum discussions. Quizzes were tough but given unlimited attempts. No final but a Term Paper that requires a minimal group effort.,1
"Dr. Zbeida is very active in making sure you are ready for essays by providing in-class worksheets you do in groups and giving great, detailed feedback on Blackboard for essay sketches. She is extremely nice and likes for participation in class. Discussion boards are not overwhelming and textbooks for this class are cheap overall. Highly recommend.",1
not alot og good to say about this class. Alot of busy work that requires too much time for a gen ed class. She openly embarrasses students that give wrong answers. Takes forever to grade assignments. you have about 12 assignments in progress at once very confusing. Poor time management. the only positive thing is if you do the work you will dook,0
"She doesn't use a textbook, so no need to worry about purchasing one. Will give you a link to read online. Also, make sure to stay on top of assignments, takes off 15 points off top if late work. A lot of graded class participation. When doing papers, at least turn something in, don't just give up or not show up. Communication is key with her.",1
Zimmerman is the teacher that everyone wants. Her lectures are interesting and her delivery makes them easy to listen to. She is an easy grader and gives very clear assignments. I literally have no complaints about anything she did this whole semester. She is really just trying to prepare you for the workplace. I am taking her again next semester.,1
"Great instructor, explains things well, she let me re do an assignment for a better grade. She definitely holds the attention of the class and is really informative. I would take another class from her.",1
"She gives off the vibe that she'd rather be doing anything but teaching her class.  Grading is SEVERELY biased.  If you get on her bad side or she just doesn't like you for any reason, you will not pass her class.  Gives out unrealistically difficult projects with no time to do them and no assistance.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!",0
"To respond to the person on the bottom, he does give 90  if you do the work well and ask him for advice. But overall Mr. November is a spectacular teacher, he showed me a new way of writing essays.  Tip: Always come to class, he gives you credit for that.  Ask for advice on your essays, if you want higher grade.",1
Mrs. Fountain was one of my favorite professors I've ever had. She made the class fun and educational. She made sure you knew what you needed to be serious about without making it seem stressful. I've recommended her to everyone I know.,1
"This class is SO much reading, about 150 pages a week (books, not textbook). Wheeler is knowledgable and interesting but the class is so fast paced that I found it hard to participate. If you're really interested in history/social movements and can handle a ton of reading, take it. Personally I didn't like the class bc of the workload",1
"I only hope that I can be like Dudrick someday.  This man is always cheerful, incredibly smart, and makes class truly enjoyable.  He puzzles through stuff with us, and never ignores a raised hand.  Dudrick is the man.",1
"Best decision I've made was to take his class. 5 participation grades, 4 tests (all online), and one paper (you get three to write and keep the grade from your best one).",1
"He's actually not that bad, I think.  It's hard to tell whether he is mean, hateful and condescending or whether he's trying to be funny.  Whatever it is though he really needs to work on his personality.  He's a graduate student that isn't ready to be teaching yet.  I've had graduate students before who were amazing, he is not one of them.",0
She is the best teacher I've had at CSU! Love her! So helpful! My lowest grade in the class was a 90,1
"She was fantastic and interesting in a class that is typically boring. I learned a lot from her, and she was incredibly well prepared for each and every class.",1
"This Proff was absolutely amazing! She made learning about qualitative and quantitative research in Social Work interesting. Very helpful, and responded to emails promptly. Overall it was a pleasure being in her class! :)",1
"I really enjoyed Professor Sherwood. She was clear of the expectations, helpful, and involved. So long as you do your reading and turn your assignments in on time, you will be successful.",1
"Janice is so excited and knowledgeable about the coursework, I was engaged from day one. Her lectures are fun, clear, and the tests are fair. She succeeds at engaging the class and answering all questions. Homework is optional, but heavily recommended. She uses her own textbook, which is very informative and a nice change from the $200 alternative.",1
Dr.Nikkel was a fair teacher for the most part. He seems to really enjoy what he dose for a living. His class is mostly him running about the room and looking at these videos. I liked him cuz his work was stright to the point and he really wanted his studnets to learn. Also i got my best naps in his class.,1
Thad would be a very good teacher if he had more time. He didn't give out homework so you have to rely on your study skills. He didn't give out study guides at all. He's funny and his lectures are sometimes engaging. i guess it has to do with the subject. if you need homework and extra help with the class do not take him. He doesn't give ex credit.,1
Cool guy. Really makes sure the class understands what's going on. You can tell he  enjoys doing what he does.  Tests are mostly written  (doing supply demand graphs  pp curves etc.)  Has an excellent visual teaching style and he's constantly reminding the class when homework is due and when quizzes are coming up. 10/10 would take again,1
Dr. Holgado is an incredible professor. If you show up to every class and you do the work and out in effort she will not let you fail. She genuinely cares about all of her students. She offers TONS of bonus points. She is also always available to help you outside of class if you need it.,1
"Math 205 consists of some difficult concepts, mostly you have to change your way of thinking. So no matter who you take it will be difficult. Prof. Clark wants you to succeed. He does study sessions for tests, other professors do not.",1
Where should I start? just know you need to eat the book and teach yourself everything. lots and lots and lots of homework. does not understand the situation of his students during the pandemic.,0
"I know its the pandemic, but he hasn't taught half of the year and moved the due dates or cancelled half of the work for this class. I was hoping to learn something in this class but feel this was a complete waste of my time. Take him if you want an easy A without having to work for it.",0
"Dr. B was a good teacher. He cares for his students and wants them to all succeed in his class. He always makes time to help his students out whenever he can. His class is challenging but manageable if you work for it. Overall, Great teacher for the difficulty of the material.",1
"I have had Dr. Storslee for several CIS classes, 5 to be exact, including CIS 233.  He shows up early and is always there to answer your questions.  He responds quickly to e-mails and is extremely helpful.  He makes complicated web development subjects easy to understand.  Highly recommended!",1
This was one of my worse experience with a professor. She gave so many papers (2 per week) Plus she gave an entire 15 page research paper with only 2 weeks to complete it. Plus 2 5 page papers due that same week. On top of that her instructions were terrible and she grades so hard! I would not recommend her to anyone. Everything was too repetitive.,0
"Professor Urbina is a very smart man. I personally like his methods of teaching because he lectures a lot but he lectures only in Spanish. So not only are you picking up more on the language without the worries of grammar, but the subject material is very eye opening and informative. Be ready to read a lot and listen a lot.",1
"Also had him for higher plants and wetlands. Lower plants too. Excellent professor. Take his classes and getting out of the classroom is guaranteed. Might end up getting a little dirty or wet, but seeing and touching nature is much different from reading about it in a book. Tests can be difficult, so work on his practice questions. Enjoy!",1
"Professor Endlich was definitely my favorite teacher this semester. She is such a caring person and funny. She tries her hardest for us to have a good time in her class, and tries to make work as easy as possible. She understands everything that you are going through. I would definitely take her again, and not even think about it twice.",1
"Professor Sposeto is so good! I thought I was just bad at learning languages but I actually learned so much with her! She is very enthusiastic and she's young so her tips about the culture in Italy are recent and helpful. The class has the amount of homework you would expect for a foreign language, but it's really not bad compared to other classes.",1
"Shes a very nice person, However as a full timer living at my moms with no job, Its alot for me! I have other courses and it seems all I have is math. Way to much homework. 3 assignments will be due in such short time, test are graded heavily I don't understand why some points come off. She made me cry with a failing grade I tried hard!",1

"best class so far at keuka, make sure to work on the papers!!",1
Amazing. My very first...and by far my FAVORITE instructor. She made class EXCITING and engaging. I wanted to go to class. She inspired me. The work was fun and used your creativity. Susan is insane in the best possible way. TAKE HER CLASS!!,1
be careful!!he deducts points on your exams even though you do them the right way.,0
Hot teacher. Highly recommended!,1
I wish i knew about this website before taking his class. I recommend not taking this class unless you're looking for failure.,0
"Very interesting class, keeps the subjects very stimulating and pretty much hands you the exams beforehand so you can prepare for it...TF graded the papers a little harsh though...all in all if you're an IR major, it will seem pretty boring the first part of the semester seems irrelevant but the last quarter is the ""IR"" part of the course",1
"Her class isnt hard. Just do the work and youll pass. I dreaded her class in the beginning, (she talks too much about her trips to Spain, not helping us enough with grammar) but she grew in me. She believes the best way to learn Spanish is to speak and use it daily and I agree with her. But we need the grammar stuff to pass. Nice lady, ok prof.",1
He's good. Take him,1
"My second class with AR. Ok, let's put the looks aside because she IS a looker and focus on her teaching style. As a teacher myself I found it too research oriented but in this case that's exactly what I needed. A researcher of her caliber would be perfect for grad students. Less sure about undergrads. Overall high marks.",1
Great!,1
"I took her Social Justice and Welfare in the U.S. class and I've never enjoyed a class more. She genuinely cares about the well-being of her students. As long as you go to lectures, you'll be fine. She likes to bring in guest speakers that offer different opinions on a variety of issues. Just be careful because there aren't any fluff assignments.",1
"Prof. Cox's Anthropology 1 online class is possibly the best online class at CCSF! It is really well organized, great material, and she also grades and responds to emails very quickly! A wonderful experience with her class!!!!",1
"Makes everything very clear, will sit down for hours and discuss everything you need help with; you must read before class to fully understand the content, there is also a lot of dad jokes and examples during lectures. Be sure when he pauses before he says something, you write it down. His tests are very easy if you read. A great professor honestly",1
"Amazing professor, definitely recommend, one of the nicest and most careering professors on campus.",1
He is nice and a good teacher. Two big group projects but they are really useful if you are trying to be an entrepreneur. The tests are pretty moderate,1
I really enjoyed her class. She is very nice and understanding. Take notes during lecture but she explains everything well and answer any questions you have with no hesitation. Had about 2 papers and presentations. Quick readings every week with 5 question quizzes (hold on to them) A lot of fun in class discussions. Would definitely take her again,1
Professor Hansen is the best professor I have had at the University. He made me think about things  I never had and gives you a new worthwhile perspective. His class was an hour and fifteen minutes and I never felt the need to look at my phone because what he says is so compelling. Not to mention he is also hilarious. Take any class you can w/ him!,1
Smart,1
A real standout professor who really cares about what he teaches. I would highly recommend Professor Reese to any student.,1
"Easy Professor if you are ready to work for it. She is approachable and very interested in her course. Attendance is necessary and opportunities for discussions are present. Also, the course load is just a tad heavy.",1
"He is on ANOTHER LEVEL, an enlightened way of thinking (big picture). Has his own way of teaching, but his exact words REALLY make sense. LISTEN to him! Some will be lucky enough to get a copy of the Bush Bible, but it's easy enough to make your own. When he provides you formulas that look like math equations MEMORIZE THEM. Case law won't help.",1
"awesome. actually teaches the problems, unlike prof. henry...practices problems in class...helps if you dont understand...uses real world and simple ways to relate ur life to class so that u understand better...pay attention and participate and you'll do well (exams are departmental, but he prepares you for them really well)",1
"Rick is a funny guy, which will help his lectures stick. But he can come off a bit rude at times and embarrass you in front of class. He is a lawyer though, and with lawyers, the ""attitude"" comes with it. He really teaches you the practical parts of real estate law and you definitely learn from him. I would take his class again.",1
"The class is mostly lectures, but she does a good job keeping it interesting. It is fast-paced and difficult to keep up with sometimes. There are 4 exams, 4 books, and a few other assignments. Don't buy the textbook, just go to class. Never used the textbook and was fine. Definitely show up to class or else the material will be hard to understand",1
"Professor Schubert is awesome! If you pay attention in class and do his assignments, you'll get an A.",1
terrible.,0
"Three hour class that can be done in 15 mins. The professor skips over the slides, which I could be doing at home. Papers are simple but he is a tough grader for no reason. Does not provide constructive criticism for you to do better on the next paper. Asks questions about your opinion, however if it is against his opinion then you are wrong.",0
"Arevalo can sometimes come off badly to students that do not put forward the work in her class. She expects a fair amount but gives you plenty of time to work on projects. Her exams are mostly based on vocabulary, short answer, and reading the textbook. They are fair. Her lectures are sometimes rushed but she does genuinely care about students.",1
Her elegance and poise is only matched by her classy style. She's really nice and well organized. Hands down the fastest marker i've had. she's tough and doesn't tolerate nonsense but if you're on the ball and know your stuff she is a joy to have as a teacher.,1
I absolutely adore Dr. Record! He's my favorite professor and his lectures are always super interesting and insightful. His class is very engaging and he always makes sure to check up on how we're feeling which is appreciated.,1
Best teacher I have ever had!,1
Best prof I've ever had the pleasure of learning from in University.,1
"Microbiology is pretty easy to understand if you've done well in anatomy and keep up with the reading. The tests are pretty hard, but she allows notecards so she doesn't emphasis memorizing little details. She repeats the major concepts alot to make sure you get it.",1
"Phil is a great lecturer. There are quizzes every week, but they aren't hard and if you pay attention, you'll be fine. He really likes to talk about more than what's on the slides he uses. Really useful info. He also grades his papers really hard.",1
A lot of people will tell you he's confusing but from my experience it was because people in the class didnt let him teach before interrupting the lesson to ask inane questions or ask about a later part of the chapter. Homework and notes help. Tests are the most weight as far as grade. Listen to understand and you will do fine,1
Very bad teacher!,0
"He wasn't great at explaining things, but he wasn't terrible by any means, either. If you pay close attention to what he's saying, you should be fine. He's also really funny.",1
"He's a good professor but he doesn't look at the slides ahead so he doesn't know what he is teaching. He has like 5 projects(?) but didn't explain how to do them well. Don't miss his class for more than 2 times if you want a quiz grade to be dropped. Overall, he is a nice professor but I would say he isn't a great professor when it comes to teachin",1
"Of course you need to put the work in to get the grade, but he works with you and is very kind/informative. He gives you material sources so that you can further educate yourself.",1
"You don't have to read if you take notes in class and underline the specific references he makes to the texts during lecture. Take good notes and you'll do well on the midterm/final. Gives a 7-8 page paper. Gave an extra credit assignment worth 20 points for the midterm. Overall, very little work if you take EXCELLENT notes and skip readings.",1
By far the worse professor that I have ever had! His classes are extremely boring. Attendance a must! Gives way too much material to read & expects you to have it all memorized. Gives weekly pop quizzes! He raises his voice & talks down to the class. He's unclear on his assignments & grades very tough. Gives last a ton of last minute assignments!,0
"(taken spring 2020) Love this man! Super intelligent and explains things clearly. Makes economics interesting. Cengage works great with this class. Self proclaimed ""hardest Eco Prof"" but if you just do the work it's fine. Really want to take him again when I can! Grade based on Cengage HW, tests, and participation. Definitely do the extra credit",1
"Pay attention to the questions he asks in class, and on field trips... understand the question as much as the answer",0
Mr. May Was rude and screamed at students in class. Was often missing. And did nothing but recite paragraphs from the book. I would not take him as a professor I would instead take one of the many other wonderful computer science teachers in Maple woods.,0
Nice Guy and smart guy.  Gets you in and out.  Cares about his students,1
"Great teacher, likes to do a lot of read a loud alouds. For her literature  & language arts there is a lot of work load just have to keep up. There is a lesson plan that took me forever to do but gives great feedback & really wants everyone to succeed. You learn a lot & I would recommend her as a professor! No exams, just projects",1
"History can be boring at times, but hes very enthusiastic about history and its obvious that he loves the subject. Just be prepared to take a LOT of notes, so dont skip. Ive had him for history twice, so I highly recommend recording incase you miss any notes. Dont be scared off by his long tests, just study your notes and youll pass.",1
"Professor Ronell delivers the most mind blowing performative lectures. Her readings of Kafka, Nietzsche, Derrida, Deleuze, Heidegger, Freud and others opened up a new world for me. She is kind, honorable, funny and caring. I highly recommend her classes.",1
"He's awesome. He's very intelligent and down to earth. He has a passion for math and is great at teaching. He explains things so well and he makes sure everyone understands. He's very helpful, kind, and funny. Such a cool dude. One of the best professors I've ever had. Do the homework and bring questions to class. He gives practice exams too.",1
"GREAT CLASS, YOU HAVE TO READ EVERYTHING AND REALLY UNDERSTAND THE SET OF PLANS.",1
Just No,0
Only offered one extra credit assignment out of the whole semester. She does not answer emails regarding questions or grading. When I asked questions in her class she made me feel stupid and when I asked for help she just told me to figure it out on my own. Honestly your pretty much on your own.,0
"If you are serious about getting ahead in the Illustration industry, you will be as disappointed with Dennis as I was. I was uninspired by him, got no portfolio pieces from his classes, and was wholly disappointed with the number of assignments we were given. He will push you into painting instead of letting you explore your own methods.",0
"I was in her very first section. She had never taught before. She is a good teacher compared to a lot of other professors, but she struggled to teach course material that wasn't hers. She has the ability to be a great professor, but as of when I took her, it was incredibly difficult because we were all confused.",1
"Honors class, very dull. Teacher is more interested in her own personal stories than teaching a subject. Thinks she is very worldly, but isn't. If you have a choice between her class or being pepper sprayed, get sprayed. It will hurt less.",0
"He is a very nice guy, but he has trouble explaining things. I didn't learn much from him, had to learn it all on my own. His test are not to bad he is great at giving partial credit. If you are not really good at physics I would not recomend taking him.",1
She is truly amazing! I was going through a rough time and I am not so great in communicating. She reached out to me because I wasnt turning in stuff on time. Didnt think shed care about my situation but she was extremely understanding and gave me the chance to make it up! She is also comforting! Overall class was great! Thank you!,1
Took Prof. Chambers online Mat014. Material is standard and straightforward. She replied to every single one of my emails in a timely matter. No complaints at all.,1
Don't expect to get a good grade .,0
"Would not recommend at all. She's a tough grader. Literally so disrespectful, she shamed someone in front of the whole class because they didn't do their homework. She expects you to like and be good at music, regardless of major. Avoid at all costs.",0
"He really cares about the students success. He has great stories that connects with the course work. If you need help, he is there to clear any doubts you may have on the course work. I will definitely take him again!",1
She is to the point and keeps you laughing with her sense of humor.  If you skip her lectures you won't do as good come test time because she goes over things that may not be on her lecture sheets.  Reading the chapters in the book helps out come test time. She is good about reviewing and going over scantrons for mistakes,1
"While calc 2 with this Prof. was the most homework heavy (and study heavy) course I've taken at UML, she does everything she can to make sure you understand the material. She's consistently available outside of class, and skillful at rewording/using metaphors to communicate ideas. Difficult, but the best calc 2 professor at UML.",1
Gives you many opportunities to be successful and to pass the class. You must do the work and you will pass. He is always available to answer your questions and help when you need it. All you need to do are his assignments!,1
"He was the coolest professor I have had by far! Super nice and truly does want his students to succeed. Lab work was easy, just make sure you have the book because a lot of the labs require diagrams that are already in the book. If you don't have it, he'll print out some copies. Really just and overall good guy.",1
This is the one class that literally helps me relax. I thought I'd hate it since it has nothing to do with my major but he completely changed my view. His lectures are simple but keeps your attention and his tests are easy as long as you pay attention. I loved everything about this class. The professor is always ready to help and he's very sweet.,1
"Attendance is Non mandatory, but it would be stupid not to go. Their are quizzes or focus questions every class period. He is german with a small accent, but he is hilarious and makes class enjoyable. If having trouble understanding class topics he is a huge help if you meet with him one- on- one.",1
She is the best teacher at gadsden state. Will go way beyond to help you!!!,1
Just avoid him.  Take the other professors who understand students and how they learn.,0
She is an amazing professor who cares about her students. I wish I took her for Eng 112!  She doesn't give out any pop quizzes but there is a lot of essays.,1
"Fantastic teacher. Class is very well organized. Dr. Zbeida answers her emails promptly, gives good feedback, and allows you to revise and resubmit your papers to bring up your grade. Who else does this. This is the class to take. I would take another in a heartbeat.",1
"Very helpful with feedback. You do need to stay on top of the work for it to be a easy class,  but if you do you will pass. You also get out what you out in. Very understanding of outside issues if you must be late on an assignment.  Not a standard teacher with just standing there lecturing. Class participation is  vital",1
"If you struggle in math, she explains it very thoroughly and genuinely cares for her students. She drops the lowest test grade and replaces it with your best. She's extremely nice and wants you to succeed. Amazing Professor. 10/10 would recommend!",1
"Amazing professor. Lectures are very helpful for homework. He is always around to help out with homework, projects, labs, etc. He is pretty laid back which is nice and makes the learning environment much better.",1
"Gives you a chance to retake one test each semester. I had him for math 0700 my freshman year, and luckily I am taking him this semester for finite again. He is a little goofy, but the best math teacher I have had at AUM. Also, you don't need to purchase a book because all his material is on his website.",1
"Took this class,didnt read the books assigned read the summarys and passed, all I could say is that going to lecture really matters for passing this class. Hes a great professor!",1
He emphasized group study and wouldn't recommend any study aids. Provides a lot of great hypos and even some practice exam questions. Lectures and good notes will help you more than the textbook alone ever will.,1
"AWESOME Prof!  The BEST instructor at CSCC. She responds quickly to emails and is active in the course. If you are willing to put in the work she will go above and beyond to help you. She is very enthusiastic and cares about her students. Virtural office hours, video comments, and open to suggestions. Don't buy the book. Highly recommend!",1
"I took Prof. Smith's FE429 (Futures and Options). That was tough. His lectures were very unclear, explanations were confusing (at best). Well educated, but arrogant and ignorant of his class. This class was an elective.",0
Sara is very passionate about what she does and she makes the class super interesting. You can talk about anything in class. Very helpful. I hardly used the book though.,1
"Dr. Foster is smart and funny, and her teaching style keeps things moving and interesting; but she does not fully outline all of the details of assignments, even those that are a large portion of the grade, and follows by brutally grading your assignment on every detail! You will learn a lot but be warned, read the syllabus word for word!",1
"Read and ""Practice"" what he gives. Don't study text book. His sample papers will be easy but exam will be really tough and confusing. No assignments. No attendence.  Russian accent. Only problems even though he gives theoretical questions in sample paper. RTT is a must read topic.",0
"Class is informative and interesting.  She expects you to work, but you learn a lot.",1
"Dr. Heilman is very enthusiastic about her subject so you will never fall asleep in her class. The essay questions for the midterm and final are given to you beforehand so youre able to prepare yourself which is nice, but the textbook questions can get a bit specific. The only con is that she doesnt post notes online, so attendance is mandatory!",1
"He doesn't understand you as much as you don't understand him. Everything is ""obvious"" to him when the reality of the matter is that nobody understands. Nevertheless, the tests are pretty much identical to the homework. If you put the time in to get the right answers to the homework, you will do well. ",1
"Take this course if you want to be treated like a high school student. Students worried more about his harsh grading instead of learning or improving their work. He likes to hear himself speak so classes will feel never-ending. If you disagree with him, you will not get good grades.",0
I did not learn anything in this class. If theology is your major run. This class was hard for only being a core credit. He is a tough grader with no rewrites. He gives a paper and a final so prepare.,0
He was a good teacher who had very clear lectures. And students were encouraged to ask questions,1
"Is not very clear with her lessons at all. Does not go back to review any lessons but gives tests on previous chapters????? Good luck, you'll learn more going to tutoring and reading the textbook",0
"Great professor who changes up his teaching style to keep things interesting. Do not let his syllabus scare you off. Even though he brags a lot about how tough the class is, it is really not so bad. The exams are insane, but he curves it great.",1
"She is a great instructor for the course and opens the eyes of how many options are available in the Sport Management field. She has a lot of connections that she has speak to the class (which was awesome) and has a lot of knowledge is various areas. One paper, a midterm & exam and other smaller assignments that are easy enough. Good person to know",1
He is hands down the best teacher I had at Pace so far. He is extremely passionate about the subject and its contagious. If you are having trouble with something he is the type of teacher that will go to all ends to make sure you understand. There's a lot of work but he gives you till the end to make up  any missing work up. TAKE HIM!!,1
"He was a good teacher idk why people complained. Watch lectures, study, go to GSS and you should be fine lol",1
"Worst professor ever. Doesnt give good direction and even when the whole class doesnt understand instruction, she does nothing to help. If she is unsatisfied with your work, you are only able to receive half credit because it wasnt revised by the due date. So its not even worth it. Would not recommend.",0
"He is a wonderful Professor. I am not saying this because I passed but because he really takes the time to help you understand math. He shows different techniques to solving a problem in case you don't understand. He's awesome! Offers extra credit. Do the work, study and you'll pass. You can't expect to pass if you don't do the work.",1
I had to choose 1 Star because 0 wasnt an option he is not clear at all and the professor has to many returning students and you would think the college would notice that. He stumbles himself on questions from the textbook and doesnt care if you fail the class or not.,0
"3 class tests followed by sample tests, so it's easy. Homework is mandatory. Extra 5 point for attendance. He is very clear & helpful. Calc is hard, Buck there to make it easy for you. Loved his class, it was fun.",1
I had professor Mathis for poetry and I had a solid B the whole semester(because only grade were the daily worksheets ) until our first test 12 weeks into the semester she grades unrealistic on the paper I got an F because I didnt meet the page requirement. When I went back to redo it I was literally 2 sentences away getting an A in rare,0
No Comments,1
Not as bad as prior comments make her seem. Its a hard class and i DO NOT recommend skipping lecture. If allowed to make not cards keep up on them and organize. Keep with it and she usually gives a little extra credit towards the end if in lecture. I got a B so if i can get a decent grade most people who at least try can too.,0
"Marketing major classmates have no iead about his lecture, and teaching bunch of finance stuff for marketing class. Heavy accent hard to follow. !!AND!! DOESN'T USE PPT FOR NOTES, AND ASKING SOMEONE TO VOLUNTEER TO WRITE FOR HIM ON THE BOARD EVERYTIME! No one wants to write becuase he is reading out his note and you will have to write throughout.",0
"I thought her class was a little dull, but looking back (after studying some of the same data structures in another class) she did a great job of explaining.",1
"Started off liking him as a professor and slowly began to really hate him. As many people have said, his lectures weren't great. His tests were very confusing in his set up since he did them through Moodle, although the class required web assign and could've just done it through there. Refused to give back credit due to syntax and was mostly rude.",0
"Lectures are useless other than clicker points, but those aren't mandatory. Only two exams aside from the final, 3 projects, and a bunch of in class and online quizzes plus homework for each chapter make up your grade. Lots of extra credit. Stats is very self-teachable so missing lecture won't kill you. Biggest perk is this guy teaches to exams.",1
"Easy Homework. Lengthy Tests. Classes are SO much fun, he is always joking around. Cancels class often and/or lets out very early. DEFINATELY take for Computer Science 201!",1
"I LOVE HER. If I could take her again I would. She assigns a massive group project in the beginning of the semester which was easy. Gives 4 quizzes throughout the semester, and a research project with a group of friends that you pick. I learned a lot in this class and was not overwhelmed at any point of the semester.",1
Worst professor I have ever had at UB . I wish there were more professors teaching this course that are inspirational and encouraging to their students. If you take him be prepared to have a semester filled of stress and depression. It does not matter how much you try he will always find problems with your work and just wants more and more.,0
No Comments,1
"I took ENG 250 as a half semester course, so it was a lot of work in a little amount of time, but he made it easy as it was possible to be, I think. Make sure you do the assigned readings and participate.",1
"If you sincerely care about getting the most from your education, he's your guy! He's more qualified to teach Project Management than most and possesses a wealth of knowledge. He's tough, so you can't just fake participation; expect to write a lot. He grades fast and gives real feedback that will help you improve. He can be reached through email.",1
"Professor Swift was decent. He had good lectures, so make sure you go to them. His tests were pretty hard. He will answer and go over any questions people have during class, so he was very helpful in that way. When we transitioned to online learning, the quality of learning decreased, but I think he might have just been adjusting to the new style.",1
HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE! This man cannot teach. He hardly gives notes/examples which is very essential in accounting. Very boring and cannot answer your questions cuz he doesn't know himself. If you take him you will fail. He's late most of the time and reads from powerpoint print outs. You're guarenteed to fall sleep or stare out the window.,0
"Did not love her as a professor, but she makes the class extremely easy. Textbook use isn't necessary (although the case study book is used weekly) and she allows for notecards on every exam.",1
"This was one of my favorite classes! The lectures are interesting every day and there is NO WORK other than the tests! Make sure to actually do the study guides if you want an A, quizlets are often wrong for his tests. Wish I could take this class again.",1
"Ms. Polster is one of the best professors, pound for pound, that I have had at Memphis, and she is so precious and is always happy and smiling!  One warning: read the syllabus carefully (not kidding about it), and don't let your cellphone go off in her class.",1
"She is an awesome professor!!! One of the best currently at Shepherd. I've had her for many many classes, including American Federal Gov't, Legislative Process, Metro. Politics, Critical Political Issues and others. You will not regret taking her! :)",1
"A very inspiring teacher. You have to be willing to experiment and get creative to appreciate the class. Very helpful and always interesting, take any classes possible.",1
This class felt very long. Its interesting but the Professor does not make things very clear. He takes forever and I do mean forever to input grades. When you try and get a clear understanding of something he is very short with you and may just move on. He grades by a percentage scale so you will have to take the exam regardless.,1
"Accelerated 2 mo. course. Very hard class. Wasn't much instructions throughout the course. More of a go do it, better be great at it or you're getting a bad grade. The amount of material you are expected to learn throughout this course is ridiculous! Quizzes are EXTREMELY hard! & do not try google. 4 Quizzes. 1 Research Paper. 5 Discussion Boards. ",0
"Interesting subject but very scattered and biased method of teaching. Barely took any notes. Weekly 1pg response papers due, 4 unit papers (only have to do 3), optional final, 6 pop quizzes drops the lowest. If you muddle through the not always pleasant reading material and incorporate the ""4 key concepts"" in your writing then you should be fine.",1
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS ONLINE OR OVER THE SUMMER. Every three days you have to read a chapter 40-50 pages long. Lots to take notes on (2-3 hours minimum) Then you have a quiz that can take up to an hour - with 25 multiple choice and 5 longer answer questions.. You have a fill in the blank exercise as well and a 1-2 page reflection for each chapter!,0
Good teacher!,1
"Dr. Ayadi is a really nice professor. She tries to make the material understandable for everyone and always available for questions. If you participate and do the work, you'll be fine in her class.",1
"Old school prof but very easy course. Only 1 midterm 1 essay and 1 final so minimal work outside of class. No textbook or lecture slides, so if you don't show up good luck passing. But if you want a refreshing break from normal economics courses, are willing to show up twice a week to take notes, and are willing to study for exams this is a breeze",1
Adelle is a sweetheart! There are 2 midterms and a final. Also there are a couple of 5% online open book quizzes. She makes it very interesting and uses clickers in class to vote on answers for M.C questions. Great Prof!,1
"One of my favorite professors by far here! He is so energetic, young and caring. He relates to everyone in the classroom and brings humanity into learning. He gives minimal work, and what he does give is so easy to finish. Not a tough grader but makes you think, which I loved. Take him if you get the chance you will not regret it!",1
"He really makes you work for it but in an understandable way, He is extremely nice and helps throughout the semester to help you pass he's definitely worth taking!",1
On tests he chooses the most difficult problems and tries to make his tests as hard as possible when they shouldn't be. His tests are much much harder than the homework and quizzes. He makes his tests as hard as possible.,0
"This guy is a greatest prof. I would take his class over if they would let me. He knows a ton of info and is very helpful. I took the class over the TV thing at Barron County, but he knows what is teaching and always responds to y our e-mails very fast. I would recommend taking this guy.",1
"Worst professor I have taken at UCD. Her tests are very subjective, and she's a tough grader. You can literally rebuttal every question on her test. She has a horrible memory, so make sure you don't ask her to repeat herself (because she forgets). She is also very rude, HATES when people walk in late, and gets distracted easily. Avoid her!!",0
"MKT 350, very easy class - easiest A in the College of Buisness",1
"Rafferty is awesome!! Physics sucks but she makes it easy! Do the work and you'll do fine. She provides all the resources and practice you need and there's lots of practice problems in class. It's not a show up and pass class, you have to actually do the work but she's super nice and makes it all as easy as it can be!",1
"I've never rated a prof on this site before but out of my two years at sfu, he's been my favorite. He genuinely cares about his students and is the most hilarious math prof ever. Made 8:30 am classes worth it, even though I skipped a lot of classes near the end of the semester lol",1
I chose this upper level Forensics class because I have a certificate in it from community college. I was hoping to expand on what I learned but that really wasn't the case. I mainly passed through using my notes from my forensics lower level classes. If looking for the basics on Forensics I'd suggest this professor's topic forensics class.,1
"Even though her class was easy for me, I cannot imagine many of her students passing. She shoves her political views down students' throats. I figured out early on that studying the 'quizzes' were the ONLY thing necessary for test prep. Don't bother studying notes.. You will pass if you put in the work but her class was a drag and so was she.",1
"She was the best japanese teacher i have had so far.She explains everything over and over again until everyone gets it. You have to study to pass the class, but she grades really fair. She made the class really interesting. Would highly recommend her.",1
"Dr. Hazell is both funny and knowledgeable. I have never looked forward to attending a class more than his. All 4 of his tests stem directly from the lectures, so it is vital to not miss any classes. My favorite class yet since returning to ACC. Highly recommend.",1
"Tami is super friendly and helpful! She makes herself easily accessible outside of class to answer or explain any questions we might have. She has lots of long lectures, followed by practice/group work time, so you get lots of hands on. But the homework is definitely a lot of work!",1
"Dr. Mac makes classes fun. Hes a ""I don't give a crap"" teacher. That however can turn bad. His tests are SUPER HARD! It very easy to fail and fall behind in his class. The only extra credit is Socrates contest and that it. Don't ask him for any. ",1
I took econ2304 asynchronous. He is a good professor who makes himself accessible to students outside of his office hours. He replies very quickly on teams and truly tries to help you when you struggle. He's very very understanding of things (i had surgery + hurricane in the same month and he was very patient). He's a nice guy and good prof.,1
"STOR 435 is hard class no matter who you take it with. That being said, Pipiras goes through lecture problems very quickly and can be difficult to follow. Exams consist of problems straight from homework and lecture, but study well in advance since there is a lot to review. His class is tough but he grades fairly. I definitely learned a lot.",1
"I loved this prof! She's tough, but she's a lot of fun. The reading is articles and a few short books. Grades are based off of discussions, a paper, and 2 exams. Exams consist of identifying terms, short answers, and essays. Exams are pretty tough, but this class is definitely worth it. I hope to take this professor again.",1
"I took Professor Chris for the Winter semester. He was fun, enthusiastic, and his lectures were awesome. He gave cool study guides before the exams which were multiple choice and true/false. Prepare yourself to do outlines for your speeches which are timed, which was the toughest part of the class for me. Overall it was an excellent class!!!",1
Dr. Little's Cultural Anthropology class is completely unfair and ridiculous. His test are all short answer and he does not clearly specify what is going to be on the test. (The test are 12 chapters long) There is only one way to do things in his class and it is HIS way. I would not recommend taking him as a professor for any course at CIU.,0
Best teacher I've ever had for such a hard class :),1
"Graham should never be able to teach a college class again. If you want your GPA to get bent over then take his class. If you want someone who just expects you to learn everything on your own then take Graham, everyone I talked to from my class was also failing all quarter long. Terrible lectures and he has 0 care about your effort for your GPA.",0
"He is an incredible teacher, very passionate about the topics he teaches. Makes the topics interesting. He is extremely knowledgable. Requires ALOT of homework, reading, and writing. ",1
Said she would correct the team project before the exam but didn't. We therefore had no clue how to write the solutions adequatly in the exam.,0
He's not as bad as some people say. Just get used to his style. Find his video-lectures on iTunesU - they were very helpful. Answering questions is not his strong suit - can't answer to the point.  But I like the way he structured his course although I had to either read the book or find some other learning materials and read after each lecture,1
"Katselis was one of my favorite professors. If you attend lectures, he will work with you to make sure you get all the material. The material is pretty dry, but he does the best he can to make it interesting.",1
"Very knowledgeable and has a lot of real life experiences.  As previously mentioned, he is an easy grader and the class can be somewhat boring.  Definitely take him if you want to learn some things.",1
"I am thoroughly unsatisfied with instructor. If you do not attend you will not pass, and I mean she will make your life super difficult to learn or even attend her lectures. The classes are usually entertaining but I find I do not always learn what I need to in the time given due to long periods of non-related topics.",0
"Dr. Chalk gives a ton of work constantly, and doesn't give you a single day off. She is under the impression that her class is the only class you are taking, and it is the most important. She gives random reading quizzes and picks awful books. She talks for 55 minutes about the books while you sit in boredom.",0
He gets us,1
"Engaging lectures! There's a lot of group activities during each lecture so it's never boring. The class is pretty easy tbh, because she makes the expectations really clear, not that there isn't any work. Readings/assignments don't take a lot of time. Just did not enjoy the group essay. At all.",1
"Took her course because I thought it would be easy. Easy content, but literally the most UNFAIR and DIFFICULT marking. Also will not answer your emails until months later, if she even answers at all. So if you have questions about anything, good luck on that!",0
She did not help this class at all.  Do not take her online.  Did not grade assignments or respond to emails.,0
"NOT AS EASY AS HE APPEARS,THAT IS ALL I'M GOING TO SAY.",0
I RECOMMEND THIS PROFESSOR. He is literally the absolute best math professor at Polk.,1
Great professor. Attendance is mandatory and a part of your grade. Test are not hard if you do the practice exams and study them.,1
"Thus far, he is my favorite online professor. He is very organized and responds to emails very fast. He looks out for students; he dropped a reading and extended deadlines. The course itself is interesting and the assignments aren't too bad. I have a full time job and a full load in school and it's still fairly easy. Highly recommended! TAKE HIM :)",1
"It's always nice when you get a teacher who is obviously experienced in their field outside of teaching, and professor Dudley is that. The only negative that I've experienced in class is that labs usually have a long block of explanation that is only done because not everyone in the class reads the directions beforehand. The dissections are smelly!",1
Very fair professor. I appreciated his simple weighted grading and his candid way of describing things. Very clear expectations and great test review. Made passing this class a breeze.,1
"god this lady is the devil, simon cowel of the speech word. everything you do is wrong, even if its right. NEVER take this lady.",0
"Group project that is worth nearly half of your grade and is semester long. Very intense, but he grades it fairly. Must show up to class. For a tough subject, he does an adequate job of making it somewhat interesting. Core class that you must take, I would recommend him, but just know that you will have to work hard.",1
"Not terribly difficult, though her final exam was somewhat overdone. Her grading is in fact subjective, and her lectures are both boring and do a terrible job of actually communicating the information. Having her for 101 made 102 a real pain because we learned so little compared to the other 101 classes. Avoid her at all costs.",0
For those of you that want to pass English 1A there are many other instructors that teach this class with the student's success in mind. Stay clear of this instructor unless you want to learn English within prison walls. You will buy many books that you won't use. Be prepared for boring lectures.,0
"He's a really nice guy and likes to have fun with the class, but he is a very strict grader and asks you to remember a ridiculous amount of detail",1
"Econ 2370 is a challenging class, but Professor Melendez is amazing! I am not good at math, and I had to study a lot for this class. The material is hard, and you for sure have to WORK HARD for your grade, but Melendez is more than willing to meet with students if they are struggling. He was always VERY helpful and understanding & he's so funny!!",1
"Professor Pajer is the most kind, warm-hearted, caring and chill teacher ever. You are given 5 essays across the period of the semester which are extremely easy. Her grading is simple and not harsh. This is a class I look forward to everyday and would definitely take it again.",1
Made us believe turning in review packets would give us 5 points on each test that they were turned in for and apparently this is not the case because my final grade is 6% lower than it should be.,0
"This is supposed to be MWF class, but Prof Baez only had lectures once a week. Every week there is a Sapling Learning (SL) assignment. HW is very easy if you read the textbook/listen to the lectures. Prof Baez's lectures are clear and follow the book very closely. Tests are on SL and are just like the hw. Easy class, would recommend",1
"Nice lady and helpful if you have questions.  Several papers and a Final (which was difficult). Also two speeches with powerpoints.  Overall, good class.",1
"This teacher is amazing, he is clear and wants you to learn. I am very happy that i recieved him as my psych profesor because a lot of the other students at IUK complain about their psychology professor being complicated and hard, and i can honestly say mine isn't. You still must do the work, but if you pay attention and do the CPAs then an A is just around the corner.",1
"If you're in 122 as your last Spanish class, then he's probably fine. Doesn't actually require you to speak spanish so long as you can memorize basic grammar concepts. If you're considering taking a higher spanish class, I would look for another professor who uses more of the language in class. Way too much homework for how easy the course is.",1
Boyles is an amazing teacher! There is a lot of group assignment work but he also makes sure all the books he assigns are pretty cheap! He wants to help people succeed!! He has a couple of important papers & a final that is easy if you have a big imagination. Take this class & really engage with this guy if you want to learn anything & keep an A.,1
Hard class but accounting is hard unless you're an accountant. But Professor Sanborn will help you. She will give extra visits to campus and stay after class to help you understand. Beware she doesn't go strictly off the book.,1
"The professor is kind, and that is it. She teaches an interesting subject, but she is a very boring teacher. She didnt live up to her make up policy. Also, I already study psychology on my own time and soon realized she was halfway teaching information. Do not take this professor if you want to truly learn psychology.",0
"The best teacher I've ever had! She gives study guides that follow the test content-- and if you take the time to study, there's no way you can fail this cliss. She is adorable, funny, and one of a kind! You won't regret a moment in her class.",1
"Great guy, makes SE project manageable. Highly recommend",1
"Matt is probably the best part of PSY230. You get to work on your homework in class and if you don't understand the problem, Matt will come and help you until you figure it out. I wish he taught the lecture because I probably would have learned the material better if he was the one who taught it. Also, go to his exam reviews, it will really help",1
"You need to show up because she doesn't post notes. Also, about a third of your mark is based on discussions, so you should be ready to talk. You get a lot of freedom on the research paper, which is nice. The final exam wasn't super tough. Overall, great class and probably my favourite class and prof so far.",1
"Great guy, helpful when needed, and is a very smart man. his class was not too hard but I learned alot",1
"What a joke. it's like we are back in elementary school. She moves seats, makes you work with partners, and has every single person in the class repeat the same thing over and over again. Terrible teacher. Boring. She's so annoying. Tons of HW (Writing words 5x each) You never get out early even after taking a test. She's terrible. Worst teacher",0
"No matter how interested you think you are in this subject, trust me, it's not enough to justify taking this class. Impossibly hard.",0
"She's a real cool professor if you have the opportunity to take another class with her, grab it.",1
"I loved Professor Ipaye! I looked forward to her lectures, they were very interesting and fun. She makes the information easy to understand and learn. The quizzes and tests are all online and open-book. Highly recommend.",1
"2-3 Exams (Midterm and Final usually). Depends on timing. Quiz every class, but you can easily get by if you study the material (Drops the lowest 3). Gives a good sample exam that is about 80% of the main exam and genuinely loves Ornithology. It's a field course so you go out and identify birds (not in the rain). Highly recommend for Ornithology.",1
"If you want to be coddled, then go to your Mommy's School of Journalism. If you want to be a great TV journalist, take Prof. Brown's class. He will push you to be better than you thought you could be. He'll prepare you for real life, where people don't care about your excuses. He is also hilarious.",1
Awesome professor! Very caring and room to improve grade!,1
"Dr. Feige was an amazing professor. Im currently reviewing anatomy for my nursing admissions exam and everything Dr. Feige taught me, stayed in my head! He makes videos to help students understand difficult topics & his homework is great review for his exams. Hands down best anatomy professor, he goes above and beyond to help students succeed.",1
"The class wasn't difficult, it was hard to understand what was expected at times. She gives either an A or a 70. The lack of feedback doesn't allow you to improve your work. She doesn't respond to emails. I did learn how to use the writing lab at Pima. That was the only way to get feedback and learn anything.",0
he is the best,1
"Teaches Research methods and makes it fun. Pay attention and go to class or you'll miss something and be derailed for a while. She moves fast but answers all questions and will take extra time if you need it.  Exams are very tough but ensure you know EVERYTHING and you'll do fine. Lots of work in this class, don't slack!",1
"Professor Zank is a really passionate about religion and provides a good intro to the Bible. His lectures are random and unorganized. His exams are difficult and there is a lot of memorization. If you can take another humanities course, I would recommend it unless you are super passionate about the Bible. He spends a lot of time on topics he likes",1
"He really cares about his students. Hes one of the best professors in the school of business. If you have a problem, go talk to him. Hes really understanding and he explains the material well, if you do the review sheet and homework, youll have no problem passing the tests.",1
At times doesn't seem to know what he is doing but he figures it out. It's not that he doesn't know the material  (he does) but that he just doesn't know where he was going with an idea. Always helpfulooking in answering questions and cares that you pass as long as you are trying.,1
"Smart and genuine.  Some of the material was a bit dry, but she helped make it interesting.  I would take any class from her.",1
"Prasad is an amazing teacher, goes super in depth to make sure students understand chemistry. If you keep up with the online assignments, the class is fairly simple. Her lab classes are 2.5 hours so if you skip you miss out on a lot. Be prepared to put effort into your assignments. Super helpful if you don't understand things, makes chemistry fun.",1
Hard teacher ,0
Dr. Harvey is a great teacher. The material is EXTREMELY difficult but she knows exactly what she is talking about. This class is not an easy A though. You really do have to put a lot of time into it and go to her office hours for guidance. SHE IS VERY HELPFUL. Lab gets really tiring and I wanted to cry 50 times during experiments. Have fun!,1
"I really liked this online course. She was responsive with her emails, always gave lots of feedback, and taught me how to think better about the foods I eat. She provided me tips and feedback on how to better adjust my approach.",1
"Professor is so sweet. She went out of her way to offer me honors designation in the class and met with me every week. If you take notes on the textbook chapter before class, you'll be fine! You're able to send your papers to her ahead of time and she gives great feedback.",1
"She was very unorganized & scattered, usually arriving 5-7 mins late. Lectured about topics that were irrelevant to the films we watched, but really knows her stuff. Expected us to read 10 articles each week, but no one did. The class was an Easy A, but excruciatingly boring. Asked us to buy 2 books, but never referenced them. Easy grader on papers",1
Easy to understand professor. Not an easy A though. You need to show up for attendance and pay attention. She gives a study guide for exams. Exams are worth almost all of your grade. If you don't study you won't pass.,1
"Dr. Cheers definitely picks favorites and picks on students in the class. If you do not stand out in the class during discussion, you will be unacknowledged by him. If you do not participate, you may as well not be in the class at all because of how he treats his students. Definitely participate if you plan on taking this class.",0
I love the way he teaches. I had fun and retained the information. Would recommend and take it again.,1
"It sucks that her classes are always so late at night. Tests and quizes are a pain in the neck (weird wording, asking you for the answer specifically from the book or lecture). Generally has a dog in class which made my semester with her bearable.",1
Dr. Carter is a fantastic professor and is very passionate about anthropology. He is easy to talk to and super willing to help. 10/10 recommend taking his class.,1
"Dr. Love is an awesome prof! He talks really really fast during class, but before midterms he always goes over things that the class didnt understand! GO TO CLASS--he leaves blanks!!!!   tests are VERY fair!",1
"Hes a nice man, but this was the worst class Ive ever taken. The first 1/4 of the semester was a waste because he quizzed the class on the different edition of the book. Class average was a mid/low C at the time of the final. Syllabus is inaccurate and the final exam was cumulative without a study guide. Do not take this class.",0
Great professor. Never be late,1
"Very long, monotone, boring classes.",0
This is my second time taking math 222 and he really helped me understand the the criteria and make connections on how everything is basically related. this is something other math teacher were never able to do. he helped me see math in a simpler way.,1
A bit eccentric at times but excellent teacher. Thinks fast.,1
Very easy gen ed. Just do the homework and its an easy A,1
No Comments,0
"I would recomend taking professor Fujimoto over any other teacher. Shes easy to work with and has great feedback. If you attend class, listen and do her readings youll pass. She doesnt give tough assignments and is very flexible. I truly think shes an amazing teacher!",1
"Awesome teacher!! Grades are just 4 essays and attendance. I used to no like writing but after I took this class, I started to really like writing. Definitely take this class. I loved it so much. Dr. Hartman is amazing too. Very nice, caring, personable, and helpful.",1
THIS CLASS IS EASY! As long as you show up and complete the modules in class you will never have homework. I really like the lab notebook because all you do is input all the answers into the BBLearn Quizzes. There are opportunities for extra credit and Matt is so helpful and caring. He will work with you until you can understand the topics.,1
Arrogant but admits it. Does not give reference material. Knows his stuff. Not a fair grader. Grades your work as if you are an advanced student when you are in a beginning class. Can be rude!,0
No comment,0
I did not like human animal. She is a tough grader and picks favorites.,0
Gives extra credit and will help you understand the material. All points count.,1
Sara's classes are difficult because she pushes you to do your best. There wasn't a class where I didn't learn. She also teaches more than just the text book; she gives you an incite into life and her successes and failures. She is also hilarious.,1
"Awesome teacher. Helpful, friendly, knowledgeable and kind.",1
her grading is overly hard and harsh even if she gives you the answers! never really explain anything after grading or offers really valuable help!,0
One of the few professors that genuinely cares about her students.,1
"She is a tough marker, but if you want honest constructive criticism on your creative writing, she will give it to you. Very passionate about writing and funny with her anecdotes.",1
"As an English major who HATES math, I was surprised to find that this class turned to be my fav this semester. I never took stats in hs so I was a bit nervous, but Jason is really cool and his class is so well organized. Everything actually made sense-- something that I've never experienced with math before. Everyone loves him,definitely recommend!",1
"There were weekly readings/homework assignments, 1 MC midterm, 1 8-10 page paper, and 1 essay question for the final. This course requires lots of reading. All his exams/essays required pulling quotes from the readings. Lecture was a waste of time. Do the readings, go to your TA for the essay questions, and you'll be set for an A.",0
"This class is an easy A. Since it's an online class u really have to be on top of ur game since she doesn't assign work every week. It's easy to forget ur taking the class. Tests and homework is not hard if u follow the exam samples. The samples are the same as the tests, she just inserts different numbers.",1
"The class is basically lectures based on the textbook chapter and then reading assignments from that chapter. Reading the textbook is actually important. Tests aren't bad, everything on them he covers in the lecture which are interesting so not a pain to pay attention. He's really good about responding to questions in class and emails.",1
She is an awesome teacher and really keeps class interesting!,1
"This is an online students worst nightmare. Avoid this professor if you can. The GEOL 100 is more difficult than the 300 level courses Im currently taking. Concepts from the book dont match whats on the test, the lab made me feel like a 2nd grader, everything is locked until the week its due, and if you use the Calendar, you will miss some things.",0
My favourite professor so far. Scott is very organized. He always reminds students of each assignment and test. His lectures are the best. Powerpoint presentations and real-life examples are very helpful. His assignments take a lot of time but are very interesting and useful for understanding topics. I would recommend him 100%,1
"Prof Wade is highly experienced in network infrastructure and OS. Taken with Windows Server, an experience oriented course. Wade was able to provide guidance as needed, but perhaps does not emphasize importance of time needed outside class. WinServ is VERY lab heavy, strongly recommend using free lab time or working on labs on personal laptop",1
"She's a tough grader, and gets irritated very easily when students don't do what she wants them to. Make sure to read articles before class and be ready for discussion or she will kick you out of class.",1
"Excellent lecturer! Presented International Politics in a way that made me want to go to class, even though it wasn't mandatory.  My interest was peaked whilst taking the course but IP is not my thing. Definitely check him out though, great prof!",1
"Professor Cox is extremely knowledgeable in her field. Her modules are clearly organized and some of the assignments were actually quite fun/interesting. Professor Cox makes it easy to grasp ideas, concepts, theories, etc. She truly wants students to succeed. I would highly recommend her. Not a hard class at all.",1
"Hectic work load for a 3 hour course. Read the entire textbook and still got a B. You must read, even though most assignments have unlimited time limit. Textbook was interesting to read. Midterm and final exam are proctored. A lot of work for a 6 week class.",1
"Power points are helpful, Go to class , study the questions in the back of the book easy A!",1
"This class was amazing! I've always loved psychology, but Criminal Behaviour was fascinating and exciting. There is a lot of material, and unless she changes something, you will need to read the textbook for testable material (but text's in library). Her tests and assignments were fun and fair, and gave you lots grade opportunities!",1
I had professor Bugai for the two years I was at the Center. He is willing to help you if you need it. His tests are semi-easy. If you take notes and study them you are set. About 1o questions or so come from the book. So you dont neccessarily need the book. OVERALL GREAT PROF!,1
"If you care enough about school to go to class, don't mind actually learning something interesting in college, and have a sense of humor, then Dr. H is for you. She's one of the best professors I've had.",1
Arrogant ***!,0
"Professor Morris is a great professor! He definitely had to adjust the course for this past semester to allow for Learning from Anywhere, and there were a few hiccups, but overall great course. When he found that like 75% of students were failing by mid-semester, he adjusted the grading criteria so that most students had A's. He's super helpful!",1
"She's just so classy and cool! She also tackled pretty difficult concepts and novels on top of handling a 200-person classroom with such professionalism. I give her major props. I can't decide yet if I want to take every class with her or if I just want to be her, but she's great.",1
"Excellent introduction course for high school students. The due dates are in the online syllabus unless previously mentioned, and it taught me to balance D2L and in person courses. He grades fairly easy as long as it is formatted properly and over 500 words. The homework is fast and easy once you get used to the requirements.",1
"Yes, she has her mood. Her way to teach and the analogies she uses are funny. She tries hard to help you when you let her know that you need help. She goes by the book, gives U a lot of chances to get extra points. I think she just needs a little more sense of responsibility.",1
Good knowledge of the subject.,1
"Portfleet is great! She makes you think and really explore what she is teaching, you wont be just reading out of a textbook but rather reading straight from some of the greatest writers in history! She really will open up your mind and let you explore!",1
Jamie is very supportive of her students. She is always willing to meet with students that want extra help. She is extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic about Canine behavior and understanding and speaking dog. She challenges you  to think out side the box.,1
"Easy, but not teaching us what we need to learn to be doctors",1
"Online class with weekly quizzes, assignments and discussion boards. Not to difficult as long as you complete work on time. The work load is not demanding either. Great course.",1
"Pop quizzes, tons of reading, takes long to respond to emails. You won't see your grades until the semester is almost over, so you will have no idea how you are doing. Tried to talk in person about my topic for a research paper and was told ""email me"". Then did not get an email back for days. Don't take.",0
He teaches in a way that is easy to understand and will answer any question you have. He always has exams and quizzes graded by the next class day. He has an exam about every two weeks but he lets you know every concept you need to for the exam the day before so you can prepare. He never has anything in the exam that he didn't focus on.,1
"Dr. Crowley is an exceptional chemistry professor.  I am an older returning adult student who has never taken chemistry classes.  I learned a great deal from her and she would always stay after class to clarify any content we had questions on.  The course was very challenging, but it is set by the ACS, and she has no control over the end test.",1
In the beginning of this class I was super overwhelmed and almost dropped it. I'm very glad I didn't because it turned out to be my favorite class and a pretty easy A. The readings may seem overwhelming but you only have to skim them as long as you watch the lectures. Professor is very kind and understanding. Would love to take again.,1
"Professor Kanchi's Cloud Computing class is awful. The lecture material doesn't cover the topics you need to know in order to succeed in the lab, she frequently doesn't respond to emails and has difficulty picking up on questions. Much of the material she provides for the lab is both erroneous and out of date. To do well, you need to find a student",0
"He does in fact grade like a jerk. Ethics is more about perspective, except that his perspective is what will give you a good grade. If you keep to his script and repeat back his own words back to him, he will grade you accurately and this class will be an easy A. I recommend this professor if you're okay with always agreeing with him. 1/10.",0
"Dr. M, She is by far one of the best professors I've ever come to know. Her enthusiasm for teaching is unmatched. She truly believes in all her students and is willing to work with you if you are struggling. However, I don't see how any student could struggle in her courses because she believes wholeheartedly in her student's success!",1
"Professor Cowherd, while well published and highly regarded in the eyes of faculty and the institute itself, is fundamentally lacking in teaching ability. His single assignment type and grading are overwhelmingly subjective and his elitist and arrogant personality make for an underwhelming and frustrating classroom environment. WILL NOT TAKE AGAIN.",0
There is an extreme amount of homework in this class. The tests are done in the testing center and they are worth 70 percent of the overall grade.  If you don't understand the material and you don't study you will not pass!,1

Buhler will work you to death but in the end you realize that you learned more from him than everything else you did with your undergraduate career. Almost everything that makes me a strong computer scientist I learned from this guy. And his stories are great.,1
"Awesome coding hw, but very time consuming and pretty hard. Class is a waste, he explains code in his own word and does not reference his lecture slides he made. His midterm & final will not be anywhere close to the lectures. Horrible coding examples. Its 20 mins of silence while he codes and shows it works and moves on. Does not elaborate the code",0
"Her class is extremely well organized, she definitely knows what she's talking about and explains all the concepts in a way that is easy to understand. PSYC221 is graded by a lot of assignments, so it might be hard to maintain an A+, but there are a lot of extra credit opportunities. 10/10 recommend taking a class taught by professel",1
"Kind of a picky grader on tests, but if you really want to learn, take him, you can learn a ton about stats. Super easy going, great at explaining.",1
"She was like a guide introducing us to this brand new world that you can tell she was passionate about. Was the class hard? Yes! However, its better to learn from someone with her knowledge about the ocean than just out of a textbook. Do not miss the field trips. Theyre incredible!",1
sooo easy and she's a really nice person. very passionate about the subject matter. Can be boring alot but still recommend,1
"Olzman's class is the only class I look forward to and I'm not even a COMM major. She challenges you to become a better speaker and performer. You will dive into your identity. You must come to class and she is easily approachable to speak about anything. Highly empathetic, hilarious, and one of the best professors I've ever taken. Highly recommend",1
Mr. Humphrey's class is very straightforward and the assignments are easy to follow. I personally liked this class because he was able to relate to his students and hardly gives any work. The weekly discussions are solely based on personal experiences. There are no quizzes or tests except the occasional essays (hardly any).,1
"Prof. Warden is the best professor that I've had so far as a student at Cornell!!!  She is so passionate about her subject, and her lectures were inspirational!  So interesting, and really clear - I learned an incredible amount.  Recommend!",1
"I enjoyed Susan.  Her passion for film is a joy to watch and be apart of.  There were sometimes where she would be a little dramatic, but the good definitely outweighs the bad.  I highly recommend Susan. Take this class with her, she's the best!",1
"Has an accent but it is not hard to understand. Homework is assigned every week & you have 1 week to do it. His test are similar to the review handouts he places on his website, but do not ONLY use those to study, refer back to the HW too. HW is all on the interweb. After the first exam, things get a lot harder. Try to take a different professor.",0
"So nice and friendly. He goes out of his way to help his students by making study guides and reformatting tests if students are having issues. Too easy in my opinion, but hey.",1
"I love Ms. V. Shes very straight forward with what she wants from you and her rubrics are very detailed. As long as youre willing to do the work and be respectful in class, youre sure to get a good grade! Textbook is needed theres chapter quizzes every week and a half. But its not difficult if you actually read!",1
Insightful,1
"Really great and humorous in History / Theory. Great with delivering his lectures. Requires in class assignments for attendance and participation grade. If you have concerns about your grade, he is very understanding and willing to help. A little bit difficult on the exams but worth having as a professor.",1
I think that the best way to describe this professor is mediocre. I felt that he was not the best at lecturing and being clear about what we needed to know. He kind of rushes through topics and can be difficult to understand. One AWESOME thing that he does though: index card during test and good test reviews! Also he takes attendance.,0
Have to buy textbook but online access code is not necessary. Lots of reading but assignments are easy. Lots of extra credit opportunities. There is a final paper and first draft has to be peer edited so stay on top of timelines but paper is fairly easy. Typically responds to emails in 24-48 hrs and lets you know if she'll be away for a while.,1
"Wicked easy class. Easy tests, 50 Multiple choice and My class was allowed a sheet of paper for all 4 of them to help us. Despite that, I didn't need it much because he was a great teacher. Would take again and recommend for future CJ students. Good guy.",1
"Un prof exceptionnel, très exigent, mais si l'on comprend sa manière de voir les choses, et qu'on lui fournit ce qu'il demande, vous allez beaucoup apprendre avec lui. Encore faut-il faire l'effort d'aller dans son sens et de ne pas se braquer contre lui. Ce cours est à prendre absolument avec lui.",1
"Fantastic teacher. REALLY engaged. The material was interesting. So sad I won't get to take more classes from her--she's not at SF anymore and that's too bad for all other Comm students. Make sure you don't say anything discriminatory, though; she will call you out on it in the middle of class to make you think. Not the class for you if you can't.",1
"If you want a lazy class and hope to pass, this is the teacher for you. You don't need to read, just show up to every class and turn in the work. There's only 6 essays, this including midterm and final. Don't expect to learn, challenge or know what is going on in class. If you ask him for help, you'll be more confused than before.",0
Take him. He is the best teacher I ever had,1
"Very nice guy. You can tell he wants to help his students and always does one-on-one revision/feedback sessions for every essay. He does give plenty of time to write each paper, but it doesn't really matter how much time you are given since he'll always find something to nitpick you on. Still a bearable class that certainly has its good moments.",1
My GPA went down coz of him.Not A good professor. I recommended NOT TO TAKE him. Dont ruin ur career and grades. Take Other Professors than him who can teach you hard way but then you u get something at the end. WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME.,0
Her notes in class aren't really too helpful but you have to go for attendance points. Read the textbook and her tests are really fair (i'm talking easy 90's if you read the textbook)!!! Just put in the time and do the HW. I am by no means a chem person and still did very well.,1
I recommend to not take any classes by him. He is such a tough grader in classes that are intro and expects you to know everything about the topic. Let alone he lists his criteria and if you follow it at best you would get 3/10 he expects you to go above and beyond. Most people end up failing his class or devoting all their time to it.,0
"She will even allow you to text her if you need help, but you probably won't need help.  She is very inspirational and helpful.",1
"Prof Espo is the best! He is a great lecturer and really keeps people engaged. He loves extra credit. If you don't like reading, probably don't take his class, but the homework is reasonable and the tests are straight forward. Really great guy.",1
Ms. Vanorden is one of the best math teachers I have ever had. she has a way of breaking down the material and offering tips that make everything easy to understand. She has a very quirky personality that keeps thing fun. I would definitely take her again and recommend her to anyone.,1
"Professor Sheridan's lectures are heavy, but really interesting. The notes you take help for all the exams. He provides a detailed study guide for each test and he really cares about people's grades. We read 3 books, 3 exams, and 1 paper. He also uses films in class, which helps understand topics more. He cares a lot and you will definitely learn!",1
"Angel Pilar was a great teacher! everyone that I recommended him to loves him as well. Not only does he genuinely try to help you succeed, but he's one of those teachers that will go the extra mile. He overall teaches well and gives u class time to learn and ask for help",1
"Many dislike Serocki, but I actually enjoyed his humor and overall character. However, his lectures are power point based. He doesn't read slides word for word, but he just skims them stream of consciousness style because he knows everything. Numerical examples are few and far between. HW optional. Not the worst tax class you can take I think.",0
dont take her she thinks this is a history school. fuller was the best bro whatever happened to that guy,0
"Absolutely LOVED this class and Dr. Heilman! She was so incredibly engaging! Each class was consumed with energy and higher learning. She is incredibly intuitive, and encourage participation.  Class discussion came naturally! The course material was great! Her grading was fair, her expectations clear and her lecture style was excellent! Easy A.",1
"I took Prof Baileys ENG-205 to complete my transfer credit that includes English with the Critical Thinking. I took her summer course and it inlcudes lots of TEDtalks, Essays, Maintain a Journal that analyzes a Novel. With all the work she assigns, she is a fair grader and gives good feedback. I would take her again.",1
Love Dr. Chalk!! Great class that is always interesting and sparks class discussions. Can't wait to take another class with her!,1
Do not take if you're not great in Math,0
"He is the easiest professor i have dealt with. He will tell you in 1st day of that you are  guaranteed an A or B at the worst if you come to class. All the exams are 12 take home and the reviews are same as the exams, he only changes the numbers. Easy A for everyone, even if you are horrible in math like i was. He is the man. Best professor ever.",1
"I am a transfer student and a current Junior. Flannery is the best teacher I have had at Missouri State, and it isn't close. He is really awesome at making sure the whole class understands a rather complicated subject, and if people don't understand, he will take the necessary time to ensure they do. I would recommend Flannery to every student.",1
he's awesome!! The class definitely got A LOT harder and practice exams are only about 50% of what shows up on the actual class but he prepares you well for exams.,1
He's one of the best,1
"As long as you show up and take notes in class, you should easily get a B.  However, if you are not extremely liberal and/or a minority it will be painful to listen to her lectures.",1
"Dr. Zbeida is a very good professor. She is caring and generous in her grading scale. There is alot of reading and writing essays, but then again, this is an English Comp class. It's to be expected. I would definitely recommend this professor. She is funny,lighthearted and accessible outside of class. Very approachable.",1
"Professor Birnbaum is a interesting teacher. He is unorganized with his lectures and grading. All over the place. IF you ask a question he will make you feel incompetent. tests are ridiculous, the study guide barely helps. I would advise taking this class with a different teacher. he ruined my experience of forensics :(",0
Never taken CHEM at any level.  Had not attended college in 15 years.  Neither mattered.  Amazing professor that demands work but is helpful and clear about what it takes to succeed.  Lecture was informative. Web tools she offered as supplemental material was extremely helpful. I took the course in the summer she was huge factor in my success.,1
Prof Morra is a cool guy who loves sociology. class consists of taking notes as he talks about the power point he is projecting. If you take notes you will be set when it comes time to write his essays. No tests or quizzes just 3 very detailed and long essays. If you HATE writing papers DO NOT take this class. Min page count for papers is 15 pages,1
"This was my first semester at ASU and David Boyles was, by far, my favorite professor. The assignments all surrounded interesting and current events and we only read two short books, one of them being a graphic novel. Boyles grades based on individual effort and writing skills, so as long as you put in your best efforts, you will get an A+.",1
"Matt does a great job keeping class interesting, despite the sometimes dull subject matter. I have really enjoyed learning from him and hearing his own personal experience. Definitely would recommend the class for a 150 gen ed.",1
Wish I would have taken her for all English related classes. ,1
"Her classes were interesting, but she grades so hard. She hardly ever gives full credit for anything. I would never take this professor again. She is very strange. I ended up with an 89.5 and she would not round me up to an A.",0
"She is so sweet! Very understanding if there is an issue going on and is willing to help work it out. All of the assignments were very easy, especially the tests. I didn't study and got 100s on all of them. Least stressful class of this semester.",1
"Not an easy class regardless of who your professor is. You will have to spend hours studying on your own or you will not do well. Dr. Levitin is very smart, knows the material very well, and is willing to help you. He has a super dry sense of humor, but if you don't take his sarcasm too seriously you'll find him very funny. I highly recommend him!",1
He was no real help even when I specifically emailed him for assistance. This was a very frustrating and stressful class. I have no idea if it would even be better taken as a non online course.,0
"Dr. Michael is the absolute GOAT. Dude is super cool and has tons of real world applicable examples and case studies. Will make you work hard, but is definately worth it. Tests are straightforward, and if you make a good formula sheet and put the problems he says will be on the test on there, you will get atleast a B. BEST ME PROF AT GANNON!!!!",1
he explains things decently --the text book slides are almost too detailed - first midterm was a joke (just like practice problems and test bank multiple chocie) . Second midterm was insanely hard. Its mt1 mt 2 final so lots of pressure on the final (still need to write it rip).Know your Substitution and Income effects and shifting curve- repetitiv,1
Took his calc 2 class at Scripps and loved him! Very hard class but he makes it so it's easy to get a good grade even if you don't do everything right. Homework assignments are very long but you have a week to do them and they are graded very generously and he tells you exactly what will be on the tests. Be sure to take good notes!!,1
Constantly goes off topic to talk about the Carrib community in Dominica. Have to read a lot of articles and 2 VERY boring books. Tests are way too hard and require you to do too much. Often wondered if we'd ever make it through a powerpoint.,1
"Prof. List makes you do the homework, or you won't pass. Gives extra credit and is caring. His passion for the subject is amazing and makes me want to major in geology. He explains his lectures by using hand movements which can be hilarious when you watch him. He is a great Teacher, highly recommend his classes and the Lab as well.",1
"All AC 470 classes do the same tests, projects, and homework, but the professor makes the difference. She is AMAZING, and will make you fall in love with audit as well as herself. She tells inspirational stories about her life and Deloitte (she worked there!). Even if you hate accounting, she will make you want to go to class and be the best! ",1
"This class is really straight forward. His tests are easy because he gives a study guide and takes a few of those exact questions and puts them on the test. I like the way he lectures, he gets the class involved in discussions. He makes you feel really comfortable to speak up in class and add to the discussion. Overall a great professor",1
"She is super nice to all of the students. She cares about everyone and she wants her students to grow. There is textbook reading and many discussion posts. If you are present, you will pass. She is organized and communicates to students a lot!",1
"Professor is incredibly knowledgeable about Astronomy! This is a college course, so don't expect to be babied. 3 tests, gives full study guides which is nice of him, 7 easy hmw, & lots of extra credit! Do all of them because it can boost your grade to 10.5 %!!! that is a whole entire grade!!  Lectures can drag, ask questions & see him office hrs",1
"Mr. S is, beyond a doubt, the best philosophy professor I have ever had. He is passionate and excited about his subject, and he wants to instill this excitement into his students. He expects you to learn, but knowing the material, you feel like it was worth it. His jokes are also the funniest part of college life. Seriously, you need to take him.",1
"The class I took with Dwosh was a nice class once a week. The class is very easy as long as you actually try. The books he assigned were very interesting and I'm glad I got them. Nothing special about him, but he is a good professor that teaches leadership in an engaging way.",1
"He is one of the best math teachers I've had in a while. The material is pretty easy, and he gives lots of examples. He uses his own print-out notes, so do not buy the textbook. His tests are basically the study guides he gives you. His tests are not very hard at all, and he is a very caring man.",1
She is super nice and helpful. STRONGLY RECOMMENDED,1
"Amazing professor! She really pushes you to your full potential. Although she doesn't always use her powerpoint during lecture, she keeps the lecture entertaining and makes the material easier to understand. As a clinical professor, she is fast paced and keeps you on your toes. She may keep you past lunch so make sure you bring a quick snack.",1
"Most helpful professor I've had QMB 3200 exams are impossible. Good luck. But FIN 3403 was easy, pretty fun!",1
"One of my favorite professors here at ETSU. Very few grades, only 3 tests plus final and homework, but they are very fair. He gives out sample tests before every test, which are very similar to the actual tests. Just know how to do those, do the homework, and you will end up with an easy A. Highly recommend, especially for a subject most people find difficult!",1
"Coop is a great guy. He knows what he's talking about and wants you to succeed. However, he is not clear with where he is going in the lecture sometimes and he also does not do a lot of examples. If you do all of the homework it will help with your understanding, but just be prepared for having to teach yourself some things.",1
The best teacher I ever had,1
She is such a sweetheart. She answers every question you ask and she keeps you interested. I love when she tells us she won't tell us any stories and then she does anyway.,1
"It took a few sessions to get get a grasp on his teaching methods.  In the beginning I found him tough to hearunderstand. He lightens up as class progresses. Readpresent alot of cases (says 1, but you end up doing all).  Grade is based on participation & exam; fair grader.  His book is used and it's well written & worth reading to prep for class.",1
"He is a very boring professor, he asks trick questions on the tests, he brags about people getting low grades on his tests, he makes study guides that have nothing to do with whats on the tests, theres little to no extra credit in this class, and he doesnt round up grades at the end of the semester",0
"An engaging and entertaining class experience, but all of our tests were a series of essay questions, so it's vital to take specific notes and avoid skipping classes. You don't need to read word for word because she will clearly highlight the important stuff during lectures and discussions.",1
Dr. Hoffman is THE BEST!! Don't even think about taking anyone but him. He is more than fair in regards to what he expects you to take away from his lectures. He is extremely engaging and really tries to make everything understandable and fun. He also has office hours after class which are helpful. I LOVED this class and wish I could take it again.,1
"Prof's lectures tend to bore me since it is redundant and not straight to the point. Otherwise, when it comes to projects, it may be frustrating when attempting to get approval to start painting, but Prof B encourages you to go further and bring out the project's value with some tweaks. Good class if you're willing to go past artistic boundaries.",1
"Not the most caring professor, but very straightforward. Tests are straight memorization, but not difficult. Study and you will do well.",1
"Took her for chem111 and she is mu favorite chem professor out of the 3 I've taken. Yes it's a tough class but she is easy to approach and explains things better if you ask her too. I would take her again, assuming I pass the class",1
"So BORING, has the same type of voice throughout the entire lecture, not enthusiastic about, he seems knowledgeable though. Wouldn't recommend taking this guy for a three hour long class. You'll die out of boredom. Take othe homework in case you do.",1
"She is an awesome professor! I love when she teaches class, she knows what she is doing, and she keeps things fun and interesting. The class is difficult, but as long as you do your part, she'll do hers!",1
awesome teacher!!!! loved her class she is great in a lecture and explains the poems well! take her and you won't regret it!!!!!!,1
Carol is a sweet lady who cares about her students. She has a tendency to ramble and can be boring at times. The homework was extremely hard. Tests are not so much based on knowledge as memorization.,1
"At a first look at the syllabus, I thought this class was going to be a real kicker, but Dr. Davis has the course structured so that assignments flow smoothly and are manageable. Really accessible professor. Dr. Davis tries to use humor and real world application in lectures. Probably the most effective online class I've taken-- I actually learned.",1
"You really need to be on top of your game throughout to really ace this class. To rephrase, it is a matter of time, as to when you start feeling lost. Easier material  tough exams and homework Tough material  pretty straightforward (but still tough) Extra credit is up to 4 points on 100 where you need to correct around 25 solutions/point",1
"This professor does not give you a clear understanding of the assignments and she does not take the time to answer students questions, she is just worried about getting though the slides. You will end up figuring out each assignment on your own.",0
Terrible teacher. This was the worst class I've taken at Hamline. His jokes are stupid and makes a fool of anyone that raises their hand.,0
"Professor Morrow is a wonderful teacher who enjoys teaching.  He is caring and will do everything he can to help you pass with the exception of taking your test for you!  Do your homework, take notes, and ask questions.  He is reasonable if you have to miss class just let him know ahead of time.  Best!",1
"Dr. Guerrero is sweet and caring. Even though it is a blended class and we barely meet in the classroom, she recognizes her students by name and will say hi if you pass her on campus! Projects are interesting and relevant mostly. She is also very understanding, and will let you turn in assignments late or will help you a lot if you need her!",1
"The quarter is very lopsided, all your points are earned in the last few weeks when she assigns a ton. She is very vague about what you should do on assignments.",0
So funny!!!  I do not think he means to be funny but OMG how he is amusing!  If you want to stay awake in class then take this professor ... he is hysterical!!!,1
"Amazing professor, funny, smart, awesome.  May be the best class at LUC.  Study way in advance, take thorough notes, make flashcards with the images of the paintings on them and you will succeed.  She is helpful, nice, great.  Has sparked an interest in something I never knew I liked.  PLEASE TAKE HER CLASSES!!!",1
"We only had class twice a week (instead of the scheduled three) because the project is 49% of the grade, but the result was that barely any class time was spent on the material, even though the majority of the textbook was assigned. He changed the project guidelines every time he was asked about them and there was no syllabus for the course. Avoid.",0
"Really liked Dr. Kroll. A little hard, but as long as you ALWAYS show up for class, and do all of the work as best as you can, you will do fine. Really likeable guy, and I highly recommend his course!",1
I really enjoyed being in Professor Rubin's class. She has so much experience in the field and offers lots of knowledge. She is very caring in her own way and was supportive.,1
"Phenomenal Professor! Wonderful teacher and great lectures! Makes lectures fun and exciting, class goes by quick. Need to show up to class but totally worth it. Has a plethora of work experience in his field and his stories are nothing but the best. Overall has been a wonderful class and I have learned so much. This class is worth taking over again",1
Shes so helpful. I dont like to read but in an online environment you got to. Shes great,1
"Dr. Bliss is a GREAT professor! For QMB, make sure to do all the homework on time (easy points), and study at least a week in advance for his exams. The homework and tests are similar, but there are some questions on exams that dig a little deeper. Make sure to attend his webinars before exams, and I highly suggest Skoolers exam review packets!",1
Really nice helpful guy. Take his classes if you're interested in class discussion otherwise it might be really boring. But if you put something into it you'll get a lot out.,1
"He is great! he gets it! It is one unit and if you need it and make some sort of effort to involve yourself the grade will show it. It isn't hard to do as he is a cool breeze of fresh air as a person and a prof. Funny ,hot and in great shape for his age he walks the phys.ed. walk and knows the talk. : )",1
Very easy to work with. And very clear in his expectations.,1
Do not hesitate. Take Dr. Hunt! Easily bets professor I have had!,1
Professor Kroll is great! His lectures are very easy to follow and as long as you take the notes and study you should pass. He usually has one homework and one a quiz a week which is great for grade boosters so just make sure you study for those. Also go to his office hours and he will help with anything you don't get!,1
Okay honestly if you take this class thinking you'll get an A without trying that will not happen but this class with Dr. McDonald is NOT that bad. She could be better but if you put in some effort to study and pay attention in lecture then you'll do fine. If you were expecting an easy A don't complain about the prof if that doesn't happen.,1
AWFUL!!! she is unwilling to help students at all and could care less about them. avoid this professor at all costs. worst experience i have had in my 6 years of post-secondary,0
great professor,1
"I cannot say enough positive things about Mr. Wildman. math has never been an ""easy"" task for me, due to lack of interest. Mr. Wildman changed that for me. He was engaging, funny, animated, and truly cares. He uses real world examples based off of the entire classes interests, which makes it feel like it matters. Recommended to anyone",1
Does not relate lecture to its application irl or the purpose of why he teaches us things. Assumes you have all prior knowledge of an advanced topic in what is meant to be the entry level course.,0
Dr. Sikora is a great guy and a pretty good professor. During office hours he walks you through problems and answers all questions that you may have. He is always willing to help out as long as you show interest and are not just trying to get the answers from him. He is a very fair teacher and makes you want to learn more about mathematics.! ,1
"A lot of Extra Credit. The Homework online is the same as the test, and you can retake every Test.",1
Prof Gray is so sweet! She was my TA for this class. You can tell she's really passionate about what she's teaching and really wants to interact with all of her students. She's really knowledgeable about all of the material as well. She is always available for outside help or just to talk. She was a pretty easy grader and just wants the best for us,1
No Comments,0
"A great professor and a great department head. She can be hard to get hold of out of class, but she does try. Will sometimes miss classes, but since this is usually due to family matters it's understandable. Only problem I had with her classes is that the book was more or less unused beyond its glossary.",1
"If you like spending the entire class listening to podcasts of other people. Being treated like kids in middle school, and being read to. Then you might find enjoyment for taking her as your professor for the work is fairly easy. Oh and if you have 2 unexcused absences you can lose a letter grade.",0
Was not a fan of this class or professor. Very dry lectures that were essentially read from the textbook verbatim and not engaging whatsoever. I took this class during COVID and the entire course was just multiple choice tests... Try a different professor if you actually want to enjoy this class.,0
"Dr. Harvey will make you work but her practice tests and office hours clear everything up. Do the extra problems in the book when you can, and do practice tests before the test- you will do grea. I really appreciate that she takes the time to explain anything I get confused on at office hours. She had practice questions in class, which helped lots.",1
Dr. Avila is awesome. If you want an easy A don't take her class. But if you are a fair student who studies then you'll have no problem. She's really nice and super sarcastic. It's funny. Everyone loves her. Great teacher.,1
"Very nice lady and can tell she is passionate about what she does, but does not communicate with the students well. She doesn't follow the syllabus and is scatter-brained. However, it is a somewhat-easy class and is an easy grader. She does boring lectures and if you hate group projects, you're gonna hate this class because it is nothing but that. ",0
he is great...but he's kinda boring...it's hard to stay up in his class and he doesn't like cell phones out while he's lecturing...it was a great class though...,1
"Great professor. Loves his subject, and very animated during lectures. Pop quizzes, but he reviews a lot, and the tests are from the quizzes. One paper, but he basically coaches you on how to write it and is very helpful. Loves to joke, but pay attention in class or you will be called out (and possibly miss vital info). Would definitely take again.",1
"Makes jokes the entire class, doesn't teach!!!",0
Her lectures were very engaging. It wasn't hard to concentrate she always tried to make lectures fun and interesting. You do have to read the textbook because the exams are based 50% on the textbook and 50% on lecture slides.,1
"Caruso was awesome, I missed probably 4 classes and still managed to pull off an A. Mid-term was easy, he gives you the test a couple weeks before. There is one presentation (something related to Dev. Psych but you get to pick the topic), he does not grade too hard on it and mostly wants to cause a discussion out of it. No final :)",1
"Johns keepin it real in the classroom all the time, big mans got big tings for students around campus and from a far. i have lots of respect for mans and aspire to get a Phd. see ya next year pal",1
"Nelson may be a ""brilliant"" author; this does not make him a good professor. Nor an ""OK"" one. His classroom persona/schtick/call it what you will, precludes his engagement with material and students. His classes exude what appears to be a lot of knowledge, but you'll leave class everyday emptyhanded- because everything Nelson does is about Nelson.",0
"The guy is funny ill give you that,but he already expects you to be almost perfect in GRAMMER.He calls his class ""grammar land"" fun right? His teaching method is horrible..The final was on a regret we have, I should have wrote about the regret i have for not dropping his class. Dont buy the fiction book only the Rules for writers(helpful)",0
She goes out of her way to prevent you from reaching your full potential. She is arrogant and laughs at students who are trying their best but may just need some guidance. She expects you to be a professional researcher like her. Avoid her if possible.,0
"GM is an even tempered folksy adjunct whose lectures are a walk through the textbook examples. Minimal mandatory homework & detailed preview of what to expect on tests means no surprises. He is available for help before & after class, in math lab, or by home phone. He does his best to accommodate late additions. I don?t know how this gets better.",1
"Mrs. Bowlin does not teach at all. she just sits there and reads the ""questions"" that will be on the test. i have not really learned anything in the class. and we don't have any type of disscussion. any time that there is an attempt at disscussion from one of the students she shoots it down.",0
"Sara is a very nice person at heart, but as a teacher I think it is hard to have her. Her grading system is very confusing and doesn't allow for students to keep track, and she makes the class very lecture heavy, which often leads to boredom from students. There is definitely a way to make the class more interesting. Wonderful person, not teacher.",0
"I used at least 30% of my phone battery every class to look online for all of the answers to the packets she gives you. Yeah... packets. This is not elementary school. I think she really only ""lectured"" once and it was in the first month of class. If you like learning on your own and learning from YouTube videos, then this is the one for you.",1
"Dr. Zbeida is one of my favorite professors! I took her for comp 1, and now am in her comp 2 class. She gives amazing feedback and really wants her students to improve and do their best. We had a couple of papers and lots of group assignments that were completion grades. This is a fairly easy class, but I recommend her for her dedication and help!",1
It's one thing to know the world of philosophy and it's another to know pop culture and think it's the path to understanding. Gentry is as shallow and unoriginal as I've ever taken. Very disappointed and wish I could get my money refunded.,0
"Attendance is mandatory, you can miss 4 classes in the semester with no penalty, but each time after that affects your grade. All of his homework is onequizlet and is due every Sunday. There's also a total of 3 exams. Prof. Baez was extremely understanding during the covid situation, and truly wants his students to pass.",1
"Though she came off as tough, she was a great teacher. A lot of people didn't like her because she made us work but it's college it's time to be an adult. All Directions were precise and clear. I was always determined by her toughness and turned in every assignment on time,  never missed class, and got an A.",1
This professor is a tough grader but if you do the work and just pay attention he is a really good professor and makes you work for your grade.,1
"Incredibly intelligent, comedic and very obviously invested in the subject. Trouble was I simply couldn't find myself interested in the subject by nature, as earthquake science was made clear fairly early on to be a subject that couldn't be taught with certainty. Nonetheless, a good class. ",1
"Loves what he does and is happy to answer all of your questions. Has a workbook, which you work each day by answering question and answers, just like in English.",1
"Out of all my classes taken at ACC, this one has proven to be one of the better ones. The professor gives good lectures and plenty of lab time. He is caring and wants his students to succeed. Extra credit given if needed. Looking forward to taking more classes with him.",1
"Good: Extra credit offered, inspirational, great feedback, great learning opportunity about the stock market and presentations, kind, helpful Bad: writing intensive, must read to score high on hw or it may be the dif between an A & B. Don't miss any assignments.",1
"He lectures straight out of the book, so I wouldnt bother with the lectures. The tests are similar to the homework. He is a nice man, but frankly, his teaching is awful. He is getting paid to teach, not to be nice. Watching paint dry is more interesting.",0
Can be condescending at times and dismissive,1
"I honestly thought I was going to fail because of this pandemic. My class was without a teacher two weeks after school closed and then we were assigned, Professor Pfeifer. He was extremely understanding that this pandemic was emotionally and mentally draining on us. I was allowed to do assignments pass the original due date and get full credit.",1
Dr. Capper is a phenomenal professor! He takes an enormous amount of material and condenses it into a single semester. The keys to success in this class are 1. Come to Class 2. Do your reading and 3. take the time to know your study guide. Nothing will ever be on the test that isn't on the study guide. Easy A if you are willing to try.,1
"Really interesting class covering most of the main types of drugs.  Only one test and it's take home, the rest of your grade is made up of discussion, open book reading quizzes, and a final project on pretty much anything you want related to the class.  ",1
"If you looking for easy way to pass cmsc411,take his course. exams are 99% same if you go to the exam review. HWs are really simple if you spend some time searching through his note/google. Projects is the hardest which is not very challenging. I doubt any can fail in his course. Easy A with effort.",0
overall the material is great but unfortunately this guy does not have the ability to provide an example and clarification to the class. Hw is copy and paste which he will provide to you and during the exam he doesn't care whether you're cheating or not as long as your near the average or above the average you'll be guaranteed an B past exams need,0
"Hands down worst professor I ever had, talks down when people speak up in class ""The class room is a place to learn, not a place to ask questions"". Very unclear as to what is being taught during class, 1/2 of the content she lectures is about china and nothing to do with the course outline. Highly recommend to NOT take a course she lectures.",0
"100% of the grade is exams. There are 5. Dr. Hoffman does a great job of making sure that you cover all of the material you need to know, and he's helpful in office hours. He's clearly passionate about the subject, and spends 5 minutes at the end of most classes talking about the application of biochemistry. I had a great time, I'd recommend him.",1
"An insightful class which changes your view of the world. Reading expected before class, amazing lectures with heavy note taking. Study guides for each exam, but get ready to study, exams have a lot of material that require lots of explaining. If you follow his guidelines to success in his class then you'll have no problem succeeding.",1
Very nice and chill guy. He cares about his students. Gives a lot of extensions.,1
"A vaguely interesting guy and exposed the class to new ideas. But he is an intellectual lightweight, so don't go to class expecting analytic rigour.",1
"Great professor, fun and interactive class. Made every lecture interesting. Definitely a tough grader but cares about each student. Would ABSOLUTELY recommend.",1
Matt is super caring and sets you up to succeed in statistics! He's very respectful towards students and is very eager to help when you ask questions. The lab is not very hard as long as you stay on top of your work. You do get three freebies on labs though and you get extra credit at the end of the semester!,1
"She shows inappropriate films for the age group. She is lazy and not tech savvy at all. You don't get any feedback until it's too late, she also has mixed material for the class. I took as an elective, she calls herself a ""historian"", I'm glad she's ancient history for me. This class is boring and serves no benefit, not even to a history major.",0
"Solid easy A if you do the assignments correctly and study for quizzes. First assignment he doesn't explain how he expects you to turn it in which made me furious, but I got 100 on all others. I got 100 on almost all quizzes. Easy to find answers on module and textbook. You can live without but it makes it easier to have one. 6 HWs 5 quizes 2 exams",1
"Microeconomics. Paid approximately $40 for his homework program. Generously curves the first 2 exams. NOT the final. Homework is very simple. Exams are essentially homework questions so truly understand the homework. Sign-in sheet is passed around but once you sign, you can go w/o any consequences. Book is NECESSARY. Cheap. approx $10",1
"Easiest class I have ever taken. All the tests are online and they are taken at home, open book, even the final. It is an easy A!",1
"Rebecca was a very nice professor, but I despised her class. With all the mundane group projects and the activities we did, I felt like I was back in elementary or middle school rather than a college class. However, while she assigned a lot of work, most of it was easy. Attendance was mandatory though, which was annoying since class was useless.",1
"I have taken 6 classes in my 5 years here with this man. He is absolutely amazing. You have to know your stuff though. His tests are consistent so long as you take his upper division courses, the lower courses are harder because of his TA's (not his fault) I must say he is one of the best men out there, he's so knowledgeable but humble as well.",1
"This professor is by far the worst human I have come across in my 19 years on this planet. She has no teaching ability and I am fairly certain I learn more in my sleep than I do in her lectures. She docks marks for memorizing the information because she wants you to ""think deeper."" Justifies giving marks like 5.332. Please UBC, find a new professor",0
"Great and knowledgeable professor. Also can be a funny guy. If you ever have any questions, he's very approachable. Quizzes every class (once a week), three graded articles and a final. Quizzes are based off of the textbook, style guide and recent news events. The class wasn't hard, but if writing isn't your thing, it won't be easy.",1
"Easy professor. You do 3 presentations and they are, introduction of yourself, to inform, & to persuade. All your work is online and is all due at the end of the semester. There are NO TESTS AND NO FINAL EXAM. Take him if you want to get an A.",1
He doesn't make it mandatory attendance for regular days only for presentation days. his class is an easy day. i never used the book,1
Professor Mahallati's INTL 5530 graduate international law course requires a lot of reading. Her use of the socratic method challenged me to research topics more closely and prepare for class. Her questions were insightful and pushed me to higher levels. Course requires a lot of analytical thinking.,1
Great professor but she spoiled the Lion King for me,1
This professor needs to take responsibility and quit teaching at CSULA. No student should suffer with their grade and learning because of this guy.  Albert didn't  grade anything until finals week and doesn't bother to reply to student emails.  Midterm and Final was 10x harder than the homeworks and made students suffer. 1/10 worst  professor ever.,0
"He has very good slides presentation...but they are of no use!Dont waste paper printing them !Exams are tough....you will find nothing similar to what you have learnt throughout the course.He has his own methods of proving problems....and expects students will write on the exam paper exactly what he has in his""MIND"".In the beginig of the sem he tel",0
"She teaches and keeps you busy all semester long. If you like to write and enjoy doing it, take her.",1
"She was so helpful, and so understanding. There are only 3 papers and she helps you as much as she can. She is almost always available outside of class, and you can reach her through email as well. She is very funny too and has a very good personality. :)",1
"Very willing to help, exceptional ability to explain. Great professor.",1
"Dr. Feige has a passion for teaching and works very hard to explain things to help us understand, not just memorize. He uses lots of pictures. This course is hard! You have to work for your grade. He even posted video presentations explaining challenging topics.",1
She is not good about getting back to her students if you email her.  She doesn't use the PAL grade book so you have to ask her for your grades.  She is a very strict grader.,0
"I really enjoyed taking Interpersonal Communications online. She is super sweet and caring, and her online lectures are very professional and well put together. The class consisted of quizzes each module and either a discussion post or journal entry and a final. She provides great feedback on all of your assignments so take her if you can!",1
Hands down the best professor on campus. He makes class fun and he's laid back. He's very willing to help his students.,1
"I am horrible in math, explains why I started out in 0700, but Dr. Brown is such an amazing teacher. He is very sweet, helpful, and he will teach until you get an understanding. He let's you retake test if you are not happy with the grade and gives you extra time on test.",1
"David was a very fun Professor, made the class enjoyable. This is not a easy class, he will make you work for it. 5 Books to read, 2 Papers, 2 Quizzes and 2 Exams with multiple group discussions via smaller readings. He is a harsh grader, but will give amazing feedback on how to improve. Make the effort, easy to communicate with. Cares for students",1
"This class was an Easy A. Dr. Guerra was really good about extending deadlines and making assignments easier for the class. I didn't really learn too much honestly, the content could've been covered in 2 or 3 classes instead of the first semester. Very easy grader, I got A's on everything and she really understands the content. I would suggest her.",1
"Jane is by far the best professor I've ever had! She has an amazing personality, and she will have you cracking up the entire class. Her goal is to keep the class interesting and entertaining. She is a very easy grader. We had an open book exam. And the other exams we had, we got practice exams beforehand and the actual exam was near the same.",1
Best. Class. Ever.  Best. Prof. Ever. Seriously excellent teacher - he should teach everything and be President of U of T!,1
one of the finer professors,1
Good class to take for an elective if you want to work with children! Very caring for her students and you learn a lot in the class but it is fun!,1
"Dennis was an awesome teacher! He's a bit out there and didn't follow the syllabus too well, but the class was a lot of fun. Definitely worth taking his class!",1
"He was the best math teacher I've ever had throughout high school and college. To put it into better perspective, I took this course spring 2017 and failed with another teacher and retook it fall 2017 and got an A. He will do anything to help you understand or get a good grade. Even resubmit assignments. Very easy going, and a day-brightener",1
None of the upper level UB Math professors are going to hold your hand.  Dr. Sikora is a great guy and a decent professor.  Be sure to put effort in on the homework as it is a good part of your grade.  Tests are fair and you'll do well if you understand the homework,1
"Dr. Mike is a great professor at U of M. He actually cares about hoe well students understand the material. He is one of the only physics professors that takes the time to review before exams. Although the exams are pretty hard, Dr. Mike takes the time to go over any questions students have.",1
Lisa kicks ass!,1
"Attendance is mandatory, don't skip, they'll take off grade points.  The projects are really time consuming, make sure you get them done on time. Otherwise the class was really helpful, if you like filmmaking, you'll learn a lot.",1
"I had Miles as my instructor for Discover: Reel Life of Chicago Film.  He is one of the most easy-going people, with an incredible amount of knowledge on the world of Literature.  He's someone I would feel comfortable with going to if I had a problem that wasn't school related.  All around great human being.",1
Don't take her trust me you will regret it,0
"He was alright, class isn't too difficult if you put in the effort but he does drag it on and makes it feel boring at times. Overall, a decent GE",1
"Steve is the man! He is passionate about his area of study and is easy to reach out to. A good amount of Extra Credit is offered. Easy to talk to, we spent half an hour in his office going over the contents of Gatorade and my pre-workout!! Take this class!!",1
"I took his class which is MUS-104 in FALL 2018. He is the best teacher at Ohlone College. Clear in grading. He makes his class interesting. Super Easy A. A lot of extra credits. However, there were many assignments and quizzes in this class; as long as you do all the assignments, essays, and quizzes, then you would be fine (at least B).",1
Dr. Katner is an okay professor. She doesn't exactly know how to teach to kids in order for them to understand the material. She is very friendly and gives lots of extra credit and curves quizzes and exams. That is what helped my grade significantly.,1
"Laptop's are not allowed, must write power point slides. You have an online 4 exams of 100 questions and 4 quizzes of 20 questions. Notes are allowed but write everything as the quiz is still difficult. Group project and presentation at the end was hard, a lot of research and a lot of writing! Participate and do your work and you'll pass.",1
David was literally the best professor I have ever had! I always left his class feeling so encouraged and motivated! He not only equips you well for your career but also for life too as cheesy as that sounds.. haha He is so bomb and I literally can't say enough great things about him!,1
A really great teacher. He keeps homework and quizzes consistent and you can easily find answers in the book. He is very willing to give clear explanations to any questions asked. He also tries to break up the lectures with videos. Test questions are directly off of the quizzes. Definitely recommend.,1
"Ms. Carr is a wonderful CPR instructor and not only works with the students, but helps them with the test, and isn't difficult at all.  She's very friendly with a laid-back demeanor.  Serious, but not demanding.  Great teacher!",1
"He's a great professor! Favorites sociology teacher so far. Dissects the readings very clearly with the help of students' thoughts. Very inclusive and engaging. He has a personal story connected to pretty much about everything we talk about in class, so it makes things relatively easy to remember. Overall great!",1
This guy is awesome.. Hes very funny and is extremely knowledgeable and keeps class interesting.. I strongly recommend Betzag.. hes the man,1
Do not take this class if you aren't passionate about music. She is an inexperienced professor who does not structure the class well for those who aren't familiar with musical concepts. Discussions aren't helpful for the quizzes and she doesn't post lecture slides. A lot of the people in my class agreed this class is too difficult to be a GE class.,0
"Amazing class. In my experience at this school, this was one of those classes that I genuinely learned a lot from and never once dreaded. He states at the beginning of the course what he recommends you do to pass and if you follow his instructions, you are sure to pass with a B or higher. Very interesting course and a really awesome professor.",1
"Most interesting coding assignments I've seen and super generous late assignment policy. Understands students struggles and is no-BS while also understanding. An incredibly knowledgeable & friendly professor. Obviously, don't piss him off. He very available--he's in the class discord. Great guy to talk to. Course is 20% scheme, 5% prolog, 75% C/C++",1
Amazing teacher! I'm seriously trying to find a way to take more classes under him. He KNOWS what he is talking about and makes it interesting with stories that connect with the material. Tests come straight from powerpoints and he does not expect you to know dates. If you don't pass this class then you simply are not even trying at all.,1
"Dr. B is a very knowledgeable and respected person in his field. Do you have questions about something geology-related? He'll more than likely be able to give you a detailed and accurate answer. His tests are difficult but fair. He is more than happy to answer questions. The main thing is, don't slack. Take notes, ask questions, and study.",1
She teaches this online class as if it were a classroom class which is great. you have to log in at least 2 times a week--which keeps you focused. great experience,1
"TAKE HIS CLASS! He is so cool. He will make the class fun. Gives review questions based on the book chapters and the same exact ones are on the exams. Exams are super easy! He does make you do essays but make sure you follow his directions on them. Not hard, if anything they are super easy because provides enough information in class to write essay",1
"Loved Dr. Thomas! Of course anatomy was going to be difficult but you can tell she loves what she does, which makes it fun and interesting. Labs are a bit hard but if you study and really pay attention you'll do well. If you ever have a question about your own animal she loves to help you!",1
Taking him for fall semester at lbcc. Math 115 class which is a new class that is equivalent to math 130 ! And he is the worst math teacher  ever!!!!! He goes off subjeCT 85% of the time test are worrh50% of your grade! Study guides are a little helpful!  Not good at explaining problemsAT ALL its best to teach yourself or use mathlab  dont take him,0
One of the most intelligent teachers I've ever had,1
Dr. Ghosh is a really terrific teacher. She makes it easy to follow the course material online and has a easy to follow timeline for everything in the semester. She answers emails back quickly and usually with a good deal of explanation. She is very fair.,1
He is very patient and helpful.   He explains everything until you understand it.  I learned a lot in his class.,1
Dr. Bland is a great teacher. I took her class last  semester and she helped me a lot. She is  one of the best teachers that I ever had. If you are planning to take English 102 or ENG 203 I suggest you take her class. Her class is not hard. Ask questions about anything that you don't understand about her lectures or MWA's and she will help you.,1
"She is a great teacher and the course was not hard at all. All you have to do is do all the work, it's not hard just kind of time consuming but this is an easy A class. You will love her I promise.",1
Loved this professor. i changed my major to soc. after taking this class. all the information was very informative and interesting. uses PowerPoint. emails PowerPoint to you before exams. study guides are important to passing the tests. goes over every question on study guide days before exam. very sweet. one paper and one group presentation,1
"She is just Amazing overall, the class lectures are very interesting an you learn a lot base on her experience. 1 Mid-term (open book) and 1 final which was a paper.  she is super adorable I would definitely take her again.",1
"This class is awful.  Instructor is dumb.  She is so unorganized.  Notes that she post are horrible and you can't follow them during a lecture. I honestly can say that I have never had a worse instructor.  RUN, DON'T WALK AWAY FROM THIS CLASS.",0
"Professor Andrews is the best! He's insightful, and he's a professor that doesn't let his students just listen. Participation is key to great discussions in this class, so don't be afraid to speak up. One of the best English professors at Fullerton College, you would be a fool not to take him.",1
"The amount of work for the class is kinda excessive for a 1 credit, but that's not her fault. She took the time to give feedback on almost all the assignments (like: ""this is great"" or ""you should include that in...""). I wouldn't say she was a tough grader, but she did expect the work done in full which is reasonable. Easy A if you just do the work",1
I love professor walker!! I took intro to business with her and it was an easy A for sure but only if you do the work which takes about 10-15 minutes. She allows 2 pages of notes and tells you EXACTLY whats on the test. She takes the time to learn everyone's names and personal life which most professors don't do. TAKE THIS CLASS!,1
"He's young and a really nice guy, the amount of assignments are moderate but definitely not too hard of a work load and he gives great feedback on essays. i definitely recommend taking this class. i had him for EXP 101 not math.",1
"Definitely one of my favourite teachers I've had. He gives you many chances to turn in late work, but I wouldn't recommend waiting since it does add up quick. I also took the lab class so that probably helped me understand but he was able to make the information fun and interesting and he is just an overall nice person. I wish he taught more :)",1
"loved this professor! Took it as  core class, but ended up neing one of my favorite classes. Lectures are really interesting, but the  isnt an easy A, if you take good notes, come to close and study you will do fine.",1
"He's definitely a tough grader and does not specify at all if you mess up, you can be doing good and all of a sudden he starts giving poor grades and his feedback is nothing but initials of a chart he has. I wouldn't take his class due to the lack of professionalism and compassion as a Social Work professor.",0
Weekly homework & 3 exams. Takes long to reply to emails. Honestly was praying for a C and ended up getting a B because everyone else did bad too and I think he was a little more lenient after the COVID situation. I would recommend taking someone else if you can. He did end up letting me redo two homeworks at the end of the semester when I asked.,0
Davidovitch is an absolutely useless incomprehensible teacher with no ability to help his students with anything.  THe way he teaches is impossible to learn from without memorizing every single thing he says. But the thing is you can't understand a single thing he says or writes because of his horrible spelling and accent. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!,0
"I absolutely loved him. I never ever enjoyed writing but I actually enjoyed his class. Prof. Leonard is ridiculously creative and clearly very intelligent. He is super nice, well-spoken, helpful, and personable. He gives awesome feedback on essays and really makes you think about different ideas. Put in work and you can do well! Highly recommend!",1
"THIS DUDE IS THE BEST! Take all the classes you can with him!! He brings in the best guest speakers and truly inspires and motivates you!  His lectures are actually *get ready* FUN TO GO TO! He passes around an attendance sheet so you have to go, but he is funny and relatable in class! Tests are kinda hard, but he gives you exactly what to study!",1
"All you have to do is know how to read, follow simple instructions, hand in assignments ON TIME EVERY TIME, study the material and you will pass.",1
Assigning a massive group project for an online class full of adults who already work full time (which is likely why we are taking online classes) is absurd and infuriating.,0
"Mr. Baumgartner always explains concepts in a coherent and concise manner. Save your questions for after lectures, because you'll want to follow along with notes. Sometimes he'll even pass out notes so you can keep up. One of the best teachers I've had at Ivy Tech.",1
You need to go to class. You can guarantee that you'll learn a lot from her class. Her office hours are helpful. Definitely learned a lot from her.,1
"Personnellement, je l'ai trouvé fort intéressant. Il est fortement qualifié en comptabilité donc j'appréciais ses anecdotes. Le cours ne devrait pas être difficile si vous mettez les efforts nécessaires pour bien faire la simul. Je vous conseille de la faire seul et de comparer avec d'autres étudiants pour bien comprendre la matière du final.",1
"he can seem like he is kinda of jerk at first, but really a fair guy when it comes down to it. i missed 3 or 4 assignments just because i was lazy and he let me turn them in on the last day(even though he doesnt allow late work) and it raised my grade an entire letter. also extremely intellegent in his field.",1
This instructor is very vague in her assignments and will turn around and tell you you didnt read the assignment if you didnt do it to her standards. Everyone in the class gets confused and while she seems like a nice person she is not a great teacher.,0
"Ning can barely understand a word you say to him. If you're looking for clarification on anything your only recourse is to ask your classmates, or pray that he understand you on accident. On top of the language barrier his understanding of the course material doesn't seem that great either. I had him for Intro to Programming btw.",0
"One of the worst teachers i've had to deal with during my educational road. Seems unprepared during class, does not know how to lecture either. Constantly goes back on her examples saying forget this forget what i said this and you never get through anything. I suggest studying the material to understand it, because exams aren't math heavy at all.",0
" Prof Chii is definitely a modern professor ,she tries to make sure everybody is engaged. but be ready to work. I made a B in this class",1
"You need to be able to take jokes. It is not picking on you to be mean, his jokes are to make everyone feel a sense of comfort and does it with good intentions. Can talk a little too much but he's there for you whenever because he actually cares.",1
"Great instructor, very knowledgeable and cares about his students. Acts tough but is really a softy if you get to know him. The Law & Security program was challenging, have to put the work in and show up for class this is defiantly not one of those programs where you just show up and not bother doing the readings or studying and pass.",1
Logic 1 - Really nice & funny guy but class was awful. He isn't very good at teaching but he tries his best to explain things to you BUT ALWAYS digresses. No quizzes. Exams have no study guides or sheets. The book is ancient and the language makes it impossible to understand. Not an easy class so unless it's ur major don't take it.,1
Miller is not about info you could find online or pointless refinement. You feel as if you are making a new kind of knowledge It's heady. Miller starts where other St. John's English teachers can't imagine.,1
Great teacher! She is always willing to help when she is asked. Gives a clear idea of what she is looking for out of the class. Great at giving partial credit. Sometimes a little difficult to understand but you ask questions you will understand it. Would recommend her if your are willing to put in the effort and spend multiple hours on homework.,1
"She is very passionate and knowledgeable about all things mental health. As a content instructor, the lectures are long and boring and she WILL test you on the smallest of things from her powerpoint and assigned readings. As an clinical instructor, I respect her advice and experience with mental health patients.",1
Would not recommend ever taking a class with this prof! She is very unorganized and scatterbrained during lectures. When she does not use power points it is very difficult to follow along. Class is extremely boring and she is unable to answer questions from students. She also is very unclear when it comes to tests and assignments.,0
"Tough class, but if you are interested in pursuing higher mathematics then the rigorous exams and sometimes intimidating lectures are important. Everything is also pretty heavily curved so as long as you're keeping up with the rest of the class you're in good shape.",1
"This was a very enjoyable, laid-back class. I learned a lot, but disagreed with some of the reading (i.e. How Fascism Works) - I didn't read it all. We were required to do 20 hours of service learning & write a 5-page paper. We were allowed to take the final online (together). Overall great class. Participation is A LOT of your grade.",1
This dude called out multiple of us this semester for plagairism which is the one thing I have never done during my college career. I took this class for fun and I'm going to end up failing. He's a very tough grader. There's only four grades and the final is a ten page paper.,0
Lulejian comments on discussion posts were constructive and lead you in the right direction. Tests are essay question heavy so make sure you know the material. The online homework through McGraw Hill has great practice tests to help you succeed. Lulejian was also an easy grader who made himself available if extra help was needed.,1
"His a good professor really funny, pretty chill and will help you develop your projects,really good feedback and is there for you to ask questions. Cares about your work he wants to see improvement and thought, and will call out if people are slacking. Feels a little useless to come to class sometimes but overall, great teacher, funny, good class",1
"Had him for mineralogy. Great prof, learned a lot.  A little tough, but the good amount. Did I mention hot?  GAAAIIIIIIDES!!!!",1
"the worst ever. she makes the course so so so hard. also, she challenges the students. She feels satisfies if the student can't answer her quizzes or exams.",0
WGSS 100 with Shaw has been one of my favorite classes to date at Allegheny (I'm a science major). Seriously take it! Life changing. All the readings for the class were interesting and the class discussions were insightful. Even though it's an intro class you do have to put in the time and effort to get a good grade.,1
"Debra Curtis is the best professor I've had at Salve. She's passionate about what she's teaching and makes lectures funny and interesting. However you MUST read the book, tests are difficult and all from the book, not lectures. She does provide multiple extra credit opportunities. One essay that she grades relatively easy on. Take her if you can!",1
"David was interesting. I mean he was a good teacher for sure! But if you disagree with his liberal views, you may as well just drop the class. He makes you read a lot, there have only been 2 essays, no tests, no quizzes. I would take him again, heres my advice for an A in his class, fake it till you make it.",1
"Paul always makes class interesting. Uses real life examples to get his points across and does what he can to keep students engaged. Loved Paul, loved the class.",1
"Great class! It is very informative and there are no tests. While there is homework, the assignments are actually informative, useful, and have real world application. One of the best professors I have ever had! ",1
"Great Professor!...Can't go wrong with this guy...Imagine a clash between Mr.Rogers (neighborhood) and Barney Fife...LOL..Very clear and easy to understand, tells you just what you need to know...he has you write 2 short papers and one medium research paper...there are weekly quizzes and the midterm/final exams are 1/2 MC & 1/2 Short Answer",1
Do not take this professor. She is rude and gets frustrated when you ask questions. Lectures are very disorganized.,0
"Great professor. Lectures are easily understandable. Just expect to do lots of work. He worked at WD at the same time which was impressive, and has recently moved on towards Google. Good luck fam",1
"Dr. Guttmann is an amazing professor, hes tough but fair and is intensely passionate about economics and makes the sometimes dismal science truly fascinating He inspired me to pursue my masters in Econ.i learned more in a semester from this man than I did my entire 4 years at hof. Highly recommend, as tough as it may be you will learn a lot.",1
"There is considerable reading in the class but this is made known up front. A test after every three chapters. If you read the chapters and do the homework along with reading there is no reason you should not get an ""A"" in the class.  Discussion questions are also required but they are simply your opinons about subjects that the professor suggests.",1
"Mike is so nice and he really cares about his students! For the remote course, there are 4 mini projects and then a final group project that you work on throughout the quarter. Other than that, there are weekly reading quizzes! He is very accommodating in terms of due dates and even allows you to resubmit! An attainable 4.0 if you put in the work.",1
"This Professor is OK, but finding out when assignments are due, what needs to be done for them, and those details, are not able to be found online, or in his syllabus. I wouldn't recommend this class. It's really hard as a three hour, and most people spend the time on Facebook the class is so boring.",0
Great professor. Very helpful in class and during office hours. He was also willing to take our opinions into consideration if there's something overly difficult about the course.,1
She's amazing! Definitely understanding and extremely smart! She's definitely helped me as a student. Show up to her class it's fun! And no final (:,1
"Dr. Mathis is an amazing professor. I'm shocked to see negative reviews. If you listen and show up for class, you'll be fine. She's a tough grader but teaches you how to write papers better. I have nothing negative to say. She is sweet, intelligent, and will love you if you do your work.",1
He is an amazing human being. Be ready to have real conversations and talk about some hard topics. My favorite professor I have ever had. Not hard assignments and he really tries to build a relationship with you. Take him if you can!,1
Gives you many videos and lecture that do not help. She is okay with responding to emails. But does go the extra mile so pros and cons. The textbook is useless with the work given and would not take again.,0
"This class was super fun, I always had a good time reading the book and doing discussions. It was super easy, I had near 100% going into the final, and then the final got a MASSIVE curve from what I can tell. I would take this again.",1
"most difficult french class i have taken yet at delaware, but worth it..first time for sankara teaching this course, so a little rocky...but i learned a lot and he wasn't TOO hard of a grader...not an easy A though",1
"Very easy class. Most of the material is from Mechanics of Solids. Very little new material. Overall, exams are not bad. In class he just does examples from the book, but it's still worth it to go.",1
"TAKE DR. ROSS! Seriously, people put off enrolling in courses until they can have him as their professor. Pretty easy grader, but the material is hard. Do the work, work hard at it, you'll get an A. Likes to give take home tests, but mind you these are not at all easy. Absolutely willing to help during office hours, and pretty much anytime else.",1
Brooke is really invested in her students understanding a wide variety of music genres and how to play them on the guitar. She challenges each student on an individual level to help them work on things that are particularly challenging for them. Her expectations for the course are clear but her grading criteria is unclear.,1
Amazing amazing teacher. Must take to experience the best experience in school,1
very monotone but helpful and nice. in my opinion i would get the book and teach yourself because he will get boring but if you follow along in the book after or during class you'll be fine. He's test aren't as bad and he gives extra credit for each test and half take home and half in class. no need to buy calculator use the app taculator in class,1
"I took 4 years of spanish in high school, and his class is extremely easy. sometimes it is difficult to understand his accent, but he is very helpful with the material. prepares you for the exams very well(98% on midterm), grades more easily on tests the more you participate in class.",1
AWESOME TEACHER. Took her first aide class on tuesday nights and she is really awesome. You would have to seriously be special to not do really well in her course. It's common sense stuff but she makes it as interesting as possible! TAKE THIS TEACHER!,1
"The course  has discussion boards, exams, and a paper. There's alot of reading materials but as long as you read the topics that pertain to the specific questions on the exam , it isn't that hard. Each exam has roughly 7 questions that requires a writing response and you can go back to the exam numerous times and submit it by the deadline.",1
Easy but insightful,1
Nice guy but terrible teacher. Learned absolutely nothing from this class and after being a deans list student for 1 1/2 this man was the first to prevent me making it. Quizzes and test are nearly impossible and this class will hurt your GPA. You've been warned! Normally don't leave reviews but I don't want anyone to suffer.,0
"Looking back, i feel like the material for this class was way overcomplicated by Hines' teaching. He went way too fast and messed up more times than I could count while solving problems. I highly recommend going to Johnny Prints and picking up the slides used in class. Get ready to teach yourself this whole course.",0
"Very dismissive. Makes no effort to answer questions in detail. Very tough/unfair marking. Stubborn/unwilling to make accomodations to help students, even in difficult times like COVID. Uses same assignments each term, so no solutions are released and you can't know where you messed up. Interesting course, but she is not a good prof in my opinion.",0
"Possibly one of the most unprepared, detached teachers i have had to date, yet, in all of my years of school. He never emails you back, nor, does he care about you as a student. He seems totally burdened to teach, and it reflects in his students learning.",0
Well I must say Dr. Purser is a wonderful professor. At times the work can seem overwhelming because the assignments due dates are close together. But he is willing to negotiate to make his students feel more comfortable. He is very knowledge toward the subjects he teaches and he is also very funny as well. ,1
"this professor is not bad just doesnt answer ?s clearly and makes you feel stupid sometimes for asking even when she says do you have any ?s. also after emailing her my work to check for accuracy she still took points off. so ask her to check entire hw. if you read the book,do the hw and show up, easy A. ps: know how to use excel b4 taking class.",1
"There's a reason there aren't any positive reviews for this professor. Reads slides during the lecture which can be found online, going to class is completely pointless. midterm much harder than the quizzes and homework and he doesn't curve grades, so good luck.",0
"She never explains her project expectations, frequently uses profanity in class, and is heavy on favouritism. She grades difficult to make her classes seem more intense than they actually are. Surprised if she runs her 2 hour lecture for longer than 45 minutes. An easy way to get a good grade is to just go along with her jokes.",0
Li Liu is a solid teacher. Her presentations in class and her assignments helped me learn the content of the course well. You're definitely going to need to do some work outside of class but not an extreme amount. She's a solid teacher if you're looking to learn about communication,1
Be ready to learn and remain teachable!! This woman know her stuff and can spot a wanna be know it all a mile away. Do yourself a favor and try to remain humble in her class. She loves to help the struggles and will bend over backwards until you understand the material. Leave your phone off or in the car. Copy down ALL that she writes on the board!,1
"Not a great teacher, not much learning due to her reading straight from the power points (which were sometimes WRONG). Graded off four tests , lab and a case study. ,but only because most of the class failed. Talked too much about personal life and crocheting. was not patient with students and expressed it.",0
If you want to truly learn anything take professor Rohan! He is an amazing teacher and anyone who takes his class will see why. TAKE HIS CLASSES!,1
"One of the best professors to have ever taught. She is more than fair, and when you take her class you will learn, more than you thought you would ever learn.If you try you will not fail.I recommend her 100 times over.Dr. Polster rocks!!!",1
She has powerpoints to present everyday but every slide is a stock picture with a title. Class is VERY awkward and uncomfortable. She is also very one sided and liberal in her material and it is hard to discuss opposing viewpoints. Towards the end of the class she got very hostile and would rush through the class. Made me rethink my major.,0
"his bioethics class was great. interesting material, and if you're willing to participate great discussions. he is really enthusiastic, and you will get a lot out of his class if you put in a little effort. tough paper grader, but he's willing to provide as much help as you ask for.",1
"Very interesting class to fulfill elective requirements. Textbook is used and must be read to get full participation points and for the exams. 2 quizzes, 2 exams, and a final. Lectures are worth attending and cover topics for the exams/quizzes. A good amount of reading outside of class, but not unmanageable. Professor is wonderful and helpful",1
her complete and total lack of meme knowledge was completely inappropriate. i give 1.5/10,0
"It's clear that KMack is very knowledgable about ECON, but his ability to transfer that knowledge to students is nonexistant. Syllabus is outdated, and tbh useless bc he doesnt follow it. No one understood how much each exam was worth. No explanation was ever given. No grades were distributed. Went into the final not knowing where I stood.",0
"He is not a bad teacher but, he goes quickly and will sometimes poke at you in front of the class for asking questions frequently. To do well in the class be sure to read the book before lectures and take notes. You can google how to do the homework for help. My class had 10/11 tests because chem dept. was trying a new thing, not too bad.",1
Brother Dalton is a great teacher who really cares about his students. His dedication to the language makes it easier to learn and he explains concepts in a clear way. I highly recommend this class.,1
"Dr. Nelson was delightful. His blistering criticism was always specific and helpful, and he is one of the few Davidson profs who actually gives you useful advice for after you graduate. He has a rep for being mean, but he was always kind and truthful with me. And he remembered my name afterwards!",1
She is an amazing professor. I had her for Engl comp 2 and it's a research class she understands that research isn't the most interesting thing in the world and tries to make it fun. For most of the assignments pick something you're passionate about and the class won't be hard.,1
"It is pretty easy to get behind in this class, there is a lot of work. She is great help though, you just have to ask. The essays are difficult if you procrastinate but with effort they are quite manageable. If you are looking to learn and willing to try, then I highly suggest this class. It is challenging but nothing you can't handle.",1
He really cares about his students and how they do. Attendance and participation do count. Three test and you do need to study for them. He does give a study guide. He explains the material with real life stories. Also he does give extra credit!,1
"I took Schultz for a ""D"" semester. By the 6th week of a 8 week course, she has only graded one paper out of 5. Also, she has knocked one week off the course making it 7 weeks (The final was due on the 12/6 and now is due 11/30). All of this would be fine if she gave more feed back, since she does not though, knowing your grade is a guessing game.",0
"I enjoyed taking this class. The information I learned is invaluable, and the way Dr. Kelley supplied several realistic examples made the content a lot more interesting. Initially, I thought that it'd be extremely boring to learn about adult stuff; I thought it'd be high school health class all over again. But, she proved me wrong!",1
Thompson is hands down the best professor at USC. He is super kind/caring and makes it known that he wants his students to succeed. He turns a hard class into a very manageable one. I would advise anyone to take 322b off track just so they can take him. His tests are challenging so make sure to do the problem sets multiple times before each exam!,1
"Misurda is easily the worst computer science professor in the department. Lectures are monotonous, no online discussion board for help, and seems to not care about feedback regarding his course. I have a high B in this course and have had to do all studying outside of the lecture. Avoid all of his classes if possible",0
"He is a fantastic teacher. If I didn't understand something, he took the time and effort to re explain it.  I would like to have him teacher all of my accounting classes. ",1
"I absolutely love Prof Cutler. If you do take her class though, be ready to work for your grade. Attendance isn't mandatory but your grade will be MUCH higher than someone who skips if you go to all of the scheduled class sessions. She is very caring and I recommend having her as a professor. Highly recommend skimming lessons in book before class.",1
"Ms. Myers is the best math teacher I have ever had. She wants her students to succeed. She reviews for tests so there are no surprises. Just go to class and ask questions because she will make time for you if you need it. EC on tests helps, also she allows students to go back and improve their homework grades. She is the epitome of a good teacher.",1
"Yall, Mr Pierce is THE MAN. 12/10 would take him again. He genuinely cares for his students. Lectures are so much fun and his passion for the subject matter makes it easy to learn. His tests are easy to pass as long as you study a little for them. Offers a lot of extra credit throughout the semester. Super easy to pass this class.",1
"def. something is a little off here. although he is very smart, nice, and has great ideas..you will never tell because he gives you NO WORK.  he's a lot of fun to talk to though..and you watch some movies.",1
"Honestly one of the best profs I have ever had! Sandy C is a gem, there is no surprises in this course she is very clear about the marking and expectations plus the lectures are super interesting. 10/10 would recommend",1
"not as easy as hopper, but not bad. good at lectures, gives extra credit if you go to more than the required amount of classes",1
"Being in class, especially for labs, is really important. He is willing to help you if you need to the help but if you blow him off, you're out of luck. If you miss a lecture or two you may be okay but make sure that you study on your own. The tests come from the lectures and the study guide so definitely at least look at the guide. ",1
Great Professor loves what he does! Always excited to be in class. Does homework packets for each chapter. Exams are a bit tricky with language used but you know at the beginning of the semester when all Exams are but read the book attend class and do the homework and you'll be fine! I would take another class from him again! He cares.,1
"Such a good prof!! She is so helpful and really cares about how each student is doing. She is a pretty tough grader, so definitely pay close attention and take good notes from class. She offers a lot of out of help, so take advantage of her office hours. Never be afraid to ask for the extra help, she's super nice about it!",1
"Professor Wood encourages students to participate with respect to each other. During the semester we did a group, individual, and a short special occasion speech. In all of them she helps us with the process and the writing ideas to make a confident speech. Make sure you talk to the professor whenever you have issues, she is extremely helpful.",1
"the professor doesn't put much effort into her pedagogy and did not organize her class very well. the whole syllabus didn't make sense. she's not incredibly helpful and doesn't provide students with much evaluation. did not engage students but talked at us in long monologues and then expected a good discussion. overall, not a good teacher.",0
"Professor Baez is extremely nice and helpful. Despite lectures being a bit boring and long, he likes to explain the most as he can to get the point across. Homework is once a week on Saplinglearning, and there are 3 exams. There is also a group project where you are graded individually due wk10. Overall a great class and great prof!",1
"Jana can be tough, but is very fair and very passionate about teaching.  She is always there to help",1
"Such a great professor! Start on hw 2 and study for test 2 ahead of time, they were the most challenging. Get to know him, he's super knowledgeable and friendly! Study the ppts and practice questions (not too long) to study for the exams! It's a more memory based class than anything but I didn't feel overwhelemed often!",1
"Ashley is amazing! She is incredibly smart, though often overly academic/verbose in her lectures that she has to clarify. Participate and do your best to answer her questions. Talk to her and treat her with respect, and she can work with you on extensions in emergencies and treat you with respect in turn. Funny, genuine, helpful, engaging!",1
One of the few lecturers that cares about students and will take time to explain. Clearly loves his subjects and has passion,1
"My OPINION of Grachev as a teacher: The second-worst professor I've ever had. Not accessible at all. His grading policy is easy, but unfair. Nobody puts much effort into his class, but only approx. 1/3 of the class gets an A. If you get an A, you lucked out..if you get a B, too bad. If you get a C, you probably put forth absolutely no effort.",0
"Lee was one of the greatest professors I've ever had. His lectures were always interesting and he was one of the most kind, caring, and optimistic people I've ever met. He genuinely cared about all of his students and he made sure we always knew that he had hope for us and that we were going to save the world. It was an easy A, but I learned a lot.",1
"He goes over the material in lecture pretty well. His test was pretty much from the lecture, but the last question was worth 40 points and combined almost all the concepts he taught. He's kinda boring, but pay attention and make sure you know the homework. That should at least get you a 70 on the test. Intro to BME is curved so much it's funny.",1
I loved Prof. Kroll. He is the best econ teacher by far for AREC202. He is able to explain difficult topics really well and wants to make sure that everyone is doing ok. He is a hilarious man and his lectures are engaging. You can tell that he loves what he does. I totally recommend taking him. The only downside to the class is the clickers.,1
I took this online class apart of my minor. As long as you are on top of your work and at least put some effort you'll do fine. Overall he is a solid choice.,1
"One of the best professors I have had a MSU. As long as you show up and take notes you will do fine. He gives credit on the tests for just labeling graphs. I didn't study much, but on the two tests I got an A. There's two tests, a final, around 6 quizzes, but drops the lowest, and weekly homework. I expected this class to be more difficult.",1
"MUS121 is a well designed class that DID get me appreciating classical music. Not backbreaking work. You dont need musical knowledge prior to course, as youll learn here. Professor McGee makes work interesting, material is engaging, and the text is cheap. Read text, and pay attention, and its not too hard. Id happily take one of her courses again.",1
"Professor Nelson was nothing special. She was nice and helpful, but not interested in her students outside of class. I took the 6-week summer course so lectures were 3+ hours at a time. Every lecture was extremely painful because there were no breaks offered and she was extremely monotone. The work was easy and expectations are clearly laid out.",1
"Things aren't always clear when students do the readings, but Prof. Duina does such an amazing job clearing everything up and talking about theorists. LOVE DUINA, take a course with him. And he's sexy.",1
"Talks too much, expects students to learn all of the export/import regulations.  Tests are in the form of essay, there's a small presentation, surveys & a business plan to complete in his class.",0
Impossible grader. There are many other professors that you can take EDFD200 with so just get out while you can. You'll regret staying in her class.,1
I had Dr. Bland at USC and i learned more from her class than all my other english classes combined. She a tougher grader and gives more work than most ENGL 102 but if you actually want to learn how to write a good argument and be more confident in your writing I would highly recommend her class.,1
"Phil. of Religion. Interesting class. Prof. Shartin was out about once a week this semester, I don't know if that's normal for him. Reading was minimal, papers were hard for some students, but he allowed rewriting. Super nice guy, really wants you to learn something in the course. I'd take him again in a heartbeat.",1
I love coming to this class. Honestly one of my favorite classes and professors so far at John Jay. She gives great feedback and is there for you when you need help. She's lenient and cares much about her students,1
"Second time taking Natalie, she's awesome. She's good natured, engaging, and knowledgable. This class consists of a lot of group discussion(you turn in questions), film and guest lecture responses(only 3 q's) that you turn in online, a term paper, a multiple choice midterm, and final includes short answer. I considered all of the work pretty easy.",1
"Dr. Zeng's class was a very difficult subject but she helped us understand the materials with homework, team class exercises, and quizzes. The students knew exactly what to study or exams. She is passionate about economics and is very accessible outside class. I would definitely recommend taking a class with her.",1
"TAKE HER CLASS! and more importantly, GO to her class. It will change your life, and as long as you're showing up with an open mind it won't be hard to get an A.",1
Awesome prof and person. His exams are always really fair and you know what to expect. He always brings in examples from his industry experience and it really helps relate engineering to the real word.,1
"I'm sure she is good at what she does in-person, but as for her online class, it's a disaster. I have no idea how to navigate the blackboard page for her class and even the syllabus doesn't match what she actually wants us to do. Just a lot of miscommunication and disorganization.",0
"Professor Mahallati provided practical material that most students are able to use in a variety of other courses/fields. Her course outline and curriculum was clear and user friendly, and she took time to explain the concepts. Enjoyed the course and learned a lot from it.",1
"Professor Flores is an activist, intellectual, mental health clinician, and a very pro-student professor-- unlike most at Davis.  I regret not having taken her courses earlier.  On a side note, Yvette, Sergio, and Angie are the best people in the Chicana/o Studies Dept.  Very inspiring individuals.",1
"I personally  liked his class! He uses the book a lot and you read about a bunch of different countries and cultures. His quizzes are over grammar, and I thought he did a good job at explaining grammar rules. He is a tough grader and his test are pretty hard. But an A is possible, it just depends on how much you want to work!",1
"Did not enjoy class, talks about theory and derives equations rather than doing an example.  Tests are on applied problems, not theoretical.",0
"Marshall is a wonderful instructor. Accommodating, sweet, and caring. I missed half of my classes and still got an 'A' because all of her tests are open-book and open-laptop/phone. You don't need the textbook at all and she almost always lets class out early if you have her for a 3-hour. ",1
"DO NOT take a class with her online. The course is extremely disorganized and she doesn't ever put grades up, so you won't know how you're doing. Also, she never answers e-mails. Although you'll end up getting a good grade if you do the work, you'll feel as if you learned nothing.",0
"Terrible. All she does is go over the extensive reading in lecture, she's pretentious and the class is useless, no application to anything.",0
Lectures twice a week that were recordings. quiz once a week. I miss the majority of them because there was no actual class. She gave a poll todo class via recordings or zoom (videos won) if It were via zoom would have done better in the class. If you can do videos online for lectures this class is an easy a but for me don't know yet.,1
"Horrible professor. I wouldn't recommend her to anyone. She grades very hard on essay, and her intructions are confusing.This class was a waste of money.",0
"Honestly one of the best biology professors, despite the comments below. She is truly concerned about her students and wants them to do well in her class. Tests are straightforward if you attend class. Lectures are generally entertaining and pretty clear.",1
"If you think logically and have a good math/proof based background, Dr. Buhler's explanations will make a lot of sense. Otherwise, you may have trouble understanding him. However, he is helpful if you have questions, and is willing to listen to student feedback.",1
Such an awesome and passionate professor.,1
"Professor White responds to my emails with questions with ""no problem."" and my inquiries as to why I got a grade and how I can do better with, ""keep doing the work and maybe that will help."" Don't expect her to communicate with you, she also sends these replies 5 days to a week later. Exams require lockdown browser. Some coursework on quizlet.",0
I have taken his math classes three times now and I learn the material so well from him. His courses are difficult and although attendance isn't mandatory you have to go to class to do well and for random in class quizzes. He is great at explaining concepts and only teaches you what you need to know for exams which is helpful as well.,1
"ENT 3114 ""New Venture Lab"" is all about a semester-long product-prototype & business-plan development group-project assignment. It is almost impossible to get an A. You will need really reliable group members. Standard group sizes are 6 to 8 people; split between 2/3 business students and 1/3 engineering students. It is very stressful. Good luck!",1
"Trista is a great professor, who has a ton of experience/ knowledge in the field that is shown through her teaching. She truly cares about her students and helping them succeed. I promise the students that left bad reviews are the ones that don't care/pay attention. All you have to do is pay attention in class and you'll learn a lot. Thank Trista!",1
"Disgustingly horrible professor that knows the class struggles. Didn't teach me a single thing about calculus; learned everything from self textbook use. You WILL struggle on exams which in theory ""reflect what you learn"", but will be so un-ordinary from class and webassign, that you'll spend alot of times in exams figuring out whats going on.",0
"This class sucked. Never would I recommend taking her, she gives a lot of assignments and test. She expects a lot out of you. We did 2 chapters a week, plus discussion plus a test. She is not very helpful at all. I would never take her!!!!!!! Plus she takes forever to turn in grades.",0
"Judy is a great online professor, requires quite a bit of work out of you but is very thorough. She is also very accessible as well as flexible with student schedules. Overall great online class.",1
"I have been out of school for 23 years, so I was feeling scared . Prof Barkley is amazing. He is very knowledgeable, well prepared, and passionate for teaching. He gets out of his way to make sure that EVERY student understand and pass his class. He has prepared power point, test reviews, recording, and exercises for the student.",1
Most unorganized prof i have ever seen. Makes it very hard to follow notes. does not prepare you for midterm/final at all. Labs dont make sense and not even the GAs know what theyre doing,0
"Due to the pandemic and making no accommodations in teaching style or tests, this is the worst class I have ever taken at Missouri State. I would definitely recommend other professors for this class that were more accommodating and understanding due to the pandemic.",0
I love her!!! Best psychology teacher everrr. She made me switch my major to pshycology because you learn so much about people and its interesting. Easy A! Just do well on exams. I took her for two diff psy class. Plus she gaves extra credit!,1
"I'm sure she's a great person, but man is she a terrible prof. Lectures unclear and hard to follow, going to class was, in my opinion, a waste of time that could've been spent elsewhere. Lecture recordings, although just as hard to follow, are easier to learn/ take notes from.",0
"Amazing and caring professor. She makes sure that every single student understands the lesson; she leaves no one behind. Explains the material in a way that's understandable, and even though math isn't my cup of tea, she made the lesson enjoyable. 5 stars",1
Her course was like taking a course with your mom as a teacher.,1
"Long boring lectures. Spends forever copying his slides onto the white boards without adding any useful information and makes lots of mistakes. Poor explanations, contradicts himself, takes marks off for stupid things like writing a number as a fraction instead of a decimal. Wouldnt let the TA's give us hard copies of the tutorial solutions. Worst",0
"The lectures are a waste of time. I went to every single one and I don't know jack about what's going on. This is an intro class and all he does is use upper level terms that make no sense to me. I like him, he seems like a cool dude, but his ability to teach needs work. On the upside, there's very few tests.",0
I cannot believe this teacher. She has the audacity to tell me that I cannot make up a test because I didn't have a doctor note for my scheduled C section surgery.I told her this in advance and I didn't get a message back until I delivered my child. She then said that she does not give make up under any circumstances. I feel attacked by this woman,0
"Overall: Very poor lecture, requires time to teach yourself. Lecture: Verbally teaches math, lacks organization, a lot of side talk. Homework: will assign problems that he didnt lecture on (uses textbook). Tests: Mostly basic problems, do the study guide. He is nice, kind, and funny. If you already know math and dont need any help, take him.",0
I enjoyed him!  He really gets you interested and thinking about topics.  Writing is hard in general so the class is not going to be easy! He tells you what needs to be improved.  I definately learned a lot from him and my last paper was perfect which was awesome!,1
She's an awesome professor.  If you'd like to learn Spanish...then this is the class you should take.  She's a lot of fun and she's great at what she does.,1
"I learned way more in this class than I ever did in high school. Class can be tough, but you get what you put in. I was never lost because she gives so many examples and answers emails immediately. Super organized. Good class.",1
"I would recommend his American Govt class if you're only taking the class because it's required. I have no interest in history, but I know the basics. This class was fairly easy, and he gives you cheat sheets for all the homework. Tests are mainly over PPTs and what he lectures about in class. No quizzes.",1
"Everything is confusing for me (can't speak for everyone else). Even when I'd get help, it just always seems like she doesn't really want to help because ""we should know this already"". Math used to be my favorite subject and now, I hate it.",0
"Clearcut lectures that do not feel long and drawn out.  covers material solidly and with humor.  Final was twice as hard as the midterm, so you really need to do the HW and know your stuff.  There's quite a bit of memorization of material.",1
"A great teacher...One will succeed like I did if you come to every class, do all assigned work and turn it in on time, and take note and study.  :)",1
"This guy is the man.  He's a police chief and you can tell. Loves telling personal stories, makes u always interested, makes you understand and learn. No book needed, good grader- take this class.",1
"Hard to understand at times, my main problem was the lack of grading.",0
"Dr. Kiesewetter is very organized, and gives good examples for students to study with. The only issue with her is that she WILL NOT scale. I took Chem 101 with her, and she would not scale anyone. She is very good with office hours, she's very nice and has great powerpoints, I would recommend her but get ready to work.",1
"her lectures are clear but her test are hard, spend lots of time looking over your notes not the book ",1
"I took this class online, and it is a big unorganized, the class schedule was out of whack. As I was preparing for a particular chapter the class schedule stated would be that week, it ended up being a completely different chapter. He took almost 2 weeks to grade discussion boards. And your grades are based on the test and the DB postings.",0
"This isn't an easy class, but he is definitely walks you through everything step-by-step. He listens to your feedback, and may adjust the class based on the needs of his students. Very approachable and kind when leaving comments. Prompt in grading. Great semester, great professor!",1
Grade is solely based on exams and pop quizzes. He will dock your grade after three absences from the class. Tons of reading but the exams and pop quizzes aren't too difficult as long as you do the readings and pay attention during class. Exams get easier through the semester as you go.,1
She is an OK professor. She is way too uptight about attendance. She does not allow one to leave early without it going on record because she is afraid one of the staff members will ask why the student is not in class. She makes the class seem really fun on the first day but then gets very dull once everyone is settled in. ,1
"Prof. Allen is a cool guy, answers any questions, knows what he's talking about.  He does move a little fast at times, it helps if you have a background in Excel, Powerpoint, etc.  Overall, nice guy, helpful professor.  Take this class.",1
"Get the Skooler's packet and you'll be golden. Skoolers is harder than what is on the actual exam so once you get to the exam you are more than prepared. There is a cheat sheet 3x5 flashcard for the 3 exams. Homework assignment due every Sunday and at the end of the semester gives extra credit. Cool guy, and Jon from skoolers is the BEST.",1
"Assignments are extremely easy because he practically gives you the answers. The later assignments get a little harder, but they are all doable. His lectures are extremely boring though and all of the notes are on the website. I didn't do as well on the tests because of not getting the material in class.  I hear he curves generously though.",1
"Lots of reading, but that is generally true of all Econ 101 classes. Overall great professor!",1
"He is NOT a hard professor. Every test comes directly from the notes. If you look over your notes at least once, you are going to get an A. He also is more than willing to repeat himself or further explain a slide if it is unclear to you. I highly recommend him.",1
"Great professor, his lectures are content heavy but in no way are they boring. I missed a couple of classes and he was more than happy to help and very understanding about making up work you might have missed. He gives an extension for one writing assignment on a monograph of your choice! 10/10 would take again!",1
"Sam is an absolutely brilliant guy.    He's amazing.  One day, I had a question about the LT(BL) of bats, as I was wondering if the acoustic disturbances made by bats could be transduced into language, and we got to talk about bats for like six-and-a-half minutes.    He also knows the head honchos like Chomsky.  Chomsky is my man.",1
"Steven Stovall is hands down my favorite college professor I've ever had. Not only are his classes not mandatory, but as long as you read your textbook occasionally and participate in your group projects you will do just fine. I would 10/10 recommend Stovall.",1
"I had Tucker of 101, 102, and Brit Lit. She's an average teacher. Kinda mean but just go to class and pay attention. Her tests are kinda hard. She's very liberal. Kinda boring sometimes.",1
Worst professor I've ever had. Sits in front of the class and reads of a packet. Does not teach anything. Seton Hall is better of paying me to do a better job,0
Dr. Wang is a very particular grader and knows what she wants.  She responds immediately with email questions and is definitely there if you need help.  Lectures go very quickly and you can't miss one or you would fall behind.  Pick good group mates because that's your whole grade. I worked really hard but did learn a lot.,1
"Had Dr. Grimminger for Chem 1 . He explains things fairly well but somethings can be confusing at times. Kind of awkward and doesn't seem to handle large groups well. He is very approachable and not awkward at all talking to him 1 on 1. Tests are tough but if you do the hw and come to class, you will get atleast a B on the exams. Overall good guy",1
"Professor Dowdings class taught me SO MUCH. That being said, I had to work extremely hard throughout the semester. There is an assignment every week, but, if you want to learn how to write, this is the class to take. He is a tough grader, but it is only because he wants us all to learn how to succeed in communication.",1
sensei if your reading this i miss you soooooo much. i've never had anyone so determined to get me to learn. you made it fun and interesting and awesome,1
"Dr. Richards is scary at first but once you get to know her, you will love her. She is super high energy and knows everything there is to know about books. She has a good sense of humor and is always willing to help you if you ask her. She is strict about things like grammar but overall a great professor.",1
"She's nice but lots of notes that aren't always relevant. Ask questions and you'll succeed, just show up and you won't.",1
"Very good teacher, knows his stuff. He gives you study questions and guides to work on and pulls the tests from these questions. Study what he gives you and you can make an A. He wants his students to succeed and learn what he's teaching.  Very helpful in class and in the lab.",1
"This professor tries to make sure that you understand the material. However, the homework is harder than it is on the quizzes and he gives either 2 or 1 chances on the homework. As long as you don't skip class too much and you really focus on the lectures and you know the material from calculus I really well, this class is not too bad.",1
"Faux was a super laid back teacher, only classes that you really need to show up to is the review days. He offers extra credit and holds review sessions outside of classes too if needed.",1
"An amazing person, I dont know of any professor who cares about their students as much as Walker. With that being said, if you are looking to be prepared for a major in Business, I would not take her. It was an extremely easy A but I cant tell you I learned that much about business.",1
Brent has only been here a semester and is legendary among my group of friends. He is soft spoken and just has a certain way of saying things that makes him interesting and fun.  He has experience in the industry and seems like a cool dude.  I had him in an easy class but I would expect him to be a great professor in a more rigorous course as well.,1
I LOVEEEE HER. She loves her students & wants the best for you. Just be prepared for her questions & know the material (it's okay to ask questions). You won't regret taking her. Talk to her if you need anything she will more than happily offer her help.,1
"Harvey is amazing. It is a difficult class but she explains things great. Make sure you practice whatever she tells you to and you'll be fine. For exams, she lets you look at the past 4 semesters and tells you problems to focus on, and her exams are similar. Lecture is not mandatory but you get a grade for workshop (which is practice). Take her!!",1
"Show and you still will not receive full points for attendance, not explanation for random grading, either on papers or attendance.",1
"Prof. Smith is one of the best professors at this university. He genuinely cares about teaching and he loves his job. His classes are not for the faint hearted, so if youre looking to go to law school or grad school, his class is perfect. He isnt unfair about his grading but is specific and makes you think. The 104 series is amazing with him.",1
"Kubota-sensei is a fantastic teacher! This was my second time having her as a professor for Japanese. She really makes learning Japanese fun! There's a lot of homework, but it's all very helpful! The final project was a five minute presentation on the prefecture of your choice. It was really great!",1
"took him for eating rights, easiest class at rutgers. there are weekly short assignments that are 1-2 pages double spaced, a easy poster assignment, and a final 5-7 page paper double spaced. everything is graded very easy. the ta's basically give 90s and 100s on everything. only downside is you have to go to class for clicker points",1
Do not do it...Reconsider...Read All the literature on this site and share the information with other students. This class will ruin any semester. I would take a summer class before ever taking one of her classes. Seriously!!!,0
Great professor but tough grader. Expects a lot and is willing to help you get there.,1
Although Dr. Brown is somewhat boring his class was easy because he made sure we understood the lessons. I never made under an A on his material this semester. ,1
Dreaded his class. Just teaches the textbook during lectures with minimal effort to make it the least bit interesting. Exams are a joke and unnecessarily hard. I was looking forward to learning about marketing but he made it hard to appreciate. Good luck if you have him for 300!,0
"Ms. Smith is so nice! Her lab practicals are difficult because she doesn't give you a word bank, and you have to memorize several complicated body parts, many of which sound Latin. But other than that, it's an easy course. Go to class, she gives you points every time you go!",1
"She is one of the best instructor, very helpful.",1
"A very special teacher and guy. As millions already know, he is the best prof at Rutgers because he will make it his mission that you succeed. All other Chem teachers are surly chuds. Dr. T is a mench. Other teachers are egomaniacs, Dr. T has a vox populi. Other teachers are dour, Dr. T will bust you up like the 3 stooges. Go to class and laugh",1
"Mrs. Jimmerson is one of the easier teachers I had this quarter. You don't read any novels-just write papers. If anyone thinks she's hard it's because they're lazy and don't pay attention in class. Do what she says, and she'll like you.",1
He is the best.  He rocks.  I could honestly listen to him talk for hours.  I wish all profs were like him.,1
"I had Dr. Braun for Critical Reading/Writing & AYA Lit, which were both great classes. However, do not expect an A if you do not work for it. I am a straight A student & have only gotten an A- in both classes. Nothing is ever perfect in her eyes. Although, she will email you a hundred times to prepare you for presentations or papers! Very helpful!",1
"First day of class then dropped out. Discussion heavy, heavy reading, expect to write  3-4 pages of reflection papers. BEWARE",0
She made english accessible and fun. The readings are insightful and she keeps lectures interesting. Loved her,1
Dowell is very knowlegable and passionate about this course. Readings from the textbook are mandatory and questions from the reading homework appear on the tests. The class is pretty straightforward.,1
"Gave the final exam. Was challenging, but then I have learnt more in this course than any other at University of Winnipeg!!",1
"Great teacher with a lot of knowledge, at first I was afraid of not passing his class, but he helped me a lot, after so many years I decided to come back to school and finish my degree and Mr. Luckett was a great inspiration person to me, very dedicated to his job in helping us gain knowledge in the social work field. Great professor!",1
He is amazing. He does really care. I seen him stay after class for over an hour helping students. As long as you are not lazy you will be fine.,1
"An extremely difficult professor for my particular section. This class will not receive any free pts, and he sticks to his schedule. You must attend his classes, you must read the material, and most importantly take notes.  He welcomes opinions, and be sure you come to class with a discussion from the work which was assigned.",1
"He is a very nice professor and he CARES about us. He will answer your question patiently. Once I was ill and could not go to class, he gave me a can of tea!!! I still can't forget!!! I love him TAKE HIS COURSE!!!",1
He was a really great professor for the whole semester. Classes during the pandemic are hard but he was always available and answering emails almost right away. Does not give a lot of work to do but to pass you have to make sure to turn in assignments ON TIME and just be aware of everything he posts. Overall easy A and an interesting class.,1
"I love Dr. Curzon. She is so kind and caring and easy to work with (as long as you are not taking advantage of her). The class is pretty difficult, it requires a lot of reading and quizzes everyday, but she offers extra credit and drops low grades. As long as you study and pay attention, you should be fine.",1
One of the best professors I have had at bmcc. He makes learning interesting. He is very helpful with every student. A quiz every Monday which is way better than one difficult test every few weeks. He cares about his students. He expects the lab to be respected. I highly recommend him.,1
"This teacher is unlike any other you'll ever meet at CSCC.  We all know that Columbus State is famous for their crap teachers and in the toilet retention rates but Melissa is one of a kind.  Knowledgeable, fun, dedicated, kind, caring, helpful, interesting, hilarious, sensible, and understanding.  You will miss her sorely when you move on.",1
"BEST TEACHER EVER!!! This was my first workout class that I have taken in college,so going into the course I was very nervous.So I'm so glad I took her course because she makes you feel comfortable working out and encourages you to reach the goal you set for yourself in the course. Best teacher ever!!!",1
Prof Malekan was a gem. I took her for ELM 112 Fingerspelling class and she helped me succeed. She teaches formal ASL which I love but is challenging.  Attendance and participation are important. Work hard and do well. Recommended for anyone interested in pursuing ASL seriously or even professionally. Take her!,1
"She is a very nice professor and helps you with what you need, but this class is basic memorization. If you review the terms everyday, then you should be fine. She gives a lot of partial credit.",1
Was a great teacher. Had a great semester.,1
"The teacher in my opinion was a little hard to understand. This course was mostly about literature and research based which I struggled with. I put my all into all my papers and got C's in all of them even though i put everything in it that he required. He is big into ""Big"" word which I'm not the greatest at. There is no make up work!",1
"His class was easily the most informative class I took while at UM. Lots of required reading, and lectures while not mandatory are incredibly dense and need a ton of notes or you wont pass. My one big turn off is he seemed to be more proud of who he knew, and had dinner with than the actual subject itself.",0
"He's easily the best professor i've had at UT, he's so nice and caring, always willing to help. He honestly made me enjoy stats a lot. 100% recommend. there's just one homework each week, random group activities, and three exams. not too much!",1
"He teaches in Avery unique way, make sure to be attentive. Classes are fun and entertaining rather than being boring and dull lectures.  Easy course. Very conceptual, no memorization. Useful.",1
"He wants you to write to his level of knowledge and understanding. Write what he's looking for and you'll do fine. Need to show up to class and have everything ready for the day. Expect 3 papers and 2 presentations and 1 quiz. Looks strict but is pretty chill once you get comfortable with him. Very mild accent too, easy to understand.",1
Grate Teacher!!!,1
"Dr. Z has a thick accent which originally was very difficult to understand. After about two weeks of lecture, I began to understand her more clearly. She writes everything she is saying on the slides and is very knowledgable about anatomy and physiology. Overall, she is very sweet and very approachable and tries to make this hard class bearable.",1
"very unorganized course. the only hope you have is the final that tests your true understanding. The quizzes, even if you know all the material you cant do well. This is because the professor thinks because it is open book it needs to be more difficult. That too, with an extremely limited time limit per quiz. One of the worst classes I have taken.",0
When i emailed her my questions about course material i never received an email back.. and she went on rambling about side stories a lot.,0
"For those who rated him low, they are just lazy! It's college, you will need to put effort to get a good grade. No teacher will hand it to you. He is a fantastic professor, and knows his material well. Take him if you're serious and not lazy. 10% extra credit if you do them all! I recommend him!",1
"Very good professor. Knows what he is talking about and lets everyone of his students know what is expected of them at the beginning of the semester. All you have to do is go to class, seeing as 210 points are available for attendance and 200 are available for exams. Very good class, lots of fun.",1
Get ready to read. The information we learned about was interesting but it was a lot of work. There is one paper and one quiz every week. Its a lot of work for an online class but it was interesting.,1
"Christina is a great professor. Be very sure to do the homework right as you get them as they are long and sometimes hard. But if you pay attention, take notes, you will do fine in the class.",1
"Prof. Pilar was a 5/5 until the last week of class, which was a mess. Review questions were posted the night before the final, and our final contained concepts that HW never covered. Our while class thought that late homework had a -5% penalty (as it says on the website), but he pointed out the day before our final that the syllabus said -30%.",1
This instructor was the best instructor I have had at NWACC hands down! She was very prompt about grading our discussion posts and gave great feedback! She was very engaged with us as students and with the material. Too bad you can't clone her.,1
"Bruh, dark souls but no bonfires. Doesn't try to change the direction of the class to help the students but rather just to get on and get paid. Try to avoid at all cost.",0
You must show up tp every class or points will be taken off. He gives a lot of work and is very strict about having things done a specific way. He also wants you to memorize the entire syllabus and talks the whole class.,0
BEST PROFESSOR OF ALL TIME,1
"ART course 121, 122, 221, and signed up for 222. Doug Domine is an excellent teacher; willing to work with people, great with critique when you ask, will push your skills, and generally has fairly fun and amusing class atmospheres. He's definitely a teacher you don't have to worry about approaching for any questions or concerns. Highly recommended.",1
"He used a graduate level text for an undergrad course.  Highlight of the course: ""This is a very important theorem that we will use a lot"" followed by, ""I am not sure it's true"" when after about 10 minutes he couldn't prove it.  I think he used that course as a vehicle to get paid to review group theory for himself.",0
Excellent teacher.  Very understanding of each student's personal needs.  She will also work with you until you understand it all.  Take as many classes as you can with her!!!,1
"Mr. Person is a very nice and respected gentleman. He was a police officer for many years as well as a dispatcher. He is now a security officer at Enloe Hospital in Chico. He does not lecture on the stuff that will be on test, but when he does it is brief. He will go through the book and tell you each word you need to know for the test. Easy A!",1
"Professor Goldman was pretty dull and her class seemed to go on forever. She was relatively easy, but does not offer extra credit anymore, besides on the tests. You have to read four books, which are not worth your time, but you have to write papers over them. Overall I would've rather taken a more interesting class, but it was an easy A.",1
So much homework for only 1 credit. I mean really. This class is a waste of time but unfortunately needed to go to a university. So yeah hated it.,0
No Comments,1
"worst teacher i have ever experienced in my student life, very tough grader. He runs the autocode to run your program, so if you miss anything in the program you end up with 0 grade, thats  how he grades. no sympathy at all ... but unfortunately there is only one professor who teaches cs320 at csula. I dont recommend him at all...",0
Take her class before she realizes she's way too good for Reynolds and leaves. Love her. Wish she would teach every level English class so I never had to take another professor's class. A true gem.,1
Really cares about her students and wants you to do well.,1
"Funny man.  His voice booms from the mic. unexpectingly, and loves to teach.  Didn't really feel the need to go to lecture.  Fell asleep a lot, but when i was awake he was fairly interesting.  Not a bad class to learn about some sick tribes that do sick things in other parts of the world.  Seriously, take it, and find out.",1
There are no classes only discussions if a student can help host a zoom for him. There is no syllabus and it's stressful because there is no structure. He is a very sweet guy and tries his best to teach during these trying times but I don't recommend him for online classes. The only two things he's grading is a midterm and a final that's it.,0
He's is very understanding if you can't make class for a valid reason. He is very nice and super helpful! Very easy to approach and ask questions and if you don't have certain supplies he is always there to help you out with extra stuff.,1
"According to my understanding he said is his first time teaching at BMCC. He looks like would like to help you, and he really know the subject but unfortunately he need more experience in how to teach. So lets give him a chance to make improvement. He do not use slide show, that could help him to teach.",1
"Besemer seems cool at first, but she's actually just rude and should not be a professor whatsover. She also showed up about 15 minutes late to every class.",0
First class with him and I'm already regretting my decision to take him. Should have read these reviews. 3 hour class and I barely understood what he said in those 3 hours. He just reads off the slides and his accent is unbearable. I would avoid. Sucks that he is the only professor teaching INFO 2315 this semester. Listen to these reviews y'all!,0
"Mrs. Myers is an OUTSTANDING instructor! She is so helpful and will take the time to explain formulas to you, in whatever method works best for you. Very kind, down to earth and only gives you assignments to help, not busy work. I would take one of her classes again!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",1
"Love, love, love Pam! You'll learn so many valuable things and she's so easy to connect with. She really cares about her students! Homework is extremely heavy and a lot of work, but grading isn't too bad.",1
"Dr. Hansen is such an effective teacher. He requires you to read the textbook outside of class. But his lectures makes everything you read about come together and make sense. He's very caring, and you can tell he's passionate. He made soils, a class that probably would have otherwise bored me, interesting. By the end of the semester I actually care",1
You will learn nothing in the BIA-686,0
Dr. Kennedy is a very good teacher.,1
"Good teacher, but if you want to ask questions ask them before, during, or after class not over e-mail. He knows his stuff for the most part, and he uses the text book quite a lot. If you have questions and you don't want to ask they should be answered in the text book and fairly easily found.",1
"LOVED HIM.  His class was one of the hardest I ever took, but he was hillarious and really helpful.  He always reassured.  I would definitely take him again.",1
"Professor Westover is one of the best instructors I've ever had! He gives great and immediate feedback. Is respectful, willing to work with you and very knowledgeable. Weekly assignments. As long as you read all of the information, you will do great. All open book, open notes. Gives ample time to complete research paper! Would take him again!",1
Would not recommend taking his class; boring jokes about his prior jobs and his exams are pretty tricky. Make sure to do your homework cause his quizes are mostly from it(also note that he promises you 10 and at the end you only have 7 or less) and also don't expect him to give you any extra help/credit if you need it. Stay away from his class!!!!,0
"Worst professor/class experience I have had at UCSC thus far. Unnecessarily mean and an absolute B. Horrendous experience, wouldn't recommend her to anyone. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASSES. Takes her frustrations out on her students and not one person I've talked to who has had her had anything good to say. Pretty much a 100%  ""hated it"" consensus.",0
"Dr. Richards is very intelligent but extremely rude. Do not bother answering a question in class unless you know it is 100% correct, or she will embarrass and belittle you in front of the class.",1
You definitely need your lab book. Make sure your always on time for class!!!,1
"This class and her coursework is a complete joke. Assigns redundant papers and essays on corny poetry. Does not let you pick your own material to write about. Picks annoying due dates out of thin air. It's an online class, but you may have something due on a tuesday, wednesday, etc. Gives a boatload of easy work, which is annoying. Spare yourself.",0
"If you strive for good grades, make sure to do homework and write your papers carefully. The instructions he gives for each paper are directional, in which you have to dig in a little bit to work on, which he demands a lot in class. Be prepared to read a lot.",1
"Keeps interest! The every day schedule is about 45 minute lecture and the rest is what ever video you're watching that day accompanied with a 5 question sheet about the video.    He truely knows AND CARES about his stuff, so he rarely uses the book. And listen because he repeats test material. PLENTY of extra credit and time to turn in your work.",1
"B Shaw is a fantastic professor! She teaches you how to think and discuss important social issues. She has taught me how to be a better person and citizen. She assigns a lot of reading, but it is always interesting. There are lots of class discussions so make sure you read! ",1
"He is an amazing and inspirational teacher. His mythology class opened a lot of great discussions, he shed light on commonalities I had not noticed, and did not reflect any bit of bias towards or against any mythology. Best professor I've had at Nassau.",1
financial economics. dont do it.,0
Dr.Kosnik's class is so fun! He obviously loves music and everything about his class. The tests are easy if you study. You will often use the textbook. I wish Dr.Kosnik taught Business classes because I really miss him now.,1
"I've taken other classes with Chris before and he's there if you ever need him, but be prepared to be thrown into the fire and to do work and learn a lot!",1
Mr. Burt is the worst professor that I have ever taken. His tests are hard but would be doable if he actually taught in class. He gets half the example problems wrong during lecture then when students ask questions he tries to dodge them by answering something he actually knows how to do. Lab is bad because he does not know how to set up the lab.,0
"Awesome Prof. had issues submitting an assignment, and she didn't doc points for it being late. Very helpful in deciding on topic for research paper. She kept the discussion board alive with insightful questions. Would take other classes with her in a heart beat.",1
No Comments,1
"Great professor. I learned a lot in her class, and am looking forward to having her in another tax class for my masters in taxation. If I could have her for all the tax classes for this program, I would.",1
"Excellent professor, one of the best.  Very caring and committed to her students.  Extremely intelligent and well read.",1
Horrible. She is hard to understand and her grading is ridiculous. She has no sympathy and does not care if your not doing good. Barely gives any practice problems. Grades after the curve were still in the 50-60% range. Avoid at all cost.,0
Amazing teacher. Quizzes almost every week for each chapter read but drops the 3 lowest. Very young and good teacher,1
Love Dr. Starner. Knowledgeable and excellent with students and was my advisor during my college career.  Love ya Dr. Starner!!!!,1
"Very educated teacher who expects his students to be on the same wavelength. That being said i learned a lot about the preternatural, so many other fields of science, and even some Latin. Pay attention, do the hw and don't skip.",1
"Dr. Bailey is hands down the best professor in the CBE department at CSU. He is compassionate, brilliant, and funny. Makes you think really hard about stuff, but is always there to help you clear things up and help you excel! I've had him for 2 courses now and he is consistent in all aspects regardless of the level of the course. Great professor.",1
"The assignments were quizzes/exams (mult. choice) & short written assignments. The quizzes/exams came from an online textbook from connectforeducation. Though it was a late-start class, the workload was very manageable. Nothing's proctored, so take notes before quizzes/exams. Not much interacting w/ classmates/professor, so self-motivation is key.",1
Graded attendance but passing means do the online work. Lots of quizzes and discussions about course material but will comment interesting feedback. Going to class is good because he is knowledgeable and shows off some really cool stuff. He has a bit of a speech impediment sometimes and cuts people off but for the sake of time management. Easy A,1
"If you like comparative lit, you'll love Avital.. She's inspiring, but she tends to talk in circles and goes off on tangents a lot. She doesn't allow computers in her lectures, though, so be warned.",1
Do not take for Easy A. I've learned more about this subject than any other class taken. This is due to the amount of practice required to grasp the subject. The 'attitude' referenced before is more than likely due to students assuming they'll receive an easy A. This would frustrate me as well. I recommend this class to anyone seeking a challenge.,1
Worst professor in the world!!!! Do not take her or you will fail!,0
"Would not recommend this instructor. Very unorganized, it takes him forever to return exams. He seems too busy with outside life",0
"Dr. Juncaj is amazing! Everything she teaches you in class is on the exams. She also provides some review packets which are exactly what is on the test. She helps you understand something if you dont get it and her homework is nothing too crazy, its usually lightwork and helps when studying.",1
I love this teacher she helped me out alot.,1
I love her. Shes so open to everyone and shes funny. I took a late night class with her and she made everything so simple. No test given. Just watch videos in class and some group activities. This class made me open my eyes more.,1
This was an easy class before I got to this guy...He made everything difficult and made tons of mistakes which made me have to follow up all the time just to make sure that I got the grade I deserved....I was doing my job as a student and his by constantly having to correct everything...Forget it...,0
I love her dank memes giving her the BEST educational knoledges for me btw i go to SDSU,1
Shes cool and caring i give her an A,1
I have always struggled and hated math. Kevin Clark was amazing about explaining everything we learned. He was also good about giving real world problems. I would definitely recommend taking him. I've never got an A in a college math class or understood the material so well and I did in his class.,1
Great teacher! defiantly take him. Had 3 twelve page papers worth 33% of your grade. Lets you out an hour early each class. Also hilarious and keeps the lectures interesting. Textbook is not needed.,1
"She uses the ALEKS system, which means that you take an assessment in the beginning and then only have to study the material you don't ""test out of"". There's homework every week, but it's super manageable. Only the midterm and final are proctored, which is also a plus! (this class is also Pass/Fail, so you just need over 70%)",1
"Gail is an absolutely wonderful teacher. She's straightforward, authentic, and very knowledgeable. She doesn't let you slide but she will do everything she can to help you succeed and understand the purpose behind assignments. She personally checks in on all of her students in a way that lets you know she's invested personally and professionally.",1
"I have already taken Dr. Nevil for 2 courses and taking a third one next semester and absolutely love her. I have always had the hardest time in English, but she helped me so much and i actually understood when she taught. She has a great sense of humor and is always willing to help you. I HIGHLY recommend her!",1
"Professor Boyles is very kind and can be easily contacted. It's a relatively easy A. No busy work, the assignments have a purpose, and there aren't many of them. Everyday in- class discussions that aren't graded, only to use to your benefit for when you write your papers. It was a fun class to have and not stress about, just do your work.",1
Study guides are useless as tests are very different from the guides themselves. The fact that you fail if you get below a 60% in the class even though you have a good enough grade is just odd.,0
Professor Flannery is one of the best professors I've had so far. He gives great examples in class that make it so easy to understand. He's a great guy.,1
"Do not waste your time or money with this guy. He doesn't care about student needs. Doesn't adjust to feedback from previous reviews, also the overall class is 100 level at best. I highly recommend literally any other professor for COMM220. You will not learn any new information in this class, nor will you be challenged intellectually.",0
"Mrs Dixon-Brown was a great professor! I took her online Organizational Politics class. Her online lectures were clear, concise, and helpful. I also thought the topics were interesting and applicable to the working world. She gives clear instructions on what she is looking for and expects. With that said, you get the grade you work for so.",1
Worst class ever!!!,0
"Extremely helpful, kind, generous, sees that his students understand the concept. Hands out free lunches! One of the best proffs at Mac and definitely the most memorable.",1
"This man knows his stuff.  If your really interested in photography and want to make it a career i highly recomend you take his class!  Smart man,  knows a lot about everything. His assignments are hard but thats the only way you'll learn. He can be rude and somewhat mean but thats just how he is. (He doesn't mean to be).",1
No Comments,1
He is a great Prof. Just take his class and you will get an easy A.,1
"She has been one of the best professors I've ever had.  I would highly recommend her.  If you go to class, study her study guides, and do your assignments you will get an A in the class.  You have to write 3 papers and do 1 group project, all are easy and won't take up much of your time.  Take her if you can!",1
PLEASE TAKE THIS TEACHER FOR LECTURE!! Her review sheets are exactly like the actually test and lets you know what is exactly on the test. Straight forward & explains everything to simple terms.,1
Her class was hilarious but she did not curve at all on the final grade although she promised that she would.,1
Professor Knott was an amazing source of knowledge. Her ability to provide constructive criticism enabled a lot of growth as a writer. Professor Knott teaches many tools that will prove useful in later courses!,1
"If you don't take Stevenson for lab you're a fool. While the class itself is hard and there is a lot of material, she is extremely understanding and her exams are so straightforward and easy to study for. You are told exactly what you need to know, so the tests are easy but you are still learning. 10/10 favorite professor at quinnipiac",1
"Dr. Hill is pretty dry, but so is beginning nutrition. She is clear about what will be on tests. The honors section is busywork, but not actually hard. Don't study for tests, test avg of 97.5%. Takes herself a bit too seriously, but not at anyone's detriment. Willing to fix her grading mistakes, help students who are struggling. Nice enough.",1
"Homework is an easy A bc you can find quizlets for them. The exams were harder than expected but if you study hard, you'll be fine. Her exam reviews really helped. Second lab exam was a little harder than the first but still okay. The lab quizzes and unknown project were easy and make sure to do her study guides because they help. No textbook use.",1
Final is 40% of grade 3 exams-drops lowest Exams are heavily focused on textbook Required to write a paper that none of the other PS100 classes are asked to do She posts the powerpoints on blackboard but they don't help if you don't go to lecture Tompson is very knowledgeable but her class is a lot of work for an intro to psych class,1
"She puts PowerPoints online to be printed before class. Does a lot of example problems, could explain material better, spends most of class on practice problems. Tests are pretty hard, although she givens lots of study materials. In some cases this is still not enough. Overall not a bad class but it can be hard to stay attentive in lectures.",1
Explanations are not clear. Powerpoints suck. really hard to pay attention through boring lectures. Cheat sheets are not helpful. Test questions are worded tricky,1
Awesome professor! Helped me actually understand the concepts of cal 1 and I'm now taking him for cal 2,1
He makes class fun. ,1
"Professor Kuhlman is very nice and listens to the students. His lectures are horrible. He just reads off a script or textbook. If you don't understand he will clarify for you but, what are we paying for?Funny teacher but not worth the money. There's no challenge in the class, if you need an easy A then its your class.",0
I took his online lecture class and while is was a difficult class he is very organized and maps the entire semester out for you. As long as you keep up on the reading and video lectures the rest of the class will make sense. He is a very fair grader and is responsive when asking questions or for help. I would recommend.,1
Take him for calc 1. He gives you all year to turn in homework and his study guides are almost exactly like his tests. Very helpful. I definitely recommend him.,1
"For those students who said she's easy, it might be compare to another male professor who's teaching this course. She's a tough grader I have ever seen, her assignments were confusing as hell. she took lots of points off if you had little mistakes. btw you won't learn a thing from her class. If you can't skip her class, good luck and have fun.",0
"Her class was not very interesting, but she makes you practice your french with some small projects. She assigns small assignments. Her tests are pretty easy.",1
"This is graduate class to expect to keep up on reading, participate in discussions and write a few long papers. She is a wealth of knowledge and more than willing to help. Super organized and returns assignments promptly and with quality comments.",1
"Shawn Richards? Favorite teacher at Humber College. He cares about his students and them succeeding not in life; if he saw that I wasn't 100% myself, he would speak to me during the break and get me back in high spirits. He challenges you! If you don't PAY ATTENTION, you won't pass, it's as simple as that. Work for your grades!",1
"Class lectures aren't that interesting. Lots and lots of reading for every single class period. Only one large paper to write, but smaller writing assignments throughout the semester and in class writing.",1
Mrs. Lytle made public speaking fun. Her power-points and lectures are super informative and she will answer any questions and truly care about your feedback in discussions.,1
"Easy class. minimal homework and easy midterm and final that he gives you the answers to. He does not teach very good, just reads power points and shows boring old videos, but a good class to take to fulfill a requirement. Easy A.",1
"Rachick is one of my favorite instructors I've had.  He is very laid back and seems to enjoy teaching.  Participation is a must if you want to learn the language and even then, Russian is known as one of the more difficult languages for an English native speaker to learn for a reason.    Be ready to put forth some effort.  NOT a blow off class.",1
"The only way to not pass this class is if you don't do the work. The lectures are laid out and she goes through them thoroughly with opportunity for questions. She responds promptly to emails and gives feedback. There are group projects involved, but again just do the work. She is very helpful.",1
"Marlowe's class was such a pain because the lectures were so boring, but she is an good professor and fairly easy. If you pay attention and do all your work, you'll get an A. Never cancels class. Probably would not take again",1
"I loved this class. It was my only 8 am and I loved going. He makes his lectures and his lab funny. He expects you to know a lot, but he is always willing to help.",1
He is pretty straight forward professor online. Class was pretty easy but make sure you study for the mid-term and final as they are most of the points for the class. Would recommend him to other classmates.,1
"Very poor lecturer. Makes many mistakes and tries to do problems ""his way"" which ends up confusing students even more since his explanations are never adequate. Too bad there is only ever 1 section for the classes he teaches so theres no way in getting around him. Learn from the textbook or youtube and do ample example problems for each section.",0
"Very nice professor, but there was some stuff that he wasn't knowledgeable about regarding the class he was teaching. I guess it's cause it was his first time teaching CIS100. The class was an easy A, I feel like I didn't learn much. Gives a test on Word, Excel, Access, and a PowerPoint project.",1
"Rachael is a fantastic teacher-take any of her classes if you're passionate about public relations, she is by far the best. Very motivating and helpful.",1
"Great teacher! Take her if you can! Gives study guides that are super helpful, also recommend reading the textbook! Super nice, quite funny, and really loves animals. Highly recommend!!!! :)",1
"I am thoroughly impressed with how Dr. Kelley laid out course materials in Blackboard. Everything is easily accessible, organized to limit confusion for students. I WISH that every professor would lay out their classes this way.",1
"I hadn't taken Spanish since high school, and going into this class my junior year of college was intimidating. Marks made it easy though. He is a great teacher. Enthusiastic and willing to help. Regarding a previous comment, he said that we should drop the class as in take a lower level to develop our understanding. I would recommend Marks any day",1
"Clearly a very intelligent and capable professor, but he expects a lot. 6 week summer course and there were 3 novels and textbook reading, plus 4 discussion assignments, lots of audio lectures, an essay, reading quiz, and 2 writing heavy tests. Really brutal for a lower division course. If you work a lot, this is even more of a struggle.",1
DO NOT TAKE EZELL. May be the worst professor I have ever had. Is extremely rude and gives a ton of pop quizzes. He is extremely specific on his grading and gets really mad if you ask him a question. He makes the easy information way more difficult than it needs to be. If you have the ability to take another prof. DO IT. NEVER TAKE A CLASS W/ HIM.,0
"4 short message drafts 1 research paper 1,500 -2000words group project revising a brochure 2 in class presentation one with group and one with the research report on a Fortune 500 company",1
"Dr. Batman is honestly the G.O.A.T. of the physics department. His lectures aren't magical, but the side comments and things he does makes the class enjoyable and funny. The class is pretty easy if you put some effort in. There are quizzes almost every week or an exam, but he basically tells you what's on them and is super helpful with reviews.",1
"He's a G. First day of class he played the Pixies, I've never met anybody with a more impressive name than Ignacio Infante, his accent is infinitely dope,  he's just a funny and laid back guy. And he definitely knows his shtuff. Essays aren't too bad, I liked the books but you didn't have to read carefully at all if you pay attention in class",1
McGee is the best professor you can take at VISTA for any type of biology course. She is the most caring person and truly wants you to succeed. Yes of course her class can be difficult but what science course isn't???? You want an A? you must work it. By far the best professor i've had.,1
"First art class taken at Oneonta and she was great. Open to all ideas, I've never heard her tell anyone their ideas/projects were bad. Even if you're not good at art she helps improve your basic skills. Class focused a lot on compositions and basic art elements. Some work outside of class if you didn't finish a project but no real hw.",1
"Loved this class because he kept me engaged with his stories and the topics discussed. He also brought guest speakers, who are his journalism partners from all over South Florida media, talking about their experiences of journalism ethics. Granted, there were quizzes every week based on book readings but as he said, ""Nobody really fails at FAU"" ;)",1
"Great Prof, he is very passionate about what he teaches and is always there to help after class and in the labs!",1
"GREAT! She is really easy and flexible. She accepts late assignments. One research paper, one group presentation and response paper every week. Take her. I  would say it's an easy A.",1
"Ever watch ""Scrubs?"", channel ""Dr. Cox."" Professor Brown thinks he is hilarious with his dripping sarcasm. I had rather watch TV for my entertainment and be taught for my tuition payment. His same flippant approach in his attempts to teach is what leaves students with no understanding of chemistry and their disdain for him. RUN AWAY, if assigned.",0
She is Amazing. Very encouraging and helpful. I wish I could have her for my next math class.,1
"She is an excellent teacher!! I haven't taken math classes in years and I came in very insecure about my math skills. She completely restored my confidence in math and about life in general. If you want a do over in math and want to really understand and enjoy the material, Professor Bronie is the professor to take! I wish I could take her again.",1
Definitely going to choose Prof. Looney's class again! Interesting class and easy A. You can bring notes to exams so you don't need to remember a lot. Lots of bonus points available and the observatory sessions are awesome!,1
I took this class over summer semester and had a really good experience. Prof Spears always replied in a timely manner and has every assignment and due date set up at the beginning of the semester so there are no surprises. She lets you turn things in late too if you give her a heads up which was really helpful! I would take another class w her!,1
"He seems to be a good guy and he is passionate about the topic but he jumps around so much in lectures and gets so off-topic that it's basically impossible to take good notes. His tests are really hard and encompass things he didn't really go over in class, so you have to read the textbook.",0
"I took him for AP I, Bio 425. He explains things clearly; knows his stuff; gives extra credit if you ask nicely. BEWARE, he doesn't like to review for tests, but again will do so if class asks. He's an acquired taste, he has no time for bs. He wants his students to do well, is available before class. I'd take him again.",1
"To put it simply, broke my love for painting.",0
"I really like Ms. Fox she's tough, & you will have to work for an A. She is really precise about the format of the papers you turn in which I always found to be a good thing. She gives lots of extra credit opportunities & tells you exactly what to fix on your paper to make it better. I would highly recommend her to anyone willing to work hard!",1
"Not a bad professor.  Like the rater before said, it's just hard sitting through 2 1/2 hours of lecture at night.  Basically an easy A if you go to class and do the papers.  He is full of a lot of information though.  He knows his stuff and has a lot of real life experiences.",1
By far the one of the best professors out there. You will leave wishing you could take more classes with her. Really strives to help her students to succeed. Helps you out with difficult concepts that are hard to grasp.,1
He is your worst nightmare come alive in flesh and blood... enough said.,1
"Fox is no joke. She played welcome to the jungle and what the fox says on the first day of class. It was very fitting. The class is hard but I walked out grammar nazi. I ended up taking her the following semester for Eng102 and it was worth it. If you want to becomes a better writer and ace papers in other classes, she's who you need!",1
"He does partial notes, so attendance is necessary. Textbook reading, however, is not. Great professor, who obviously cares a lot about tourism and the students.",1
worst teacher ever. went to see her for help in office and did not help what so ever. gave me the lowest grades on papers when i worked for hours on them. book readings mandatory. talks to much of herself and does not clarify well. do not recommend.,0
Easy class. Unexpected quizzes and test are the exact same as quizzes. He gets really into the topics even though you may not find it interesting. Nice and funny dude.,1
"He only provides instructions - step 1, 2 , and 3, but not walking you through the example which make it harder for students to understand the concept.  The test have only 20 questiuons, and each one is 5%. AND He does not curve!",1
his class was ok. I like the fact that Dr. Thompson is fair. I took his class during Covid-19 so both the class and the lab was online. On a quiz we had to name the bones of the cranium and for a particular section it was very difficult to label without being shown in person. He understood this and graded the quiz accordingly with a curve.,1
"Gives boring lectures that dont really help. If you know Fourier you should be ok. Test 1 - OK, test 2 - BRUTAL, Final - ok. Exams are pretty bad. No one actually does well but the curve is insane",1
"This is by far one of the best professors i have had, you can honestly tell that his heart is in the right place; which is helping the student understand and enjoy the class.  .  I can honestly say that i have learned alot from him, thats more that wi can say about the rest of the professors!",1
"Explains everything clearly. If homework is completed, the tests will be easy. Overall a great teacher that wants her students to succeed",1
"Guttmann is a great economics professor that has been teaching for 42 years. He is caring of his students and gives online assignments weekly. Midterm, final, discussion board, and participation are grades. Makes you work for it but teaches a lot and I would definitely take him again. Take this professor because it makes you appreciate economics.",1
"Jose Morcillo is one of the best professors I have ever had in my last 4 years of university. He makes sure everyone participates, answers questions, and gives some of the easiest and useful tests ever. If you want an actual professor to treat you like a human, take him.",1
"He is a very monotoned speaking guy. He  talks constantly about the same thing without telling you what it means, or if its important. He will tell you you are wrong very rudely if you attempt to raise your hand to answer, yet gets mad at the class for not raising their hand and answering. He is very biased on the way he teaches. Don't take him!",0
"You will NOT get what you earn...grading is 100% subjective, and the class participation was NOT participation based... it was off the wall projects with WAY too little time to complete them....do'nt piss her off or you will get a bad grade...",0
Freedman is great! He is interesting and passionate about what he teaches. Supportive of students and fair with grades,1
"Professor Wheeler makes lecture enjoyable and interesting. I believe the class is way too hard for a 100 level so if you are looking for an easy GenEd, this isn't the one for you. A ton of reading outside of class. Befriend your TA for sure.",0
"Lanning is SO great. He's such a good lecturer. If you don't go to class (and I mean every class), your grade will suffer. There is a LOT of content to memorize AND understand. Flashcards are helpful, but if you can't connect concepts, you're screwed. His tests are thorough, but gives detailed study guides. He wants you to do well.  Take his class!",1
"I thought professor Weber was a good teacher, but I really understand Algebra and enjoy it. A lot of my classmates had trouble in his class because of how he explained things. I do think he could do a little better explaining to people who are not as good at math. But, he will help you if you ask and he loves questions!",1
"worst prof ever, she was not willing to help students and didn't teach anything",0
"If you're taking this class to fill a core, think again. Provost is a geniunely nice guy, now that we got that out of the way. Multiple questions assigned every class (Marked very hard), a 10 page paper (9 sources needed), and get ready to be serenaded by his voice considering all he does is lecture all class #yawn. This class is reading heavy!!!!!",0
"Great Professor, Wants to see you succeed and improve. The class was easy and helpful. It is an easy A as long as you try to learn how to play piano a bit.",1
She taught me in FRSL 102. She was really considerate. She went over the quizzes and can8. Expect lots of homework and time dedication to the course. Amazing professor tho!,1
She's great. Made class very interesting and there was high class participation. Did convert final exam into paper.,1
If you have the availability to take this class online I highly recommend it. This class was one of the most frustrating classes I have ever taken. The professors dosen't count attendance as a grade but takes points off if you aren't there. He has a really snappy attitude and expects you to lead the lecture along with him. Worst class ever.,0
He was an excellent professor and gave away lots of extra credit.,1
Mr. Trower is a great teacher. I am awful with math but he gives tons of extra credit. The tests are hard but the extra credit makes up for it. I passed with a B.,1
Very good teacher with a clear method. He makes you participate and his classes are light.,1
"All of her questions to her tests and assignments are taken from online, which is something I wish I knew when I took her class. The homework assignments are very short and weekly; the content is fairly tough, but she tries her best to help you understand. The book was cheap. Overall a great, easy professor for a tough class.",1
"Dr. Mike is the best professors I have ever had here at the University of Michigan. I had never really encountered physics before, so I was terrified going into this class. He made it a class that I was able to get an excellent grade in. He goes above and beyond for his students. Dr. Mike is amazing. ",1
She tries to be caring and upfront but her teaching style is not the best. I've learned more from google and youtube videos than from her own lecture videos/discussions. She may make students feel as if they are not trying hard enough even when they may be putting all their time and effort into her class. Quizzes/exams for lab are never returned.,0
"Nice guy , average teacher , always makes time outside of class to help students.",1
Dr. Thomas was an amazing professor. After the first two weeks of her class I knew I'd needed extra help. She offers tutors to anyone who asks. She gave me two and with out them I would have failed the class. She gives real life situations and case studies she did.,1
"Dr. Mike has clear lectures and is very humorous. He is always ready to help in the Physics Help Room. He can get frustrated if you don't understand the material right away, but overall he is a good teacher. EXAMS ARE HARD.",1
"Today in class this professor threatened a student who was talking out of turn: ""if you keep talking, the next thing you'll get is the clop!"" She did this twice. If you want a teacher who threatens violence to her students, by all means take her class. You should also know that her teaching methods are ancient, outdated, and often ill advised.",0
"Dr. Pipiras is an outstanding professor. Lectures include many examples, which is helpful. Lots of homework but they are very helpful in understanding the material. He is entertaining and the exams are easy. Probability is difficult but Dr. Pipiras does all he can to make it not so bad. Strongly recommend.",1
Wonderful Professor! She gives out all her contact information so she is super accessible and will respond even on nights and weekends. She has no patience for laziness but if you put one step forward she would walk a mile for you.,1
Wonderfully dedicated instructor with high level of understanding and awesome ability to connect with students!  Extremely patient and willing to repeat instruction when asked.  Had her for several semesters and never once saw her become impatient.  One of the best math instructors who is an excellent example for student teachers.,1
"Nice guy, but GOD does he grade hard. If it was in person I would collapse from the work load. It's worth it because I learned the material. Like learned learned. Online is super flexible, doesn't mandate attendance. If you do the homework on pace, use it for the weekly quizzes, & use the textbook, you'll get an A. He drops 3 lowest.",1
"Took this class online. In the beginning of the semester, she made us do a discussion post every day for her class. I missed one, and my grade dropped from 98 to 87. The discussion posts are worth 10 points, but it weighs a lot because she doesn't give many assignments... at all. The semester ends next week and she hasn't graded anything else yet.",1
Great professor. You should come to classes because all the material is covered in class.,1
"Very energetic, knows her stuff, extremely helpful, and nice.",1
"If you want an instructor that will communicate with you, don't take her classes. I e-mailed her a few times and never heard back from her. In the online class there are group discussions once a week. Even when you meet her criteria for acceptable participation, she still deducts points. Tried to ask what I did wrong. No response.",0
"Jamie is one of the worst professors I have ever had. She is hopelessly repetitive, completely uninformative, and vague with expectations. She is also incredibly rude and condescending. Her grading is based on whether or not she ""feels"" you are trying hard, not your actual work. The is no actual dog handling in the course.",0
"In order to do the assignments, you need to first buy the text book. I didn't buy the text book in the beginning so I wasn't able to do any assignment and received bunch of 0s. This class is a self teach class because all of the stuff we learn is just reading text book. I don't understand why I pay all this money to just learn from the text book.",0
"Dr. Jimmerson is a fantastic teacher.  She generates interest in English.  She grades hard, though.  Her tests can be pretty difficult as well. She provides Bonus opportunities to make up for any bad grades.  I recommend her, but expect to work for your grade.",1
She is amazing! Not many student know about her but I highly recommend her as a chem teacher. She is the type of teacher who would lets you use notes on quizzes but not exams. lectures can get kinda boring but try and pay attention because the examples do help you out on the quiz. She is funny. She makes things so easy for you to understand.,1
"Great instructor! Her class is lighthearted and you can tell that she cares. This class is quite a bit of work, but it's mostly assignments that are required from any UNIV class.",1
No Tests. 3 Papers 2 Presentations. If you get it done your getting an A. He is a very inspiring teacher and would def. take a class with him n. ,1
"Just Had my first class. I didn't listen anything she was saying cause she is insanely pretty. She also has a cute accent. Or maybe, I found her accent cute b/c she is pretty.",1
"She does a great job of breaking down complex ideas into simple terms. Test material comes from the in class notes, so it's a good idea to go to class. Her exams aren't hard, but there is a lot of critical thinking, so make sure you know the material. She cares about her students, she is an amazing prof.",1
"Professor Pangallozzi was an awesome teacher. She is extremely knowledgeable and great at her delivery. The COVID pandemic forced the class online, so things felt a little rocky to start, but she had it pretty well figured out in a few weeks. Quizzes and tests were all online and open book, so as long as you keep up with the reading it an easy A.",1
"Really nice professor. Took an online 3 hour course, never went past 1.5 hours. Easy A if you just participate in class discussions, he wants to interact. Show up, speak a few times, A. No textbook. I would take this class again. But he also takes long to respond to emails so fyi.",1
"Mr. Andrews gives 3 essays and 1 research paper total 4 essays. he also gives 2 in class essays. you would also do journals, but very easy journals. he makes English fun, but you need to participate in class. you will read articles that are relevant in society, which is very interesting! sometimes i think he should just be a sociology teacher.",1
"This class is supposed to be an introduction to linear algebra, but Falk teaches it like a graduate course.  His schedule was far different, and much harder than other sections of this class.  Tests were only partially related to homework problems, and often required a huge leap in understanding from what was covered in lecture.",0
"Your grade is all subjective. Teacher does not give grades on assignments so you have no idea how you are doing other than his verbal comments and test scores. You are required to have a DSLR camera (expensive) for the class and it does not meet your art requirement. No text book is used, tests are based on his lectures. Class is not recommended.",1
"Very inconsistent, he LACKS a lot of communication with his students, does not respond neither emails or calls. He will not mark you in you are even ten minutes late. Heavy accent, if your a good listener you will do fine he literally reads off the power point, and often rushes through everything. He's very knows his stuff but lack teaching skills",0
"WORST TEACHER I EVER HAD!! so much work! Every day you had to do 5 pages of textbook homework, we had bimonthly quizzes, a midterm and a final. MANDATORY NOT FOR EXTRA HELP, we had hebrew table in which u had to go once a month for ur grade!! she graded ur participation on how much english/hebrew u spoke that day and she doesnt round up ur grades.",0
"Midterm, Final, 2 papers. Meyers herself is great, don't get Forbes for your TA, his paper grading method from paper 1 to paper 2 is not clear. Go to lecture, you can probably skim the reading, very historically heavy though, so take notes on that. You won't pass if you don't go to lecture. Easy enough. Not a huge amount of reading for an ENG class",1
Absolutely inspiration. Made me love philosophy. He's very engaging in class and in office hours.,1
"He was a great teacher. Although he was somewhat hard to understand, he was always ready to answer questions and he had a great sense of humor about himself. Highly recommended.",1
Fantastic instructor and extremely accessible outside of class. The class is great and division of points is all very logical and fair.,1
Dr. Konen is amusing and does not give out much homework. Always tries to keep class interesting with jokes. The powerpoint slides can get boring if the earth and science isnt your thing. Overall would take again.,1
"Had us read 20 pages of a statistic book every week, and asked us 3 random questions regarding chapter. On top of that was having us research, write draft, and final within 3 weeks and didn't offer much help regarding the papers. Also wouldn't grade my finished work over the spring break because one of my sources couldn't be printed.",0
"Possibly the worst professor ever. So unprepared. She'd come to each class, and just ramble. She showed up for two of the tests without a test. Once, she had us write the tests ourselves in groups and then she READ them back to us, and gave us about a minute to answer each question. Her excuse? She was training us to be professors. Awful!",0
"Weekly quizzes based on textbook. Requires a very solid final paper. Good lectures, enjoyable. Go to him during office hours, he's a great guy and will help you out. One of my favourite Trinity profs",1
She's the best prof.,1
"If you ask anything other than an amazing question, he will publicly fry you in front of everyone. There might be 1 or 2 homework assignments in the semester. He assigns a 5 question essay quiz every Friday to be completed online by Monday. You will have 3 online exams and one final exam in class. Hes not horrible, though. I got a good grade ",0
"For such a lame topic, she explains concepts in detail and welcomes questions. You get a chill/helpful ""Mom Vibe"" while she lectures.",1
"I liked her, solid prof, make sure you participate. She's respectable and respects the students.",1
Discrete Probability,1
"She's a really good teacher, but she makes you work for test grades. She wants in depth essays. One or more field trip and summary of the trip is required. There's several group presentations, nothing on your own. Conservation biology is pretty depressing, but it's very educational, transfers as a 300 or 400 level course to a lot of SUNY schools.",1
Professor Bermudez is super chill and laid back. My class was asynchronous for the semester and as long as you hand everything in by the end of the week she will give you a 100 for every assignment. Just do your work and you'll be fine. Super duper easy and the readings she gives you are actually interesting and fun.,1
"Textbook required and lots of pages assigned at once. You don't really have to read to pass, just attend his lectures, pay attention, and take good notes and you will pass. Tests are not proctored so retyping your lecture notes online makes test hard to fail. Gives out MANY free answers and few pop quizzes in class count for extra credit on tests.",1
hard teacher and can be rude at times so watch out,0
"Hes a decent guy but the way he teaches class is ridiculous. Your grade is based off of 2 exams and the final and for the 2 exams he grades so hard. Theres vocab with no word bank, any little detail he takes off points, hes just not a good professor, do everything you can to avoid him in order to save your gpa",0
She will provide a vast amount of resources for you to do well on the exam. She will help prepare you a lot with your lab practicals and I felt very prepared by it. She will tell you exactly what you need to know and there are no curveballs. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!,1
She made me work hard but I feel I understand Econ much better after taking this class. Also she posts all her materials online so it pays off to read them.,1
I like her - class is fairly easy. A decent amount of homework assignments online. There is a lot of information so you have to study for the tests or you won't do well.,1
Best professor I think I have had my entire college career. If you listen to his lectures you know what he expects. The review sheets set you up perfectly for the exams.,1
"I love this teacher, I have had him for 3 classes now, His final projects end to be a lot of work but he is a understanding and proficient teacher. You learn alot in his classes and most of the time he will let you resubmit an assignments if you didn't do well on it.",1
One of the worst teachers I had.  Doesn't explain much in class.  I wouldn't recommend him to anyone,0
"Soft speaker. Has a distinct Chinese accent, so slightly more difficult to understand. Ask a question and he will answer it. Teaches by the textbook but is very knowledgeable on the topic. Homeworks are difficult but prepare you for tests. Tests are mixed. Grades tests and homeworks in a very timely manner. No late homework accepted. No calculator.",1
"Super hard class no matter who teaches. However, he wants you to pass. He'll over look the midterm if you fail and marks your process more than he marks your final answer. If you suck at math, take it from him and work hard.",1
"Linda is such a sweet professor and she is definitely passionate about everything she teaches. Sometimes her classes are very lecture-heavy and hard to sit through, but she does a good job assessing where the class is in understanding and adapts to their feedback. I would recommend her for straightforward classes that are still pretty interesting!",1
"It's a shame that such an interesting topic can be ruined by such a monotone and unenthusiastic professor, never mind the fact that his class is disorganized and often crammed. He gives zero feedback on graded assignments and it is hard to take a professor seriously who constantly makes grammatical errors in his lecture materials. He is very nice.",0
"HIS LECTURES ARE BORING, AND HE'S NOT THE BEST AT EXPLAINING PHYSICS. HE LIKES TO CRAM THE TEST REVIEW THE NIGHT BEFORE THE EXAM.BATMAN POSTS HOMEWORK EVERY 2 DAYS. YOU ALSO HAVE A QUIZ OR A TEST EVERY FRIDAY. FINALLY HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IN SECOND CHANCES, WHICH MEANS HE DOESN'T REPLACE THE FINAL TEST GRADE WITH THE LOWEST TEST.NO GRADES DROPED.",1
"He's called Prof Awesome for a reason.  Compared to all the other profs we've seen this year, he is truly #1.  Wish he could teach everything - which I bet he could.",1
"Take Micro with Powers, not Andersen.",1
Great professor and great class.,1
Helpful and friendly. Makes class interesting and explains text thoroughly.,1
terrible at giving feedback. do not recommend,0
"I took her Black Sci Fi class a year ago, and it was so incredible that she easily became my favorite English professor. All her analysis are amazingly detailed/structured, and I'm always awed by what she manages to pull out of texts. Not for everyone, but if you're looking for a professor who actually discusses race, you can't go wrong w/ Serpell.",1
"Pretty good teacher, helps you out when needed. 3 projects arent to painful and the tests arent all too bad either. Subject is pretty boring but he does crack very dry jokes so its makes the class a little better. I would take him again",1
"HE IS AWESOME! Angel does a great job making sure his students understand his step by step lecture. No PowerPoint, but just writing on the whiteboard. He emphasizes his lecture in a way that makes the material relatable. To pass, you need to show up and participate in the group activity worksheets. Respected and a chill teacher, More than 10/10!!!",1
"The class consists of heavy reading work, weekly reflections, and an overarching group project that is based on the idea of creating a well rounded lesson plan. Note that this is a foundations course, so it was my first ever lesson plan. We were verbally torn apart in front of our class for 10 minutes. Still got an A but it was not a pleasant time.",0
I highly recommend Shelby if you are afraid of taking a Sociology class. She mostly does lectures but she also has audience participation. Her lectures are very clear and straight forward and the quizzes are easy if you study her study guides. She is very kind and will not hassle you.,1
"worst prof ever, doesn't want to help students, makes everything so difficult for students, stay away",0
"Here's the deal. If you enjoy astronomy, this class is great. Its a lot of stuff you've learned in HS and before. In my case, I always went to class but did other work. He givea you all the questions word for word on the test in the guides. Google questions, get answers, memorize and get A.  5 mandatory, random attendance. Drops lowest test. ",1
"I started off reading the book & not listening to the lectures but that was a mistake. If you have to choose one, listen to her lecture videos on youtube. She breaks it down really clearly & covers the most relevant material. If you do that & the exam prep every week, you'll be fine. The homework is unhelpful, harder than, & unrelated to the tests!",1
He made Econ bearable and always offers help. Extra credit given after exams and he curves. Group project was not that difficult. Come to class to earn participation. Study guides helps exams. Overall Professor is super understanding if you show effort and he gives a lot of help and is lenient if he sees you trying! Recommend,1
"One of the best philosophy professors at Colgate. He really knows what he's talking about, and makes it easy to understand. Great corny jokes! Participate, do the reading and take decent notes, and you're set.",1
"Dr. Curtis is by far the best teacher at Salve. She is kind, funny, and extremely knowledgeable. She is knows how to provide information in an accessible way and is able to give assistance when needed. She is always available for help outside of class if concepts are hard and is overall just a really great person and professor.",1
great prof; very nice lady; classy and professional,1
Mr.K was great! I truly enjoyed his classes and stories..,1
"Derek Chang of CSULA Math is the best teacher!! Made calculus easy. I did not take another calculus course with him, and I regretted it. Best teacher ever. Choose him over others, but there are a few other good ones to. Writes clearly, speaks clearly, what more can you ask? Greatest professor. ",1
"Not the worst class or professor ever. His lectures sometime seem pointless, and sometimes make very little sense. Most of the time the connections he makes seem like stretches. Lots of opportunity for extra credit, and the papers are not too hard.",1
Professor Morgan is very much so an expert in the journalism field. His class is not too difficult. He can be a bit disorganized but it doesn't affect your grade. He is not a tough grader and is a nice and caring prof. I enjoyed his class.,1
" The class material was extremely boring.  I tried to follow and learn from the critiques she gave me but I did not see any improvement in my grade. Her critiques are vague, this was one of the most frustrating class I ever took. I do not like her teaching style and I do not recommend her to anyone. Boring , frustrating & prof not interactive.",0
"Prof. Robbins is amazing; she loves her job and it is easy for students to see that. She is willing to put in the effort to see all her students succeed, and does a great job of effectively communicating the material, which is by no means easy. Get ready to study hard before exams, but if you show up and participate she gives some extra credit",1
"She was a wonderful professor! I took three classes with her and as long as you put in the work, she will make sure you can do it. She wants to see all of her students succeed and provides so many opportunities for it. Tests are not extremely hard as long as you study, and she often gives quizzes which help the end grade. Take her!",1
"This professor was great. He was my beginner guitar teacher, after taking the class with him teaching I now have a better understanding of the guitar and I am making great progress learning new things. Practice everyday for at lest an hour, you'll he a guitar player in no time. Learning guitar also inspired me to learn other instruments as well :-)",1
"Prof à éviter. Les explication ne sont pas claires, il lit les diapositives tout simplement. Les examens ne représentent la matière, (Plus difficile que les exercices fait à la maison). Passe sont temps à se venter de ses expériences professionnelles, rien avoir avec le cours. Un chose bonne: Répond rapidement aux courriels!",0
"I have had him for multiple classes and he is very helpful if you come prepared with questions. Hhe is a tough grader, but also gives you what you deserve and worked for. ",1
"Mr. Brooks was wonderful. Very clear in his expectations from his students and your outcome from his class. I believe he had realistic goals and followed his syllabus about 90-95%. He would push dates back a couple of days to benefit the progress of his students. Was always available to answer any question, a positive classroom enviroment! :)",1
"Ms. Moody is a great professor and really does care about her students. She just wants to see you succeed, so come into class with a positive attitude. The A is literally spoon fed to you as long as you come to class, follow directions on all assignments, and do your cultural events well ahead of time. Lastly, she teachers this class for free!",1
"Brilliant and genius.  Will answer intelligent questions, will not answer stupid ones.  fair enough?  Change your life kinda prof.",1
"Kevin Eubanks is by far my favorite professor. He really cares about his student and making sure you actually learn from the class, in fact learning was so important to him that we did not have any exams all semester because he wanted to spend more time on the topics we discussed so we could learn.",1
No Comments,1
Although she is extremely nice I probably wouldn't take her again. I actually wanted to learn in that class because its for my major but i really don't feel like i learned at all. If your looking for easy tests but not to really learn then she's your girl. Overall the class was a cake walk.,1
Professor was super boring in my opinion. Only went to the first 2 or 3 lectures and went to every discussion and passed the class with an A+. A lot of reading for the class but I didnt read a single bit.,0
Paul is an absolute legend! Served as an inspiration for me personally and for everyone I know. Has an incredible insight into the industry. Likes when you participate in class.,1
"Definitely take Deacon Daniel if you can. You don't really have to read since he goes over everything in class. If you take notes or get someone's notes, you're golden. Easy A if you do that. Attendance is mandatory - you have like 3 free absences but someone can always sign you in. Just a midterm and final and both were easy. Take him for sure!",1
"He is a good teacher, and yes does require wireshark and other utilities, which are all freely available. He teaches exactly how to use them in class so there is nothing hard. As long as you go to class and study his examples for the exams, you will at least get a B. He is also very helpful if you have any questions.",1
"Tanush's SI sessions are the reason I didn't drop Evgen, and eventually passed the class.  A-class SI leader and A-class human being!",1
