Such a nice lady but very unclear with expectations. Hard to know what she wants until after grading is complete but allows students to work on the mistakes and resubmit. Read verbatim from slides (has fill in the blanks) and has in class exercises almost every class. Don't recommend but still possible to make a good grade.,0
"Gerard is one of my favourite instructors. He provides thought-provoking lessons and the work he assigns really requires students to think critically, engage with their learning and self-reflect. He is easy to talk to and you can tell that he cares about his students. I really appreciate the creative approach he takes in this course and others.",1
"Not the most caring professor, but very straightforward. Tests are straight memorization, but not difficult. Study and you will do well.",1
She's alright,0
"He's the best prof at Blinn. He's extremely experienced, very intelligent, and very hilarious and kind. He made me love the topic and I learned things that will stick with me for a long time. Cares about animals, cares about his students. I can't say enough kind words about him. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1
"I took this course in the summer. We went by 2 chapters a week. There was 2 quizzes and 2 discussions due each week. She provides PowerPoints, videos, and links to help you with each chapter. She gives good feedback. She wants you to suceed. Take this course.",1
"This is the best teacher at NOVA. She relates to the students and knows what she is talking about. I would recommend if you have to take this class to take hers. You have to do speeches, but they are easy. If you fail this class than you should just drop out of school. Another good thing is she is pretty hot so you will want to go to every class.",1
"super irresponsible, not good ppl to communicate",0
"I am currently taking her lab and she is very nice, explains everything clearly and makes organic chem understandable. There are no lab reports just a lab notebook.",1
"he's a really cool guy, but with type of subject matter, you'd think he could make it a little more interesting. even lab is a sleeper, though you'll regret it since class participation is 20% of grade!",0
"He's very nice but his class is lecture heavy. His interest is in entomology, and this was a beginner biology class. His exams are pretty easy as long as you study and use the study guides that he posts. He assigns readings for lectures, but I never actually read, but I'm sure it would help your grade if you did.",1
Overall a great professor who knows his stuff. If you are a visual learner he might be a little lecture heavy for you. He is always willing to help as long as you do your job as student and follow the rules.,1
"Very pleasant demeanor, very helpful. If you need more understanding of a concept he will gladly readdress it. Extra credit review every test and gives plenty of partial credit for bad answers as long as you show your work.",1
"Can't stay on topic in class. Tests you (extremely difficultly) on material you did not ever discuss in class, because he was too busy getting on his soap box for an hour. Also grades on whether your opinion on politics mirrors his- didn't think professors actually did this, I'm disgusted.",0
"You have 4 tests and then a comprehensive final made by the marketing department. There is a large group marketing project that you work on through the whole semester. Tests were hard for me, either you have the correct answer or you don't. Some questions were made to confuse you. Know the vocab and essential concepts. Lets you have a note sheet.",1
Extremely lazy.  Worst teacher I have ever had.,0
"One of the best classes I've ever taken at UNT! I was in the accelerated 2040/2050 course and myself, professora and all the other students became like a big happy family, that worked really hard!! You must study, read, go to every class, get involved and work very hard. If you do all of these things, you will do very well. I already miss everyone!",1
"This class is supposed to be an introduction to linear algebra, but Falk teaches it like a graduate course.  His schedule was far different, and much harder than other sections of this class.  Tests were only partially related to homework problems, and often required a huge leap in understanding from what was covered in lecture.",0
"Brother Fawcett is amazing and is incredibly kind and willing to work with you.  I absolutely loved this course and I will be keeping the book for it.  His class really teaches you about parenting and how to be the best parent possible.  Instructions are clear, and you are required to work in groups a few times during the semester.  Great class!",1
he is really strict regarding grades.,0
"She is very nice, however a very tough grader. She is hard to understand(strong accent). The labs are worth only 3 points each, and lab attendance is mandatory(taken for points). The average on the tests are 52-56 percent(for the entire 85 person lectures)&she refuses to curve them. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO TAKE A DIFFERENT TEACHER!",0
"Dr. Lamkin is super hard. She jumps from first slide to random slides while explaining. Don't take anatomy with 3-4 classes. Requires a lot of reading, understanding and the most important memorizing. If you want an A you should like put A LOT of time studying. Definitely not an easy A. Her labs are extremely hard like her lectures! No extra points",0
Mrs. Prater means well but treats her students like they are children and talks down to them. Expects you to read every night before class and is homework heavy. Her personal tests arent that bad but the midterm is a grade breaker. Study hard and go to class otherwise you wont do well in the class. There are definitely easier teachers for this clas,1
"In this professor's class for only less than four weeks into the semester. He seems knowledgeable of the subject, however is extremely impatient with students. I went to see him in his office hours and he got angry over something not being printed out. I asked him to check my work and he said ""this is garbage I don't want to see it"".",0
"She is the best yoga instructor I have ever had!!  This is an excellent class to take, and you can get a letter grade!!",1
Well No Lie he has great stories though I'm sure if we stuck to the syllabus this class could have easily been a half semester class. He goes on and on and on with stories though that can be tiring and completely not go over what we should have in that class. Takes forever with grading things and giving them back. Not Emailer friendly.,1
"I found that Professor Smith was very disorganized. It felt like he didn't have a solid plan for the semester. He's not the best at lecturing, but if you go to him and talk one on one, the feedback and help you'll get is very good. Definitely not a professor I would take again, but he's a very nice guy.",0
He is approachable.,0
I wouldn't recommend this class to anyone. I chose this class with such high intentions and ending up being extremely disappointed. I am barely passing and the amount of work assigned is not normal. Please trust me. ,0
"Although this is the toughest class I've ever taken, MA really cares about her students. She shows it in an odd way because she can be rude or mean at times, but it's only because she wants you to do your best and want to succeed. Be prepared to do lots of homework problems. Read the book, and never get behind. It's impossible to catch up.",0
I took him this semester and he says he will respond to emails within 24 hours but Ive emailed him about a project days before it was due and he didnt respond until after it was already turned in. Also he doesnt keep up with grading and you wont really know if you passed the class or not until its basically too late. Will never take again.,0
run...,0
Ms. Brock is so caring!! She really cares about student's progress and always willing to help students! She is amazing!!,1
"She is a very nice teacher, does not put up with rude behavior. Her class was tough, I personally do not recommend her. Majority of the class failed, go to main campus more options. She makes you work in groups a lot. Try your best to keep up and get your book as soon as possible. Midterm  take home, Final  take home or in class(less questions)",0
If you have the option do not take this class online. Her directions are not very specific and she is terrible at replying to emails when students have questions. She will even copy and paste emails and send them to multiple students that asked for feedback on their paper. Not very helpful at all. ,0
"Its only 2 weeks into class and i'm totally miserable, IF spanish is your native language/your second language you'll love him we don't really learn anything new he just talks in spanish the whole time, I have a headache everytime I go to this class......he makes me hate spanish he is from Venezuala so he has a very strong accent.....Be Aware",0
"Serge Jasmin is a good guy its that other guy names organic chemistry that sucks. I'm not gonna lie he has trouble finishing his sentences and has accent so its sometime hard to follow, oh yeah and he gets mad when you ask questions and tells you too look at the stuff he posted on canvas as his answer. Grading isn't too bad since he curves.",0
"Very sweet and caring professor! My first semester of college and she gave me a great learning experience/atmosphere!I recommend her to everyone, pretty simple grading scale. You go mrs. p!",1
She was a good teacher. Math is really hard for me but she made it a point to openly ask questions when you don't understand and when you did she happily answered. We had a chaulk board not a white board and she's allergic to chaulk so she was always stuffed up. I don't recommend missing class cause you'll never catch up.,1
Lovely professor. Easy to talk to. ,1
"Great A&P teacher. She stays up late to make outlines and exam reviews to make it as easy as she can. A&P is a tough class. The people that drop weren't ready for the challenge, but Mrs. Zitrick makes it totally possible to get an A in the class. Find a group to study with and use all of her resources. She's a terrific asset to have.",1
Very enthusiastic professor that will make you fall in love with the subject of study. Inspirational influence on my career.  Probably my favorite teacher of all time. Dedicated to his students and (I feel) went above and beyond his responsibilities as a professor. I give Dr. Zlesak an A+!,1
"I would not recommend taking Dr. Kageyama. He does not know how to run a class. His lectures are confusing, study guides are not helpful, and tests are hard. The class average for both the midterms was 60%. He had to apply big curves and offer a bunch of extra credit just so we had a chance at passing. We also never got our project grades back. ",0
"If you arent good in math, stay far away from her. She is more of a bully than a teacher, she was not helpful at all, I will never take her again.",0
"Dr. Morris is the best! If you have any opportunity to take her class, do it. She is very understanding and kind, and is also excellent at explaining tougher concepts. She will go out of her way to help students if asked. The best, literally!",1
I took PSYC 321 (family development) with Dr. Mooney. She read straight off the slides and the class was boring. She was a tough grader when it came to the paper and exams. She nervously laughed after almost everything. Received a C and I worked my butt off in the class.,0
He is possible one of the worst professors I've ever had. He is very bad at explaining topics and doesnt go over half of the clicker questions so its hard to catch up if you are behind. The only reason I go to his lectures is for clicker questions because I learn little from him. The class by itself isn't bad but do what you can to avoid having him,0
"She is very unclear and almost makes you feel dumb for asking a question. She has this laugh that she does when you ask a question that makes you feel like she is mocking you. We never finished a lecture, tests are very hard and she doesnt explain things. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. SO many people dropped this class.",0
The worst professor,0
"One of the worst professors I've ever had. Hutton didn't respect any students in the class, as well as she responded to 1 out of 9 emails I send throughout the semester. Also, hutton believes all of her students should ""look up to her"" and become just like her. She accused me of cheating twice and argued with my class the entire semester.",0
I love Professor Fujita. She is a sweet person and is more than willing to help. She is passionate about what she does and she cares about your performance.  Take her for Chem2411L!,1
Nguyen is great. He was so sensitive to the covid-19 situation with his students. He gave us lots of extra credit opportunities in the form of assignments and extra points available on tests (even before covid). He doesn't really take attendance but I don't recommend skipping any lectures or LABS. He's pretty funny but don't be sensitive!,1
"Very inattentive professor, extremely lecture heavy, doesn't make eye contact with students, horrible at explaining content, very strict grader, tests have nothing to do with textbook reading or what he presents in lecture. He expects you to be an expert before having taking this class. I strongly advise you to find a different physics professor.",0
Its not a easy intro level course but she really is the most amazing lecturer. She really makes all the stuff in the class fit together. The tests are essays but they are COMPLETELY based on lectures so its doable. There is also alot of extra credit.,1
"Discrimination, no science only politics! Hater of many ethnicities, including Russian people. Hater of some religious. He was disrespectful even to his wife during the class. The worse person I have ever meet. He is not a scientist because his mind is full of political propaganda!",0
She takes attendance EVERY class! Actually paying attention is optional. Don't bother buying the book; everything is in the powerpoints she gives you. You must memorize absolutely everything in those slides though. Tests are lots of multiple choice and a few essay style Q's. Read Q's very carefully. Will have a paper and group pres at the end.,1
"Falcon is one of a kind I would say. His class is hard and requires a lot of reading but I think being able to hear him lecture is worth it. He presents a lot of different perspectives and isnt afraid to get controversial. Im glad I stumbled across his class and didnt drop it, he really has impacted my perspective of the world",1
"She is very liberal and will call you out in front of the whole class if you are conservative. Papers are very controversial. She makes you sit in alphabetical order and bringing materials is mandatory. Basically, you are repeating eighth grade. She makes you do peer review and it is not very helpful at all. I dislike her but it is an easy A.",0
Decent lady but she can come off as rude at times. Get ready to sit in the most redundant class. As she drags out discussion and you will listen to people practically say the same thing over and over. I did an assignment early by following the syllabus and she added requirements not specified. Then got an attitude when I brought it up.,0
"Dr. Avila is amazing professor, I have taken Chem I and II with her before organic and if you really want to learn and have take it easy a bit, she's the one to take. At times she is very serious, but most of the time she's very caring and sarcastic which makes her class enjoyable. I would highly recommend Dr. Avila to just about anyone.",1
"Dr. Whitt is fast paced. I had him for two different classes, and I would have been lost if I wasn't already a math goddess. He gives homework every single class meet but never checks it. HE is VERY STRICT!!",1
Absolute worst. Tests are easy if you understand the basic concept of each problem. He is by far the hardest grader in the world. Takes off points even if the answer is correct. If he sees one thing not there that is a point off. Too old. Born in the BC era,0
STRICT ATTENDANCE POLICIES AND PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS; CONFUSING LECTURES; TIMELY BASED STRUCTURED ONLINE DISCUSSIONS; NO VIA E-MAIL ADDRESS REPLIES FOR RECEIVING ACCOMMODATION SERVICES ON IMPORTANT GROUP WORK ASSIGNMENTS/PROJECTS. Make sure you request INTENSIVE TUTORING SERVICES and verifiable CRC counseling support mentors to obtain success.,0
"A 20-point curve is added to each assignment. The highest test average was a 60, and all other tests had an average below 60. He is extremely hateful when a question is asked- regardless of the question. As a student who has succeeded in every aspect of college, this man lowered my self-esteem.",0
This class by far the worst class that I have ever taken at this college. Be prepared to stay up till 4 am 4 nights in a row studying for her quizzes and tests. I have seeked help from her and a tutor multiple times and neither were help at all. I feel she sets us up for failure. She takes forever at the beginning then goes physco at the end. awful,0
she was pretty nice and fairly helpful. i did feel like she may have treated me slightly different because i was young,1
I took this class as an online summer course and it was very straightforward. There were 2 exams and 3 discussions with two replies and weekly 20 question quiz. Professor Shan graded weekly and provided positive feedback. I enjoyed the class! Take it if you need a class.,1
He is pretty hard to understand. Get the textbook so you will know what is going on. His in-class examples don't make sense and he writes in an unorganized manner. You will have no idea how to calculate your grade because he makes it up as you go through the semester. There are hardly any explained practice problems so you're screwed for the exams.,0
"She is a tough grader, during lectures she does give out good ideas that you wouldnt normally think about. There are about 1 inside the class essay. I believe overall she is narcissistic and no matter how hard you try; it still isnt good enough for his standards.",0
Reading assignment every night and pop quizzes almost every class. There are three papers during the semester and she does a horrible job at explaining her expectations for these. Her midterm is impossible even after extensively reviewing the class material. I asked for assistance multiple times and she was rude and not willing to help. DO NOT TAKE,0
"This guy is terrible. I'm a ME major, this course is needed, and I have never gotten below a 84 in any previous math class. Makovers handwriting is bad, he jumps all over the place, he'll change numbers in examples or put an equation into mathmatica if he can't figure it out, and he goes way to fast. Avoid him at all costs.",0
"Dr. Mirsurda is really passionate about the material, but I don't think he relates it to the students. He doesn't give a lot of homework so I you don't do well there isn't much of a buffer. He often speaks the whole lecture, so it's hard to follow for 75 minutes. He often gives snarky responses to the students when they ask questions.",0
Never available to get help from.  Grades are based off of midterm and final only.  He didn't even know my name!,0
"Esposito can be very overwhelming at first, but you will grow to love him. He has such passion for what he teaches that you can't help but become interested. He assigns a 1 page essay every week for CC101 so be prepared for a lot of writing and reading. Do not skip the reading or the class.",1
"Seriously,  he is the worst teacher ever. I'm not just echoing what everyone else has said about him but this man cannot teach. he doesn't know what he going to teach in the class bcoz he uses other professor's powerpoint and he doesn't know some biological chemical reactions.  he is rude, disrespectful, and doesn't care for anyone or anything.",0
"I can definitely see why people may not like him, but he has been one of my favorite professors here at Temple. Makes you work hard and earn your grade, but you get so much out of his class.",1
she is really bad...she didnt help me at all...the class was a waste of money and time. dont take her class.,0
"Could be considered a language class. Taken for Science credits. Prof is very serious, on the ball, but totally human and reasonable. GREAT prof!",1
"Madhu has specific unspoken criteria for assignments, even when you follow the syllabus she always finds ways to deduct points. Unlike other ECE profs, she does not accept missing assignments at the end of the semester, and you will get a zero for them. If you are having hardships in your personal life she isn't super compassionate or accommodating",0
"Worst math teacher I have yet to take at TMCC (and I have taken many math classes). He offers absolutely no guidance for the exams and all the 'practice' tests are worthless because they cover nothing that's on the exams. He sets his students up for failure. If you have a difficult time with math, DO NOT TAKE CASEY!",0
"started MAT-106 and was excited  bc of his high rating. However, if you are not great at algebra, he won't slow down for you.  I was completely lost. 1st class  was told I need to get up to speed. 2nd class was told he does not teach algebra in this class and I have to already know it.  I had to drop , I was lost after only 2 classes",0
"Too many and too long quizzes. Really Hard exams. Bad Lecture notes. Bad TA grading. Too many quizzes, too hard exams and bad essay grading. Bad TA. Tough class.",1
"By far the most unorganized class I have been apart of at NC State. He only communicates through email, he lost student's assignments multiple times. I felt like I was taught nothing and had to figure it out on my own. He is a nice guy and a genius in AutoCAD but I just did not enjoy him as a teacher. You will probably get a high grade in the class",0
Professor Meacham knows the content really well. Questions are welcome and you will get in-depth answers no matter what questions you ask. You can feel that she does her best to make assignments as clear as possible.,1
"Best English Teacher ever!! She will work with you and help you. She grades fairly and honestly. Sweetest person ever.!! Also, you will learn a lot from her. From her teaching style to how to write properly she's the best.",1
"For a communication teacher she doesnt communicate very well. I took this class online and it was very difficult. The tests are so vague and you are expected to read 50+ pages for a 10 question quiz weekly, and everyone I asked agrees that the questions are based on material they didnt find in the text. She expects way too much. A lot of work.",0
Not a very good class if you actually want to learn something.  I took her for speech and I know nothing more then I did before...,0
Maher was not organized in his lectures. He would include irrelevant material in his lectures that would not be on his exams. He gave tests that included essays and definitions that were ridiculous. He was not clear when asked what he was looking for in the essays. The only way to pass is the attend each class and take notes over everything he says,0
"very good teacher, tough class if you don't work hard",1
"Although she has high expectations, Knott has been a really reliable professor for me. She does assign a lot and she does expect a lot out of students, but she provides help and is completely willing to work if you are. Again, It's not an easy class but if you're willing to stay on top of things it's not as hard as others make it seem.",1
"Surprisingly difficult, and Prof Khalsa isn't very understanding.  Pay attention to the syllabus - we weren't allowed to miss a SINGLE class, and that gets tough after a while.  I was so excited to take this, but have ended up hating it.  Unless you're REALLY serious, I'd stay away.",0
He never talked about the subject at hand. Graded papers harshly. Worthless overall.,0
"She is super hesitant to give As on anything. Even with little 10 point assignments; you do everything she tells you to do and you still won't get full credit. Must read the book from cover to cover to do good on tests. Also, lectures are a waste of time. Avoid taking!! ",0
"Professor Burnier does a great job at teaching, especially because he assigns papers that have to do with the history of Illinois and Chicago. He often goes on rants that pertain to nothing about the topics that we are supposed to be talking about, but overall he was great!",1
"Class is so pointless, all you do is talk about the book he wrote. Did well in the class but would never take him again. He is creepy....just look at his picture.",0
"Professor Hinshaw is simply an amazing person. His class was phenomenal. He is one of the most engaging lecturers I've encountered at Cal and a truly good person. Office hours were such a joy, and I always left with some nugget of wisdom. I wish this class were a year long. I would take any class with this professor! He's one-of-a-kind.",1
"Extremely hard corse no matter what professor you have.  Extra work in Bridges vs other friends with different teachers.  She moved very quickly and left no time for questions or confusion.  Pop Quizzes about once a week, class handouts for homework, online homework, and you are assigned questions from study guide to turn in every day.",1
"She is nice but doesn't seem very helpful. In my opinion, she doesn't explain things very clearly. There were many times in class where she would call on students for answers, they didn't know the answer, and then kind of acted like we were stupid for not knowing even though it was her instructions that weren't clear/didn't make sense.",0
She is seriously the sweetest and most helpful lady. She makes assignments very easy and interesting to students. I would definitely recommend her over other marketing teachers. One of my favorite classes,1
"She's very patient and if she sees that the class doesn't understand what she's talking about, she goes over it in a different way. She's always willing to help in and out of class. She's also a perfectionist so she will point out where you could do better, but she understands that night classes = busy people.",1
She is an amazing prof!! She is so energetic and passionate about teaching!,1
"Dr. Barber is the worst at grading anything. You will not get grades back until the last week of class, so no feedback until it's too late. Every assignment's instruction is so confusing, and every assignment repeats every week. I don't think I learned anything in this class. I learned how to do busywork.",0
"Horrible Teacher, only reads from the text book and expects too much from people. To give him a bit of credit, he does give us simple homework..at times. His test are also both True-False questions and are always open book. If only he gave a better description he would be a better teacher.",0
"Just a few notes: On ""Five and Apply"" papers, follow his example EXACTLY, as if it's a template. Seriously. Even if he says it's an ""anonymous"" discussion, use your name. He won't give you credit for the assignment if your name is not attached. Follow his directions EXACTLY and you should get a good grade. No late work!",1
"Pretty fun class. If you have any issues, she's super understanding. Just participate in discussions and do the assignments, and you'll be fine. They shouldn't take too much time. Extra Credit is plenty. If you do even one or two, you'll be golden for the entire semester.",1
"Amazing teacher. Hilarious, helpful, and class is a blast. He definitely goes out of his way to explain hard topics, as long as you ask him to. Challenging course, but he makes it fun.",1
"I can't say enough amazing things about Colleen! She expects you to have read the material outside of class but the in-class discussions are engaging and interesting, and she has a great sense of humour to boot. She doesn't use Blackboard but if you read the material thoroughly and attend class, you'll do well on her tests.",1
"For COMM 301:1 big paper at the end of the semester (comparative analysis) 3 tests the whole semester. gives u studyguide, everything she wants is super clear. no attendence policy. great sense of humor! take this class!",1
"Professor Crane is Awesome. extremely easy class. only assignments you get all year are three papers that are assigned at the beginning of the year and due at the end of the semester, on any topic you choose. Her exams are short and clear cut. she basically hands you an A. I would take this class over again, or at least another class with her. ",1
"He wrote his own textbook, so as long as you read the textbook you are fine. You're even better off because he makes a good amount of mistakes in lecture anyway. Also, his tests are  exactly like the homework and textbook, so if you know the homework you will ace the tests.",1
"Get ready to have to do at least 50 pages of reading (textbook and articles), watch 30-45 mins of videos AND read about 20-30 powerpoint slides PER WEEK. The quizzes are open book, but the questions are so specific that, no matter how much you prepare/study, you will still have no idea what's going on. Also, lots of trick questions.",0
"Among the worst professors I've ever had. She projects blame onto students for her own lack of knowledge, ridiculously vague and contradictory requirements, and even her inability to use basic teaching technology like Carmen or MS Word. When you point out her contradictory requirements or mistakes she makes, she comes down hard on you. Rude. Awful.",0
She definitely won't be swayed in her ways but she is very easygoing as long as you follow the instructions and get your work done. You can learn how to quickly improve with her feedback.,1
"Hard to hear, her slides don't make sense half the time because she doesn't proof read them. If you ask her something she'll tell you that's too advanced for the class and won't answer.",0
"Took Pharmacology II and worked on a research project in Bettina's lab for BIOM 4521/2.  Dr. Kalisch is an excellent teacher for Pharm II and a wonderful research supervisor. She genuinely cares about mentoring students, is approachable, knowledgeable and helpful.  Wondeful!",1
the most awesomest Acct Prof:D,1
"She gives 4 photography projects in total. 2 are projects that require you to choose between 2 topics, 1 requires you to go to an photography exhibition and discuss it, and the final project allows you to choose the topic. She's also lenient in terms of what she allows for the projects and is very kind. Best of all, she appreciates all work.",1
he's awesome!! The class definitely got A LOT harder and practice exams are only about 50% of what shows up on the actual class but he prepares you well for exams.,1
Her teaching style is lacking in clarity. You are pretty much on you own for knowing how to write a paper. Her tips and tricks are not very useful.,0
"It is literally the hardest thing I've ever done to pay attention to Dr. Kaminski for any amount of time. I can't say that I've ever seen her take a breath, let alone ask if you have questions. Be prepared to teach yourself a lot. As well as spend A LOT of time on the homework. Oh yeah, exams are awful too.",0
"This class is the worst spanish course that I have ever taken. We have so much homework for every class and the quizzes are terrible. She is nice, but this class is not worth it. I have gotten an A in every spanish class up to this point. The quizzes have things we never even talked about and the sakai page is so unorganized.",0
"Because Lamkin was an assistant professor, I didn't really have much experience with her. But from what I  experienced, she is a seemingly good professor. However, you shouldn't just take my word for it. Take a class with her and see how you like it. I'd be happy to hear how others like the new Honors program being started at Mission next semester.",1
Complete jerk.  Not interested in helping you.  He is dishonest with his grading and avoids students who ask for assistance.  Byrne gives VU profs a bad name.,0
"Sweetha is literally the sweetest TA! She comes across as tough but she was really understanding. The labs went by quickly and everything was very straightforward. Her quizzes are tough, but if you know your material and read the lab manual ahead of time, you'll absolutely ace this class. Just make sure you pay attention and stay respectful!",1
SO hot,1
"I loved Mr. Marsh, these classes were very hard, a lot of studying and an amazing amount of homework, but these classes are hard in general. Marsh has been my favorite teacher so far in my 2 years at Clark, he is understanding, flexible and will help anyone. I had fun during labs, lectures are a bit tough, but it was very worth it in the end. ",1
"The worst organization of any online class I've ever taken, The guidelines for written assignments weren't specific, and at worst contradicted themselves. Does not respond to communication. I felt that it was very poorly organized, and that he was putting in minimal effort. Would not recommend Kurokawa for this class.",0
Beeeeeeeesssssssstttttttttttttttttt teacher I ever met!,1
"I have not taken this class, but I have looked over what she has taught from friends. I am a local administrator for many large businesses in fort myers and from what I have seen she knows nothing about networking or teaching it.",0
"He is great. Attendance isn't mandatory but there are a lot of in class activities that are used for grading. Besides that there are 2 midterms, 1 final, and a project. All are easy, you make your own exam and then he adds like 10 questions( out of 50). Great Class.",1
"He puts 0 effort in catching the rampant cheating that was clearly happening with inflated test scores this semester. He could have at least randomized test questions, but it is clear the he is totally OK with punishing honest students.",0
"she was a really good professor. class wasn't always thrilling, but she was passionate about all of it. she had great stories and graded fairly.  plenty of small papers and 3 take home exams that ruined my life while i was writing them. but if you finish them, she'll give you a good enough grade.  i'd reccommend this section.",1
"She doesnt respond to any emails, takes forever to grade, and doesnt consider that were in a PANDEMIC. Her grading was tough and she wasnt lenient at all. Take it at another school dont put yourself through the stress and mental deterioration. Disappointed because I had heard so many good things about her when classes were in person.",0
Great teacher. If you have any questions she is more then willing to help you. Makes information applicable to real life situations. This class helps alot with Biomechanics and Motor learning.,1
"Long boring lectures. Spends forever copying his slides onto the white boards without adding any useful information and makes lots of mistakes. Poor explanations, contradicts himself, takes marks off for stupid things like writing a number as a fraction instead of a decimal. Wouldnt let the TA's give us hard copies of the tutorial solutions. Worst",0
"Not as good as people say. I had him this semester, and he was alright. The curve will not help you much, and while he is a good professor, he still has his flaws like everyone else. He comes off as smug/arrogant when you go to ask him questions. His exams are fair, but the averages are always high (as most of the students in his course are honors)",1
"In 102, there is daily homework and a lot of exams and you need your textbook all the time, but Erin was enthusiastic about getting us through the material and I felt prepared for the exams. good TA and always willing to answer questions",1
"He is an incredibly sweet professor, his class seemed difficult at first, but he allows you to send in your drafts and will give you amazing feedback. With his essays, they were long but not really hard to complete.",1
One of the worst teachers I've ever taken. Too many assignments for an online class. Too many small things you had to complete in order to get your real work done. Too many things due at once. Too many things due back to back. She was really rude when you did reach out to her. She just didn't care.,0
"I took elementary span 1 online w. her & it was tragic. Homework was due every week (over 70 assignments, not exaggerating) The class description said it was for people with little to no knowledge of Spanish (me) but the work was for Span 2 speakers. WHATEVER YOU DO STAY AWAY SHE WAS NOT UNDERSTANDING AT ALL. I WISH THERE WERE MORE CHARACTERS ...",0
Professor Lee has been a great teacher and is very cooperative but the only problem I faced was that he was not very much frequent with his replies to the emails. But otherwise he is a great teacher.,1
i think this teacher is ridiculous. He would rather drop students then help them. i know someone that supposedly failed a test and when they asked to see it he told them that he threw it away! he also  belittles students in the class room when they are trying to ask questions and get help,0
"Really nice guy, will help you if you ask for it. He is very enthusiastic about what he is teaching even though the subject was kind of difficult. However most people find philosophy tricky. If you put effort into this class there is no reason why you can't end up with and A or B. Also mention craft beer if you want a fun conversation.",1
"The way he explained things was confusing, so it's better to stick with smart people. You can missed a few classes and made the points up with extra credits. Overall it was an easy lab class, just a bit confusing. No textbook. If you take this class, you will surely get an A.",1
Took Professor Marlowe two semesters. She's a great professor! Lectures are clear and she gives a study guide for the exams. Very helpful! Definitely would take her class again,1
i previously had assumed that professors needed some degree of intelligence. khalsa taught me never to assume anything.,0
"The professor assigned a lot of readings but as long as you do the readings and discussion guides, the tests will be okay. Make outlines and know the chapter. The study guide does not help with the test very much. Kinda slow when it comes to grading and a little disorganized. Very friendly and approachable.",1
Not available outside class. Always tries to avoid students and their questions. Not organized at all.  Made simple things more complicated. Never gonna take his course again.,0
Must do assignment. Not allowed to go against her ideologies,0
I took him Fall 2019 for English 1C. Hes a good English professor and I felt like my writing improved but his personality is horrible. Hes arrogant and a narcissist. He will call on you in front of the whole class if he you do so much as laugh or make a sound. Hes not afraid to embarrass you in front of others. Horrible!!,0
Interesting teacher whom knows a lot about the subject matter. Also has lived the life of an Anthropologist so he talks from experience. If you do the readings ( the textbook is really interesting ).Phones are completely off limits. Pretty easy class to get a decent grade in that you show up and read the assigned readings.,1
We didn't learn anything because we never had lectures. During the 2nd week of classes she said she was canceling all classes for the rest of the semester. She told us we would all get A's as long as we didn't tell the Goodwin administration. Told us if we cared about Bio then we should just read the textbook. Please Goodwin do something about this,0
"Dr. Kelly isnt a bad professor at all. Most of the opinions are based on preliminary writing courses the University required, which she really has no control over. Her own classes are very insightful and helpful without an intense amount of work. All required gen-ed credits suck, but her actual classes are great.",1
"Do not take this class if you want to learn something. Ms. Bouchard is interesting to look at, but she is not good at teaching. She is unorganized, does not follow the syllabus, makes up assignments as she goes along and does not grade anything until the end of the term. Her lectures are about the definitions and no real legal research happening. ",0
"She is a great professor who has a passion to teach Economics. And she is always welcome to answer questions. Actually, I couldn't take good scores on each test then I got 79% for a grade after final finish. However, when I asked to give me a chance, she gave me 80%. I have no words for her. Don't give up and try to talk to her. She will help you",1
"It is very obvious the professor does not care about this class. The class consists of reading through a stats book, and doing a homework/quiz assignment out of the book weekly. This is a self help class. The professor is not involved besides grading. He won't respond to emails, you are on your own for any confusion. Don't bother signing up for him",0
"Very easy  class, 4 Essays and 1 group presentations. Lectures are very  boring , don't expect to watch modern movies very often, usually the movies in focus are black and white or from foreign countries. Easy A as long as your essays are good.",0
"Jeremy Fry was super nice from the first day. If you don't understand something, he'd usually go back and fix his mistakes, or show you how to do it better. I really liked his teaching style.",1
"Andor is a great professor. I had him for the ECO/HST class that he taught with Sabi. He's funny, easygoing, extremely knowledgable about history, and an all around interesting guy to talk to. He doesn't seem to care too much about deadlines, but he can be a tough grader so make sure if you turn something in late that it's good quality.",1
"Super strict about guidelines, but yet confusing. The exams are headache inducing. The material itself was really interesting but she did not seem to care about the students, even if it was an online class. And the final paper had nothing to do with the material covered in class.",0
She is the most hate-inspired woman I have ever dealt with and that is not an exaggeration by any means.  I absolutely despise this woman and cannot understand how she's still got a job.,0
Great teacher. Very helpful. Pretty easy. Recommend you take his class.,1
"This has to be by far the hardest/worst online class i have ever taken. The quizes are extremly hard and tricky, and the book sometimes tricks you as well. Some of her answers to her questions are wrong and when brought up to her she wont do anything about it. DONT TAKE THIS CLASS.",0
"I would never recommend anyone to take her class who is doing a gen ed or if you have any traditional views. She gives out many writing assigments, and also grades very unfairly on your own analyzations of the theories learned. She is a very young professor and a joke. Uconn really needs to get rid of her. I should've looked here before taking.",0
"He's there to help you understand the material, but your final grade depends on how hard you work. Definitely cannot skip this class, missing one day can be crucial.",1
"Mandatory reading every week - approx. 100 pages. Multiple choice midterm, 8-10 page near the end of the quarter, and a relatively difficult in-class essay final. During lecture, Prof. Perez stated that his class was NOT going to be an easy class at all. Thank god I ""S/NC"" this class.. If you're looking for an easy ""A"", look elsewhere",0
"HORRIBLE PROFESSOR. First of all he abbreviates so much to the point of no understanding. It takes longer to understand his abbreviations then what he is trying to teach. Basically you end up teaching yourself. He allows you to bring an outline for the final but it doesn't help much. Overall, its worth taking someone else",0
"Taking this class is the biggest waste of my life. Matlab and maple are basic tools for computation and Engineering etc, you DON'T sit in a classroom to learn the how to use the tools!Latex is completely useless. You can achieve the same much easier with Word and other math symbol typers. Also, Prof Gupta gives the most boring lectures on earth.",0
worst teacher ever for online classes! her tests are impossible and she never responds to E-mails :(,0
"I took his graduate digital communication systems course. He's a hard professor without a doubt, but he tosses in little jokes, which i enjoyed. you MUST do homework to understand the class. he's very friendly and approachable. he does give BIG curves as well for final grades.",1
"Although it is just a GE course, he teaches us like we are all political sci majors. So I really had no idea what he is talking about. Extremely boring lectures. Not worth it even if you're just taking for credit. Terrible overall. Do not take his class. You will regret taking his class. Probably the worst class.",0
"class avg C-, unbelievable. Have no idea what he was teaching in class. Even his TA's teaching skill is better.",0
Not as bad as prior comments make her seem. Its a hard class and i DO NOT recommend skipping lecture. If allowed to make not cards keep up on them and organize. Keep with it and she usually gives a little extra credit towards the end if in lecture. I got a B so if i can get a decent grade most people who at least try can too.,0
This is by far my favorite professor here at SUNY Cortland. He ties in all his lectures with real life examples which helps extremely when learning the material. He is very enthusiastic and makes learning a fun experience and he is very available for office hours and willing to help. He wants all his students to succeed in the class,1
Awful. Took him a whole semester to grade one paper. Tests are confusing because his lectures contain no actual information and his study guides are also pointless. Also very long winded so sitting in class is wildly boring.,0
Lectures not helpful but she's not mean. Theatre survey class pretty easy.,0
"He almost never responded to e-mails when he said he would (and being a ""blended"" course (half online half in class) you would think he would. His final assignment had little to no outline and left a lot of students unclear of what was needed. He also failed to give me marks on assignments and activities I had completed. Would not recommend prof.",0
This teacher lacks a teaching skills. He's so narrow and thinking that you will answer according to what his instructions without even teaching. Lol! It's funny that I never got criticize by all my previous professors and he's the first one to think that I'm not trying my best. I wish I I found this rating site earlier.,0
"UGHHHHH! all over the place! 6 books, so much reading its insane, doesn't even acknowledge that we do take classes BESIDES just his, he just takes his job way too seriously. i don't look forward to his class and theatre is my world, thats how much i dread it. theres just too much going on at once, finish a project before you give out another!",0
"I have only been in his class for a couple of days, but what made me automatically not like him is that he said he will not record his lectures. I find this very inconsiderate, especially considering the time we are living in. If you won't make your classes accessible, especially when everyone around us is dying, then you are not a good person.",0
BEST INSTRUCTOR! He is very funny!,1
the way she thinks is so ridiculous. I can hardly believe that I willingly signed up for such a class. She also sometimes thinks that your not right when in reality you are.,0
"If you want to pass the class expect to work for it. He explains everything thoroughly and clearly, but you have to pay attention! (just like any class you want to do well in). He tests on what he presents in his lectures and uses the textbook problems as test questions. He's there if you need help, just ask & don't be afraid. Work hard! Good guy!",1
"Way to much work, its a Gen Ed class and he treats it like a senior level philosophy class. He told us all we needed to do was the reading and i still did bad on the exams even though i read all the material. he gave me no helpful advice on how I could improve. I had to drop because I was putting off my other 4 classes just to get Ds on his exams.",0
Boring lectures that aren't helpful and vague expectations. She'll go 20 minutes over on a conference to share personal stories while you wait on her to look over your essay. One of my worst experiences with a professor.,0
"I had her for my freshman seminar yoga class and she is my favorite professor so far. She not only teaches her lesson plan, but life lessons as well. I would recommend her to anyone who is willing to work, and have fun!",1
This professor only lectures and doesn't let others talk. Hard to participate or be engaged when so negative and rude.,0
"Nemat is a very engaging professor. He is one of the few engineering professors I have had who truly cares to spend time making sure the students understand the material, absolutely. He will tend to spend times on material that seems simple, however, it is with good reason. FUNNY which is great for eng. class. Exams very close to HW & pract. ones.",1
"I enjoyed her class!  I have not had a math class in many  years and was very nervous about this class.  She is very clear when teaching  along with a wonderful sense of humor, so I was completely at ease.  Making sure the homework is done is most important.  She is easy to talk to and very fair with each student.  Amazing teacher!",1
"Poorly organized, graded by few things for a semester long grade. Very book heavy. Most students are confused with what is going on in this class so everyone just does their best. Other profs are worse so just take this for your gen ed and get through it. Cool, funny guy but isn't the best teacher. I could see him being a good upper division prof",0
Talks and talks and talks. Keeps classroom way too dark. Puts things on test that are not in any book.,0
She has no sympathy for her students nor does she care to even respond to your emails or questions about any projects. she needs to relax on the workload ! i had a personal problem and she never got back to me but just give me a 0.,0
Worst teacher I've ever had in my life. Completely useless. Does not know anything about graphic design and is horrible at giving feedback. He belittles his students and finds pleasure in embarrassing them in front of the class. Any good reviews on here were probably written by him.,0
I don't recommend her if you need extra help. I couldn't understand her very well and her method of teaching made it extremely frustrating. She likes to do the hard way before she shows you the easy way and won't fully answer your question. Even if you're good at math i would still hesitate to take this class.,0
"She would start to pick on random people, even if they were listening to see if they knew the material and would get upset if they did not. When analyzing a document everybody needed to see it the same way or they were wrong. There were no such things as a wrong answer here because she would get mad if you did not get the topic or was wrong.",0
"Le pire prof que jai jamais u. Des examens qui ont aucun rapport, difficile pour rien !! Un examen cest faire pour tester la compréhension las pour faire couler le cours aux étudients. Plus jamais ce prof.",0
"Extremely hard. Very Little help. He is just so smart on his own, I think he has trouble bring himself down on a undergrad level. Nice guy,just hard prof",0
"Daniel is a fantastic professor! There are two big exams involving multiple-choice and SPSS portions. There are also a number of short SPSS activities (walkthroughs available) & a few homework assignments as well. There is one semester-length research paper with randomly-assigned classmates. Overall, 10/10, one of my favorite professors ever.",1
"I wasn't really into the material of this class but Prof.Shimko is really awesome at giving lectures. Passionate and interesting. three tests each with 33.3%, no attendance, no quizes.",1
"I had professor Stewart for Accounting 1 and 2. Great professor, there is a good amount of work but it's accounting so I was expecting it. Great professor, I would highly recommend. Out of all of the accounting professors at UCO, Mr. Stewart is the way to go.",1
Throughout this class I questioned if Dr Lee really knows what he is talking about? Maybe things are lost in translation but content he is teach is just plain wrong.,0
"Her lectures are not as detailed as the book but discussion does help with the material. There were 4 HWS, very manageable and 1 programming assignment. Studying the lecture slides & HWS was sufficient to do well on the final and midterm. Pop quizzes that can only help your grade. Overall, very nice teacher!",1
"for a 100 level online class she really requires a lot of work, its like you have to write a book in the bb discussion section every week. if you post it early enough she will tell u what u need to add to get the full 100 points. she requires a stupid amt of citations from the txt and explanations, or else its not good enough, shes really annoying.",0
"Avoid him with all costs. He is talented in making easy and simple things into very complicated lectures. He might have been great as an airport manager, but he is not so good at teaching. His lectures can be more organized and sequential. You'll have to go back and forth on your notes adding information to previous notes.",0
"She is really vague about what she wants out of your writing. She grades harshly and is picky about wording. A lot of the activities in-class felt like filler assignments. You pick one topic for all of the essays in class. Because of this, you'll find yourself hating your own topic by the second essay. She doesn't like if you disagree w her ideas",0
"This class was all over the place. The HW questions out of the book were fine, but he gave no direction when it can to using R. He likes asking word problems on the tests, but beware of curve balls. He tried to help us with points in the form of in class assignments, but it can only help so much.",0
"Nice person, but not the greatest professor. Class lectures were very dull and often not clear. Very little reading assignments (a plus), but difficult grader and it was hard to understand exactly what she wanted in a paper. Most students were below average on the midterm.",0
Professor Milinovich is one of my favorite teachers at Dominican! He is so engaging and interesting. Pretty easy to get through his classes as long as you do the readings. I learned a ton in his class. He is a wonderful human being and everyone should take a class with him!,1
"Don't do hw? Wont pass. Overall, great professor. She has a different style of teaching which affected me in the beginning but I managed to catch up. Read notes provided before class lecture which includes instructions on how to use stat crunch to find your answers. Exam reviews reflect actual exam so pay close attention to those!!",1
"Worst teacher Ive ever take in my life. Strict on grading, no matter how hard you try he will always find some problem to lower your grade. WORST TEACHER EVER",0
"You actually have to be there to pass, she explains everything and you have to do the homework to pass. Other than that you will learn some good french from her.",1
"Hybrid class: Do online work & go to class, even if you feel you dont need to, GO TO CLAS -lectures are tough to understand -examples dont make since! -I would def. take into consideration before taking him if math is your weak spot. Hard to tell if he actually cares to see his students succeed! -Utilize tutors & study groups for sure!!",0
"Has no clear guidelines but expects so much. He gets mad when the class does bad but when you ask him what to study, he'll call it ""fishing for answers."" ""Fishing"" makes him even madder and he says if we ""fish"" the test will get harder. He asks questions on content he hasn't taught and expects you to know it.",0
Very nice and easy,1
Love her,1
Hes a great person hes just tough when it comes to grading. Theres never a right answer.,1
"This lecturer holds his students to high and unclear standard concerning their written responses. The reading material assigned is unnecessary and inapplicable to the poorly organized lectures. The test at the end of the semester was universally failed, the study guide particularly misleading.",0
"horrible teacher! I have trouble staying awake in class, let alone pay attention and try to learn! Finals are beyond anything we've ever done before! Avoid taking his class at all costs. You'll be so much happier without him!",0
"Took the online physical science. Easy A if you do what your suppose to. He gives lots of extra credit. Emails, disscussions, quiz and tests. Gives feed back and responds quickly. Id def take him again.",1
Good guy. Good Math Teacher. Class was not hard if you showed up and did the homework.,1
Professor was super understanding about the difficulties of online learning during the pandemic. Was lenient with deadlines and coursework. Would take the class again,1
Never again.,0
"Really great class, I actually learned a thing or 2 and would recommend it to everyone. There are only 3-4 exams but she provides a study guide. There are 4 speeches but theyre all really easy and she even helps with the outlines during her office hours.",1
Prof Allen overall just sucks. He's arrogant and inconsiderate to the fact that this is not everyones first priority and mostly everyone only take his class to fulfill a gened. He gives super long boring lectures that no one understands unless you're an expert in Refugee crisis's. Do not take this class unless you have the time to do excess work,0
"Take him if you can! hes the best, and he really tries his best to help you understand. He works through every assignment he gives.",1
"This was a very challenging course for me. Graded on few things and the final is worth 60% of the grade (cumulative exam). Very caring professor though, pretty hilarious, and easy to get ahold of which is key for difficult concepts. Cool guy. Podcasts his lectures so I never had to come to class, but WATCH. Also, OPEN TEXTBOOK EXAMS, BUT NO E-BOOKS",1
Gabe Shapiro is always willing to meet with us students.  Not always focused in class but very enthusiastic and motivating to be around.,1
He will rip your writing apart and then smile to your face. Nice guy but a tough grader and a stickler. Didn't tell the class in the syllabus that we had two of the same annoying assignments. So glad to be out of there,0
"She is one of those teachers that has a very specific group of people that are her little ""stars"" and who are so great in her eyes that she does not give the other more quiet students a chance. At the beginning of class she says ""Alright, so what's going on?"" and the few students that talk a lot will talk to her for 30 mins and waste class time.",0
I have taken this class elsewhere as an undergrad. At SFSU I took this at a graduate level expecting further depth. Was disappointed in the quality of the material. The instructor has experience in image processing but clearly is behind the curve in AI and pattern analysis. Not worth my time or money. ,0
Awesome teacher. Will spend as much time as you need helping you but also doesnt want to keep you in the class. Take him!,1
"In-class assignments every day, so your grade will drop fast if you miss. Extremely tough grader (I rarely got full credit for assignments and I'm an A student). She wants things done a specific way and if you don't ask questions or confirm how something should be done, you will lose points. There are easier teachers for this class.",0
"There was a lot of notes, so if you miss a day make sure you know someone in the class that will send you the notes. He loves to tell stories, and gets off topic a lot but if you show up to class and participate he will love you and you will get an A. Very nice and easy to talk to unless you're being rude in his class.",1
"Barely listened in his class, was pretty boring, everything is on slides, final and midterm are just papers, APA FORMAT, cool guy, just really really really really really really really boring lectures... so yeah have fun with that",1
"Funny guy. He seems to enjoy teaching when the class participates, but if the class lacks energy, he will reciprocate. He's very knowledgeable, but doesn't really show it until he's asked to elaborate on something during a class. The underachiever of instructors, which is comforting as an underachieving student.",1
Shes easy and sweet! If you stay after she'll help you! She gives out the questions on all your tests so its no prob! Shes laid back but you still learn. Great class!..esp as an elective!,1
"I truly enjoyed this course and having Mrs. McGlynn as my professor.  She cares about what she does and is happy to help.  She infuses meaning into what she teaches and has inspired me as a future educator.  If you have the opportunity to take a class with her, please do.  She is a gem!",1
"Alicia was a very caring and accommodating prof! I was unable to make an in-class quiz, and after emailing her she straight away said it was fine for me to do it another time. Her lectures were filled with personality, from spanish songs to her teaching us to dance. Definitely make sure you bring your textbook to class, study, and you'll do fine.",1
"One missed class will bring you down basically a letter grade. Lectures are circular, slow, and if they do end up coming to a point the point is generally something that any breathing human could have gotten to on their own at age 15. There's no final but there's a funky amount of busywork. Daily discussions are torturous. A very timid teacher.",0
"I would never recommend Dr. Yang. She is condescending and rude. Unnecessary amount of work. You write, take, and grade your own tests that take HOURS. She is very particular and if things are not done her way, she is judgemental and will tell you you're wrong. Struggles to give compliments to her students or make them feel worthy! Avoid!!!",0
"Had Sean for my Mix 2 class, AWESOME guy. He has a lot of experience, extremely helpful and knowledgeable teacher. Amazing sense of humor. I learned a lot of new concepts and approaches to mixing from him. I'd take any of his classes again in a heartbeat. He's always happy to answer any questions. One of the best new MP&E professors.",1
Prof. Chase was easily the best professor Ive had at MJC so far. His lectures are interesting whether youre into astronomy or not. I visited his office hours with a few questions once and he did a great job giving a one on one explanation to make sure I understood the material. The weekly quizzes are a breeze if you study the notes he gives!,1
"I made an A+ in this class - all quizzes and exams are online and are T/F, however, Prof. Frazier is very rude and has snarky comments. He is very harsh on attendance and says it counts for a grade yet actually doesnt. If you can manage his weird teaching ways its an easy A class.",0
"Great Professor! Biology is hard so you are gonna have to put some effort into it, but she gives you everything you need to get a good grade. 3 lecture exams, 1 lab exam and a final. The test are pretty fair you just gotta know your stuff. Labs are easy. DO ALL OF THE EXTRA CREDIT. The extra credit can boost you up a whole letter grade.",1
"wow. how awesome. I paid 3grand to watch two ""professors"" read a PowerPoint. I thoroughly enjoyed that neither of them demonstrated hkw to approach a single exam question. Great way to TEACH someone! impressed!",0
"HORRIBLE PROFESSOR! Does not respond to emails, does not fix mistakes in grades, and made one of the tests at the last minute! Would strongly not recommend this professor.",0
I am currently taking a class with this professor and I am finding him hard to understand. Beware he does everything on powerpoint and rarely uses the board. I have found it hard to learn math being done on a powerpoint. He is also extremely fast paced. We had a test last Monday and We have one again this Thursday.,0
Mrs. Kondrak is a good teacher it's just that she is monotoned. He voice does not change and she is BORING.,0
RJ is the sweetest guy and he really wants you to do good. He has a very thick accient making it very hard to pay attention and understand. His lectures consist of fill in the blank powerpoints. RJ gives case studies that are worth 1 point extra credit so it doesn't do much for your grade as well as weekly quizzes that are online and aren't hard.,0
"Class material is hard at first but gets easier. Don't worry. Hw, Paper, Midterm 20% Final 40%. She has trouble understanding your questions, she'll respond but it's not what you want to know. She is willing to help you though. If you go to office hours, she will explain concepts and calculations and try to help you understand",1
"Very nice guy, and appropriately funny. My GOD does this guy give harder exams. Just like Horstmann grading structure. Class average on first exam was 21/50 but half the class did ereally well and other half did not. Too much assignment u wouldnt finish unless only taking 2 classes that semester. After exam 1 and 3 HW I was discouraged to work hard",0
"You must learn @ home outside the classroom if you want to succeed PPs are helpful but very vague & pretty much read verbatim Adjunct prof., doesn't seem to care abt our success Marks grade down for being late  lowering GPA Keeps you late well after class is over Hands-on in-class activities are fun Makes you work for your grade Lots of group work",0
"took her for bio lab, she is the nicest TA youll ever meet. shes lenient, nice, and actually gets back to your emails fast. would definitely take her again and would definitely recommend",1
Professor Chavez is a nice lady and sends out reminders for when work is due. The only way to fail this class is by not doing the work and by not studying.,1
I dont know why everyone makes a big deal about Professor Drake being too hard. Its probably because he is one of the few professors who is actually legit here at the university of Montana.I get A's on all his tests. The key is going to class and making distinctions behind main actors in the readings. Not a class for deadbeats who only want easyA's,1
"Such a caring and down-to-earth teacher, he really makes sure that you not only know what you're doing on a big assignment, but also provides some in-depth feedback to help elevate your abilities. He is a quick responder to, which is great given the current situation.",1
"I enrolled inside this online course expecting to learn lots of interesting conceptual materials relating lifespan development studies, unfortunately I got immediately dropped by instructor without any further due of providing assistance to resolve urgent matters and CRC counseling didn't even bother to help me out either hurting my reputation!",0
This teacher takes forever to grade assignments.  I took him three weeks to grade discussion questions and homework assignment that were suppose d to be graded the first three weeks in class.  His discussions don't follow along with the book.  So it's important to read the book and not listen to his discussions if u want to pass tests.,0
"If you want to take a self taught class this is the one for you. She posts the assignments at the beginning of the course and other than getting grades, once in a while, there is no real interaction. No group discussions. Disorganized materials. Hard to keep motivated. ",0
He's new at teaching and is still learning which means he's awful at the moment. His study guides have typos and his answers aren't even right. He takes away points if you want to check your online connect homework to see if its correct. His classes are slow and he often goes on tangents about Greek philosophy.,0
Best Teacher Ever,1
"Honestly, this class was pretty easy. There is only one assignment a week, if that, and we only had 2 big essays. Lectures weren't mandatory and were recorded, all lectures are easy to understand with some tangents. Prof Peters was a tough grader for the essays, but if you do the weekly assignments you should get an A easily! Lots of extra credit.",1
"Truly one of the best professors I've had. He does give a lot of homework and it's a hard class, but he genuinely tries to make it as easy as possible for students while making sure we are still learning. The exams are just like the HW. He interacts with the class during lecture a lot so its engaging, he's funny, and very approachable. Great prof",1
do not take this class if possible,0
"This class has been REALLY terrible. It has been impossible to follow, the answers to test questions cannot be found in any of the material he provides. He rarely responses when contacted. He disappeared for ten days and neither explained or apologized. DO NOT take this class from this professor, you will regret it.",0
"Faux was a super laid back teacher, only classes that you really need to show up to is the review days. He offers extra credit and holds review sessions outside of classes too if needed.",1
She's fantastic. BI202 is framed in a way for non-biology majors and it's done impeccably. Lectures are very engaging and I also like how exams are graded on a curve. Definitely recommended.,1
"Best teacher in COB, also the person to talk to if you have any trouble with class schedule or similar. He actually knows what he is talking about, owning his own accounting firm makes it easier to pay attention. Overall great guy and teacher, take him if you can!!!",1
"She talked to her class like we were in pre-K. She was completely unhelpful, the program glitched (almost everytime), and the tests were so hard. She's definitely one of the worst teachers I've ever had. DO NOT TAKE HER.",0
"Good suggestions on color mixing, paint handling. Poor management of class time. Critiques went way over; she stayed later to finish & implied that anyone who didn't stay was not committed. As a single parent w child care obligations I had no choice but to leave, although I was hugely committed. Left a bad taste, insensitive, elitist.",0
"This teacher is awesome. I really hate writing, but she makes it great. My first writing teacher sucked and made me hate writing, but Professor Felber really is great. She uses screen cast when grading papers which makes for great feedback. Best teacher I've had by far.",1
I had her a little over a year back but she's still one of my favorite instructors and is the kindest person I've met here.,1
"This class was a joke.  The material is a bit tough, so you have to keep up on assignments, and it helps to work with your classmates.  But the professor is so awful!  He didn't make sense half the time--I don't know how I got the grade I did. Luck?",0
"Uses class time to chat and if you ask for help inside or outside class, you will not receive it. The class is a joke though.",0
"Please do not be fooled. He is average at best. I took him and his lectures are the blandest thing you will ever attend. Puts you to sleep every time. The only reason I kept going into class was for attendance points. # exams all consisted of learning 45-55 definitions, so if you can memorize it should be an easy A. He is not a good professor.",0
"Mrs. Wilson was the worst English experience I have ever had. She has recently had her first year at USC Upstate in Spartanburg. She is the toughest grader and gave feedback that was unreasonable. I took a 101 class, and there is no reason for the tough grading. Wilson clogs most of the class with her personal life allowing little time for work.",0
"Really nice guy, funny, but frustrating if youre accustomed to more organized & punctual teachers. No HW but that does mean your grade is basically based on tests. Feels weird spending hrs on labs you dont even turn in for credit. Stalls on getting graded work back due to being busy w day job, but its a night class, most of us work FT too.",1
He makes frequent mistakes when teaching and often made it more confusing than it needed to be. The material wasn't extremely clear the first time he taught it but he always answers questions the students had. Once it was clear what to do then it was easy. He's pretty funny and I had a good time in the classes.,1
"Is mildly entertaining at times, tries very hard to connect with the students but generally fails at doing so. Assignments are very vague and generally seem pointless, he doesn't really help to clarify them even when asked. He's confusing even though he thinks he's somewhat Socratic or something. haha. Attempts at indepth conversations didn't work.",0
"Best teacher! Just read the night before and you'll get an A. She chooses interesting books to read that are relevant. Only one Shakespeare novel and she keeps it interesting. If you don't love English, you'll learn to love it with Dr. Chalk. Only 2 papers and she'll look over it beforehand for feedback. Easy midterm as long as you take good notes.",1
"TAKE HER EMOTIONS CLASS DURING WINTER OR SUMMER SESSION! During those times, she lets you take the tests open book/open note. During the regular semester it's closed book/notes and there's so much information that it would be extremely difficult. When open notes, impossible not to get an A. Papers clearly explained she gives grading guide. Easy A.",1
Not at all understanding of missing class. It is a pandemic and life happens but to him nothing should be more important than his class. Often did not explain assignments clearly. Ignored students email. If you were oh so lucky to get an email then all he'll tell you is to look at the syllabus.,0
"Great Professor. She is hard but fair. I don't know what all of the negative comments are about, its an upper division elective class, they won't hold your hand. You have to do a lot of work but it's worth it. Great class and great teacher.",1
She gives extra credit for doing the homework and bonus problems on the tests. Don't just write the correct answers on the tests. Show all your work when solving the problems to receive points even if your final answer is incorrect. She teaches a bit fast but if you ask for clarification she will go over every step and explain them more clearly.,1
"This professor just does not seem to have any knowledge on teaching. He is extreamly unorganized, and you just cannot follow what he is saying. Honestly I don't think he has any intrest in his students.",0
"Absolutely one of my favorite professors. Take him only if you are able to work hard. I learned so much from him and this class and I recommend it to any non science major. Really interesting stuff. He cares about what he teaches, just be prepared to put work in. also, he's always up to smoke a cigarette after class.",1
cours facile si t'es à l'aise à l'oral,1
"She isn't very friendly and is difficult to communicate with. I found her to be really judgemental. She is a tough grader, so even when you put your 100% effort into an assignment, don't expect to get an A.",0
"I have mix feeling about this guy! Heres the thing, his test are not hard. Its from his lectures and multiple choice questions from the study guide. Hes an extremely hard marker for weekly assignments and I feel like hes not approachable when you need help. I managed to get in the 80s bc I did well on the final. You can get him but be prepared",0
Great professor!!!! He was willing to accommodate during the pandemic and workload is super manageable. Material was easy to digest and exams were pretty easy. I highly recommend this class to non-STEM majors. The one negative thing I can say is that feedback was not given on assignments and I was often unclear as to why points were taken off.,1
"Lectures are 3 hours long, yes he is a bit boring and some topics are hard to sit through depending on your interest but it is very easy to do well in his course. He provides study guides that are 6-9 pages but if you go over it the exam will be easy since he pulls questions from the study guide. He also gives xtra credit 6% added to final grade.",1
Great Professor really funny and helpful!!,1
"YOU WILL FALL ASLEEP IN LECTURE. Unless you get a good T.A., you probably will have a tough time in this class. He goes off on tangents a lot and is very monotoned. He doesn't use slides either so it's quite boring. Grading consists of 2 midterms, a final, and weekly quizzes in discussion. All of the test are essay questions.",0
"you basically need to study on your own, lectures are super boring and no quizzes to boost up marks. He is also very picky and a tough grader when it comes to wording for the written part of his exams. If this is your first time taking the course, you should probably get someone else to really explain the information since bio is generally hard",0
she's the worse,0
Wouldn't wish her on my WORST enemy.,0
"Great at explaining difficult topics. It can be a hard course if you're not good with Chemistry, but he explains well, and is available to help. Had him for ChemII after a bad professor for ChemI. What a difference. He was able to explain the stuff I didn't get the first time very well.",1
He is really smart. Lectures are informative about everything not just the course. Respects students even when they can be rude or disruptive to the class. He changed some dates on the syllabus but it was for the better of the class and we have more time for final projects.,1
"If there is any possible way to avoid his classes, DO SO!  He is a very smart man, but has absolutely 0 teaching ability.",0
"He made gen chem bearable and genuinely cares about his students. His exams are kind of hard, but not unfair in the least bit.",1
"I loved her lab and found her to be a super great instructor. If you were stuck, she'd help out until you got it.",1
He doesn't explain anything well and the entire grade was just based of the midterm and the final. Homework wasn't collected and quizzes don't affect grades. The tests ask for a lot of definitions and proofs and had way too many parts to finish in 1 hr. He doesn't communicate with his TAs properly so they don't know what is going on either.,0
"Professor Kireyev has a lot of potential being a great professor if that is what he chooses to do, what I would recommend to him (if he reads this) is to slow down during lectures because he FLIES through topics which leaves little time to ask questions even though you may be confused. Overall he knows what he's talking about and is accessible.",1
"I had him as a TA. He gave great lectures, covering everything anyone could possibly need to write the essay exams and breaking down simply enough for people not inclined to philosophy. Always gave very detailed feedback on papers, and stuck to his suggestions- if I followed them the next time, my grade improved. Straightforward, logical stuff.",1
"Love this professor! Extremely knowledgable, friendly, and funny. Although her lectures may seem dry, they really help students understand readings more in depth and keeps things simple. Exams are simple if you actually read (some readings are long). Always willing to help during office hours. Would definitely recommend taking a class with her! ",1
"Show up to class, ask questions, and if you need her to be in the math lab she will go and help you! Make sure you study. As long as you do the work and show up you'll be ok. She offers retests and gives take home quizzes. Not the worst teacher like many people say. You need the textbook for hw.",1
"This teacher is a very confusing teacher. She talks around everything. She grades you on everything literally everything. The way you dress, the way you talk, how you stand. She makes up topics that don't apply to the real world. She makes you feel like your opinion doesn't matter. She's just horrible, I recommend that you take someone else.",0
"I have no clue why students gave him such a good rating. He is a great guy and very knowledgeable but the class is just WAY too much reading and studying to be a 100 class. Be prepared to read every night, hard test, and pop quizzes. He is also a hard grader when it comes to the assignment. He's a really cool guy but be ready to put a lot of effort",0
"She's tough.  Take Barbara Miller before taking Larsen. Its lots of work, especially when you want to goof off. P.S:   For all the guys out there, her sons are really cute. But she'll get you to where you wanna go. Lots of information but it will make some sense.",0
She is the best psych professor ever! Her lectures are fun and she gives you everything you need to know on the test through the notes she has you write. Her class is just so fun and enjoyable. i never knew psychology was so much fun. Her tests are based on a few chapters at a time. Just go to class and take your notes and youre good!,1
Took async fall 2020. It was on the Tophat and textbook is included in the purchase. You read the book and answer mc and short answers for like 60% for your final grade. Midterm and final were easy as the questions were mostly from the textbook readings. Easy A as long as you do the work.,1
"This class was a huge waste of time, the class was 2hrs and 45 mins and for at least half of each class Bert would just ramble and try to make jokes. He was never prepared for class and would usually freelance his classes, and he also didn't explain how to use the programs and expected us to know what we were doing.",0
"Makes several mistakes, doesn't give breaks and gets aggravated if someone gets up to use the restroom, very condescending, rushes through materials, doesn't properly explain mathematical rules and applications, every chapter I used kahn academy to figure out the ""lesson"" plan avoid at all cost",0
"Dr. Pittman is by far one of the sweetest and most highly educated professors I've had. I have her for Comparative Religion and Cultural Geography, both good classes. Her lectures are very interesting and packed with interesting, but it's not always relevant to the online quizzes and tests. Overall, wonderful woman and professor!",1
"Hunt is a very boring professor. She gives very organized power points but reads in such a monotone voice. As far as being a teacher she is okay, but as a person she doesn't seem to care about her students. She has a lot of pride and looks down on her students. Her exams are also more difficult than other professors.",0
One of the best professors in the College of Business. He seems to truly care about his students.,1
"One of the best Math professors at RCC. He has a very nice attitude, and really cares about his students. Very charismatic, and explains the Math very clear. TAKE THIS GUY",1
"I only have 350 characters so here's the take-home point: She is EXCELLENT- the class is difficult even if you think you know computers well. It's a lot of work but her grading criteria and assignments are very clearly listed and done in great detail. She puts a lot of thought into her course. Read her posts, do the work, get the A. End of story.",1
"He is a Superman! A brilliant performer,  a prodigious mentor and just an exceptional human being!",1
She was a miserable teacher to learn under and almost drove away my drive to learn Japanese.  I refuse to be taught by her ever again.,0
"She talks to Fast!!! , Its a 50 minute class, The first exam she expected it done quickly, and was repeating, ""I don't think I'll be getting a lecture in,  with the quiz taking the class so long."" Needless to say , we did the rest of the quizzes online.  She repeated several times thru out the course she didn't know how to do formulas.  PPT were :(",0
"She's interesting. We basically sit in a circle and talk about poems and stories the entire class. grade is based on midterm and final only so if you miss a class, you don't miss anything. it was definitely boring at times but I got an A so I'm happy. She's really really sweet and super easy going about everything. i would definitely recommend her",1
"He is a nice guy, but admits the first day that he is monotoned and prepares us for a boring course.  His quizzes are hard for the pure fact that there is so much material to cover for a 10 question quiz.  He isn't helpful outside of class and is very hard to get ahold of. DONT TAKE. Take learning!!!!",0
"excellent teacher.  Lots of videos and classroom discussions/participation.  Very ""fun"", young at heart, guy (gives you candy for 100 on quizzes, $1 for 100 on tests) He is not demeaning or arrogant, and is fair.  Covers material very thoroughly, makes outlines available online if you choose to utilize them.Would take him again-highly recommend CW",1
I always tell fellow science undergrads to take a class with Anne. Incredibly passionate and thoughtful teacher. Definitely would like to have her as a professor again.,1
"Come on Guys!!! He is one of the best history professors I have had so far. He gets really fired up when he talks and will practically choke, because he runs out of air. You get it, Yeah!!!",1
"I thought the material for this class was interesting. Quizzes on the readings every meeting time (fairly easy if you did the readings) and some group projects. Very nice man, and very willing to help you",1
"taylor is very very willing to help, enjoys the maestro, subtly insults the idiots in the class, and knows his****. learn it or don't, he doesn't care. and thus, why he's hot.",1
"I took ICS45c during COVID-19 when we shifted to online learning and it was a lot easier because exams were replaced by weekly exercise sets. You still learn though! He prerecords lots of lecture videos, provides detailed online notes, and uses live lecture times as office hours. Very responsive on Piazza and tutors/TAs are helpful.",1
The only reason why I am passing this class is due to the fact that I teach myself every single chapter. The professor is a nice guy but isn't good at explaining what he is doing on the board and half the time doesn't even know what he's doing himself. I would recommend taking any other professor for chem 2 over this guy.,0
"Teacher goes through the section, is pretty organized, and keeps grades posted. Is a little bit confusing as trys and adds extra information that is not needed, but is a pretty good teacher!",1
Maureen is the <b>best</b> teacher I have <i>ever</i> had. I know I can speak for all her students that she is very understanding and helpful.  I have learned so much from her in 2 semesters!,1
She's a cool and understanding teacher! She assigns a light load of hw and makes learning easy. I always feel that I understand the material in her class.,1
"NOTES NOTES NOTES NOTES. If you take him, meet people in the class, get contacts and meet to share notes, he talks, s l o w & fast. you can't write everything. final paper is on, the notes of 32 stories/poems, we read. If you want to improve your writing, it's a good class, but don't expect to walk through it.",1
"Professor Lichtman is great. He has lots of knowledge on business. Gives feed back and his test are easy as long as you pay attention in class and do the work online. You don't need a book because it's included in the MindTap. You must show to class, you skip class and you won't pass. Test  are normally 75 questions long.",1
"She does not care about students. This old hag only cares about picking up her  salary. She is very offensive if ask for question. She deserves a big ""F"".",0
"I had him as a discussion class for calc 1 and my god he seems so irritated to teach. As if it's not his job to??? Also, he graded my work with really rude comments. I attended his discussion once and I asked a question and he seemed super annoyed that I did. Never joined the class again.",0
"She is an awesome teacher.  Very straight forward and clear about the course material.  Lecture material is important for writing papers and understanding tests, but all the readings are not needed.  Overall, a great teacher and a class worth taking!",1
"Dr. Isley was the absolute best!!! She is literally the only class I was excited for. She was really engaging and made her assignments fun and enjoyable. I would take her class ALL OVER AGAIN. Test were Easy and she even gives extra credit if needed, but her class is so easy that you shouldn't need it. Get a easy A with a fun and caring professor!",1
"He's definitely a tough grader and does not specify at all if you mess up, you can be doing good and all of a sudden he starts giving poor grades and his feedback is nothing but initials of a chart he has. I wouldn't take his class due to the lack of professionalism and compassion as a Social Work professor.",0
"very fun class! i enjoyed it! all you do is pay attention, take notes as you watch movies and you will pass guaranteed. Has 4 essays, presentation, 1 midterm, final. No hw! i recommend this class for anyone who enjoys films and need an easy A. Very nice prof and knows a lot about the subject. I actually learned a lot in this class.",1
I loved taking this class.Professor Guzzone is  great..Never boring and the tests aren't bad if you do the reading.I recommend it to anyone who loves music.,1
"This class is ALOT of work. You have a group presentation, 3 exams open notes but they are difficult, 13 paper discussions, 10-15pg final paper. Participation matters. You only get 1 unexcused absent. You have to work hard for your grade.",0
Not a fan of this professor. He is inexperienced and therefore doesn't teach the material clearly. He constantly makes mistakes and confuses himself and the class. Doesn't really adequately prepare the class for the homework or tests either. I also asked for help with part of the project and he was rude and unhelpful with his response.    ,0
"Dr. Lee is such a nice person but I would not take his class again. His exams are so hard, I failed every one. HIs lectures don't help, you are basically teaching yourself. Nobody even shows up to class. You have to read the chapter before class and that doesn't even help. Maybe tutoring would have helped me. HARDEST CLASS, PICK SOMEONE ELSE!",0
The class wasn't all that difficult and it is my fault for slacking off towards the end. But he was easily the worst CS professor I have ever had. I'm not sure if it was just me but the way he taught the class and interacted with students made me feel very unmotivated to participate. I would avoid taking a class with him at all costs.,0
Don't walk..run away!  He reads straight from a powerpoint and makes things very confusing. The tests are extremely difficult...he really enjoys the essay questions.  Way too much info given for the amount of time he teaches (aka-read straight from the powerpoint). I would never take another class taught by this professor again.,0
Bogdan was great his class was straight forward you learn alot of vocab. Yet this test try to trick you but  if you read it twice you'll get it,1
"Do NOT take any class with him! He may know his stuff, but he does NOT prepare students well enough for his exams. His exams do not at all reflect what he teaches, and he tries to be extra hard and trick you it seems. He will answer questions, but can be rude if you don't understand. I've had to teach myself everything from this class. -10/10!",0
I LOVE him and would take again BUT get ready to work! He is a genius and is eager to share his knowledge with you. Papers due every week and longer papers due sporadically make his class HARD. His assigned reading is easy and short which makes it easier to be prepared for class. He also requires you to attend events out of class which can be hard.,1
Worst instructor I have ever had. Is not clear with dates of tests.,0
Made this French III class harder than it needed to be in terms of us adding to previously gained knowledge. She could take more time in explaining grammar. But she was okay in general. Going from Mme Vitaglione in French 2 to her was more difficult than it should have been if the point was to have people leave being fluent in French.,0
"Really nice class for one of my first being a DE Student. Class was online and strictly through MyMathLab, which allowed multiple attempts on HW questions and 2 attempts for the quiz after. Depending on holidays, she gives extensions for the long homework assignments. She also gives a lot of reminders so you get your homework completed! Recommend.",1
"Christina is a really cool person, but if she doesn't like your piece then you might as well just turn in a totally different piece. She is also pretty unclear of what she wants which can be good in art, but in this case it didn't work because she wanted specific things. I took Color Theory and I don't think I learned enough about color in class",1
"Jeanette is not only an amazing professor, but such a caring person. She pushed me to be a great student and I learned more in her class than most other classes combined. She makes you earn your grade and it is not easy but it will certainly pay off in the long run. I highly recommend her.",1
"Doesn't really do anything except grade the mid term and exam. You're basically teaching yourself with the textbook and Connect assignments. No lectures or supplementary notes by the professor. You can't even email him, as he directs all the work to the recitation professor.",0
"If you've taken an AP calculus class before, go ahead and take him as a professor. If this your first time ever seeing calc before, stay away.",0
This was an easy A class but I didn't learn anything from this professor. I took A&P which is the only reason I knew a lot of the information. Also the directions and the syllabus were very confusing to follow. She would become irritated quickly when asked questions by students. Easy GPA booster.,0
He may know his stuff but there are much better teachers out there. Be prepared to struggle on your own as you will get little or no actual teaching. He grades based on if he like you or not and had no rapport with the student. I had to basically self study and there was little or no help. TA are not much help either.,0
Professor Niu is a really nice person and her intentions are to help you but her teaching style is bad. She does not explain in a way you'll understand and may be unclear to comprehend. Do not take her if your math skills are not sharp.,0
his class was all over the place. We had a lot of different books and we would jump all over the material. He would go off on tangents a lot and it felt like what he was saying didn't align with what we were reading. His essay assignments were confusing and he took forever to grade. He's very stuck in his ways and i wouldn't take him again.,0
"He is perfect in every way, shape, and form. I love you.",1
"Professor Wu is a very nice guy, he allows cheat sheets on tests and doesn't have too many exams. Be sure to put everything on your cheat sheet! His lectures are hard to understand what's relevant, and for his lab projects make sure you attend those classes because his instructions are vague at best.",1
I like that this professor had alot of talks about how this stuff we learned is in the real world. I also like that he graded the tests quick. He always asked us our opinions of things we were learning about and made everybody feel comfortable and told us there is no wrong opinion in his class. I recommend him alot.,1
"Took him for animal science, awesome instructor, very knowledgeable and funny. Kept lectures interesting.",1
"She is very nice and well organized. All of the work adds up to the research paper, some quizzes and discussion posts but only once every two weeks or so. She could be a harsh grader only when yo arent clear. Overall a good professor. Just do your work",1
He is the best professor. He give one midterm exam and one final and both of them are home take. in the midterm you can do as many times you can and raise your grade. He usually look at the effort that students put in his midterm. He is simply awesome and care for his students.,1
"a tough grader, but helpful and quickly responds to emails.",1
The professor talks really fast when she give lectures. She grades hard! She except you to know the entire book and vocabulary. Her quiz online are difficult. The time for each quiz is 20 min.,0
"This class, like many of the other reviews show, is a complete mess. There is no communication between temple and his TA's which led to one of the 3 graded assignments to be graded wrong. The only assignments worth grades are the 2 midterms and the final. He rambles a lot and goes off topic in lectures. I only learned from the book. STAY AWAY!",0
"He's a great professor, one of the best ones I have had at csuf. The material is not easy and requires a lot of review to master. He's pretty lenient with the homework and you would be smart to get to know him personally. He's a great instructor and he wants everyone to pass. He has a wealth of knowledge and if you try you'll be fine.",1
"Even though I ended the class with a C. I did not give up, i improved my grade on the tests and quizzes. Professor Kern saw that. He is very lenient about grading. Tests and quizzes are not hard. You just have to be prepared. Gives you option to ask questions during and after class. Teaches from textbook. Great person!",1
Very interested in correcting grammer and writing style and skills.Marks off for everything and she expects perfection even though she does not live up to her own standards.If you can take the class with another teacher I would do so.Good luck!,0
"Not feeling this class. All the people who said to avoid it are right. This class is hard for no reason. It just is. The lectures are ridiculous, because literally speaks at a million miles a minute. Tests are crazy, too. My biggest gripe with them is that they are just terribly worded sometimes. which is annoying! Just ask the question clearly.",0
le meilleur prof que jai eu dans mes deux années a date. mm si il est un peu demandant,1
"One of my favorite professor's I have had. Lectures are super interesting, and he really tries to make them relevant to what students want to learn and get from the class. Sometimes he'll spend the beginning of class just going over student's emailed in questions. His exams are easy if you attend class and pay attention 70% of the time.",1
very unprofessional. would not take again,1
He is passionate about the subject he teaches and is very knowledgable about the subject. He gives out a lot of extra credit assignments and is an easy grader as it is. Very self explanatory teacher/class. You ARE tested on the same material taught  in class so there are no surprises. Do you the clicker questions and study and you'll be fine.,1
"I'm not a big fan of math online. I think the class would work nicer if there were computers in the room instead of going to class then reserving computers in another building for testing. She seems like a nice lady, but not very excited about math. I notice she makes silly errors then says ""why didn't you catch that."" We don't use the book at all.",1
Honestly a great guy. He genuinely wants you to do good. Sometimes it feels like she cares more than the students. He gives curves and his lectures aren't boring. He's funny and makes sure you really understand. Great person. I would definitely take him again.,1
Can I give you some advice? Don't take a class with this prof if you can avoid it. Trust me on this one.,0
"Pay attention in lectures, speak up during class discussions and do extra credits. You will get an A if you do that.",1
"One of the best teachers I have ever had. I am going to sign up for more of his classes, regardless of what they are.",1
"Dr. Callaway is an energetic, engaging professor, and her class was an amazing experience! She was helpful, if a little vague, outside of class, and her paper-comments were honest and helpful. Tough grader on papers, but her focus on participation should boost any ""off"" grades.",1
"If you want your assignments to be graded fast, they wont be. You NEED to be able to retain information from reading because half of your grade is based on study guides from the text. He is specific on his quizzes so youll need extensive notes. He seems to know what hes talking about but taking it online is extremely stressful and not worth it.",0
"This is a horrible teacher. She is very unclear about assignments, and hardly replies to emails. I emailed her asking for more clarity on our essay, she never replied. If she doesn't like your writing, she will let you know in the margins. She believes white men are terrible, very melodramatic, seems to be very religious, also against certain races",0
"Tabea is a brilliant instructor. She can be quite intimidating and her syllabus is daunting, but as the term goes along you will  realize that she is super kind and her assignments are manageable. If you show up to class and do what you're responsible for, you'll have a great experience in her class. Dont go on your phone when shes lecturing. Ever.",1
"This is one of the worst professors at Trevecca. He's a great guy outside of the classroom, but he's a joke. He requires you to attend many events OUTSIDE of class for multiple grades including the weekends. He doesn't even know the material he's teaching and will pick a fight when he's in a bad mood. He doesn't seem bad at first. Just wait.",0
"Difficult to understand the lectures, frustrating to work on tedious projects that aren't graded for content (why bother?) A good suggestion would be to use the Blackboard site more, the calender and grade features especially would be helpful.",0
"I have taken Dr. Larson for 3 other classes(all online) . the work that she gives  is with a fair amount of time to  completed and submitted each week. it opens on Monday at 1 am and closes Sunday nights at 11:59pm.   I would recommend taking  her, if you do all the work, you will get an  A or A -. The book is essential since its an online class. ",1
Amazing class ! He is understanding and his class is interesting ! Would recommend. I didnt think I would enjoy it because it was my first semester and politics you know . But I was not disappointed and it ended up being by favorite class lol,1
"Love, loved her. Learned more on my 2 quarts with her than all of HS. hadnt even sat in a class in 5 yrs. Classes and assign were a breeze, aslong as you pay attention and do them.  shes just fun, engaging, has the class participate together, down to earth and has jokes. Loved her in history on films and eng 102. You wont regret her classes.",1
"I was really struggling with my Chicago citations & within one quick email he reviewed my work and made some minor corrections. Doesnt always provide clear criteria for test quizzes which can be frustrating for studying reasons. Overall, if you read the book it corresponds with the slideshow. Learn how to write papers but besides that good teacher",0
"She's really nice, but she'll end up just doing the problems and not explaining much. Even after asking questions she'll do it again. The things on the test can be something taught a day before, also a super harsh grader. Do not take her if you already struggle with math",1
"McCay is just an amazing professor, an amazing PERSON, in general. His lectures are really straightforward and he gets that we have lives outside of class. Super flexible, more than willing to work with you, an easy going morning class, and a super intelligent man. Assignments are super easy. He even said I didnt have to do one for the A. 10/10.",1
"Took professor Nelson on a 6week period for PSY230, best decision ever! She was very sweet and definitely wants you to pass! She is understanding and will answer your emails if you have any questions. 6week summer courses are very fast but she made it so it was not overwhelming! I love how organized she is. Would definitely take her again.",1
"I took 3d Design with him. A genuine guy that loves what he does. Just don't take this class expecting an easy A. His projects make you think analytically and critically, and when it comes time for his infamous critiques, be prepared for criticism. He gives plenty of class time to develop your ideas and is always ready to help if you need him.",1
Travis is awesome so don't judge the class on the first two weeks of class. It gets better I promise. If you are a visual learner or can learn by example then his method of teaching will help you. He does lots of examples and helps with homework during class.,1
"Alicia was a very nice teacher, eccentric and fun. She had lots of neat stories to share however her explanations of important lessons sometimes were lacking. I had up to Spanish 12 before taking 249 and found the class to be easy as well as her marking but for students straight out of 100B I think it would be more difficult.",1
"He is super unclear about what he wants, and the office hour doesn't help at all! The only thing you can learn from is the class note. The lecture is useless. Definitely hard grader. Deduct points with no reason! Ridiculous project at the end of semester that no one knows how to do",0
"Cynthia is a wonderful professor. She is kind, funny and entertaining to listen to during her lectures. There are a lot of short papers due (almost bi-weekly), but they're easy if you do a thorough reading of the handouts. One group pro. at end where you give an oral presentation. Make sure you're clear on HW b/c she can be a little scatter brained",1
"Worst professor yet. Hw and exam is a 400 word personal essay (informal). He reads everything directly out of the book with not explanation. He rambling a lot and gives unclear on essay assignment. He incapable of help you improve ur writing skill. he will noted when you received help even if you went to a tutor, he'll tell you not to do that again",0
"Her readings are extremely boring!!!!! Bring your pillows; she will put you to sleep!!!!!! A Don Quixote groupie, her stupid brownie points are annoying, seriously how old are we? She’s a harsh grader! Avoid taking her!!!!",0
"if you want to understand anything, take a different professor, i had to withdraw from the class because it was so hard and had failed everything, i did well in high school algebra and thought this would be easy, hard to understand and teaches all over the place.",0
"She's a harsh grader and will fail you if you skip too often. I don't feel as though she taught us much about writing or becoming a better writer. She is very liberal and most of her assignments and lectures revolve around society and feminism. Overall, try to find another professor with more experience because her class was very disappointing.",0
supportive and harsh to. you can tell who she likes and who she doesn't. Seomtimes has attitude. Doesn't respond to emails or follow-up on things.,0
She is the worst professor that I have ever had. I was very interested in anthropology until I took her class. I would  suggest taking ATH with a different Professor.,0
"David is extreme boring and unorganized. He makes 9am lectures a snooze fest when all he does is read off of the slides.  His assignments have not been modified since 2009 and his required readings are just way too much. Course is great, the prof not so much",0
"I personally think Heather is a nice person, however isn't a good professor. She makes the test extremely hard and on topics not discussed in class, or in the textbooks or homework. Also, all she does in class is read off the lecture slides and doesn't really help other than that. Overall, as a course with her as the prof. do not recommend.",0
Murtuza is a bro! Always willing to help. Sometimes his handwriting is hard to read on the board and he talks kindof quietly. All you have to do is ASK HIM TO REPEAT and he always will because he genuinely cares. Ask for help during or outside of class and he'll even schedule extra office hours. He had Sat & Sun hours during finals week for us.,1
"Very caring professor, she cares about her students and will always help with questions you have after class or accommodations.",1
"Learn from the book. Didn't buy the finance calculator. He doesn't know how to do the problems without it, so if you can't teach yourself. well good luck. Review is not helpful. He cannot give formulas or extra help unless it is directly from the slides given to him. Why pay for a class when the teacher can't teach?",0
"There is a standard but it doesn't exceed students level. Her expectations are practical and plausible. For those who's says she's tough should go to Wong's(head of dep) class, then you'll know what ""tough"" really is. I took 1102 with another instructor and it was a disaster. I would definitely take her class again if I could. ",1
"While orgo is a very difficult subject to master anyways, Ibrahim made it that much harder. He is not clear what will be on exams and he makes the exams ridiculously hard. Not a single person that I know of is doing well in his class. The only thing that counts for a grade in this class are 4 exams. Lectures mildly help, but the book is your bff.",0
"Almost impossible to understand, hardly ever returns homework, and you are tested before quizzes get returned. Knows his stuff, but he just can't get it to the students effectively. He WILL notice if you miss a class, and you WILL pay the price for it.",0
Took course online for fall 2018. Course had little assignments but tons of reading and 2 papers to complete work. Not sure what to make of it but it required 2 books.,0
"Cool professor! Took him for Comm 30 and very easy to connect with. Do the work and communicate with your groups, he also gives a little prep beforehand so passing the presentations shouldn't be hard. He also gives a couple of small paper assignments and peer evaluations. He lectures are easy to understand, participate and get involved!",1
"I absolutely loved this class! Professor Nelson's lectures were the easiest to pay attention to and very well organized. And he tells you exactly what he wants on tests, quizzes, and papers which is so helpful. Also, he has a great sense of humor which always helps makes things more interesting. Take this class!!!",1
"The only way to learn is through the lectures, which is hard to understand sometimes because of her thick accent. She gives examples that make no sense and are not relate able, and just complains about how most of the class sucks at the material and she cant wait to get rid of us. The material is not overly difficult but she is not good at it.",0
"He truly makes the class more complicated than it should be. If you have to take him, take it online so you can use the book and notes. Don't bother with the powerpoints unless you are really stuck. He's not going to answer your questions, so use practice problems to help. Most assignment questions are based off the ones in his book. He's no help",0
"Absolutely fantastic professor. Very helpful and always willing to help out.  If you're in to photography, you HAVE to take Mr. Spence's class!",1
I absolutely adore Lois. This was Contemporary Political Protest in America and you could tell it is one of her favorite classes to teach. She is not that hard if you pay attention and do the work. She was inspiring! Especially since I took this class fall-11 right as Occupy was causing waves. I am looking forward to taking another class from her.,1
Really knows what he's talking about but much better professor for a higher level class. Tests are really hard and require you memorize the content. Lectures are pretty standard. Knows a lot about research. Definitely stop by his office because it can clarify things that were hard to understand in lecture.,1
"Such a great professor and class.  Her notes are very thorough and easy to follow.  The class is very interesting and will definitely teach you a lot. I wouldn't say it is an easy A, you have to do the work, but if you go to class and actually try there is no reason why you wouldn't get and A. I would highly recommend this class.",1
"Dr. Meche is a good teacher, for sure. It just seems that he expects a lot from his students, & he's a tough grader as well. Participation is definitely mandatory, but his assignments aren't difficult. He also explains how to do all assignments & is very helpful. Participate, complete assignments acc. to directions, ask questions, & you'll be okay.",1
I hated this class when I first started it. The class isnt structured and he's all over the place. I realized later that he really just wants us to become interested in the subject. He is very knowledgeable and I appreciated the class after it ended. I would take another class with him.,1
Jeff is a great guy! He offers alot of help and I had him for PPS so the class was insanely easy to begin with. Do the work and it isnt hard my little sister could probably pass the class but Bryant has to have a intro computer course so take this guy and you'll do fine. The only thing I didn't like was it was at 8am,1
She was a very hard grader. She was vague on what she wanted in her writing assignments. She is bad on staying on topic. As a matter of fact she was rarely on topic. I would very much recommend you find another instructor for the course you plan on taking!,0
"Her lectures are funny but she is a tough grader on the lab quizzes and 2 writing assignments. Assigns more papers than other BIO130L classes, and really need to understand the materials and memorize them before going to class.",1
great teacher n enjoyed,1
"EXTREMELY USELESS. Doesn't get to the point at all. Skips through 10 slides at a time and speaks only about how iPads and iPods are revolutionizing the world. If you get her, SWITCH TO ALEC CRAM. He's much better!",0
"Even if you need to take him for accounting 101 DO NOT. Very nice guy, joking and funny but not a single class I payed attention in and makes a difficult class even more difficult to try and learn. Strictly shows youtube videos that we could look up ourselves",0
Extremely difficult to understand due to her accent. Struggles finding the right words when communicating . The language barrier is by far her biggest weakness. It creates a lack of interest from students because she makes the material much more difficult to understand. Only gives 10 min. of the class before the exam to discuss the review. ,0
"I did more work outside of this class than all of my other classes combined. We had two textbooks. One for our weekly 500-word blogs + two 250-word comments on other people's blogs, and the other textbook for the online tests. Do not think that just because you get to use the textbook the tests are easy. No. Very difficult to take lecture notes.",0
"Dr. Lyall is informative, knows how to reach students, and makes difficult material accessible. The homework is easy and he's very reasonable and approachable. It's great to have a counseling professor who ""walks the talk"". He actually works in this field and what he teaches is based on experience, not just theory. Take his class! He's excellent.",1
Great energy and is a lot fun to have as a professor. Never a dull moment in class esp. when it is a speech day!,1
Not present for a lot of the course.  Students left to figure it out on their own.  Forums not working when an assignments were due.  Discrepancies throughout the course material. Didn't grade most things until the very end of the course. Rude and condescending when contacted about these issues.  Glad this class is over.,0
"Not clear with the syllabus. Does not hand back graded assignments. Skips through power points and says it will be posted on blackboard but never is. Is not willing to listen to students talk in class, kind of speaks over them.",0
"We seriously made a student group chat to try and figure out her assignments. I don't know of a single one who made perfect scores from her. To clarify, I've seriously won an international Scholastic medal for my writing. And still never succeeded in her class. Her prompts are weird, she never grades, she overloads assignments, she's late to upload",0
"Derek Chang is the best professor for any level of calculus. Seek him out for your calculus courses. Tons of homework, and he checks the homework, so don't slack here. Test are long, very long, but fair. Explains everything crystal clear. I wish he was department chair at csula. Derek Chang deserves a best teacher award or something like that. ",1
"Took her for stats, super easy. Makes you do a lot of discussion board posts though, but still not bad. ",1
Excellent lecturer. Very articulate and comprehensible. Would recommend this class.,1
"Dr. Lyons is a really nice prof, and I think she wants students to do well, but doesn't adapt to different learning types. Her tests are way too hard.",0
"I lost interest in the online writing class when the professor didn't show up for classroom  chat sessions. The weekly lessons would get released on different days of the week, so you couldn't get into the flow of the class. I would not take another class with professor Keating if I had other options.",0
This man is a terrible professor. His class is boring. Out of all of the staff in the English Department I had the worst dislike for him. Attendance is a must but that is self explanatory. I took his ENL 369 Gender and Negotiation class. He is unfair with his grading and is not understanding at all. He grades very harsh and low.,0
"worst prof ever. i got 60/61 required outcomes and he gave me a B. this guy is rude, curses all the time, and is straight up mean to all students. dont take him if you cna help it",0
"Teaching a course based off of self-help books is a waste of time. Online quiz, online lecture, loads of reading... busy work with a 45 minute presentation to fill class time.  supposed to be a 2+2 credit course but really it is 4+2 for 3 credits.",0
"A horrible professor that doesn't care whether he is speaking about opinion or facts, he simply combines the two during lectures. He is a boring lecturer that makes multiple gaffes every class and rarely answers a question straight. Avoid taking this class, you will learn nothing.",0
"Professor Ajluni is amazing professor she deserves the world but she really cares about her students and trys to help them in every way possible. When it comes down to lectures please dont leave her hanging, participation in her class is key to understanding the depth of the topic being discussed. Also prepare to be social overall great class!!",1
She's incredibly mean and selfish.,0
She is really sweet and caring. She is strict certain times but that's reasonable. Gave us extra credit at the end. Always easy to get contact. Tries her best to give us all the things we should get for course. Lovable.,1
"Really nice, well-meaning professor, but his English is terrible which makes it really hard.  Unfortunately, he's the only professor that teaches first year college physics.  On the plus side, it's a fairly easy class so getting an A shouldn't be tough.",0
"This is the worst class I have ever taken. The only available Comm 230 section was a 180 student lecture with Cindy White. Worst professor. Attendance is pointless because she goes so off topic and the Powerpoints do not help! Your grade is based off only 3 tests, not leaving you any room for mistakes. All she does it babble.",0
"The worst professor I ever had. I was excited most about this class, but it teaches NOTHING about being a realistic teacher. She gives MULTIPLE large assignments, discussions, and weekly assignments. This is not a class to take if youre full time student. She also isnt approachable.",0
McCay was a good teacher. I am very stupid and I still could kinda understand what he was talking about. the only reason I got a good grade is because every week we had to answer a take home tests and I would stay after class and he would talk me through each question then give me an A on it. so that's how I would go about the tests if I were you.,1
"Professor Brown is a great guy, who shares really funny stories. I really like him! He was helpful during his office hours, but his class was impossible. I worked my butt off, read the book, took lots of notes, and studied for days for his exams. But that still wasn't enough, if it wasn't for him curving, I would be stuck with a C in his class. ",1
Can not explain text in a why that is easily understood. Just repeats the text.,0
"Dr. Bonaccorsi is a great chemistry teacher and knows what shes talking about, shes there to teach students and answer any questions after class, quizzes/exams can be difficult and there is no curve. Top Hat questions during class strongly suggested you should show up.",1
"If I'd known of this site before registering & reviews, wouldn't have taken his class & have the regret. Only way to pass is if you tune everything out to hear him clearly since he mumbles & he could explain an essay prompt w/o you realizing it. Only assigns 400 word paper vs the 1,000 criteria. Learned nothing since he genuinely does not teach.",0
I would recommend her! Very helpful. Explains things very well. In class assignments and homeworks are pretty straight forward. Three exams. The first exam I found difficult just because she has to throw so much at you but the next two are pretty easy. Loved her class! She's passionate at she does and she knows her sports!,1
"She goes through around 12 pages of notes in one class. There tests are hard and there is a lot of ""all of the above"" and ""b and c only"". Unrealistic to memorize all her class notes ALONG with the massive textbook. Hard course especially for a first year. Would not recommend as an option.",0
"Without a doubt one of the worst teachers I have ever had, in one of the worst classes I have ever taken.  She has an extreamly annoying voice, and can't control the volume of it.  She says um at the beginning of almost EVERY sentance.  The worst 2 hours you will ever have to sit through!",0
honestly he is super nice and he tries really hard to keep everyone engaged. He provided a 15 minute break for the class and most of the time ended with a video he wanted us to see. The tests were pretty fair but your screwed if you don't come to class. He asks random questions based on in lecture material.,1
Dr. Boden is passionate about his work but is terribly inconsistent    comes grading. there are grey ares in geology but he still  grades strictly for  100 level course.  to  this   a community college!   not recommend taking this class. it   gpa  killer! hw is  and long. way too much time   a good grade  an elective class.,0
Excellent Professor!!!,1
"She gives quizzes at least once a week. She expects you to read the book and know everything before she teaches. Shes a hard grader and when she says you just need to know the basics, she doesnt really mean it. Theres a lot of material in a short time. Shes strict about attendance and theres no such thing as makeup or late work.",1
Harddddd class. Hardest of the series. If you can make it through this class the other two in the series will be a piece of cake. Don't get on her bad side :),0
She's a great teacher! Extremely easy and doesn't place much emphasis on writing. More so on understanding the topic and analyzing it. Lots of group interaction too.,1
"For someone who has worked in mental health, she sure has a problem practicing what she teaches. She does inteigue students and make them care and even listens to their concerns. But she will also make little comments that she knows will hurt students the most.",0
"Fantastic lab instructor, very good organization and always there to help students.",1
"She offers you extra to retry for quizzes but she not helpful if you don't understand, your midterm and final is what will make the difference in whether you pass or fail her class.  If you don't pass either midterm or final, you're more like to not pass the class.",0
"This was my first time taking accounting and he made it so easy to understand. I would definitely take him again! Class is not mandatory, but his lectures are easy to follow and making learning accounting very straight forward. He is an amazing professor!",1
"This man has driven more students out of ME than all the others put together.  I respect him, but the way you respect a bull when you're in his pasture. Do the homework, ask questions, and if you don't understand, DiBella teaches a night course...",0
"She's your typical feminist lady who was raised during the civil rights movement.  Her study guides are easy and take a max of 2-3 hours a week. You literally don't have to go to the lectures, because she isn't going to teach you anything useful.   She believes citing sources are more important than actual understanding of the material.",0
"Dr. Mueller uses the POGIL method which definitely has its pros and cons. Overall, I would say it works. People complain about wanting just lectures but then just space out don't learn anything from them. I definitely feel like I have retained more info from using POGIL. Dr. Mueller is also a great guy. Will always help you when needed and really c",1
There is an extreme amount of homework in this class. The tests are done in the testing center and they are worth 70 percent of the overall grade.  If you don't understand the material and you don't study you will not pass!,1
"He wasn't very thorough on how to actually solve most of the equations he'd talk about. Also, his examples on how to solve the problems were less than mediocre. He doesn't really put that much effort into his lectures.",0
"Steps to making an A: Take online, DO ALL OF THE HOMEWORK, take the test (grade doesn't matter.) Do whatever you want on the project. I know this is going to sound odd, because it is, the test grades do not matter that much, most of your grade comes from homework. I forgot to do some of mine, drop my grade from an A to a C, had A's on all test. ",0
"Incredibly nice guy, I just found the lectures to be really boring. Depends on how much you like the material. Lenient grader, very approachable, and really smart.",1
"I decided to drop her class after the first half of the first semester. Her class may be ""easy,"" but she is such a boring teacher-she reads straight from her notes. She gets WAY off topic WAY too much. It was rather dull at times, and I don't recommend this class for anyone unless you absolutely LOVE history.",0
"Dr. Mark grades you off of her personal feelings and will not clarify when you ask for reasonings as to why your grade is so low. She is a very boring lecturer and does not respect students when grades are late or if there's a family emergency. She also grades your participation on how she feels you did in class, her personal opinion of you.",0
"If Professor Mason doesn't like your writing style you won't get an A no matter how hard you try. He expects a lot and is rarely available outside of office hours. His tangents do end up on the tests though, so take extensive notes. I've had him twice and I will do anything not to take him again.",0
Dr. Ramey is easily one of my favorite professors at UA and I do not even have an interest in religious studies (class was for my major). He made the subject truly interesting and it was clear he is exceedingly knowledgeable about what he teaches. Class was easy enough but I still got a lot out of it. He will go above and beyond to help students.,1
"He offers feedback on journal entries and short writing assignments. I dont know why I took this class, I hate writing essays. Also dont take him if youre in a different country but if youre east coast youre chilling. Idk why he made it mandatory to attend class but I just had my camera off and slept. Glad its finally over good freaking bye",1
"He is a really nice guy and always willing to help if one has any questions during office hours or in class. BUT he is a horrible professor by nature.Poor guy was just born that way, not his fault. He does set 250pt at C but given his super hard exams its hard to do",0
"All I can say about Professor Thompson is lazy, save yourself time energy and aggravation and take a different class.",0
"awful prof, im so glad my class with him is over and i never have to do another with him ever again, I've never had a prof as bad as him",0
"Just awful. Very condescending, loud, and rude to her students. Outside of class she is very pleasant, but when she is lecturing she is absolutely impossible. Jumps around, yells at her students, makes things unclear. I would absolutely advise not taking this professor if you can avoid it.",0
"This instructor said at the semester start that ""the book is wrong and confusing"" but then often recants that statement and says read ""the book it will help you"" he seems to flip-flop between these statements on a daily basis. He often says ""go to the Marc for help"" but then the next day if it is not the work he taught you than you're out of luck.",0
"Great teacher, good communication",1
One of the most amazing teachers I have ever had in my college career!! I would come back to NGU just to take another class with her!,1
As an anthropology major I was waiting for this class and it did not disappoint. There is a lot of theory but I felt like Carter made it intersting and easy to grasp. One exam and a final project. Only criticism is that graduate students can take the course and sometimes show disrespect in class. I wish Carter would have been more confrontational,1
"I loved her! I took this class as a Mini-mester, and it was super hard.  She expects you to read the chapters!! She teaches the subject matter very clearly, but if you aren't getting the material, she wants you to read the book. She's cool and grades lightly on the exams. Put in the effort and she will notice.  I will definitely take her again.",1
"He is an incredible teacher, very passionate about the topics he teaches. Makes the topics interesting. He is extremely knowledgable. Requires ALOT of homework, reading, and writing. ",1
Do not take this professor under any circumstances. For some reason she believes her students should dedicate most of their time to her class despite it being a Miami plan class for most. The tests are filled with ambiguously worded questions which cause averages in the high 60's and essays are expected throughout the semester. Do not take her.,0
"Fun, Easy, Useful, Great Class",1
Jill is an amazing teacher. She is fun and really encourages students. She is always available for help and lectures are clear and informative. Best teacher in the program!!!,1
Mrs. G knows OB inside and out. If you have her for clinical you are lucky!,1
"Don't as for any help, vague and won't go out of his way to help you.",0
"Bruh, dark souls but no bonfires. Doesn't try to change the direction of the class to help the students but rather just to get on and get paid. Try to avoid at all cost.",0
"Avoid this professor like the plauge. Unclear lecture, unorganized examples in class, constantly is looking stuff up while giving his lecture, and the class is doing so bad that my 72 might end up being an A.",0
His very good i like his classes,1
"She's a busy woman, I've taken her in person class before and loved it. For whatever reason this spring semester, she didn't respond to any students for a few months. She was posting & interacting more on facebook than a class that students pay for. She did eventually apologize but she left us wondering in the dark about our ungraded assignments.",0
Weekly Journal and homework every week usually takes me 3-5 hours each. 5 exam + Final are out of blues range 20-30%. 20 multiple choices worth 3 points each and 2 essay of 20 points each. Some found on Quizlet some found on Teacher's testbank. My first class in Mira Costa with great disappointment for a hard working student. avoid this teacher.,0
not so great teacher.,0
"Seems like a great teacher if you take his class in person. I, however, took his class online and it was not great. He words instructions poorly, his grading expectation is that you photograph your notebook work and submit that instead of using ExploringStatistics or another online module (What?) for homework, & doesn't list test dates in syllabus.",0
"Easy class but prepare to write a lot. Three 5-page papers, weekly discussions, quizzes & a group project. The professor is completely MIA. Does not respond to emails or questions & won't grade anything until the end of class. He took points off my first paper & I made the same mistake on all my papers because he didn't grade until class was over",0
"I'm not sure who said she was a sweet lady because she was rude in my class. You can barely understand her for one thing and she told us we ARENT ALLOWED TO ASK QUESTIONS. There were always issues with the homework, she would say when it's due and then it would be closed long before then and she would refuse to reopen it.",0
Great teacher. She doesn't ask for a lot but she is really big on APA. We had a lot of group projects which is pretty cool. She is very understanding and easy to work with.,1
"I took his class during the pandemic and he made the online lectures so interesting and meaningful. I've never taken Neuroscience before and I loved how he presented the information in a clear, straight-forward, and easy to understand manner. He is also very receptive to student feedback and gave us multiple opportunities for extra credit",1
Stay away if you want to pass,0
"I took Dr. Bowman for arts in contemporary society for the summer, online. Her class has a lot of work for being a 3 credit course but if you stay on top of it youll do fine. I was nervous from reading the reviews but I made an A. She expects you to write well so if writing is not your strong suit, I would not advise taking her.",1
"TAKE HIM. He's super funny and really makes you think about how we handle corrections in america. All quiz points are extra credit so read the chapter before class to get max points! Tests are open note, 1 group presentation, 2 papers about any topic in CJ you want. grades HARD on APA format so beware of that. He makes it hard to NOT pass his class",1
You do not have to show up at all and you can still get an A. Do the online assignments (which he grades easily) and use his study guide for the midterm and final and you will be fine.,1
"Dr. H expects way too much out of you for a gen ed. class.  She touches on topics for a brief period and then expects you to know everything in her mind. She babbles tons in class and is very disorganized with explanations  Do NOT take her class if you can avoid it. Tests are poorly constructed and subjective to ""how she feels"" like grading you.",0
"He is seriously the best proff at UM-Dearborn.  The man is like 70 something, rides his bike to work, and walks in the field for 8 hours/day.  He obviously loves the environment, teaching, and his students.  He is not kidding about the amount of time spent on the notebook but if you do it everyday, you will pass.  Very smart  but not condescending.",1
"The most condescending prof I've had at Carleton. Does not answer questions well and when you ask for clarification he seems as though he is annoyed with you and does not expand on his previous answer. Pray you have a decent TA for this class. I didn't find the course hard, however that doesn't excuse the profs lack of interest in helping students.",0
"Very sweet guy, but I almost died of boredom. On the first day, he told us he repeats himself at least 3 times so that students won't forget the material and he wasn't kidding. Super easy A if you don't mind wading through busy work every week.",0
"This was the worst professor I have ever had !!! She is very condescending, I would NOT recommend her at all. You have to go over modules by yourself and then come to zoom sessions and ask questions, if you need a professor that teaches then dont choose her ! Her mid term had 8 or more answer choices per question!!! WORST PROFESSOR EVER",0
Great class. Professor Dutta went above and beyond. I am not a math person and his Videos really helped me learn the material and pass the course. Always available and helpful.,1
"Mrs. Bisalski is the only professor to teach the BUSA 3301 class though! She is nice and cares about what you have to say. DONT get scared of the syllabus, it is a lot of work.... I MEAN A LOT... but if you do the work ahead of time you will do great in the class! Do the work early (before the due date) and you will succeed!",1
aunave gives easy exams but is hard to understand.  not very helpful and is strict about attendance.  asks for homework randomly which is way lame.  very easy grader though.,0
ENGL 398 proved to be a useful class because of Dr. Parker. He made sure we had ample time to complete our work (offering in class time and extensions depending on the schedule).,1
"Best professor I've had by a long shot. He's very clear and makes sure you understand the material before he moves on. He's always willing to give you extra help outside of class when he's there. If you pay attention and do the homework, the exams are a piece of cake.",1
"I can tell this class isn't going to be hard, just a LOT of work. This course is all self-taught. She provides videos and includes the text pages in the homework on Pearson MyMathLab. She does not do any lectures at all whatsoever. Take advantage of tutoring and what's provided on Pearson. This class requires honorlock for the two exams. Or Zoom.",1
"Dr. Fein is a knowledgeable professor who really wants his students to learn. However, he has very high expectations, and he can be too demanding sometimes.",1
"If you have any interest in studying Political Science, stay away from this professor as she does not teach it. Lois' teaching style is to espouse her own views and belittle yours. Grades are given willy-nilly with contradictory feedback which all but guarantee a stifled learning experience. Steer very clear of this one, fellow students.",0
He loves to talk and share his life'S story. He gets off topic alot so he gets behind alot. He likes to teach about what he thinks and test you on it. He knows what he is talking about. His exams can be tricky but he gives you a study guide that lays out the exam for you. The material was really boring and he grades hard.,0
"I took MGEB02 this summer with him, term tests and exam have so many questions to do every time. If you are not familiar with practice questions he posted, you definitely won't be able to finish the exams within the time limit.",0
If you have any religious opinion keep it to yourself. If you share your views he will target you. He pulled me to the side one day and basically told me if I didnt drop his class then he would fail me. I will never take him again .,0
Literally the WORST teacher I have at the moment. Find someone who will actually teach you and help you.,0
very good prof would recommend. raised GPA but requires work,1
"Today in class this professor threatened a student who was talking out of turn: ""if you keep talking, the next thing you'll get is the clop!"" She did this twice. If you want a teacher who threatens violence to her students, by all means take her class. You should also know that her teaching methods are ancient, outdated, and often ill advised.",0
"No attendance required, no books, no quizzes, no in class exams. Your WHOLE grade is based on your completion of Network Pro cert. No point in going to class he reads word for word off the slides and doesn't share any life experiences with you at all. I went to about 4 classes and got an A. Final is online and taken outside of class.",0
"I took this class online and he had no idea how to use the technology. We went through an entire lecture without being able to see his screen. His exams are extremely difficult and he had to end up curving the entire class. He might be different in a traditional course, but I would never take him online again.",0
If the class is online expect to teach yourself most of the material.. The examples shown in lectures are no where near how hard the exam questions are.,0
A psychologist who'd rather be a biologist.,0
"Dr Larson is an amazing professor. She makes the entire course interesting, you wont want to miss a piece. I took her for two classes back to back and enjoyed every minute of it and learned so much. She is very nice and you can easily talk to her. I would definitely recommend her to everyone.",1
Jerk... I had him over 10 years ago... good to see he hasn't changed. at least he didn't totally kill my love for math (since I'm a math teacher now),0
"Very hard, her tests are nothing like the review and the questions are VERY VERY VERY hard and she goes through the material very fast. Very hard teacher, if you can, please don't take her!",0
"If you get her good luck, she's tough and won't really help you that much. Not understanding at all and is sometimes very rude. Very strict, so strict we had a seating chart in college.",0
"The class is you show up, sit down, and she presents a PowerPoint with the material from the book which is free online and then you do a in class group assignment. I usually hate that kind of setting, but she makes it really interesting and is fun and crazy! If you can't take a joke don't take her class! She is super easy going!!",1
"Dr. Schellhorn is by far he worst professor I've ever had. She says on day 1 that the final exam is going to be incredibly difficult and every semester the average is an F. She also says that she won't curve the course at the end, but not each individual exam. She only curves by 9 points but says that she will curve by a lot more than than.",0
The lectures were actually pointless for this class. MAKE SURE YOU READ THE TEXTBOOK!!! I learned all the stats I know from the textbook not him.,0
"I have scored high 90s and even a 100 on exams but her projects bring your grade down immensely, She's such a tough grader and expects you to do exactly what she wants BUT doesn't tell you what she wants.",0
"I took Konya for Math 7,8, and 15. He is caring, and emphasizes that he is there to help you succeed. He was such an inspiration to me, and is the reason I am now pursuing math further. His test questions are pretty easy and some come straight from the textbook. His grading can be tough but it's helped me improve my solutions to make more sense.",1
"WORST TEACHER EVER! Seriously. I could not understand a word he was saying. He told us to study one thing, then didn't put it on tests. He even put some stuff on the tests that he didn't go over! In fact, he told us not to study one thing, and then put it on the test! I do not recommend this teacher to ANYONE! Stay far away from this teacher.",0
"He talks super low. Offers study guides for exams, however some questions are not what he provides when it comes to the real exam. Drops lowest exam grade. Homework must be done in green books, and are due the day of each exam. He is not that bad, but I would not take his class again.",1
"Great teacher! Very intelligent. The course structure was set up differently than I've every experienced: no tests and minimal papers. Class mostly consisted of group work and debates. Awesome, engaging class. I learned a ton and had fun! Highly recommended.",1
"Awesome professor, twin of Reid Spencer from Criminal Minds. Advisor of more than double the number of students than any other professor. Super class, which makes you understand the material better than a common lectures! He is ""Da Man""!",1
Mrs. Banks is absolutely fabulous!  She has a great presence about her and is clear about her requirements for the course.  She's a fantastic speaker and works hard to convey good information.  The best speech teacher at WVSU!,1
"Fantastic teacher.  Ms. Fox is a very tough teacher, but you will learn a lot from her class.  She responds to emails in a very timely manner and is always willing to help, if you ask.  Hands down the best teacher I have ever had.  If given the opportunity, take her class!",1
"Dr S is the sweetest, but her criteria and wants were a bit confusing sometimes. She's new at Carroll so I can excuse that, and I still highly recommend her. She really makes you think about the injustices in the world and she opens your eyes to. various ways to solve issues. Lots of papers, but theyre relatively easy and interesting. I reccomend.",1
Very unorganized. Does not grade things until the very end of semester. I did not receive a grade on things that were due before spring break until the week before finals. She also gives no feedback on the grade you receive. Announces different directions and due dates than what's listed in syllabus. Very confusing and doesn't respond to questions,0
"I really like Ms. Fox she's tough, & you will have to work for an A. She is really precise about the format of the papers you turn in which I always found to be a good thing. She gives lots of extra credit opportunities & tells you exactly what to fix on your paper to make it better. I would highly recommend her to anyone willing to work hard!",1
"Professor Peter is really kind and considerate of his students. His quizzes and exams are easy if you study,the exam's questions are sometimes verbatim from the exam review. He encourages students to ask questions, and is a great teacher. I did not like the group projects however, they are VERY long, our most recent lab was 11 pages long.",1
"He REALLY likes to ramble about lots of topics that have nothing to do with music. It was a lot of ""talking at you"". I was annoyed and didn't feel prepared for quizzes. I passed them because he posts the actual quiz on D2L for you to study from but really you can just memorize the answers. Hes real political and a ""attack/blame the government"" guy.",0
Do not take a class from this guy. You won't learn anything. The class is poorly organized and  you receive very little instruction. Assignments are vague and learning materials are unhelpful or incomplete. I seriously learned more from YouTube tutorials than this class.,0
Lectures mainly consist of going over slides in class and some demonstrations on computer in programs/commands. Seems to care little for student success. Understandable in lecture but posted documents and assignment descriptions are absolutely awful. Very hard to understand what is being asked of you for many assignments without further questions.,0
"I loved her! Her teaching skills are awesome, if you like a professor that lectures, she isn't for you. She is strictly hands on.",1
Great Professor and great course,1
Dr. Watford was an AWESOME teacher.  He was very interesting and knew what he was talking about.  I enjoyed goin to lecture and his exam reviews were very helpful.  There were no surprises on exams... BEST TEACHER in the Nutrition Dept!!!!!,1
"It would be a great class if she stuck to subjects like, I dont know, German. I dont pay my hard earned money to hear a language professor give her inane comments about the patriarchy and gender discrimination. Other than that the pedagogy is good. This being said, the other GERM instructors are also great so I recommend them to new students.",0
"If you take this class be prepared to drop it in the time allowed before the W. William  is arrogant and rude. He wishes he was at teaching at Harvard but apparently he's not THAT GOOD . His lectures were a waste of time and had nothing to do with the tests. How he still teaches at SRJC is beyond me, I guess no one else wants the job.",0
"Thrasher isn't the worse teacher. Toward the beginning of the semester while discussing prehistory, when a class member asked her what date the Neolithic Age began, she said she didn't know because she doesn't want to learn something that she didn't believe in. I thought that was the most incredibly stupid thing I had ever heard from a professor! ",1
"This professor is absolutely awful, I would not recommend her at all. She tries really hard to sound smart but when she does it just gets confusing. She is very unclear when giving instructions and it is either her way or the highway. She is a hard grader and is not willing to work with you if you need help.",0
Dr. Hart has a vast knowledge on biology. The major DOWNFALL of her is her teaching method. She is very unorganized. She goes all over the place with her lectures and gets distracted very easily. Most of the time she wouldn't even lecture. She would just talk about herself. Then she would squeeze in a TON of information in the last 15-20 minutes.,0
"If you want to learn accounting, you should take her. She drills the material in your head and makes you remember it even after the test. However, there is a lot of homework and quizzes due on the weekend, but those help you so u wont feel surprised on the exam. Put in the work and this class will be knowledgeable and easy. participation matters",1
She prepared me for the bar exam in such a way that I scored in the 96 percentile on the Feb 18 Bar. By far the best professor I had in law school. She ran class in such a way as to create a learning environment without distractions. Her professionalism was unparalleled in comparison with other professors.,0
"Best Prof in CSUN hands down. She'll not only be clear on what she wants, but she will truly prepare you for the world of business. I plan on taking her again for another course. She is down to Earth, funny, honest and really helpful. She will truly LECTURE you on life!",1
"This is way too much for for this class. All he did was move a due date for the pandemic, that's it. No sympathy for what students were going through mentally. I went into the final with an A, and got a B overall. The review sheet and mock exams were pointless. Extra credit was given, but had to work hard for that as well. I would not recommend.",0
"This man definitely deserves 5 stars. He makes statistics really easy and he spends a lot of time reviewing for the exams. He has somewhat of a heavy accent but if you give him a chance you'll be alright. His only rule to pass, is to show up to class. That's important because he goes over everything u need to know",1
"Very difficult class.  He pushed us very very hard.  He was willing to help me whenever I got really stuck, but made me do everything that he thought I could possibly do by myself.  He made me stretch to do my best.  It was frustrating, but I learned a lot.",1
"Be ready to work. Professor Paler will teach you a lot and she is a solid professor. There are times when you will question why there are so many pages of reading (sometimes totaling 100!), but you'll learn how to get through it. This is a class where you put in what you will get out. Paler will reward you fro your hard work.",1
Isabelle was the lab instructor for this course. It was online due to covid. It didn't seem like she was very considerate of the struggles of online learning. Lab assignments took at least a whole day to complete and the information/instructions would be scattered across multiple pdfs and brightspace pages.,0
"THOUGHT THIS CLASS WAS GONNA BE GOOD BECAUSE HE WAS SUCH A NICE AND LAID BACK TEACHER. HE DOESNT RESPOND TO EMAILS AND HE TALKS TOO MUCH DURING LECTURES, MAKING IT UNCLEAR ON WHAT TO STUDY FOR THE CLASS. VERY CONCEITED, TESTS ARE HARD. ITS NOT WORTH THE GEN ED.",0
She is great! She has her own little moments...   But when it turns to grading she is there to help! As many drafts as you want if you want to improve your grade. I've seen a few professors like that! ,1
"Not a good prof...teaches orgo straight from the book and if you don't understand it there, you're screwed.",0
He makes pre-calculus fun to learn. Hes easy to understand and goes at a slow pace which at times can be annoying if you understood the material the first time around. He also gave me 100% on a hmwk I missed just because I went to his office hours and went over some problems.,1
"if u dont get biology, DO NOT take this class with her!  she should not be teaching a class designed for NON bio major people!  she uses biological terms each class which arent in the book. (only bio people would know them) exams are HARD!!!!",0
"Dr. Morgan is a great lab teacher.  He covers exactly what will be covered on the tests, and is always willing to help.  If you put forth the effort, you'll get the grade you want.  Will definitely take him again!",1
Respect him he will respct you on a one to one - very angry with mood swings - He will talk about everything and anything not b/c he is SO intelligent but because the man likes to listen to himself speak and tries to make himself look good.  He makes stuff up!  He thinks he teaches but he doesn't - BOTTOM LINE: DO NOT TAKE HIM,0
"Yifan Li is good as a person, but not so good as a teacher. I got a hard time to understand his leature, which is what the exams are based on. My english is not good, but I can understand all of my other classes. I couldn't take notes because I was not sure what he was talking about for most of time, and these notes can't be found anywhere else.",0
It's one thing to know the world of philosophy and it's another to know pop culture and think it's the path to understanding. Gentry is as shallow and unoriginal as I've ever taken. Very disappointed and wish I could get my money refunded.,0
"It was pretty challenging, but in a good way. You're going to have read allot of material and be ready to talk about it in class. But I learned so much. About allot of different things, and the class was really interesting because so many people participated. She never said your opinion was wrong coz your didn't agree with hers, which was cool.",1
"Very rude, do not take his course if you don't have to.",0
I absolutely LOVED her and the class. She helped give a lot of feedback in and outside of class. She is great at her job and it absolutely shows that she loves what she teaches. She deserves all the love.,1
"I had London last fall and I never knew this website existed until now,  and I am so glad because I feel it is necessary to tell people just how awful this professor was! I have transferred schools because of the poor experience I had with this professor!",0
"Easy class! A lot of homework assignments every week: mini short essays, social media, quizzes, chapter homework, and class participation assignments. There's a mid-term and final, and one major essay that requires to do presentation on it. Teacher is really nice and grades easily. Boring lectures!!",1
"The best professor in pgcc. He knows what he is teaching and he help you reach your goals. He is amazing , he is kind hearted and hilarious. You go to school with no stress. I highly recommend him.",1
"Miranda is so incredible. I've had her for COMM 553/503, and she brings a really unique perspective and style to her classes. Her assignments can range in difficulty, but they're meant to challenge you, and she's very willing to help. She does lag a little with giving grades, but her feedback is excellent. I absolutely recommend her!",1
Would not recommend online course.,0
The person before me is spot on.Caldwell is very interested in the subject. That's it for good qualities.Tough grader.Distant personality. Boring class. Can't read comments on papers so you can't improve your papers...Difficult to track down outside of class. Its a lose/lose. Take someone else for this stupid english req,0
Professor knows her subject. Tests are HARD! Gives opportunities for extra credit - take them because you're going to need it. Do all homework.,0
LOVE HER! Best english teacher I've ever had. She truly turned the classroom into a home. Very motherly and cares about student's interests and encourages students to write essays on what they are passionate about. She assigns diverse readings to engage the whole class and made me think in ways I never thought before. 3 essays and a research paper.,1
Great stories and pretty entertaining. Class is fairly easy and you don't have a book so everything is straight from notes and lectures. He loves talking about study abroad programs and has been to what seems like every country. When he talks about a region he usually has pictures of himself in these locations so it keeps you interested for sure.,1
"Don't Do It! Worst professor I ever had. Powerpoints are hard to understand, he had a heavy accent thats hard to understand in lectures, he wrote the required textbook which is as useful as the powerpoint. he does not explain your questions well and assignments are online however they are hard to do without help.",0
"He will mostly teach his own tool - JDeodrant. The mid-term is 50% of the total grade with no clear instructions at all. Just handed a project which we have to refactor within 3 hours, in addition to explaining reasons on GitHub. The main issue, no guidelines on number of refactoring. He deducted marks for issues his tool itself didn't detect.",0
"For an adjunct. teacher, I really enjoyed her class. This was a law class, so there were no hands on but she makes the topic interesting and fun to listen to. Her quizzes and tests are super easy and she only has 2 or 3 the whole semester. DON'T BE LATE TO CLASS! If you show up to every class and get an A, you don't have to take the final.",1
"She is a great teacher if you have interest in actually learning the language. Alas, if you are taking the class to just fulfill requirements, she is not the prof. you want. She is understanding with your problems, but she is strict when it comes to class. Be prepared for work if you take her.",1
"He didn't do the best explaining projects or understanding students' questions. The grading wasn't too harsh though. Everything taught can be easily learned through the textbook or looking it up online. When there were technical issues for the class or individuals, he was very understanding and helpful.",1
Group projects account for 40% of the total class grade. The first project takes about 2 weeks to finish and is insanely long.  This class isn't hard but has a ton of busy work.  Teacher gives very little feedback and the syllabus is confusing when describing assignments.  Teacher doesn't add to discussion posts at all.,0
"Dr. Hess is a pretty chill instructor, she expects you to participate and be active in class. She goes over historical context to understand the movements and the authors. Test can be difficult, since she picks a random poem or passage from ANYTHING that was read in class. Midterm and final, four response papers, two presentations, and one 8-page. ",1
"The red flag not to take: he wrote the textbook, refers to himself in it many times This course is doable, just a lot of hoops to go through for a 200-level psych course (if it was listed 400 level - ok). The caucasity really shows when he calls tai chi a ""slow motion exercise"" but Wikipedia lists it as martial arts. Sends pass agg emails.",0
She is really great at teaching. If you miss a few classes you need to get notes from someone in your class or you will be lost. She's very understanding and she will try to make sure you understand her lecture before moving foward with the lecture.,1
Lots of pop-up quizzes! Makes math understandable.. TAKE HIM!!!,1
"just dont waste your time, the good reviews are outdated, its time for him to retire, he does not know how to teach an online class. The class feels like a punishment . never answers emails and has always seems like he doesn't know what's going on",0
"His class was a joke, the books he gave in the class were barely used. It was not worth buying them at all.  I would not recommend anyone take his class.",0
"I received 88-95s on every exam, yet even if I get a 100 on the final, I can not get an A in this class. Giant flaw in his grading system. He does not respond to emails. Exams are 95% of the class and homework is completion. He can be funny in class but also very sassy. Homework every night with videos that you are required to watch.",0
good teacher.  tough but fair decent sense of humour,1
This course is just for learning the software. ,0
I really wanted to enjoy this class. Phelps is very opinionated and constantly contradicts what's in the book and DVDs. He is overly critical of the ONE PAGE writing assignments and is known to berade the class before passing out the graded essays. Very disappointed,0
The quizzes were unnecessarily difficult and discouraging. The lecture slides were only a summary and to do well on the exam you were expected to kind of memorize every paragraph of the textbook just in case.,0
"Kindest prof I've ever met and one of the best, but I HATE speeches. BUT she makes the atmosphere so fun and relaxed because she knows this is a stressful class for some. Pretty easy grader and is always ready to help a student with their speech. Creates a supportive environment. Quiz heavy at the beginning of semester but they are open notes.",1
A hard class.,1
Favara is one of my favorite professors ever! She is kind & hilarious! Don't be afraid to speak up in her class because that makes for the most interesting discussions! She chooses a wide variety of texts for us to discuss. By being open minded & putting in the time to read you will definitely succeed in this course! Pay attention to readings!,1
Great person. VERY knowledgeable on the subject matter. she gets a lot of negative feedback but a lot of it is just due to the fact that she tends to teach classes that are just a lot to understand anyway. holds office hours often and is very generous when it comes to getting points back on assignments when you go talk to her.,1
"This was my first class at ASU and it shook me to the core. He is a nice and caring guy but I don't see connections between the lectures and the tests. IF YOU DON'T DO THE READINGS, YOU WILL FAIL THE TESTS. For this class you will a lot of writing and it doesn't get easier. If you form study groups for test then your grade will definitely improve.",0
"A bit intimidating to speak up in class because he will question everything you say, but he seems to genuinely care too. Going to office hours helped.",1
"I say this with sadness because I expected the department of Chemistry in William Paterson University to have somewhat decent instructors, but they do not. Yalan Xing by far puts the cherry on top of the cake. She does not care, to say the least and will fail you regardless of her inabilities of explaining the materials for orgo, DO NOT RECOMMEND!",0
"Its like the class sets you up to FAIL on the TESTS. The lecture material was VAGUE.  What was on the midterm asks for MORE DETAIL than what was lectured. A LOT wasnt even mentioned in the lecture PowerPoints at all! Class mean for the 2 quizzes & the midterm was a 68! Curves class at end, not each individual testquiz. Final is cumulative. ",0
"AMAZING teacher! He really knows his stuff, and his lectures are interesting and thought-provoking. Grade is based entirely on two essay assignments and three exams. The essay assignments are easy, the exams are on the harder side (require very good note-taking). He really wants his students to succeed, and arranges study groups prior to each exam.",1
"Had her as one of my professors during the first semester of the pandemic, she was the only prof i had who did not give extensions on assignments and was not understanding/caring AT ALL to students needs. If you have something personal happening in your life dont expect her to be lenient with you.",0
"Way too text book oriented, not up to date with current trends his knowledge begins and ends with two examples: coca-cola, and Toys-r-us. participation based on arbitrary facts like if you check your email in class, how professional you are, etc. has pop quizzes like elementary school.PHD in consumer behavior so he scrutinizes little details .enjoy",0
"She knows her material, but not how to teach or grade it. She grades on page space filled rather than quality of content with notes and will give normal scantron tests at home with confusing questions on material not covered in class at all.",0
"I has this class blended, so it was 70% online. Quizzes are online and very easy. Projects are in groups, and she's not a tough grader. Easy A and if you mess up you can make it up at some point with the extra credit opportunities. She is also a super nice lady!!",1
"Great teacher! I had him as my micro professor for my 1st term as a freshman. He made the course very durable and easy to understand. Just as a warning, he gives his exams a heavy weight so if you do poorly on one of them your grade might suffer a little bit. However, even still, as long as you pay attention in class & do your hw you will be fine",1
I loved Julie for research! She cares so much about us in the online format and has given us so many opportunities to practice our skills with practice quizzes and activities. She highlights the important information we need to know for tests and has been so sweet.,1
She grades very hard on your writing.  You could be an awesome writer in you whole school career but with her your writing will suck.,0
"This was one of the most difficult classes I have ever taken. His lectures are super engaging but he doesn't stop to review/clarify concepts that might have been forgotten. There are so many lecture quizzes and lab quizzes which can be both beneficial and harmful. His tests are super specific and vague, but it taught me where to focus my studying.",0
Terrible! Completely chaotic class meetings. Discussions are not guided. Most unpleasant class meetings I've experienced. Expectations unclear. Opportunities to excel are few. Just take something else instead.,0
"JP is a perfect example of someone who can't ""do"", so they teach instead. He is totally inept when it comes to software development and loves to tell you what the ""industry"" is doing, when it's not only completely inaccurate but it's laughable, he's never worked a day in his life in the private sector. Avoid, he's hard to understand and childish.",0
The lecture for the day is always influenced by her mood that day.  Pray she had a good night and coffee in the morning.,0
"My favorite teacher of freshman year. Cancels class more than most teachers, tells great stories, is funny and keeps you entertained. Quizzes are really easy.",1
Only a few weeks long so you can't miss any classes. Learn how to write cover letters and resumes so it is useful. She gets you set up with a linkedIn account which can be useful.,1
"Professor Kim is very kind and really tries to help you understand the content to the best of her abilities. Going to class is a must for language development, and the class will become difficult if you don't go. She is very understanding when it comes to late work and the works.",1
"He is very knowledgable about Hawaiian language and wants the students to learn how to speak the way natives speak. You learn a lof of vocab, but each lesson is pretty much the same every day. I personally didn't like that all assignments were turned in online, because there was no follow up on whether it was turned in or not.",1
"Literally one of the worst classes I've ever taken. Very unfair with grading assignments. His standards, requirements, and grading techniques changed based on whatever his mood inspired. Narcissistic, condescending, lacks experience. Contradicts himself often. I do not recommend taking a class with Hass.",0
He loves participation in online discussions. As long as you do the assignments on time youll get an A. He responds to emails quickly. Not a hard class. All the answers to the assignments are in the book and in the learning objectives.,1
the class was ran very well in parts 1st and 2nd half the professor explains what you need for this class form textbook and exams he does games and reviews for exams and extra credit take notes his reviews will help you on your test he makes the class fun and interesting gives good lectures show up and pass and try not to be late,1
Is not attentive to students. She does not answer emails. Grading is straight foward but assignments are beyond confusing. Textbook used is confusing as well. ,0
"Unclear expectations Tough as nails, nitpicky tests ",0
Would avoid this instructor.,0
"One of the hardest classes I've ever taken, and it wasn't even for my major. Do NOT choose to take LAS with her. Like another post on here, I did have a 4.0 but I struggled by to get a C with her. Grading on papers is unfair for freshman level non-English majors.",0
"Must be willing to teach yourself through the online hw's. During he class he does give the questions that could be on the test, otherwise you're on your own. ",1
"She is the best.  Had her for a few classes, she has the most professional demeanor  while being super supportive at the same time.  She explains things very clearly, and if you still don't understand, she is always willing to work with you to make sure you get an explanation that works for you.  Honestly, could not ask for a better teacher.",1
"He is rude and not nice. He chooses which students get certain questions. He chooses who kets easy questtions and who gets difficult ones, especially the annoying dates. He will let you know when he has had enough talking with you. He will also call you out if you email him questions a lot. He is a proffessor, he is suppose to answer them.",0
"Prof. Lang made our 8 pm Earth Science class interesting. He tells a lot of jokes to keep the class woke, alert, and entertained. This ""boring"" class was actually great. He's a great professor. He does everything to help his students earn an A in his class. If you didn't get at least an A- you didn't utilize all the opportunities he made available.",1
"She wasn't clear, and taught based on foundations we were never taught. Her quizzes were tough and she asked for a lot of analysis in class which we were not equipped to do. Her exams were take-home, which was nice, although it meant a lot of work. She didn't answer questions very well. Overall, not the best linguistics professor I've had, by far.",0
"For this specific course, he does not give partial marks, sometimes not at all. This will have a big impact on your exams unless you work extremely hard. He'll help you if you visit his office and tries to help his students, but don't take this specific course with him. Other courses, maybe, but not this one.",0
"Great person, become her friend and it will pay off.",1
"From my experience with Ken, people either love him or don't. He expects effort, and values you consulting him with your project before handing it in. He assigns a lot of work and sometimes it is  overwhelming, but he also asks for feedback about the size of the workloads and changes it up. He's a very decent guy who is good to have on your side.",1
"Knowledgeable in the subject and gives good feedback, takes forever to grade, lectures are boring, not engaging, and almost painful to sit through. the class itself is easy enough though",0
"Professor Nelson is very interesting and intelligent. However, his ECON 202 class was extremely difficult for me. His lectures are quite boring and the class is not mandatory, but HIGHLY recommended to go. If you are not a good test taker then I would NOT recommend his class for you. Your ONLY grade is exams!!! Overall, the WORST class I've taken.",0
Schellhorn is a great option for Fin201. She is very helpful inside and outside the classroom. Her tests are very similar to the study guides she gives you.,1
She doesnt even teach at all. I paid 500 bucks for her to literally send out an article with a discussion and some puny quizzes. Then she gives you a bad grade because she doesnt agree on your opinion. Horrible professor and doesnt accept any late work even if you have a legit excuse. She sets her deadline at 10:00 at night. AVOID MARY LOUIS,0
"I hope that I could give 0 for him. For those who have to take this class, do it wisely. Write your letters clearly, cuz he took points off because you did not write '2' or '5' properly. He also can not read your exam if 'x', 'z', and 'y' is in printed format. Very stubborn , impossible to argue with (about anything). Argue for grade? Take care!",0
"Doesn't really tolerate excuses, even if they're beyond student control, like internet connectivity. Quizzes are okay if you do the readings but lectures are long and boring. During online lecture, a student's mic accidentally turned on and the professor became irrationally angry and waited for the student to explain themselves. Just avoid.",0
"He his a fair marker, his materials are good enough to clear the mid exams,Certainly he is one of the best professor in concordia",1
"I took this professor for psychology of media and she was amazing. The class is real simple, you watch movies and write essays about them and you learn how psychology is displayed in films and different movies. I definitely recommend if you're looking for an easy A!",1
"Easiest class ever. Show up, do the assignments and you'll be golden. And the professor will help you with anything if you ask him.",1
I love professor walker!! I took intro to business with her and it was an easy A for sure but only if you do the work which takes about 10-15 minutes. She allows 2 pages of notes and tells you EXACTLY whats on the test. She takes the time to learn everyone's names and personal life which most professors don't do. TAKE THIS CLASS!,1
Very nice man but hard to learn from.  He goes over how to do something once and then leaves you with problems to do and you need to get it yourself from there.  Makes students work together if someone was absent and makes you look stupid if you ask  questions. Tests have difficult multi-choice and true/false questions.,0
"Ala is amazing! Physics is a hard subject but if you put in the work youll definitely pass! She was always more than willing to help me. Utilize her office hrs! Shes also extremely caring and makes her lectures fun! Take her, you wont regret it!",1
"If you're looking to take an Astronomy course, well then you better keep looking. He's a tough grader and the tests are hard. This is not an easy A, so think again. Hes very strict on attendance as well. If you don't study then you have no shot at passing, and even if you do study, then you better study harder. Go to his office hours, he likes that",0
"Get ready to write down lots and lots and lots of lecture notes, he doesn't make them available online, honestly never seen a teacher do this before, and then he tells us if you don't study the lecture notes you're not gonna pass, also made us buy the book for $80 in the beginning of the year, never used it once",0
"Took him Spring 2020 (pre/during Covid). Very hard to rate him as he was a great lecturer but would go off the rails about things like going to the bathroom during class, or one time where he got mad at a student for trying to leave for a family emergency during class. Seemed very understanding during the transition.",1
"He's not a bad professor but I find his test difficult. I feel as if he should give worksheets for us to study and at least give a study guide for the final exam, not just review in class with us. This class will be difficult for students who isn't majoring in the scientific field or care too much for science.",0
Her class was hard but she was always willing to explain and help. Assignments and exams were returned within 5 days and answered my emails quickly. She provides grading rubrics so I knew what she was expecting. She is really nice and very approachable.,1
"You have to go to lecture, and if you don't, you won't be able to catch up easily. The slides are unorganized, and she throws out too much information without enough time to copy it down// nothing makes sense. She doesn't clarify what she means or elaborate on points either.",1
"She is a tough teacher, makes it harder than it really is. Her test are made to flunk you. Her labs are poorly designed, also uses Physio Ex which is irrelevant to anything we do. Don't take her unless you can remember an entire textbook with powerpoints and useless animal facts.",0
"Very hard to understand. Seemingly doesnt know how to use technology, reads off of slides, and gives little to no instruction for assignments (even exams). Took the joy out of art history and most of my brain cells. Definitely would avoid this prof.",0
Worst professor I've ever had. Had him for Pentateuch and gospels in the same semester. His opinion is always right and if you disagree he will laugh at you. His assignments are ridiculous and he doesn't explain them. I am an A student and I got C's in both classes. He assigns a ridiculous amount of work and acts like his classes are the only ones,0
easiet course ive ever taken.,0
Dr. Blankenship is such a great ENG 111 professor. She is very caring and her grading is very easy. All you have to do is show up to class and do the work she assigns and you will pass. If I ever have to take ENG 112 I will pick her for it.,1
"Lacks a presence on husky ct like other professors, but compensates with his clarity and devotion to the students. He likes to have fun and is a great lecturer. No homework, not necessary to get the textbook, but can help clear up any confusion.",1
"I miss this professor!! he's the fairest professor ever, no ugly attitude, ALL UNDERSTANDING. group talks, he likes your feedback to improve & i respect that. GIVE him a RAISE!! his examples are well explained too so keep your mind opened. he is very cool and his final was optional: if you liked your grade, you didn't need to stress taking it ;D",1
"LOVED her so much! She is very kind, caring, intelligent, and such a sweetheart. The class was never overwhelming. I honestly enjoyed coming to her class. I highly recommend taking her. You will not regret it. This class does require observation hours, please DO NOT put that off and think you have all the time in the world to do it.",1
he is very monotone and has a dry sense of humor the quizes are easy since you can use the book..study and you should be just fine watch out for the curve,0
"Her lab quizzes are always fair and she goes over the procedure and major concepts before each lab. Shell answer any questions you have and makes a morning lab class fun, if possible she will let you out of class early.",1
"Great teacher with a lot of knowledge, at first I was afraid of not passing his class, but he helped me a lot, after so many years I decided to come back to school and finish my degree and Mr. Luckett was a great inspiration person to me, very dedicated to his job in helping us gain knowledge in the social work field. Great professor!",1
"The class is a LOT of busy work, but it's definitely not hard. You just need to show up and do what she says, but be prepared to be treated like a little kid. Her class reminds me of kindergarten.",0
"Great feedback, I'd look forward to reading what he wrote on my papers. Always honest and helpful with his feedback. Great lectures, he has a comprehensive view of the US. If you want to open your mind, then really listen to his lectures and think about them hard. I very much respect this man and the work he's done.",1
Most organized online class I have ever had. This class is so interesting.,1
Took her for in the summer and she's very easy. Lots of hand outs to print out but other than that....4 tests. All essays. 2 take home and 2 in class. Not long or hard. Just ready the articles. Pay attention when she goes over it. She normally tells you where to find the essay answer. Easy. Take her,1
"Her teaching style isnt very helpful at all. All she does is show examples of other artists and past student drawings, and sets up things for you to draw and tells you to draw what you see. She doesnt go in depth with explanations and ive never seen her draw anything. This class is for someone who is already somewhat decent at drawing",0
"Had Rick for 260 as well as an online course - He's never failed to be condescending and rude when asked a question, especially if he thinks the student should know the answer. Doesn't know how to teach the material in his class and gets upset when the entire class performs poorly on an exam that was written like he wanted everyone to fail. Avoid!.",0
"Dr. Day is the WORST professor I've had so far! If you skip lecture, you are guarunteed to loose points because attendance and pop quizzes count toward your grade. Also, he teaches as if everyone has a strong background in coding (despite being an INTRO class). If you don't have experience coding, you will most likely struggle in labs.",0
"This class was very interesting and provided useful information. Professor Galindo is a great instructor. Grade is based on class activity points, four quizzes, midterm, final, two observations, and an adolescent interview. Everything was on Blackboard, except the final. Easy A. Make sure to read the book, attend class, and do those assignments!",1
Very caring and understanding! And also as long as you keep up with the homework and quizzes and discussions you will be fine !!!,1
"good professor but his tests are much harder than others out there.  problems on tests are difficult and advanced as if everyone in the class is upper level finance major.  doesnt explain well - had to teach it to myself.  try to take someone else, but if you get ervin its not the end of the world.  problem is you need C to get credit - hard to do.",1
"Dr. SASS is amazing. Her class is easy as long as you do the readings. She doesn't do exams but has in class (open note) short essays and does oral quizzes. The quizzes aren't hard. She'll call on you for an answer, which come right out of the book, and she never tries to trick you with questions. Jokes around in class Absolutely loved her.",1
"Mrs. Peters is a well organized teacher and is always prepared for class but her teaching methods are horrible. She teaches everything the long way. Alot of our class had issues with her method of teaching. Not very helpful when a question is asked, always gives general answers. Very sarcastic attitude. Not very helpful. Would not recommend her!",0
"I have never had such a terrible professor in my entire college career. I submitted every paper, took every exam, and only missed about 3 classes and I still failed the course. I went to her before every one of my papers were due, for help, and still failed every paper. If you do not agree with her personal beliefs she will fail you!!",0
She assignments are quite hard but she lets you re-do them. If you email her your assignemnts ahead of time she'll give you amazing feedback. You can't fail her class unless you don't put any effort into it. Anyone in the Science program I recommend her course. She's extremely sweet and helpful!,1
"Isn't clear in directions and blames students when they don't know what to do. I passed this class but worked harder than ever, not because he was tough on me, because he doesn't know what he wants. In my opinion, you should only need to get help from TAs and GAs if you are struggling, it should not be an essential part of passing.",0
Lectures twice a week that were recordings. quiz once a week. I miss the majority of them because there was no actual class. She gave a poll todo class via recordings or zoom (videos won) if It were via zoom would have done better in the class. If you can do videos online for lectures this class is an easy a but for me don't know yet.,1
"May seem like a tough class at the start and his teaching style might catch you off guard, but you just gotta actually do the work and read the book! Up until this class, I was skating by giving about 60 percent, but here you gotta give 100, and the Dr. will be more than fair with you if you're honestly trying and STUDYING. Great night course prof.",1
"A very nice person, but grades assignments very toughly (does not give you clear expectations). Does not help to prepare you for the labs very well and does not go over the theory behind labs of previous weeks, you would need to visit her during her office hours in order to get the help you want/need.",1
She us rude and needs to get over herself. And her techniques are outdated,0
"Typical lefty professor who believes things like the Soviet Union wasn't real communism and real communism has never been tried and believes the NRA is a terrorist organization. Also speaks of Obama like he was the return of Christ but, if you're able to regurgitate her beliefs onto a piece of paper 3 times a semester you will pass easily.",1
Mr. I helped me become a better public speaker as well as gaining more confidence when it came to any type of speaking.,1
"Very nice person BUT he doesn't know how to teach. He expects everyone to everything, and when you ask him a question he makes you feel stupid. He is so hard to understand, and his handwriting looks like chicken scratch.Doesn't use useful technology, not clear, can't convey what he's really trying to say...stay away from him! there are better profs",0
"In order to pass the class, you have to be present for the lectures and labs. You cannot pass this class without studying. Dr. Nivi is a bit hard to communicate with, but if you talk to her she is more than willing to work with you to the best of her ability.",1
Professor Liao is good but he goes a little too quick. Expects you to know your Math125 when you come in. Does not explain step by step but if you ask he'll come up to you and explain until you understand. Homework is due on the day of the test. Test questions are easier than homework ones. Drops one test. Will provide formulas in exams.,1
WORST PROFESSOR I HAVE TAKEN. materials he teaches doesn't make sense.,0
"I enjoyed lectures, even though they were sometimes boring. This professor is a tough grader and the material isn't easy, but he is really good at teaching.",1
"She is very unclear in lectures. She doesn't use blackboard at all and if you want to know your grade you have to go into her office with her to calculate it. Email her, she probably won't reply. As if she's against technology. The textbook will really be your lifesaver as well as the online study modules and Pearson homework. Drops lowest quiz.",0
One of the coolest and most helpful professors I've ever had.,1
"Easy A, great easy going prof. He even hangs out with students and hears all their complains. He is very supportive and helps you improve your grade by talking to your profs. Very nice person, he is always in his office, so if you want to learn and get grades, make sure you see him every week in his office - he or Gaby are there for you to help.",0
"Take him if and only if you really want to get knowledge. Its not an easy A class. Instead of answering a ? directly, hell talk abt all stuffs related to that topic. The study guide n hw are useless cause theyare from the department, not for his class. Use practice problems n mock ex + pay attention on what he says to be important.",1
"Hard to follow.  Really nice person, but jumps around a lot.  Not great at explaining things.",0
"She helped with all of my assignments and checked everything before I turned them in. I had an A throughout the entire quarter. At the very end of the course she went into the system and changed all of my grades to failing. I emailed her and she accused me of plagiarism. When I reported her, she failed me, but I was still passing. Discrimination.",0
"Avoid if possible, unhelpful and beyond arrogant, very vague with everything in my opinion.",0
"I took Buddhism with him. He gave two exams plus the final. The exams cover multiple chapters and readings, but only include 10 random definitions and two essays. Most of his lectures are irrelevant to the exams and you don't really know what to study. He also assigns two 7 page papers so if you don't like writing don't take it.",0
Mr. I is a great professor! His lectures are really inspirational. Makes class fun.,1
"I hated this class so much, I withdrew. I have never withdrawn from a class before. He did the same thing every class- talked in his boring, single paced voice from start to finish. I took notes all class, every class. I would read the chapters and go over by notes and still fail. He was a tough grader & very specific about ONE PAGE papers.",0
"Sociology 16 was a breeze. Much of the material was informative and intuitive. The class atmosphere was okay. The class projects / presentations were easy, not a big deal. This is a college class. Caveat - if you don't study from the book, you'll most likely receive an C on the exams. Buddy-up with someone and you'll do fine",1
"I was nervous about having him b/c of negative comments from students. But he's actually a fair professor, being if you want to pass his class you won't be trick with materials outside of the class. He'll tell you what's on the exam. He's clear when explaining anything you don't understand. AWESOME PROOFS PROFESSOR EVER!!!",1
Heard from a couple of classmates that she can be kinda rude. Tests are filled with trick questions but you often won't have enough time to catch them. It's only lectures and readings. Not the worst class but not engaging at all.,0
The class was split in three parts or times in literature. We were tested at the end of each part. As long as you read and participated in discussion you will pass. exams consit of object exam and written essay exam.  The end of the class a research paper will be due. You have about two weeks to complete. Teacher replies to emails within a day.,1
"For the sake of your gpa and wanting to graduate on time DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR! He's one of the worst professors I have ever had. I've never failed a class before him. If you take him, good luck.",0
"Wonderful person, but horrible teacher. Does not actually lecture, but she will play video upon video. She does not teach. Her tests are ridiculously hard and are all short answer/essay. The first test was 32 short answer/essay questions!!!! You will have to teach yourself AND finish the ridiculous repetitive and useless online biology homework.",0
"Excellent Teacher!  Very enthusiastic about teaching.  Exams are tough...mostly application questions. Understand the concepts you are reading in the book, don't just memorize.  The class moves at a very fast pace. Plan to spend at least 12 hours a week studying.",1
"Dr.Hill is a terrible professor. This class was extremely difficult, and rather useless considering it 100% filled with pre-health professional students who do not care to study ecology. Exams were very unfair and graded even more unfairly. Professor is stubborn and does not even reply to emails. Try to take the class online!!!",0
"Honestly, I really did not like this class. It was an unnecessary amount of homework. Proof assignments were tough and took a lot of time to complete. This class felt like a session A but for the entire semester. I took this the same semester as MAT300 and I actually preferred MAT300. The only good thing is that the exams were pretty easy.",1
On the first day he said half the class would drop by the middle of the term.. he was right. If he knows half will drop he should make a change so that doesn't happen. Not a good teacher and wouldn't recommend!,0
"Ok so idk about the person under me, but  I'm taking it right now and Mr K is a great guy. You can tell he's passionate about art just by the way he talks about it and makes his sounds. He takes the time to  go around and physically correct your drawing if needed. Its a complete joy to take his class. If you dont take it serious, you wont do well.",1
He is amazing. Honestly. Yes he's tough because he expects you to work for your grade. This is college. Honestly I'm a lazy student but this subject is just so interesting. I changed my major because of him. He is so inspiring and thoughtful. His three hour lectures make me pay attention because of how interesting they are. But be prepared to READ!,1
"He knows his stuff. Attendance is not mandatory, but very necessary, and so is the reading. He is fun, but don't underestimate the difficulty of his tests (Especially if you don't attend/read!). Missing even one class is brutal. Not recommended for slackers.",1
Amazing instructor! Very enthusiastic and took the time for study groups outside of class. I wish he taught every subject.,1
Mr. Blake is a very caring and helpful professor. He is more than willing to take the time to help you with school work and is also good to talk to if you have trouble with any life problem. Mr. Blake is awesome!,1
Dr. C is the G.O.A.T,1
Not sure why there are so many positive reviews. Your grade is entirely dependent on difficult tests which are hard to prepare for because of the way that he taught. I would definitely avoid taking an honors course with him.,0
"Prof Krishnan's class was incredible (averages of 80% on midterms), until we got to second order differentials. He had to do some lectures twice because he got so many questions, and no one i talked to got it. Unfortunately, I have to actually apply ODE's in my major, so thats a big problem for me. Final was brutal, I went from a solid A to a B-.",0
"I enjoyed taking this class with him - even if we did run behind with the syllabus, it wasn't expected that we know something that we ended up not having time to delve into. He is super knowledgable & open to learning from his students, too. The class was super engaging and I LOVED the discussions. If I had any complaint, it was the students lol",1
"Awful professor. Only talks politics in a physics class. Quiz after every class, most of which are completely unrelated to physics. Big waste of tuition money.",0
"I did not like Professor Smith. Her lectures were extremely long with obnoxious background music and lost my attention. She brought her personal political views into HISTORY lectures multiple times, but she does communicate with students well. She knows when students are most likely sharing answers. Stay on top of the work, and you will do great.",0
"is making an effort now, but her way of interacting with the class at the beginning of the term was very negative. I like the material but i'd suggest not to take this course as an elective, you won't get a good mark with this prof",0
"hello everyone don't take her class it's big mistake laguardia is doing big mistake to keeping her here and letting her teach psychology classes , she have attitude problem .",0
Don't take it,0
"Dr. Luttrell is very nice, but his method of ""teaching"" is just reading through powerpoint slides. You can skip class and read through everything on your own and understand it just as well. One good thing about his class is that he curves all exams to 75%.",0
"Take anyone else for writing composition. I didn't enjoy this professor's lack of respect towards her students. Tough grader, have to go to class or you'll fail, pushes agenda on students, just don't take her.",0
"Took immunology with him; hes a smart guy and really knows his stuff, but the material was hard to comprehend and he couldnt explain it in a way that would make sense. Tried to teach myself , but no luck. Im usually an A student, but ended up with a C+ (NO ONE GOT AN A THAT SEMESTER) without a curve. Hardest class Ive ever had. Avoid.",1
"He lectures by writing on a chalk board and that's it. He cracks jokes but they are not funny. You cannot write on his test or he will take 5 points off, a couple test were 30mins for 50 questions. He was teaching the bones in the hand wrong. I dropped his class this semester, class averages on his test range from 47% to 59%. HORRIBLE INSTRUCTOR!!!",0
Great professor. Never be late,1
"a great instructor, remember her stories, they show up again",1
"Pretty bad at teaching. At first I thought it was her first time teaching or maybe its the first time in this subject. However she has a PhD, MBA, and a MEd. I don't recommend her for this class. She knows her stuff and is probably good for other courses.",0
"It would have been a good class if she had given feedback. Grades were not posted - not in 48 hours, not in 3 weeks. Emails go unanswered, questions are left hanging. Even emailing several times doesn't help. It sounds as if she is a good teacher in the classroom, maybe. Online, not so much. I would not recommend anyone taking this class online.",0
I was told by Mike that I should consider changing my major and he was insanely harsh in his grading. He never encouraged me or worked with me and everything I did was wrong. Ive had 3000+ level classes that were easier.,0
"Many dislike Serocki, but I actually enjoyed his humor and overall character. However, his lectures are power point based. He doesn't read slides word for word, but he just skims them stream of consciousness style because he knows everything. Numerical examples are few and far between. HW optional. Not the worst tax class you can take I think.",0
Goes through slides way too fast for those of us that don't think in math. Comes across arrogant - isn't approachable. Doesn't triangulate book's explanation (especially at the end of the course when he's the author). Expects you to learn software ~and~ scripting/formatting software on your own WHILE learning the actual course.,0
"Dr. Hermann is a very nice man, but I would not recommend taking his class if you have the option.  The class is very boring, which I did not expect out of an English class.  It's like an English class taught for a math student. There was a lot of work randomly piled on throughout the semester, and several due dates at the same time unnecessarily.",1
"I took her online class and it was like we didn't even HAVE a teacher. She assigned the homework. Never really helped or returned emails. While she was teaching the class she graded maybe four assignments. (She just gave us all full points for turning them in.) Unless you like to learn straight from the book, don't take her; she's an awful teacher.",0
"She is a horrible professor, absolutely horrible. She tells you-you're doing something wrong and will tell you how bad something embarrasses you in front of the class and not even help you to do better. She always brags about how much experience she has yet it doesn't show. I have never met a professor that almost every student has a problem with.",0
"Professor Jacobo provides studentsclients NEGATIVE ENERGY. Read ahead and don't procrastinate. Your educating yourself with this professor, because she provides zero support.",0
"Great Professor! If you like philosophy you should definitely take one of his advanced courses. Brilliant guy and lots of in class discussion. He left 2 long take home tests, but he is a fair grader. Doing the readings will definitely help, but if you pay attention in class they're not necessary.",1
"I found this instructor to be infuriating! Her personality & teaching techniques leave a lot to be desired. She does not take into consideration that most students taking DE math are generally not good with math to begin with & she offers them no assistance or encouragement. In addition, the amount of homework & quizzes for her class is ridiculous.",0
this teacher is so disorganized. He was always all over the place for every lecture. Obviously smart and guy and has hundreds of students but dude needs to get his ish together,0
Good prof,1
"Any attempt to be personable with her goes ignored. Assigns more than other lab professors without taking into account the added time they take. Exams are set up by assigning a random animal and applying concepts to that specific animal. Which in theory sounds great, but she gives you no direction or resources on what she expects, hard to succeed",0
The class was overall easy do to the fact that the test review she gives before each test were a carbon copy of the test with just different number/variables. Homework was also easy but it can take lots of time to do. She came to class late numerous times and at time it seems like she didnt really care. Her teaching was also confusing most times.,0
"She treats the class like elementary schoolers. If anyone says two words, she stops and says ""is my teaching interrupting your conversation?""  Doesn't give a lot of guidelines for the paper.It's just ""Write a critique about whatever you want:a book,a movie,a magazine,a restaurant,a video game, etc."" She is aslo nit-picky about punctuation on papers",0
"By far the worst professor I have had online. She was never understanding about anything. WAY too much reading and studying for each exam. There was too little of a time frame when taking exams, causing me to fail. My emails were never responded to right away, and when they were it seemed she gave ignorant response. I would not take this course!",0
"Would not recommend this instructor. Very unorganized, it takes him forever to return exams. He seems too busy with outside life",0
She is the WORST Professor that I have ever had. She sat and read off of the slides. She treats her students like they are little children. She also does not care how you do in the class at all.,0
Avoid. You will lose interest in the course on the first day. Cannot present information effectively and always gives off the impression that he does not have a clue about what he is talking about. Does not belong teaching an upper level course. Attendance is mandatory with a sign in sheet. Tests are fill in the blank with word banks. Avoid.,0
"The class and I did not get along. I found the professor to be somewhat rude and uncaring. The course material was taught in a way that made it hard to balance his workload with other courses. Some of the readings (which there are a lot of) are lengthy and boring. Don't get me wrong- some of it was interesting, but wouldn't recommend the course.",0
Professor Brandt delivers his curriculum with humor; and he makes governemnt interests with current topics that can relate to the lectures.  He is my favorite professor this year.,1
"I did not enjoy the class, not relevant course material for a 4th business class. I felt like he spent more time guilt tripping the class about things versus teaching us something of value.",0
"He is a very ""pro"" and nice professor. He knows the material very well. But he is a little lacking on explanation. A few of the material he covered are a little unclear. May be I suck at it. His assignments are hard and it gets you to think. He really challenges you to think about CS deeply. His exams are pretty challenging.",1
"She is a great professor. Get ready to read, do your works on time and pay attention in class you will get A. she cares about her students and helps them to do well and provides feedback to improve.",1
"Dr. Tops has taken over EGRE 206 and its an improvement from previous professors. Hes very interesting, you wont be bored. But time can be spent more so going over concepts than doing practice problems when in a class like this practice problems help the most. TAs can grade harsh and somewhat unfair, but will give points back. Good class overall",1
"I had Owen for UF 100 for Food Chemistry. Easy class , very interesting and he is excited to teach! We had a midterm and a final which were worth a lot of points, but it was super easy because he teaches you everything! There are iclicker questions which helps you get extra points. He has extra credit opportunities. Take him!!",1
he didn't teach us anything he just talked at us for an hr and gave us 30 hw problems a week. Test were weighed really heavily too so if you did poorly on the mid term you were screwed.,0
"One of the easiest engineering classes ive taken and will ever take. Exams were easy enough to just study a night before or 2 nights before class didn't even feel like it was on my schedule except for lab which was painful to attend because of how much time would be wasted. Her teaching style was just doing examples, much better than power points.",1
"Like another review stated, there are very few assignments and no interaction with the professor whatsoever. When submitting assignments, it takes weeks to receive your grade and same goes when you send an email to the professor. I had not missed one assignment but received an A- due to getting a 19/20 on an exam even w/ 100/100 hw points.",0
"I had her for basic skills and concepts of music. While she was a very nice professor, the subject was very difficult to understand for someone with no prior experience. She understood that a lot of us had no idea what we were doing, but couldn't dumb it down and further. She is VERY helpful and offers retests. Very nice lady.",1
"Get as much time necessary with this professor when writing your memos--midterm memorandum included.  She is not sympathetic and she is redundant as much as she is ambiguous.  The class is boring, but follow the text book to a ""T"" and you should be fine.",0
"Honestly, not as terrible as everyone says. She is an awful lecturer and makes the material dry, but if you show up to every lecture, take pictures of the images that she omits in her lecture notes, and have good memorization skills then you're fine. Easy A for science (biology) majors. The tests are a lot of writing, so you can BS a lot of it.",0
"Speaks far too much in class, making it almost impossible to understand what information is necessary to know. Although he makes small talk by referencing his love of comic book heroes, he hardly stimulates the class to think critically. Far too much outside learning had to be done after his lectures to decipher his notes. Would not take again.",0
Such a good professor! As long as you participated in class and put in effort on the assignments you got an A. He was super awesome as a person too and really cares about his students. Moved deadlines if students were really overwhelmed with with other classes. Super approachable!,1
"Amy has by far been my favorite teacher this quarter! The only thing I didn't like was having scheduled meetings online, but an easy 10 points, show up, participate, and you're good. Lots of great info! I love everything I learned amazing class! I highly recommend her! Lots of movies, but you have all quarter to prep for them.",1
"Great prof who is passionate about teaching. If you ask a question after class, be sure that you have time for the answer b/c she will talk for days. Nice, approachable, smart and fair, exactly what I hope for in profs. Her exam is moderate and if you kept up all semester, you shouldnt have too much of an issue doing well. Do the reading!",1
"She is a horrible instructor. She ""acts"" like she doesn't understand you when you sign, and make you do it over and over again. She is the worst ASL teacher at Mesa. She says the students are below what ASL 4 students should be at and says the other ASL teacher are not doing their job. Take some one else!!",0
"Not a bad professor, he mostly just reads from slides, gives homework fairly often but it doesnt take that long to finish it. TA's never graded anything on time which made studying mostly last minute. The exams are pretty tough, but his grading is fair, will give lots of partial credit.",1
"Class was ok. Had an option to complete a certain # out of total assignments. Was always pushing deadlines back. He did tell me it was ok to take on a topic that has yet to be researched, went thru ideas for the paper, told me i needed to find research on it on graded last edit? that was a bit annoying. Nice guy. not very interesting. dont avoid",1
"First off, this class is not hard at all. It is a very easy A even if you miss class often. However, Ms. Con is very hard to understand and is very boring which makes this class seem difficult even though it's not. If you take her, just make sure you attend class when you have in-class work, do your homework, and study and you will do fine.",0
"This professor was the worst professor ever! He doesn't grade anything until two or three days before the withdraw date. He creates study guides with answer sheets AND DOESN'T ANSWER THEM CORRECTLY and if you use that answer on the test , he marks it wrong. So unorganized, rude, gives tests that have the hardest problems! DONT TAKE HIM!!!",0
"Dr. Bachman is a good professor who explains concepts clearly. I don't know what some people are in here talking about him being rude or impatient with students. Many people in my class (including me) asked very stupid questions and he was patient with all of us and tried his best to answer him. Your grade is just three tests, but they are easy",1
"Most pointless lectures ever. He ranted once that it is our fault for failing if we have jobs/kids. We were graded by 3 tests, meaning the final could be worth 70%. He kept delaying material because he thought it was too much for one test, and yet saved ALL reactions for the LAST WEEK and that made up 100% of the final. I have nightmares.",0
He is the toughest grader I have ever taken. He gives a lot of homework and is really tough on the specific details required in your answer. He is the hardest teacher I have taken. There is a lot of drawings and answering questions.,0
"Professor Sanchez is great and truly cares about her students. However, this class has a lot of homework that is due by every class. She is lenient and lets you hand it in late but honestly there is way to much especially if you have other hard classes to focus on. There are 3 online exams. Make sure you go to class participation definitely helps.",1
"McConnell is a great philosophy professor. If you're looking for advice on how to write a better English paper, this isn't your guy. If you want to write better about philosophy, then sign up. He gives a lot of prompts based on great movies like Memento or Groundhog Day. Exploring the philosophy of my favorite movies in essays was a great time.",1
She likes to talk about her family and baseball more than accounting. I only took her again because I know what to expect from her. I've been in 2401 for a week and we haven't had any actual teaching yet. Can't wait for December.,0
Great instructor.  Wonderful understanding man.  Class was a thrill to attend and he made everything easy to understand and use.  Taking his 122 course. He is very passionate about math.,1
"Take this course online. I took the class in person and it was really boring. The class is extremely easy as long as you do the assignments on time. She gives you an unlimited number of attempts on the assignments, so there is no reason to get a bad grade. If you do take this class in person, be prepared to sit through a lot of Power Points!",1
Professor Kim is very hard to understand during his lectures. He doesnt slow down if you dont understand and is never in his office during office hours. He will make sure that you pass if you want to. He is a brilliant guy but not a very good teacher.,0
Terrible and deleted my last rating.,0
"Compared to all the other physics professors that I have heard about, Oks sounds like a saint. He really was a good professor. he gave decent lectures and would answer any questions students had. Would do some demos to make lecture more interesting. Tests were multiple choice and open book, so a little challenging there. You get what you work for!",1
"He REALLY cares about his students and will go to great lengths to make sure everyone is succeeding. Super funny/comical and honest/genuine. Writing is horrible, and he didn't always explain what seemed obvious to him but was confusing to the class, so make sure to ask lots of qs. Key is to just do a lot of practice. Overall, great prof!",1
Anderson is my favorite teacher ever! I had never taken a Calculus class before I took her and I came out with an A. She made calculus fun!,1
One of the best professors here at LBCC! Definitely recommend taking him!,1
grades too hard,0
"I loved Prof. McArdle. SUCH a funny and sweet guy, and he really cares about your wellbeing. He wants you to get an A and he'll do anything he can to help you get there. Super understanding with any out-of-class issues you may have going on. 100% recommend!",1
"Dr. Ryner is scary smart. He thinks like no one else I have ever met, and I mean that in a good way! He is probably one of the most intriguing and kind professors at ASU. Admittedly, the theory he introduces can be hard to grasp at first, and his papers, while short, are still rather hard. However, it's worth it. Also, he's always there to help!",1
she is really all over the place when lecturing. notes are hard to take and hard to understand because she goes so fast. I had to find a lot of outside help in this class. she is pretty good about extra credit and letting you turn things in whenever you want though.,0
"She is a cool professor, her lectures are very interesting and she definitely knows what she is talking about. Hardly gives homework and when she does is very easy. Do recommend taking her",1
"The nicest woman you'll ever meet. She cares so deeply for her students that you won't want to leave her class. She has only a handful of tests and they are super simple and straightforward, but don't take advantage of that. She works hard for her students to help them learn. Participate in discussions b/c it makes the class more enjoyable!",1
"Online class, she did a horrible job at teaching the material and when asked for guidance she tells students try not to overthink it or read the book again instead of helping you understand. DO NOT TAKE HER. She also made us write a 10-12 page paper and it ended up being only a completion grade.",0
".Not a lot of feedback, she doesn't like to get emails by students. It is really hard to get good grade own this class. However, I have learned a lot of things fro her! She is organized and clear how to teach. DEFINITELY, HARD GRADER!! DONT TAKE HER CLASS IF YOU WANT TO PASS EASILY!",0
"It sounds like a certain student just needed a lot of hand holding and is angry it wasn't handed to her. If the program is so flawed, why are the majority of students doing excellent. Be an adult, take responsibility for your own failure, don't blame the program. Prof Waller has been nothing but helpful to me btw",1
"By far the worst professor I have had in my 4 years of college. From the first week, students switched out of her class to another section with a different professor. Avoid her at all costs. Her grading is completely arbitrary and her lectures are just awful. Youre better off teaching Soil Science yourself!",0
"While the class may have been hard, he did a great job teaching it. He tried to get the class involved in discussions all the time.",1
"Amazing calculus teacher. Honestly, you couldn't hope for a better one. She's enthusiastic about the content, accessible for extra help, and clear and concise during lecture. The only thing that I thought was funny was that she put a lot of emphasis on the correct use of symbols and names when grading.",1
"She was very nice, gave a couple days off, as long as you do the assignment with proper instruction you will be fine!",1
"100 level course, yet we were asked to write 3 page papers weekly.  Course load is heavy, but then the midterm and final are the only time the text book was actually used in the class.  Graded strictly on grammar, and marked down for things that were direct quotes from citations.  I'm now in a 200 level writing course that requires less.",0
"Misurda has the style of teaching being, ""You're on your own"". His lectures are very dry and hard to convey sometimes. For 5 weeks he did his 'slides' on a piece of paper where students would follow and copy notes. Come exam time, he doesn't have them. The class average for that exam was a 60 and our second midterm exam average was a 58. Dont recco",0
"there are about 7 short assignments (1-2 pages) you don't need the textbook, you don't need to pay attention in class, just clicker points, a 5-7 page paper at the end. EASIEST WRITING CLASS EVER",1
nice dude,1
This class is impossible. The papers are are really hard.,0
Gives good lectures but very opinionated and doesn't really open her mind to student's perspectives. Memorize her opinions on topics in order to do well in the class and on the exams. She is kinda rude and detached from students. She is also a really tough grader and multiple people in my class including myself said she didn't grade fairly.,0
"He's a cool guy, but you have to participate a lot in class for him to really like you. This isn't a problem for me since I've had him before and am comfortable around him, but he makes shy students work for it. He also tends to go off on tangents about his family and personal life, and his stories are always amusing. Take his class!",1
Taking him for fall semester at lbcc. Math 115 class which is a new class that is equivalent to math 130 ! And he is the worst math teacher  ever!!!!! He goes off subjeCT 85% of the time test are worrh50% of your grade! Study guides are a little helpful!  Not good at explaining problemsAT ALL its best to teach yourself or use mathlab  dont take him,0
Do not take his class! You will regret it. ,0
Just had her for health care ethics- one of my new favorite professors at loyola. she knows what she's talking about and easily one of the best lecturers at loyola....take her- it's such a great class!!,1
Hard but really informed professor.,1
"I had high expectations for her, because she seemed like a very nice person. However, she's lazy when it comes to her lectures, and grades harshly. She curves significantly, but does not make it easy to do well. Sadly, she's the only biochemistry teacher. Be ready to use outside resources for learning...",0
Wonderful teacher. Very easy online course. Turn everything in on time. Follow his formulas and tips on becoming a better writer. He will respond to your emails and answer your questions thoroughly. You will get an easy A. I am delighted to have been taught by such a quality professor.,1
"I thoroughly enjoyed her innovative way of teaching! This is just a GE class, but I learned SO much about about myself as a human being, and felt empowered by the things she taught me about myself through the coursework. There were 3 main projects, all of which allow you to thrive outside the classroom. Show up for yourself, and you will do well!",1
"She's very young which means two things: one, she likes to have fun in her classes and frequently opens the floor for class discussion or personal stories. Two, she's a hard grader. Younger teachers tend to stick to the book, and she does more so than other professors. This is likely because she wants to demand respect outside of her gorgeous looks",1
"Brother Miller is an awesome teacher. He really cares about the students, and despite his limited office hours (he also teaches at UVU), was often there for students when they needed feedback on assignments. Show up to class & you'll do well on quizzes and assignments. Learned a lot. Not a fan of the oral presentations though, ha.",1
"In 1 week, you take notes on written/video lectures, do 1 quiz, & do 1 discussion. 3 projects in Weeks 2, 10, & 14 have their own discussions. You do not need to use the textbook at all. It's optional & free. 1 midterm & 1 final, same format: they take 20 Q's from past quizzes, then you write 4 essay questions. Very kind & laidback grader.",1
"most classes, he came off as very rude in regards to how he communicates. talks over you and -- which can make the classroom setting unsettled. aside from that, do your work and show up to class, and your grade for that class should be fair.",0
Very cool professor- very liberal. Knows a LOT about the subject matter. Studies affirmative action. He just needs to speak louder in class- he has a lullaby type voice. But he is good. You will learn a lot in any of his classes. Definitely recommend him. Brings other perspectives into the class and holds time for valuable discussion.,1
Great teacher except for his damn russian accent,0
"Gets angry that people don't take her class seriously, and acts incredibly demeaning to those who ask questions. I wouldn't dare ask a question that she might think is stupid, out of fear that she'll give me a snarky response in an annoyed tone, making sure the whole class knows that ""you should know this"".",0
He may be fun but the lecture halls are too big for him to actually care about you and your struggles in his class,0
"I didn't have ryan for 3202 so I can't speak to that class. However, I thoroughly enjoyed having him for 4204W. Yes, the class is a lot of work and hard, but if you want to be an MIS major and are interested in the subject you will like him because he provides a lot of high-level, in-depth view that is FAR more enjoyable than 3202. Would recommend.",1
Mr. Spence is my favorite teacher! He was so great! Homework was simply taking pictures based on the criteria he gives. He gives a quick critic in class. He lets you redo assignments to get a better grade. Only 2 tests given one on the basics of photography the other on photo history. Such an easy class!,1
"Best professor ever. Very intelligent, loves to give out A's!",1
She's a really good teacher! I enjoyed her class and learned a lot of stuff about public speaking and how to make a great speech. Her class isn't hard. I got 70 and I think an 80 on two of the speeches but still got an A. Definitely recommend her class!,1
"She's awesome and super nice. It's a pretty easy class to begin with, but she throws in stuff we probably didn't learn before so we don't get bored. I took it as a Hybrid but the amount of work was easy to balance with everything else.",1
Homework for her lab takes hours and is extremely unclear! You email her for help and she doesn't respond. Her power point notes make sense in class when you talk about it as a class but are hard to understand at home. Shes an extremely tough grader. Short answers tests.,0
"I absolutely loved having Professor Turkovic for my AMH2010 class. He is lecture heavy, but the lectures are in-depth and require you to think. He gives a clear study guide which are the verbatim questions on his exams. He is a funny and caring professor and I would recommend him to anyone, so long as they are a diligent student.",1
I feel bad.. but she's a pretty bad teacher. I'm taking her now and I'm so excited for December to come around.. She assigns an assload of busy work just because.. she's really vague and an over all poor teacher. She will discuss essays and she's actually pretty helpful about that.. but that's pretty much it.,0
Killed any interest I might have in Spanish. An incredible amount of class time is spent with her rambling about her family in Spain. Please read other comments on this page--they are absolutely rght.,0
I hate math but I love Mrs. V! I had to take MTE 1-4 and I kept her the whole way through. It is fast paced class because MTE is only 4 weeks long. You get homework everyday and everyday you learn a new unit. She's very helpful though and will make sure you understand. She also has a sense of humor that is gold and cool to hear at 8am.,1
"Im leaving this review after completing 6 years of college as a marketing major at NWACC and the Poo of A and believe me he was the ABSOLUTE BEST teacher. He will teach you things that matter! I wish I had taken better notes, so I may take his class AGAIN and ask for it as a Christmas present. Take every class you can with him!! He fills up FAST.",1
"Annoying, arrogant, and generally not fun to be around.",0
"Yes, it's possible to get an A but you'll definitely have to work for it. The content is pretty interesting, but you have tog get super organized in this class. You'll have multiple things due every week and a ton lectures to go over. If possible, I'd avoid this class as an 8 week course. You'll definitely always have somethingto do in this class. ",1
This teacher was great at making comment and clearly stating why you may have missed points. The class was laid out from day one which is great for online classes. As long as you keep up with everything you will get a good grade.,1
"Worst professor I've ever had. Blames students for bad exam grades, never returned any of project grades. Nobody knew how they were doing in the class until the final grades were posted.",0
"Lot of reading but it's all skim-able and very manageable for an English course. He explains things very well in lecture. Easy grader, and easy exams if you look over the slides beforehand. He was flexible when I had to take an exam early, reachable outside of class, and definitely entertaining! Highly recommend",1
"The midterm research paper and final count for like your whole grade, so the other stuff barely  matters! She is VERY broad on what will be on the tests, and most are short answer ques. & essay. Teacher is not friendly or helpful at all!!!",0
"Dr. Paul Coutinho is a fantastic professor and a beautiful human being. What I found exceptional about him is his ability to easily connect with students. He is genuinely interested to get to know a person behind the name. The atmosphere in the class was relaxed and welcoming, and I really enjoyed the way class was conducted and taught.",1
"""Politics of Past and Future"" one of the most unusual, different courses I have had. It introduced me to an entirely new set of views on society and politics. How leaders use history and future thinking to justify what they do. Readings are ""not the usual suspects"" including Freud, Sade, science fiction, movies, music. Take this if you can",1
Best professor at Hostos Community College. Love her,1
"To put it simply, broke my love for painting.",0
Liszka was very boring and defensive. She isn't open to other ideas except her own even if they are just theories like evolution. When I stated it was a theory so she got very defensive saying it was FACT. Umm no? So I would not recommend her because she is very bias as a professor. Lecture heavy!,0
"There is no proffesor in UCI who is clearer and easier than her. Easiest class ever, but still learned a lot. No concepts. just memorizations. but memorizations a piece of cake as the exams are almost straight off the practice exams given before the tests.",1
The most boring class and very essay filled. She goes essay crazy. And too much reading,0
She's a good teacher and will help you as long as you try in class.,1
"Professor Steiner is a wonderful professor. She cares for her students. Besides this, how she weights assignments is 100% fair. She isn't out to fail you or make the class overly difficult. Though, you still need to put work it obviously. There's 3 tests and 1 final. The final is cumulative. She gives practice tests. Gives extra credit as well.",1
"Gets offended by people not coming to class in a lecture with over 200 people. This is college, people shouldn't be punished in lecture courses. She does these industry exercises randomly in lecture throughout the semester so it keeps kids coming cause they dont know when they'll happen. First lecture I've never been able to use my phone or laptop.",0
"i have no idea how she got her Phd. her way of teaching is just stupid. i was planning to get at least a B in IE 314 class. but after the final test i was hoping for a D :( . She thinks she is strict, but in reality she is not. she doesnt know how to be flexiable with students. you will understand me if you try other professors in the department.",0
"Triggs was brand new to TCC and did her best to work with us and adjusted due dates around theory. The hospital experience was not great but she did what she could to make it work for everyone. I learned a lot from her and hope TCC will keep her on staff full time. She's fairly laid back and funny, def recommend. Has a lot of stories to share.",1
Do the work and you'll be fine. Seek help and he will help you. Don't expect him to pick you out of all the students. This was my third attempt at Statistics and he made it easier to comprehend.,1
"Only reads off the slides. You can download slides but is NOT very helpful. Funny Heavy accent when he says ""packet"", and hard to understand what he writes (scribbles etc)Go to his office & he will ask you rhetorical questions but he will help u in his office but is difficult to comprehend his teaching u the stuff. Take this class at own risk.",0
"Extremely boring lectures. He would just read his slides, make some sound effects, and attempt to joke. He's a terrible grader, as even correct answers, with the same info from his slides, is marked wrong. Never replied to emails, hard to reach in general. Told us to study notes during the quarantine and then disappeared. Not worth paying $2k+ for.",0
"One of my favorite teachers! She is so kind and helpful and really does want you to do well. 232 isnt an easy class in general, but she always answered any questions I have. She was a genuinely great professor, her lectures were engaging and she keeps it interesting. She cares about her students and is great at her job. Take her class!",1
Prof. Hesford is a great teacher. She makes the subject matter interesting and creates a learning environment that is comfortable. She challenges her students to think critically without making the assignments impossible. I highly recommend taking any of her classes,1
"I like Dr. Schaller a lot and she has inspired me to pursue more studies in Urban Planning.  While her assignments are writing intensive and not always easy, she will take as much time with you as needed to explain. She uses case studies and often challenges her students in a new way.  Some may not appreciate that but I liked the challenge.",1
"My favorite professor during my time at MSU. He won't give you anything unless you work for it, but he will bend over backward (I'm mean, really, he's a spry ol' guy!) to be there for his students. Show you care, and he'll make sure you understand the concepts. And be sure to ask him about climbing stories. :) Thanks for everything Dr. Callis!",1
"Class wasnt too bad, i showed up often and thats where he gives participation points for. Tests I found semi difficult, 5 total including final , drops the lowest  one. Homework isn't hard which is where most points come from. Would take again",1
"Claims he teaches you to think independently. Dont believe it! He only cares about what he thinks. If you treat him like a guru and agree with his politics, he loves you. If not he blows you off. Very disillusioning to have a philosophy professor who is so close-minded.",0
"She is careful to give each student adequate attention and practice to ensure topics are truly learned. Attendance depends on course pacing. My class met once a week for 3 hours, so it was more mandatory so I wouldn't miss things. Overall, she is a kind teacher that will do what she can to ensure you understand the lesson.",1
"Take this class if you dare.  It was a horrible class, I would not recommend anyone take her class.  Not only does she give out more homework than is possible to finish (especially if you have a family to take care of) but she expects you to know everything and is not willing to go out of her way to help you understand.   Very disappointed in her",0
"He's great will work with you!! he's amazing, super nice and you'll get the material.",1
"Dr. Rivas is very approachable and friendly. He lends the authority of the classroom to the students, which of course has its positives and negatives. Take the class if you are looking for an easy ride through pointless theory. Honestly, Rivas would be more effective behind the scenes of the English department than teaching.",0
"Honestly one of the best professors I've had at U of M. Provides a fun learning environment, as well as real life tools, and skills to utilize them. His teaching style helps you understand the topics very well and critically. Lots of fun examples, and in-class discussions. Tests are difficult, but what test isn't... Projects are actually fun though",1
"Be prepared to study 20+ hours a week for a C. She is a passionate teacher, but VERY nitpicky I spent more time reading her rules and grading criteria than the book. Tests are insanely difficult, and class is regimented. Shes all about application of material which is great if you're going into healthcare. If you just need the grade go with Bassett",0
"All of these negative reviews are exaggerated. Yes, it's a difficult class, and he isn't the most ""warm and fuzzy"" guy. Nonetheless, he's very fair with his expectations and you learn A LOT. His priority is preparing you for the CPA exam, which is much more difficult than this course. If you put in the time you'll be fine; it's not rocket science.",1
"I've had bad proffs before but Mr. Haze is very unorganized it's almost unprofessional. He talks a lot about irrelevant things and his directions are so vague and poorly put together be it verbal directions or even written. He doesn't grade timingly ,doesn't keep your grade current,and just generally isn't very direct or responsive when confronted.",0
DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH THIS PROFESSOR. Lots of readings and if you forget to read he takes points off. Only quizzes and half the stuff is not in the readings or talked about in class. One absence is 5 points off your attendance grade which makes a difference. Lectures in a socratic method; basically whatever he wants to talk about that day.,0
"Seriously the worst teacher I've ever had. Take my advice and find another teacher. You'll be glad you did. Lectures were incomprehensible, he was really weird and grading on the final SUCKED. he is not consistent with grading at all. AVOID HIM AT ALL COSTS!! :(",0
"Not terrible but not good either. The one good thing is that he curves your final grade at the end of the semester. His exams are brutal, but they're mostly based on the homework, not the slides. Very nice person, but too laid back... except for his exams. Lectures are pointless. He just reads from the slides.",0
"Wilburn is straight up one of the best professors I have ever had. He is a gentleman, a scholar, loved by students and just a brilliant human being. I hold Josh in the highest respect. ",1
Vague explanation of how he grades the journal which is a major part of your grade. The class seemed more for students to fail than succeed.  Would not recommend taking this class unless you have to.,0
"Old school prof. While I don't mind an old school prof, and everyone teaches differently, this man reeked of pompous arrogance. His class was him ensuring everyone realized his importance. 50% midterm on an Econ elective to a fourth year class, and a rude class-wide email responding to the low average. 8000 word essay. Needs to check ego at door!",0
"If the class is online, don't take it. Ive heard he's better in person.",0
"Definitely recommend Dudrick if you're at all interested in Philosophy. You will need the text, but not everybody does the readings every night because he teaches everything in class. Class notes are very important so make sure to get them from a classmate if you miss class.",1
"Elizabeth is very old school, she is completely disconnected from her students. Her lectures are super long and super boring, she uses no visual aids and does not post her lecture notes. In order to pass, you will have to show up to class. I will never take another one of her classes again, did not help my average at all.",0
Definitely one of the best instructors I had. He broke all the information down so it was easy to remember.,1
"By far my favorite professor at UMD. Took Death Penalty with him, overall a super eye-opening class and I learned a lot. Doesn't penalize you for not going to class, but is more likely to tease you about not showing up. I also had him for Quantitative Research Methods & Analysis and he was always available for office hours & one on one help.",1
"Mrs. McGee is an amazing instructor. She is fun, silly, hilarious, really cute, and a great at teaching the material. Her class is not easy, so don't be mistaken, you just need to put in the effort by studying. I had one of the highest averages in the class and still felt stressed at times. Its all about studying! I highly recommend her.",1
She's an amazing teacher! She gives great feedback and responds to emails quickly. She went above and beyond to make sure I understood the lessons. She's so enthusiastic and takes the time to get to know her students.,1
"He is very rude and has no consideration for student success. If a student does not do something the exact way he vaguely tells them to do it, he will become very upset and refuse to help them. He does NOT teach anything. All he does is talk down to students thinks heâ??s all mighty and great. Awful â??teacherâ??â?¦if you would even call him that.",0
"Hilarious, always making the class laugh, whether it's on purpose or not.  Highly recommended!  You will not regret his class.",1
"For students who want an easy grade - Take this professor. Its literally the easiest class, even if you have half a brain. Materials kinds of straight forwards, and is common sense. Professor is really lenient, but, beware, she goes off topic A LOT. I mean, A LOT. She talks about random stuff everyday, sometimes its interesing. Sometimes its not.",1
"An example of why teachers should go to teacher-school before trying to teach. The department should place more oversight over how she organizes/writes lectures and how she grades. We compare homework and scores so we know grading is not consistent. Some people always score better, for no reason. She ruined what was supposed to be the best class",0
"Shes one of the best professors Ive ever had! Its an easy class, just show up and do your work. Participation matters and theres group presentations but theyre easy. Highly recommend!",1
Ms. Sexton is an amazing teacher. She is strict but very fair. She only asks you attend class and study.  I had her for Micro Lab and I learned a lot from her lectures and techniques. She can be detailed in her quiz so make sure and study! The unknowns were not hard after taking her. ,1
I took his class for second semester even after reading the comments and I strongly recommend not taking his class. First off there's no leniency and doesn't even communicate properly on what's gonna be on the midterm. His lectures online looks like chicken scratch and its unreadable.,0
Sanda knows how to design and she's wonderful at that. However she doesn't teach well. She gets mad when students aren't getting it yet we just spend the whole class critiquing and repeating ourselves. She made it clear from the beginning that this class is a lot of effort and time. Not for the unconfident people.,0
"He's a pretty bad prof. Doesn't explain anything well, expect to be confused in class and abuse your economics friends for help. Econ is hard to get a good prof for so he may be one of the better ones , as sad as it may seem.",0
This class sucks. don't take it. you will regret it.,0
"This is a teacher who really wants you to become a better writer. All papers may be resubmitted and regraded as long as they are initially turned in on time. Grading can seem tough, but it is really just a push to get you to learn to revise and rewrite. In the end, grades are generous if the work is put in, and your writing will go up a notch.",1
"Assigned interesting readings but led very poor discussions. Anytime we got going, she took us off in a new direction using her buzz words she uses over and over. (Ex: hegemony, intersectionality, ideology). She also grades papers based on her politics and not on the quality of your writing or argument. The course is interesting, but she is poor.",0
"Mr Humphrey has a great personality and is very intelligent. Not too much homework, even though it was a 6-week class. He is very clear about what he wants, and offers rubrics and study guides. Just do what you need to do and youll get a good grade. Not a tough grader at all. It is an important class that I recommend taking as an 18-week.",1
"I dont understand the negative reviews on here. Professor Blake is an amazing professor and has very clear grading criteria but requires you to earn the grade you want, its not an easy A. He pulls right from what he goes over on class for quizzes.",1
"Lewis is a fantastic teacher. He's excellent at explaining the material. In CS 200, you'll write 4 programs and take 2 tests and 1 final. If you have the chance, take Lewis.",1
"Probably the worst professor to teach a philosophy course. The professor shows zero enthusiasm during lectures and discussion; lets the vocal liberal students 'run the show' causing lectures to get out of hand, ultimately resulting in little exchange of ideas. Steer clear of this professor and subject although it's the lesser of two evils...",0
He puts all the readings and films you need for the class online for you. He assigns several articles or chapters from books that he expects you to read between classes. You also had to watch the film out of class. He is a tough grader for the quizzes but is not so tough with the papers which was a boost to my grade.,1
"This class was my first time taking physics at the university, it didn't leave a good impression on me regarding the department. She's difficult to understand (language barrier), has bad handwriting, and does not finish lectures on time. Do not bother taking the practice exams that she posts, you'll see at best 2 similar ones on the exam. Avoid her",0
"Took the 6 week class. Very hard, apply yourself, he will NOT baby you. Come to class & pay attention, no texting oror side conversations, he finds it very disrespectful, and it is distracting to other students.  Bottom line he helps, but will not give you the answers before you try. If you don't study you will not get a good grade. Read chapters!!",1
"I would not take this class again. With this class, it would be impossible for me to even pass. Lecture you had to practically teach to yourself using the powerpoints slides which briefly described the concepts. The practice problem videos were unclear and it did not seem that she was interested in the subject. For lab she was unhelpful and unclear",0
"She rushed through portfolio work and spent months on ""busy work."" She yelled throughout the class, kicked a number of students out cause she thought they'd fail. Her feedback is weeks late and not helpful. I went back to my English 101 teacher for help. Yes you have to work hard for a good grade, but she's so stressful and unnecessary.",0
He's like the god of Hamilton's philosophy department. I have no idea why other professors aren't like him. I get lost in a trance whenever I listen to his voice. His wisdom and intelligence sends me to the moon and back!,1
He is absolutely horrible. I have learned nothing from this professor. He sits in class every day and just reads off the power points and plays YouTube videos of people teaching the concepts. The only reason I go to class is to sign the attendance sheet. He does all of the online quizzes in class. That's the only good thing about him.,0
"She's a tough grader, which is bad enough considering she doesn't teach class online. It's basically do it yourself. The deadline is at 10 instead of 11:59pm like the other classes. She's very strict about turning assignments in on time even if you have valid excuse as to why you couldn't turn it in. If you take this class, be prepared.",0
"Studied extremely hard but didn't understand anything (as a chem e with a 4.0). In a normal class, I would've failed but got a B because of the huge curve. Brown's presence makes the whole NCSU chem dept look bad. He should not be a professor.",0
One of the best professors I've had. Usually hate an hour and 15 minute lectures but almost always loved listening to her. She also grades extremely fair and is flexible with a lot of the work as long as you email her. Would love to have her again!,1
"Professor Sheridan is a great professor, class is lecture heavy; however he gives detailed study guides ! Also three exams including final, 3 novels which youre quizzed on, and a paper on one of them. He lets u use notes for the exams. Overall great professor very hilarious!",1
"a great dude and pretty good professor. stutters occasionally and loves to say ""out there."" he puts a big emphasis on pulling your own weight because he genuinely wants you to succeed. he's funny and keeps his lectures interesting.",1
"Easy A, but the class is taught like a high school class. You have to show up to lecture and do worksheets. There is a lot of busy work.",0
"Great professor, always looked forward to class!",1
Terrible prof. Does not clarify whats on the exam she will tell us to study the whole book while the exam will be clearly based on a small section of the book. Theres no course outline and she wastes 1hr in a 2hr lecture talking about random nonsense. Lectures and powerpoints have absolutely nothing to do with whats on the exam. STAY AWAY!!!!,0
Stubborn and unaccommodating professor. Not willing to help students who approach her. Doesn't consider student feedback at all -- 0/10 would not recommend,0
"le pire prof que j'ai jamais connu, a eviter a tout prix",0
I found this online class to be tough as well as the professor.   There is a lot of reading to do plus video lectures and a virtual child to raise.   There are also quizzes every week which are not easy even though they are open book.   I found the professor not to be very understanding either.,0
"Was great, glad I had her. Only 2 exams and 4 quizzes (a 5th one at the end to replace the worst), all of which she posts what material you need to know usually a few days before. Online homeworks weren't even that bad. Only real hard part was the essays on the exams, if you want an A you'll have to nail those. SI is extra credit too. Clickers tho",1
Terrible. Heavy accent. Unorganized. ,0
"Mulvihill's 1000-3000 classes are simple, one of the best Professors for Intro to the CJS. But if you love yourself do not take his capstone class. You have to read 3ish chapters every night and you will hate yourself. All tests require camera and mic use and every paper is graded super grammar nazi style. Stay away if you love yourself at all.",1
"She is a very sweet professor and will help you if you ask for it, but the class itself is very lecture heavy and can sometimes be boring. The final is a group project, which is easy but the quizzes in class can sometimes be difficult.",1
"I was interested in this language but the professor herself always had useful tips to help you improve your speaking and writing. The class wes a bit easy for me; and that could be because i was already learning before her class. There are no quizzes, only homework and short readings/exercises. Exams were sometimes over activities. Received a A-",1
"Not the greatest, very VERY slow, and not organized by any means. Marking was often tough and he doesn't like to accept the arguments or ideas of other people. Though he is friendly and approachable, his teaching methods and style we not necessarily the best. I don't think I would recommend him",0
This dude called out multiple of us this semester for plagairism which is the one thing I have never done during my college career. I took this class for fun and I'm going to end up failing. He's a very tough grader. There's only four grades and the final is a ten page paper.,0
"Great guy, knows what he's talking about and loves what he does. The tests are hard, and he grades hard too, I am usually a high B-A student and this class was tough. I didn't hate it though",1
"Unprofessional, very rude and condescending towards students, does not return emails.",0
He is a great math teacher. He makes sure you understand everything and does not get frustrated with anyone.  He made sure everyone understood before moving on. Great teacher who actually cares about his students succeeding in life.,1
"Do not take Mr. Weiner's class. Do not. He doesn't answer questions, there are a lot of assignments. He is stubborn in his opinion. He can be very rude. The class is like a high-level sociology class instead of an intro class. There is so much reading and if you don't understand it he patronizes you. Just find some other professor, please.",0
"Bogdan is a great teacher who really knows his stuff. Hes a very relaxed teacher and his lectures are great. He is one of the best professors that I have had, if you have the opportunity to take his class take it",1
"Mrs. Langill is the WORST teacher ever. She is completely unorganized, she will tell you to study one thing and then test you on another, she doesn't provide any help to you, you either get it or you don't.The material is hard enough, and she is completely useless as a teacher",0
"Mr. Susott is an excellent teacher. He relates well, and keeps things interesting. If you are looking for a history class where you are going to talk about battles, stratagies and generals, this is not for you. You will learn something, and it will change the way you look at history. Take this class",1
Honestly she is the best professor of all,1
Syllabus is very clear on what is due and when. He lists what he is grading you on in each assignment. Happy to answer any questions you have. Organized and straight forward. This class was very basic and easy to pass. Just show up and do the homework on time.,1
"Very easy class if you're always there on time. The exams derive mostly from his lectures, and his lectures tend to be long, but very informative. I highly recommend recording his lectures so you won't miss any important details. The textbook did not help me much. Study the definitions he uploads on blackboard.",1
Although he is very kind he is not specific with tests. Most questions will not be on the slideshows he puts on canvas and blames you if you dont succeed in the class. Very disorganized and is unclear of when deadlines and tests are in his class.,0
"Really tough, not super helpful in office hours. Takes off unnecessary points",0
"Il n'explique pas bien, survole la matière, nuit plus qu'il aide. À éviter.",0
"One of the worst teachers I have had in my life.  She is not clear at all and takes forever explaining one thing and then gets mad at the class for ""wasting her time"" when all we are doing is just sitting there listening.  She makes us do assignments before she even taught us what the assignments were on. WASTE OF TIME.",0
Bruce is an amazing teacher and a great guy in general. Took him for 152 & 262 and loved both classes. I would definitely recommend him to anybody taking chemistry classes at LCC.,1
I love doug!!! He is amazing. Take his class. You'll love it.,1
Probably one of the most demanding and incredible professors. Also one that try to nurture the growth of your writing. Definitely one of top professors I recommend and respect!,1
She only replies to simple email request; she does not reply to in-depth email inquiries.,0
"Very helpful and encouraging. I've tried to pass this class soo many times, this was the first time i succeeded, and I attribute that to her genuine encouragement.  She was VERY easy to Email and get a hold of outside of class for looking over your papers.  It was a fantastic class and she encouraged a real bond between students. We had fun.",1
Professor Grunlund knows her work but she makes this subject too hard! Every quiz she gives is timed too! She dont even give you a second chance to take it over like most teachers. Shes also not truthful about whats going to be on the test. She will tell you to study stuff thats going to be on the test but it dont be on it. Kind of deceiving.,0
Great class and great teacher,1
I took Dr. Sharif for physics. He is an amazing professor. Give good examples and notes that help with the homework/ tests. I don't really have anything about the class to complain about. I signed up to take 2 more classes with him next semester.,1
"This teacher is not transparent to his students. Does not use piazza, barely uses D2L. Extremely lazy when posting information about hw and exams. Does not post announcements at all. Joke of a professor at an academic institution.",0
"Easy A :) She's super nice, class is basic knowledge, a lot of group work and presentations (good practice for other classes)Gives extra credit. Class was canceled a lot.. Def take her if you can",1
"Dr. Callaway is the most influential professor I've taken at Fordham. She is willing to help you do well in the class if you feel you are struggling. Read the book and do the papers and she will give you a good grade. She gives you the exam questions before the test. This class could have been boring, but this down to earth kind soul made it fun!",1
"He's super friendly, helpful, and tries to communicate and keep everyone in the class interested, but he isn't a pushover, although he gives some credit for trying, Calculus isn't easy for a fair amount of people and if you're unable to keep up you aren't going to do all that well, but he is willing to help and an SI was available. Good professor.",1
"Feedback on papers was on punctuation mainly, not content. We were writing proof arguments and I never really got feedback on my arguments, if they were weak, strong, well worded, etc. Also, the video put out for each lesson just went over the links in the lesson and showing us those, no insights in how to approach the lesson.",0
"Awful class, there goes my gpa",0
No word can describe his class. You have to understand mumble and polish accent to know what hes talking about. I dont think he even knows what he's talking about. He speaks the same language as DESIIGNER except monotone and every now and than a moan.,0
"Christy is a great teacher. She's really nice and is always willing to sit and make sure you know what she's explaining. She can be blunt and specific sometimes, but just ask for help and fix your errors. If you do so you'll do fine.",1
Tough grader,0
Professor Knott gives good feedback but when she gets frustrated she lets it out on her students. She is a tough grader. I like her personality a lot and you can tell that she cares but I just wish she didn't grade like everyone was becoming an English major. She doesn't realize that people take this class because it's a requirement for an AA.,0
"Really awful. Extremely rigid on deadlines, I had a family emergency and she called me a liar and I had to miss a big assignment instead of it being a little bit late. She also tried to drop me after I missed two classes, it's school policy but she's the only teacher who follows it. Don't take her class. Terrible teacher. Waste of time.",0
Great Class. Chance to write. Nice workshops. Meets w/ u to help.  write one complete short story in the semester.  See others work.  Everyone comments on each other's work so be able to take comments.,1
"Never met a more lazy professor, this guy never taught us a single thing only posted videos and never did anything himself. Lazy, unhelpful and unreachable, I have never hated another person so much in my entire life. This prof is extremely lazy, DO NOT TAKE UNLESS YOU HAVE TO. I would have given him a 0 if it was possible.",0
"If you can avoid her, please do. The exams are hard...you read 11 plays and are expected to know who said what lines...the papers are long (10 pages) and she is extremely critical. She has a touch of arrogance and will willingly fail her ENTIRE CLASS.",0
"This is one of the worst professors at GWC. Taking Botany with him and it is SO easy, and not in a good way. He always wastes lecture time consistently by going on random tangents about irrelevant things. There's no organization or structure in this class and he does NOT put students first. Easy A but you will NOT be ready for other majors courses.",0
She's excellent & dedicated.  A real purist and a joy to be in class with!,1
"Very disorganized and assigns many readings and papers throughout the whole semester. She is not clear about many things and has me lost most of the time. She does not upload any grades onto canvas, only readings. Does not completely follow the course syllabus.",0
Be prepared to work for your grade with Dr. Schumann. He's a nice guy that provides good feedback but attendance is mandatory and the textbook is a must-have. The tests are purely memorization; as long as you memorize the terms and read the chapters you should do OK.,0
"Cooney is a really nice professor, the subject is just hard. Make sure you read the textbook and do the study quizzes in them because they help with exams. The homework helps with exams too. I was only able to get a B because of the curve lol. I also recommend going to office hours for help because he's really helpful.",1
"Tom Archibald is a solid choice for mathematics. His lectures are engaging and he is open to questions during the lectures. He is clear and explains concepts well. His office hours are fairly open, and they are well worth going to. He is very kind-hearted and fair.",1
"Professor Hegbloom has no respect or sympathy towards her students. She is rude and if you email her, don't expect a response until midnight. She does not provide you with any necessary requirements for assignments she requires and expects you to know the information without teaching a single thing. I do not recommend her to anyone. She's horrible.",0
"Unorganized- does not follow the syllabus, Tons of HW -so you will never see the day of light. I've taken many online courses and this one was the worst. Does not teach anything. 3 Tests- first one 50 questions; test 2- 75 questions; final 100 Q; weekly discussions and must respond to others; must turn in 10 750 word essays.",0
"Our class average was a ""D""and she did nothing to change that. let me remind you it was GENERAL. psych. AVIOD",0
"She is the worst, plz don't take her class if you really want to pass CHM 122. She is so confusing. Never gives you feedback. If you go to her to see if you got a question right or wrong she might change your right answer to a wrong answer. Her tests are hard. Even if you red the book, when you go to class she will confuse you with her lecture. ",0
"Dr. Lim is a really nice guy but his lectures can definitely be hard to pay attention to. Thermo II is a very challenging course no matter who you take it with. Dr. Lim gives out extremely detailed notes so for nearly every homework and test problem, theres a very close example problem in the notes.",1
"The best professor around hands down. Super understanding, considerate, hilarious, relatable, encouraging and immediately available for his students! I have had multiple foreign language professors and I feel like I have learned nothing. With Morales sensei I have learned so much and continue to learn every class and have fun learning.",1
"He is by far the worst professor I've ever seen. He has a very thick accent and I barely understood what he was talking about. Not only he has a thick accent, but he also did not go through the materials very thoroughly. He will explain something without reason, and he expects you to understand the concept. He repeats stuff over and over again.",0
"Holly was the most difficult Professor I have ever had at SCAD. Her class was full of unclear homework and project assignments. She not only wants you to be an expert at using the programs, but wants your work to be grad level design work, ridiculous for an intro class. We should not have to use YouTube to teach a class we're paying someone $4k for",0
Kata is an amazing professor with a lot of knowledge and wisdom to share.  She is good at engaging the students and is very willing to be a learner and not just a teacher.  She has a great teaching style that is fun and easier to learn from. Definitely recommend her!,1
"Prof. Bannow is not a mean guy, let me get that out of the way. However, he talks down to students because he doesn't understand that a student doesn't master a concept by seeing it once. Do not ask questions, do not miss class, basically teach yourself. He ends up giving so much extra credit the class seems pointless. Not recommended at all.",0
she's a vary caring woman and she will always give you help if you need it. she's also easily approvable,1
Enjoyable class.,1
"I love Dr. Anderson. He's such a caring and kind professor. He always calls himself the most ignorant person in the room and he tells us to channel our inner Socrates so that we aren't afraid to ask questions. He understands that what we're learning can be hard and he makes it clear that he's here to help. Latin is a lot of work though, esp. Latin2",1
hes why i want to be a professor.,1
"Mr. Rosin is genuinely a good person and respectable man, but having him as a professor, I failed miserably. The class is incredibly online based, and the online assignments are too much, as well as very time consuming. It's very easy to fall behind. And in class, Mr. Rosin would get distracted a lot or do HIS work wrong. Incredibly hard to follow.",0
"a horrible professor and a horrible person, holds no regard to her students or those around her, grades inconsistently with no explanations doesnt respond to emails or even texts dearborn should just drop her",0
Cassidy is an amazing teacher who inspired me to get a philosophy minor. She's kind and hardworking. Cassidy really knows how to engage students in conversation and approach uncomfortable subjects objectively. I really loved how she forces students to be critical thinkers. She's a tough grader but provides excellent feedback. You'll learn a lot!,1
DO NOT TAKE HIM IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE DOING ONLINE LEARNING. Has no idea how to communicate with students. You can try and send him an email asking for help but he won't give you a straightforward answer. He does NOT email you back in a timely manner. Also just posts exams and doesn't explain ANYTHING and doesn't post grades. You're in the dark.,0
"Professor McKnight is a stellar professor who ensures his students grasp the fundamentals of German. Homework every night, but it is very doable. Group projects were enjoyable and rewarding. Participate in class and attend most of the lectures, and you will be in good shape. Would definitely take this class again.",1
Just memorize random facts from his book and you will do fine on the exams - if you have sharp memorization skills. There's actually little to no actual learning about NUTRITION in this class. It's basically Biochemistry 2.0. I am disappointed because the instructor failed at articulating the material in lectures. Just memorize his book.,0
"She was an okay professor, but was really hard to talk to. Every message was a fight and I never felt I said the right things. Glad it is over for me",0
She's a great teacher but don't miss class after the mid-term. I had a death in the family and couldn't make it to 1 of 3 mandatory classes. Ended up losing nearly 30% of my final grade to one absence. I'm lucky I'd done very well early on or there's no way I could've passed. ,0
"His grading is extremely hard, loves to talk down to people and seems full of himself. This is a capstone course, so it's required. Before taking this course, make sure that you ask your regular legal research instructor to teach you how to write up legal memos and how to prepare legal forms b/c Wiley will not. Good luck!",0
"Professor Sonntag is consistently late in all of the meetings. I do concur that she grades with her eyes closed, and she does not fix grades, not a professor that you want to take.",0
"Gentil, beaucoup d'expérience mais passe trop de temps a nous compter des histoires. Apres ca il défile la matière en 10 minutes et tu dois lire le manuel pour comprendre. si tu fais les exercices tu devrais bien réussir l'exam. Qqun qui a deja fait de la compta ne devrait pas avoir trop de difficulté. Il refuse de repondre aux ques. pr la simul.",0
"I only made this account for this review! The world needs to know! Jessica is a great professor! You will enjoy her class! She is super fun and I learned so much in her class. I'm actually sad for the semester to end. She doesn't give too much homework and most of it is short written responses, so it's pretty easy. (Taken during quarantine tho)",1
I took characteristics: mild/moderate and there is a module due once a week. There are lots of things in this module so I recommend not procrastinating it.,1
The Gordon Ramsey of PhotoJournalism. Your video/photo quality will improve when he criticizes you. But it is what it is: People often think others are out there to get him/her so people take his criticism up the anal.,1
Very good prof. Attendance mandatory if you want to do well.,1
"Your grade for the class relies heavily on 4 exams, no extra credit offered, and very few assignments to buffer a poor grade on an exam",0
"I took every soc class at scc and had her several times unfortunatly.  She is a terrible professor.  If she likes you, you'll do well but don't disagree with her or your grade will suffer.  As a soc major, I hardly passed her classes and yet managed to maintain a 3.8 at Eastern.  It was pathetic.",0
"She teaches at a very quick pace and crams a lot of material in. She wants you to go to math lab for more instruction, but that's tough for people w/ jobs and other classes. She sometimes makes people feel dumb when they ask questions. I would recommend taking a different instructor if you would like to pass the course with a good grade.",0
Great Professor!! She LOVES what she is doing and does all that she can to help students out to prpare for every aspect of the class! Makes learning fun!,1
Worst teacher ever. Somebody needs to fire her! She needs to mind her own business!,0
i took him last year and i have never had a better teacher since. him and i always had great school related conversations and he never ceased to help me out. i would recommend this teacher for anyone!,1
"Dr. Gilyard is an awesome, albeit intimidating scholar. He is knowledgeable about his content and doesn't mind sharing his wisdom gleaned throughout the years. He is a hardworking professor who can, at times, appear hard/harsh, but I assure you his classes will not disappoint. He's a great school/teacher, someone I truly look up to.",1
AJ shows true passion for ASL as well as a true desire to see her students succeed. She is always open to hearing about any way she can change the class to make the learning process easier for her students and always makes herself available if you need extra help outside of class. Keep up with vocab or you'll be lost. Highly recommend taking her!!,1
"Incredibly difficult for an intro class. She has no idea how to budget class time, will rip apart your work in front of the class, and expects far too much of her students. Reading questions are absolutely ridiculous and took me about 5 hours per assignment. Takes about a month to grade your assignments.",1
"Online class with weekly quizzes, assignments and discussion boards. Not to difficult as long as you complete work on time. The work load is not demanding either. Great course.",1
"Absoulte worst teacher I have ever had. On several occasion the Dean had to sit in on our classes because of problems people had with her. If she liked you, you got a good grade, if not you are screwed on the test. I am a solid 4.0 student and recieved a 2.5 in her class.",0
He was a great teacher. Study the notes he tells you during the review and you will be guaranteed to get a high score. Never skip his class because he will fail you.,1
A really nice professor! She is willing to answer questions and offer additional help after class. She made me think about the Enlightenment period more critically.,1
I took this professor for race and culture 101. He is a very harsh grader and expects you to do above the required amount. He grades assignments very late and finds any reasons to dock you off points. Would highly recommend to avoid him as a professor.,0
"THE WORST INSTRUCTOR IN THE DEPARTMENT OF CHEMISTRY, BOTTOM LINE! DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE WITH YALAN XING, CHOOSE SOMEONE ELSE, SAVE YOURSELF TIME, DONT WASTE A SEMESTER WITH HER UNLESS YOU REALLY KNOW ORGO CHEM MATERIALS B/C YOU WILL NOT LEARN WITH THIS INSTRUCTOR! SHE'S ALSO A TOUGH GRADER.",0
"Worst math teacher i ever had. She often gets confused and has to refer to her notes. She cant answer questions, barely speaks english, and can NOT teach. Avoid this woman at all costs",0
"Great professor! Explains assignments very well, always willing to help out. I really enjoyed her class in Fall 2008",1
She is va very tough grader!,0
"This professor doesn't care if oyu learn or not. He will rush through the material to fulfill the syllabus, and he will be glad to fail you. My roommate had him last year, too, and said she was surprised he was a man of god.           highly UNrecommended",0
"Took his online PS1 course, was really solid. We had roughly 2 max, one hour long lectures a week, 4 quizzes over semester (v easy if you watched), response paper (just summarize), and three exams. I really found him to be a good professor and I actually learned a lot about gov and PS from him.",1
"Professor Xian is very nice. She uses a mic and has an accent, so she's very hard to understand. You'll probably end up doing all the learning on your own, but the material is easy. The tests are VERY similar to the sample problems she gives you, so do them! You won't even need the book. She is always willing to work with students, so just ask!",0
Professor Calkins is a truly amazing professor! She makes her online class so incredibly easy just as long as you read the required text. She gives wonderful feedback on assignments and is very understanding. I had received a 9 out of 10 on a quiz because of a silly mistake I had made. I emailed her and she gladly gave me the point after explaining,1
"Dr. Crowley is an exceptional chemistry professor.  I am an older returning adult student who has never taken chemistry classes.  I learned a great deal from her and she would always stay after class to clarify any content we had questions on.  The course was very challenging, but it is set by the ACS, and she has no control over the end test.",1
Worst teacher I have ever had. I had to drop. Niu is very quiet which makes it really boring. She has no passion. Doesn't know how to teach.,0
"Dr.Reiser-Danner is great she has her own workbooks which makes it easy to learn the concepts but you still need the textbook so you can look up Z-scores and stuff. She is very helpful and will explain a concept to you 10 times if thats what it takes. Nothing against Verrekia, or Gans but take STAT with Dr. R-D you wont regret it",1
"she is so useless, she only helps you if you're an AKA, which the whole student body isnt.",0
"If you get a chance to take Raynard, absolutely do. You will get both an interesting course and a great professor. Your participation grade is based on quizzes instead of a nebulous idea of what a professor thinks you deserve, just one example of her dedication to fairness in her courses.",1
"She is the worst. She only has 3 tests, including the final. She takes off so many points if you don't do exactly what she wants but she doesn't even say what she wants. She didn't assign any work and then in the last 3 weeks she made 3 projects due. She just talks for the full hour and 15 minutes.",0
"The most boring class I have ever taken. He lectures every class. You look around and 90% of the people are either asleep or watching Netflix. This class is nothing but abstract, liberal ideology that makes no sense. But its an easy A honestly.",0
"DO NOT TAKE ANY CLASSES SHE TEACHES. She should not be an instructor. Her classes do not make any sense, she asks students to explain problems even if we've never covered the material before. I had to hire a private tutor to get through her class because she did not teach and would not meet me during her office hours. Avoid like the plague.",0
"I would love to hear one of his lectures, but as a professor? You couldn't pay me enough to take him again. If you can avoid his class, do it.",0
"Seemingly teaches the high level ones assuming you already know the material. She'll explain things infrequently and jump around so that retaining what you learned is impossible. Also cancelled classes excessively and solved problems incorrectly on the board, stopping to correct herself after you've written everything down. I don't recommend her.",0
"He' really interesting, funny, and kind! He's a great teacher and seems like a very compassionate person! I loved going to his classes, and I never found myself wanting to leave, like I do with a lot of classes. Haha I would definitely recommend him to others, and I would take a class from him again!",1
Professor Holcroft's online Human Nutrition class was fun and interesting. Her lectures were provided via websites that she put together with pretty straight-forward reading material. Weekly dietary analyses are very time consuming but they really help you learn. Expect putting in about 8-10 hours a week for an A grade. ,1
This teacher is awesome! I learned so much from this class and I actually retained a lot of the information.  He gives great examples to help you understand the terminology and procedures better.,1
"Nice guy, but I lost count the amount of times I almost fell asleep in this guy's lectures. Talks too fast, and goes through slides like lightning fast. Goes so fast we all have to take pictures of the slides since he doesn't post the solutions to the questions. Also his quiz and exam questions are WAY TOO HARD, ended up failing the final.",0
"Dr. Wolff is a very nice lady! She is very laid back and easy to talk to. Lectures usually take the entire class time. There is a movie assignment, and an off campus assignment. I really enjoyed the class. Some of the test questions were a little tricky. Reading the text is a must. The powerpoint do not have much info on them.",1
She is nice and will do makeups but she has got to be the worst math teacher ever. She doesn't even know half of the stuff she teaches and she doesn't know how to speak English but when you talk to her in Spanish she gets bothered.,0
"Jackie is fun. The material is easy if you've taken chem before. I personally never looked in the book, but you have to buy it for the access code for online homework. There are 3 tests, 50 multiple choice q's. She drops your lowest lab score and gives out a lot of extra credit.",1
"One of the least helpful and least responsive professors I've ever had. She never responded to my emails by answering the questions I had she always just redirected me to the tutoring center, even for technical issues that the tutoring center couldn't really help with. I wouldn't recommend this teacher to anyone.",0
"It was a little hard at times, but well worth it. I would definitely take another class with this professor. Just make sure to watch his lectures, a majority of the test questions are based on them.",1
"Professor Wang is a great professor. She makes the class straightforward. If you attend class and listen, you will find the homework is done with perhaps minimal usage of the textbook. In addition, quizzes and exams are extremely similar to the homework. Do the homework and you will do well. She is a very kind professor.",1
The best prof in drama - hands down.,1
"I took Spanish for 2 years in high school and passed with A's and B's. So when I had to take a language for my degree requirement, I thought Spanish would be a breeze. Boy was I WRONG! Even with my prior knowledge I was confused and he moves very quickly. SO MANY ONLINE ASSIGNMENTS. He takes points off if you don't show up (even when you are sick)",0
"One of the best teachers I've ever had.  Do the work, and you'll be rewarded.  Use your brain, you'll be rewarded further.  He doesn't have time for those who slack off, and will tell you so. Great preparation for actual employment as a legal researcher.  Wish I had more classes I could take from him.",1
"She's super sweet, and even gives the class a few laughs each lecture. Lectures are long, take a LOT of notes. Tests are the majority of your grade and can be extremely hard, especially if you do not study days before. Overall, she is great at teaching.",1
"Ryan Romero is as subjective as they come. If you have to have him and are not some creative guru, just do your best and try not to be upset when he grades you really harsh. He is a cool guy and pretty understanding, but I wouldn't recommend to take this particular course from him. Unless you are outrageously talented, don't expect to make an A.",0
Dr. Wigginton is not a good professor and will ruin your whole semester. She has never responded to any of my emails and during class says she doesnt work Friday - Monday so we need to ask all questions in class vs. email. I went to her office hours twice and she wasnt there. Class content is easy but I hate the way she talks down to us.,0
"Very clear and organized.  Lots of reading, but test questions are predictable...all main points.",1
Love this teacher,1
Shes great professor before and during the pandemic. She tried her best to delivery the material and rose above the occasion. I really enjoyed her class. She gives 4 exams including the final and a lot of extra credit. You also have a quiz after every chapter. She wants kids to be engage so participate much as you can. The material is interesting.,1
He is quite the angry teacher whenever someone has a question he gets annoyed straight away. Ask more than one and he''ll barely even help. He makes it overly obvious that he has no interest in helping. As far as teaching goes well he DOESN''T teach just reads straight off a powerpoint. You WILL have to teach yourself stay away when possible.,0
"Cool professor who cracks dorkish computer science jokes and teaches pretty well. Taught CS70 with Vazirani and took the backseat, but involved with tests and homeworks.. sometimes questionable practices of finding questions online and assigning them without knowing the answers.",1
"You should only take her class if you are proficient in math. She makes many mistakes and often gets confused. A nice lady, though.",0
What did she even say? With her accent an fast talking I wasn't able to understand much of what she said. Her way of answering questions is by avoiding them. The online Labs Plus was more help than she was. ,0
"Professor Sbragia is incredibly passionate about the course material, and he makes it easy to be interested in the material. By far one of my favorite professors I've had",1
"Very unorganized. Starts an exercise and makes mistakes frequently. I took his summer class for Calculus 1, if you don't get distracted by someone moving and writing in the blackboard without any order, you'll get an A. Says homework is not mandatory but asks for it after each exam.",0
She took the time to explain the material multiple times and took time to do a lot of examples in class. Not really much communication about how to prepare for midterms though or grading policy.,1
Nice and funny guy but not very helpful and very unorganized. He seemed too caught up on outside projects to really care how we did. No reviews for test or exams. I would have been better off not coming to class and just renting the movies but attendance is mandatory.,1
"awful prof, awful examiner",0
Very good lectures. Homework is not that difficult. Exams are based on the homework. Doing all your homework and understanding everything on the lecture notes will guarantee you an A.,1
"She is absolutely awful. She doesn't know how to grade properly, and she misses everything. I have to constantly message her about how she graded my assignments incorrectly - which she eventually changes albeit reluctantly. Where or how she got her PhD is beyond me.",0
Would not recommend ever taking a class with this prof! She is very unorganized and scatterbrained during lectures. When she does not use power points it is very difficult to follow along. Class is extremely boring and she is unable to answer questions from students. She also is very unclear when it comes to tests and assignments.,0
"I took the web course during Spring.  Tests are straight out of Powerpoints.  There will be group projects to do, which is odd, since it is a web course.  It is kind of a pre-accounting course.",1
"Give study guide, and very helpful, approachable.",1
"Avoid this class/teacher at all costs. She is way too upbeat to be a human. Her grading is ridiculous. Our team got points off because she ""felt we didn't get along"". When we asked her about it she said it was because she just had a feeling. We all liked each other a lot actually.",0
"A vaguely interesting guy and exposed the class to new ideas. But he is an intellectual lightweight, so don't go to class expecting analytic rigour.",1
took her twice! She really knows how to make you approach environmental questions from all different angles. Great class where it doesn't even feel like a chore to learn,1
"I took a mini-term. The class has a lot to read; you have to write one paragraph essay for each chapter, one final exam, and a midterm. He may sound a bit tough, but if you do all the homework, you will pass.",1
"She's a very sweet woman, but she's not a great teacher. She doesn't explain things well and in math there needs to be a certain level of explanation for things to click. You can pass if you do your homework and make good grades on them, see her after class, if you didn't understand something, and see a tutor. I would have failed without a tutor",0
"If possible, do not take his class. He rarely answers emails or messages and doesn't interact with students at all. His rubric is unclear with 'dramatically exceeding expectations' required to get an A. I understand it's college and it isn't meant to be easy, but this guy is horrible. A month in and he hasn't taught anything himself.",0
She's by far one of the worst prof. I had to work with. She's really does too much. Like her online math class and how she wants the camera set up is just so annoying. And she will not give you one extra point and won't let you makeup work. I just missed one assignment and everything else messed up. She's just plain worse!,0
"I took this professor because all of his great reviews, which are probably all fake. I used to love chemistry before this class, but now Im on the verge of failing. The class averages on tests are normally Ds. His lectures are by far the worst Ive experienced, the homework is impossible to do without looking everything up on yahoo answers.",0
"He is very professional, makes you read to know the material, and write papers every other week, while taking quizzes the opposite week. Really learn about society from him. Very good class and very knowledgeable.",1
"If you're taking this class to fill a core, think again. Provost is a geniunely nice guy, now that we got that out of the way. Multiple questions assigned every class (Marked very hard), a 10 page paper (9 sources needed), and get ready to be serenaded by his voice considering all he does is lecture all class #yawn. This class is reading heavy!!!!!",0
"This is not a very difficult class and if you show up he will gladly help you. I got A's on all of the tests and hw, if you do not understand the material at first he'll help you learn it. I found the class interesting & even funny sommetimes",1
She gives a lot of homework compared to the rest of the English department teachers.  She also doesn't describe the homework.  Many times she isn't willing to help till the end of the year when it is too late.  She really drilled a person at the end of the year to do well but by that point the person was either failing or not.  Do not take her!,0
"Overall: Very poor lecture, requires time to teach yourself. Lecture: Verbally teaches math, lacks organization, a lot of side talk. Homework: will assign problems that he didnt lecture on (uses textbook). Tests: Mostly basic problems, do the study guide. He is nice, kind, and funny. If you already know math and dont need any help, take him.",0
I cant speak for her in class teaching but for the online course I took with her she was completely unhelpful. Youre expected to teach yourself the material and there were no reviews for 4/5 exams... including the cumulative final.,0
"He hardly talks about what we're going over. He rambles about his own life and other non-topic things such as how to kill a person with a pen. Have other course homework ready to do in there or else you'll be sitting there doing nothing useful for an hour and 15 minutes. Other than that, easy A",0
"I partially agree with the comment below me.  I agree he is approachable, however he really does make the subject harder for me to understand.  & I do not agree with his exam method.",0
Really makes sure you understand the information. Great at teaching.,1
"This guy is really nice. He wants everyone to do well and is very lenient about everything from hw to quizzes. He's not out to get one over on you. I did not always love the lectures, but hey, it's comp sci. Cool professor.",1
"She is really great, shes fun, really smart and teaches a lot but doesnt give much work. Expect to get let out about half an hour early, shes super laid back and it wasnt a huge deal if you missed a couple classes she always posted the notes. Like i said almost no work just study for mid terms and finals. Really enjoyed her class.",1
"Definitely take Deacon Daniel if you can. You don't really have to read since he goes over everything in class. If you take notes or get someone's notes, you're golden. Easy A if you do that. Attendance is mandatory - you have like 3 free absences but someone can always sign you in. Just a midterm and final and both were easy. Take him for sure!",1
"She is a wonderful professor! Tough love is her way, she does not appreciate slackers and will push you in the right direction every time to improve your work! I would recommend her to anyone and I will have her on my thesis committee for sure!",1
"Sadly the lack of reviews on this guy led me to take his class due to this class being set in the morning. First off, he relies heavily on the book to teach which isnt great because his tests barely reflect what you were taught and was supposed to learn by doing the homework. Also very inconsistent. Overall, take someone else.",0
"Professor William reminds me of a second grade teacher, while she is extremely upbeat and always has energy, her lecture do not help to understand what she is teaching. Most of the time you are teaching yourself.",0
One of the greatest professors I've ever taken. He is very knowledgeable and tells a lot of fun facts. His class is very easy to pass and interesting. I would highly recommend him. Be prepared to read a lot and do homework on the reading. There are no quizzes and for the tests consists of writing a paper based on questions. Take him!!!!!!!,1
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. it is hard and you cant understand what he says. the class is so boring and he talks about one slide for like 15 minutes!,0
"GOD! Forget about this professor! They say he is smart, but....Please, please, please do a favor to yourself and DO NOT DARE to take him. Never available and never replies to e-mails!",0
"Professor Serpell is incredibly brilliant, but tough - her class was the most difficult I've taken at Cal. Her lectures are great and encourage participation, but expect students to think hard.  I would recommend taking her class, but only to students who actually like English and are willing to put in effort necessary to keep up on readings.",1
Hilarious guy. Obviously very knowledgable and wants to help.,1
Très dur à suivre. Se perd souvent dans ses idées. Ses examens sont mal corrigés/construits. Il est dur à rejoindre/à rencontrer. Ne suit pas son plan de cours.,0
Went over many techniques for photoshop. He lets you record. Gives plenty of lab time. If you missed something he will definitely help you and repeat himself. Super nice.,1
"This is the only class where I have actually felt stupid. He wasted an entire class just complaining about how horrible we did on a test and how he didn't understand because it was the ""easiest"" test ever. He has 2 tests then 3 videos along with 4 papers, which he grades very easily. He comes off cool, but his qualities as a professor are poor.",0
"Dennis is a respected artist, but should not be teaching. He shows up 15 minutes late everyday and sometimes takes attendance sometimes doesn't. He gives everyone a B as long as you show up and try. He tells you to watch videos on the internet if you want clarification on anything. He plays on his IPad all class long. No demonstrations ever.",0
LOVED cathy! She explained everything thoroughly and if you didn't understand it she would put it into a different perspective. She had mini quizzes each week and i would highly suggest taking advantage of open lab!,1
"Honestly, you learn so many life lessons in this class. Prof. Wingora is a very wise yet funny teacher he can be amusing and makes class interesting. Theres homework on blackboard every night but it can honestly be a 2 sentence answer. Tests and final essay or presentations are super easy, simply study or memorize moral theories and add support.",1
she is clear on all of her mathematical explanations,1
Love this class. Tests is multiple choice  and they're easy if you study only! He truly cares about his students and wants you to learn. Definitely recommend him.,1
"Main key to passing, turn in your assignments. He gives GREAT feedback. He's a tough grader, but you can tell he cares for his students. I took an online 16-wk course & the due dates for assignments were every sun, wed, thurs, and sat. Again, you NEED to turn things in on time. He does not accept late work or extra c. Do the work and you will pass.",1
"This was my least favorite class at UMBC- Shady Grove. I don't like her lectures because she goes off on tangents that aren't related to the lecture. I found that attending her lectures made me more confused. Some of her quizzes contain errors that might lead to someone answer incorrectly. When students point this out, she becomes quite flippant.",0
Professor Guzzone is absolutely incredible. This is my favorite class that I have ever taken in my life. He is so knowledgeable about music and the history of it. I had a 3 hour class that met once a week and always wanted to stay for more! I never even needed to take notes! Tests are so easy if you pay attention and read the chapters when asked,1
"He calls it passion, I call it narcissism. Most of the lecture comprised of his personal life and work relating it to the class; lacking the true teaching aspect. He didn't give real notes either. The book was mandatory and even with the book for the take home test, I still failed. It's more about his expectations than the course itself.",0
Doesn't know what she wants to say to the class. Doesn't have any type of lecture plan. Teaches very slow and speaks very low.  ,0
"This was the worst English professor I have ever had. He rambles on about philosophy and the true meaning of friendship and ""philia."" He makes you join a messageboard to post your ""excellent thinking"" and it's all extremely pointless. Beware this class and if you already have it I would drop.",0
amazing prof! she is passionate about thermodynamics. I would recommend attending all classes because the text isnt that useful but she makes things clear. Assignments are extremely helpful too. get her if you can!,1
"Terrible professor. Wants students to communicate with him, when you do, if you are incorrect or reflecting a difference of opinion, you are berated in front of the class. Goes off on irrelevant tangents for lengths at a time and then complains that the class is so far behind. His study guide is in his own verbiage so it is difficult to research",0
"Tanoukhi's lectures provide no clarity on the philosophical readings, and really neglect the assigned literature. Her slides are huge block quotes without page numbers--which she does not put online--and her exams are quote IDs of author, title and date. She also loves to waste class time with bizarre stretching or trying to learn names. ",0
"Take this guy's classes.  i took 2 of them, tough but a blast.  I actually learned something.....I think",1
"Hands down the worst professor at ISU. He makes you feel beyond stupid and isn't afraid to tell you how bad you are at writing. He thinks that he is better than his students just because he has been teaching for so long. He will tell you that he ""believe in you"" when in reality he could care less if you do well in the class or not. AVOID HIM!!!!",0
"She is very tough, her grading method will hunt down your grade. She says that she is tough, and the test will be tough. You study very well, and you know the material, but the questions in tests are so specific that you don't know what she is talking about. Be ready for a lot of tricky questions. DON'T FOLLOW HER STUDY GUIDE, just study everything",0
One of the funniest professors I've had. He gives out quizzes at the beginning of every class but they become so routine that they can't even be considered pop quizzes. Each quiz is based off of the homework or problems we did in the previous class and then similar questions are used on the test. Easiest way to pass is to do the work he assigns.,1
"Very nice professor.  Professional, concise.",1
"He has a tendancy to get off the topic sometimes, but more often than not, his lectures were interesting.  Translation quizzes were easy and papers weren't too long.",1
"Dropped, do not recommend. You will not learn anything from this prof. How he became a prof is beyond me.",0
"Pretty heavy accent and speaks very softly. If you're not sitting in the first row, you'll be lucky to hear half of what he says.",0
"Nice guy. Thick accent. Class was a waste of time. I only went to get extra credit for perfect attendance. Lectures were all powerpoint slides that he later posted online. DON'T BUY THE BOOK! It's not needed at all. If you can turn on a computer, you are probably overqualified for this class.",0
"Loved this class! The four 5 page papers were a drag, but I only wrote 2 and took the final and got three high As. Very opinionated, but if you agree with him it is fabulous! He has a lot of great insight and stories to tell. Take a class with him before you leave UMass!",1
"Mr. Burt would just read off the slides. He doesnt give a straight answer to any questions whether it be regarding course content or grading. In labs, he only gives about 15 minutes to do them them and spends most of it trying to set it up. He curves at the end of class, so you dont really know what youre going to make until the very end.",0
awesome teacher!,1
"Dnt take him. He is old and cranky. Quiz Evey day , test are easy 150 multiple choice but still he is  mean. ",0
"Really easy class, all you have to do is show up and listen to the lecture. She only gave out two papers and two exam, and the exams were easy because there were only two questions and she gives out the first one. Easy class.",1
"Everybody loves Baughman.  Material covered in class is interesting and he's a pretty funny guy, too.  Highly recommended.",1
"She's very sweet and knowledgable on all the topics. Sometimes she is a little disorganized in her lectures, but as long as you skim through the textbook and study the study guide before exams, you can get an A! In 230 there were 4 exams, 1 group presentation, & 5 quizzes. Homework almost every week, but it was just the definitions from the chapter",1
"Professor Hart is a very nice and kind lady, however when it comes to taking a class with her, steer clear. She is very unorganized and you never have any idea really what to expect on anything. She spends many lectures going over the same material from months ago, but none of that stuff will be on the exams.",0
"This professor was very unprofessional. He was immature and unnecessarily rude when answering a simple question over email. When I asked for feedback on a grade I received he insulted my work and made false accusations about my lack of effort. I did well on every other test and assignment but his opinion on my ""creativity""  hurt my overall grade.",0
"I have mixed feelings about this professor. He's a really nice guy and is very accessible, but sometimes he can be unclear when explaining his lectures. Luckily, the lectures are posted so you can go back and review it. My only problem with this class was how harshly the homework was graded. You'll do better on the exams than the HW.",1
Professor Romani is one of the best hpe teachers they have at ccc. She loves what she does. She teaches in a way that is fairly easy to grasp and makes sure you know the material before moving on. She knows what shes talking about. Doesnt like when youre late so be on time. Take notes and youll pass the class. Tests are on what she lectures about,1
"Hes easy , and quick, he wont waste your time, he made our class a hybrid class and that went great, most of his assignments are online and you can use your book. its easy but you really learn something in his class. i recommend. ",1
"Shawna is great. I really enjoyed her class. Tests are not very challenging, and group project had a lot of long papers but were graded easily. A little unorganized with her lectures, and where to find things on study guide but other than that it was a great experience. Didn't use textbook once.",1
I wish to say thank you to this Professor. He had really helped me with when I needed it the most concerning family and etc. He gave the assignments early at a ich helped me with my schedule. I had asked him to help me and he did so and benefitted the whole entire class.  Thank you again and God bless with all my heart. Elina A,1
"The class was hard, but Dr. King makes an effort to get you to understable the material as best as possible. The tests are tricky and detail specific, but not impossible if you study.",1
I LOVE HER. She is amazing in class and is very organized. She is also a great adviser.,1
Easily the worst math teacher i have EVER had. He does not attempt to teach at all his idea of teaching is mumbling things to make himself sound good. Absolutely do not take this class with Dan I with-drawled along with 13/25 other kids in my class. Dan is a joke of a teacher. Youtube runs circles around Dan.,0
shes the nicest professor on campus. she goes out of her way to make sure everyone understands everything clearly and does everything she can to make sure everyone gets an A. she is undeserving of any bad ratings.,1
"Class was great. The lectures were all online 40+ page powerpoints in case you missed class &  were also your studyguides for the final. Cut his three hour class into two, which was a bonus. ",1
"Very well organized. Gives a couple of papers. Nothing you can't handle. Prepares you for test, etc.",1
"There is a quiz once a week along with a paper at the end of the semester. No final, no midterm. Study the chapters for the quizzes!! Definitely recommend him!!!",1
I have never been more disgusted with a course at UNB. He made up the marks - and would not provide backup or return marked work. Had to get the dean involved just to get my mark! DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE!,0
"She's lenient with grading the lab's but when it comes to quizzes they are just horrible! She would give you a random species that you have no information on a few days before the quiz and then expect you to become an expert on it in a few days! Her lectures are just horrid, she usually joins and talks about how hard her second job is mostly.",0
Terrible teacher . Be aware she holds grudges. She gives a lot of notes but doesn't tell you anything about any of her tests. She expect you to eat breath and live the subject  and doesn't help you with any questions all she says it look through the notes. I would recommend staying away from her for many different reasons.,0
Dr. Conner is a good teacher. She doesn't use the text but it's good to have for a quick referrence if you need one. She sends lecture noted to your e-mail and usually will accomadate you in any way possible. I took her for 2 semesters and an A both times. I would recommend her.,1
"jean is awesome! I am so glad that I got to be in her class. She has taken my thoughts about education to a new level and she has truly brought out the best in me. Her class is fun and she does a lot of projects. No tests. If I could take every single class with her, I would.",1
Leftists will love him. He only sees his side of things and grades accordingly. Will never take his classes again.,0
Her online course is one of the hardest to navigate which is ironic because of the class she teaches. If you ask about something on her course page that you couldn't find she'll make you go on a scavanger hunt through the clusterbomb of useless information on her page rather than taking 5 seconds to tell you. Also more homework than any class.,0
Absolutely awful. 10/10 would not recommend.,0
She would be a great 4th grade teacher with all of her petty nitpicky rules.Chastising grown adults is totally inappropriate for a 400 level college class.She gets really madd when people arrive late and are on laptops.She does not post her powerpoint lectures so you should be there for every class.She is knowledgable about the subject matter.,0
"Really knows how to communicate with students of all types, and has admirable patience in a subject that is challenging to some and simple to others. Liszka has brilliant metaphors for hard concepts, and both academic and industry experience, which is wonderful. Fair, extremely helpful. Plus, she prefers C to Java, therefore she is awesome.",1
"He has a very superficial understanding of sociological theories and does more preaching than teaching. He teaches with a heavy bias, outdated facts, and outdated materials. However, he is very nice, forgiving, and encourages in class/ outside of class discussions. The midterm/final are given and the class comes with five short papers. Easy A.",0
Easy to talk to. If you like to question things and have your mind mess with then his class is for you. He challenges me with questions after I ask him questions. Don't have to go to class if you are sick or he will kick you out.,1
"He is the worst teacher I have ever had the displeasure of meeting in my college career, he does not care about his students. He thinks anyone and everyone is trying to become a scientist.... don't take him if you can!!!!!!!!!!!! he is really hard",0
"Professor Endlich is amazing, she's bubbly and really excited about her work, that makes you want to be excited as well, the work is tough but as long as you follow instructions and turn everything in on time you'll easily get an A... 1010 would take this class again if I had to. ",1
It seems like he even don't understand the concepts for this class when he lectured. He always made mistakes. Although his notes was extremely helpful.  I knew what fugacity is from his notes.  The only way I prepared for final exam was to read all his notes.,0
"Uplifting, hilarious, & knowledgable. She knows her stuff & her personal experience is very helpful. Super fun & easy class. I spent most of it laughing. She thoroughly explains everything & will always help. She WANTS you to succeed but that 1st requires self-leadership!  Trust me when I say she gives you EVERYTHING you need to, so take advantage!",1
"Great professor. The more your class participates, asks a lot of question and have discussions the easier the test are. You can't really go wrong in this class with this professor.",1
"Took Public Speaking Spring 15. Class was easy because I took Speech Comm in Fall 12. I somehow still got a B, did the math and it was because of the tests on book material we never specifically reviewed ever in class. If you're not shy in a classroom and can do some research for a speech, this class should be fine for you.",1
"Honestly, one of the worst experiences Ive had with a professor in general. As a person, hes a good guy but when it comes to teaching the class and grading not so much. Very specific on his grading and will deduct points for missing a lim or parenthesis or something minor. No study guides. Gives hardest version of questions on test.",0
This is the most easy biology class ever,1
"Probably one of the best professors in the Brownsville UTRGV Campus. He knows the subject, he cares about your grade... meaning if you don't do so hot on a paper or assignment he will let you take it home, correct it, and submit it once more for grading. He's old school, all grading done by hand and is also very down to earth. An honest professor!",1
"He was very unforgiving, very harsh grader, and gave homework every class session.",0
Lots of reading but the book is interesting enough,1
"The textbook for this class weighs 500lbs and is thicker than the bible. Prof. Raphael is kind and caring, but be prepared for cases that go on for 30 pages and get ready to be asked about every concurrence, dissent and obscure intricacy. The publishers could honestly cut out half the pages in this textbook, the students would be better off for it.",1
"Hands down best professor I had at UT throughout my undergrad. The class was really fun to attend, and he makes learning all the material a breeze! He was also available after class for any questions, and is a very genuine person and caring person outside of class! If you need to take biochem, take Hoffman!",1
Awful! If youre a visual learner this class will be extremely difficult. She uses launchpad & reef & theyre extremely expensive. If you dont buy them youll obviously wont pass! Her study guides are useless & she had no set office hours & its very hard to reach her. Do yourself a favor & dont take her,0
Stunning and Electrifying,1
"Interesting, melodramatic and engaging. I always looked forward to her lectures. Anything beyond that I say no! You better write a polished essay to get a high grade in that class otherwise you'll end up with a lower grade.",1
He's funny and good at explaining things.,1
"While attendance isn't mandatory, you won't do well in this 8 week course if you don't attend unless you already have an IT networking background. Be prepared to do the Netacad online learning at home and for best results, get ahead on the modules so his lectures make more sense. Great instructor with professional experience in Cisco.",1
"Eric was not a great teacher. Half of the time he had to stop and redo his examples because he didn't even know what was going on, he would even often ask us if we knew what we did wrong. Assigns lots of homework and the tests often consist of the more difficult problems with lots of steps.",0
"Love this guy. He's a fantastic lecturer and his lectures are what really make the class great. It's definitely a class you don't want to skip, if you're interested in passing, because all the content is reliant on the lectures for the most part. Reading the slides after won't help you. I think he uses them more as reminders for talking points?",1
"Dont take over the summer. Horrible experience, material was severely reduced and I feel I learned almost nothing. On the other hand I have heard great things about him from many others so I can only assume it was the reduced time structure.",0
"I was super excited to start this class. However, after working hard on papers and going by her rubrics, my grades were very poor on analysis papers. If you have a question, she seems very rude when she answers. Also, I wouldn't take this class if you work full time or are a full time student.",0
"Took his CS 220 class, and Intro to Algorithms class.  Worst teacher I've ever had.  He threw me out of his office hours once, because he didn't like that I missed class that day.  Doesn't speak English well at all.  You won't learn a thing in his class.  Drop, immediately.",0
"She had an attitude when students asked  questions and criticized them for not knowing the answers.  I emailed her for help and she refused! When I went to class she was rude again, but got quiet when she realized I was prepared. I've heard similar experiences from other students. Luckily I only had her for lab and passed the course overall.",0
I've taken Mrs. Dodson for several math classes.  This review is based on her statistics class which I feared going into.  She is very helpful and explains things in a manner that's easier to understand than most textbooks.  She's also easy to work with.,1
"Never posts what she says she will, and will change your syllabus 10x before you actually know whats due. Attendance is mandatory, but she cancelled an extreme amount of classes (or showed up 10 min late). The work is not difficult, you just won't have any clue whats going on. If you email her to ask, she likely won't respond. So stressful!!!!",0
"Be prepared to complete a lot of drawing projects. Teacher is very motivated and will inspire you to do well in his class. I can honestly say I learned a lot in this class. Lectures are clear and are related to projects. You will need to complete a drawing portfolio to showcase your work. Overall great guy and very understanding, always helpful.",1
"Not very many prof are good teachers, but Rolf is a very good teacher and makes himself available for questions during lecture or after lecture.  He also seems to really enjoy what he teaches and makes interesting relevant references to his work. Also very friendly.  I highly recommend this class.",1
This man makes my life worth living.,1
Group lab every Friday. Content not fully covered before lab. Tries to explain through lab while your trying to work. Others have complained she doesn't speak English. Knows English well. Speaks horribly. If you need someone to teach you the content for the class TAKE ANYONE ELSE. Take only If you don't mind teaching yourself while being confused.,0
"Took McDevitt for BSC1010. He is a great guy very funny and easy going. There were 5 tests, he drops the lowest one. The tests are impossibly hard, I studied 7 hours for one and still got a C. The lectures are very confusing and he made the class a little too difficult. Would not take if you're looking to get an A",0
"She makes coming to class enjoyable as well as worth while. She uses really good descriptions and stories to make everything taught in class relatable. If you ever do need to skip a class however, it's super easy to makeup because all of her powerpoints are online. Also, very approachable and easy to talk to!",1
Weird teacher! She makes us do the most random essay topics and makes little sense when explaining them. She grades hard based on if she likes what you wrote about not on structure or style. The classes are pointless she reads out of a book or someone's essay. There are only 3 papers and a notebook and thats ur grade. Get someone better if possible,0
"FInishing my third year in this field and she is truly one of the driest lectures and most useless teachers I have had. Reviewing for tests is impossible, between the half empty slides with color clashing font, and spending hours just trying to find readings she gives using only a name and date. Shoots down questions in-lecture, truly the worst.",0
"awful directions, expects everyone to care about art even when none of us are art majors and that we should just leave because we were wasting his time, told me today that he may have thrown my paper away because there is another kid in the class with the same last name and that made it confusing. 70% of grade is in the final week.",0
J'ai eu le professeur... Il a essayé le mode: Je ne donne pas de cours.... On a eu 0 cours de sa part... Il commençait le cours à parler d'écologie... Il répétait la même actualité d'un cours à l'autre. Professeur à ne pas prendre.,0
"One of the worst classes, he couldnt care less about his students. Most of the class had failing marks and he enjoys talking down to students infront of everyone. Take any other class than this, hes an awful person. Most of your grade is based off group work, if you have a bad group then you will struggle.",0
"The class is very interesting and expects you to be fully involved both mentally and physically. Professor does his best to make lectures conceptually easy to understand. However, you need to study on your own by watching his YouTube videos and asking applicable questions during class. He is very generous as he curved the final exam&course grade.",1
Had him for a philosophy course ... dry sense of humor ... only a couple tests and the final paper was hard but I enjoyed the class,1
"Professor is very passionate about debate, she walked us step by step out of our comfortableness when it came to public speaking. I learnt more about critically thinking in this class than I have in all of my English classes combined. Professor grades fair and is very funny, take this class if you are in college to learn rather than just for paper.",1
"She's very sassy and says she wants us to ask questions if we don't understand. But then gives us an attitude when we do ask questions. The lectures are typical, study notes, take the tests. It's the lab that's ridiculous. Theres little to no teacher. You essentially have to figure everything out yourself. And it's not easy. ",0
"Her lectures can be a little boring and tests are iffy, but overall she's a very nice woman who cares a lot about what she does. Would recommend if you need a natural science credit and want to take psych",1
I completely disagree with the other review. Anne puts very little effort into this class. Tests come from a test bank of her previous tests. The TA is responsible for everything else. You could easily learn everything taught in this class from youtube. For a 4000 level class Anne is extremely patronizing . Don't waste your time.,0
"Easy class, barely went and passed with a B .",1
"She was very unorganized & scattered, usually arriving 5-7 mins late. Lectured about topics that were irrelevant to the films we watched, but really knows her stuff. Expected us to read 10 articles each week, but no one did. The class was an Easy A, but excruciatingly boring. Asked us to buy 2 books, but never referenced them. Easy grader on papers",1
"Attendance is mandatory, don't skip, they'll take off grade points.  The projects are really time consuming, make sure you get them done on time. Otherwise the class was really helpful, if you like filmmaking, you'll learn a lot.",1
The class is hard and boring. He murmurs to himself and you cant hear what he's saying.,0
"Mrs. Wells is very passionate about her job. She likes to make sure that everyone understands her material in class. Homework was asked of us but not necessary to turn in. If you understand the material, tests will show. Show up to class to learn the material and you'll be fine. She also gives reviews before tests which obv helps a lot!",1
Expect quizes everyday. BOO,0
HORRIBLE got a D in the class. When you ask questions he tells you look in the book doesnt bother to help. pop quiz when he feels no one is participating doesnt even tell you what to study or focus on for the exam. terrible professor doesnt care for the students.,0
"Glad I took this class, but discussions don't always line up with the lectures. Its hard to understand the direction of the class because it's not chronological or grouped by topics. Professor is super knowledgeable and passionate.",1
ok prof. clear lectures but bad tests,0
Great Guy.  Grades are easy to come by.  Would do anything to help you out.,1
"Prof. Hendrick is iconic in that she is so chill, yet a very knowledgeable actor. I took Basic Acting with her because I thought I would be interested in it, but she taught us that it was so much more than that! I loved every single class with her. Very few essays/homework assignments, just come to class ready to BE IN THE MOMENT.",1
"I recommend anyone but him, he does not take the time to actually teach students. Very inactive when it comes to labs, by walking around class and expecting students to self-learn. The exams were really hard and he does offer extra credit but what does 1 point really do when he rarely likes a students response to the bonus question.",0
"I would never recommend takeing her she doesnt teach well enough, if you are one or two minutes late she will mark you absent. i learned absoulety nothing in her class.i should have drop her!!",0
"Most of the coursework is the workbook activities and discussions. There are few assignments youre being grades on, which makes it easy to do them on time but if you dont do them your grade will suffer. The quizzes are fairly easy as well, so overall the class should be easy to get a good grade in.",1
"African-Americans in film ... don't take this class. most of the time we get out early, but class discussions are 5 minutes long and mostly consist of him saying the same things about one movie as the previous one. The book is good. won't learn much. harsh paper grader",0
"she's a great teacher, she's a no nonsense kind of teacher, do the reading and work and you will do ok. if you don't do that than you will fail . the tests are somewhat hard. its multiple choice and open ended questions. attendance is mandatory. if you are lazy and not a good student don't take this course or have her for a teacher. not boring.",0
"great teacher, highly advise to take this course with him. makes the class very interesting.",1
"Assigns TONS of homework (esp. readings) and expects you to do it thoroughly and come to class prepared to engage in in-depth discussions. She cares about letting the writing style be determined by the message, so nothing is set in stone. She wants to free you as a writer from the rigidity of the dreaded 5-paragraph essay. Great class, but tough.",1
"Professor Thangaraj is EXTREMELY clear about his expectations from the first day: they are high! He expects a lot from his students and pushes us to be better than ""OK"".  Go to his office hours and go to class! Participation is key! Nice guy and easier grader than he originally seems. My favorite professor thus far at Vandy!!!",1
"Amazing, sweet teacher! She uses real-life experiences to help us gain an understanding of what we are learning. She is very open to what the students have to say and loves discussing the material. There is only one group project but you discuss the material in groups in class. Take home quizzes. Open book final. Easy A! Just participate and enjoy!",1
"Wouldn't take him again, he skips around the chapters and talks about what he thinks is important, then he'll put questions on the exams that you didn't cover in class. Really nice guy, but I really hate his teaching style.",0
Useless.  Unpleasant.,0
changer de prof! sinon garder le si vous voulez faire le cours avec l'impression de ne pas s'en avoir un du tout,0
"Going into this class I heard that Professor Milligan was a hard teacher, and hard grader. So going into her class I already knew her class was going to be the class I focused on the most. Her outlines,her explanations, her knowledgefor what she's teaching is apparent. To me the best thing about her is that she's accessible through e-mail.",1
"This class so so so hard.  She not help me at all.  She think she know everything but don't know nothing.  If you know everything why not help people but since you pretend you do why don't you.  God Says: The righteous care about justice for the poor, but the wicked have no such concern...",0
"Ruder is pretty boring, but you can basically do whatever you want during class time as long as you follow along when he's coding. He has study guides that are kinda annoying, but they do help you for the exams. For our class 2 of our exams ended up being take home. Overall, easy A as long as you don't get behind.",1
"Too much reading, I do not learn my reading 30 pages of information and then taking 4 different tests on it. I will NEVER take this class again. I just had a mental breakdown over this class and I'm over it.",0
"""Johnnie"" is kind, patient and helpful. She takes one on one time each class to help with any questions you have and allows each student to work at their own pace. Learning Illustrator was challenging but she goes out of her way to help you master it. The quizzes are open book and can be retaken. Work is mostly completed in class. Wonderful teacher",1
she is a great teacher! her tests are pretty hard but as long as you study you will do fine..the class is very interesting,1
"Loved the Shakespeare course. The readings are lengthy and difficult to understand, at first. You'll learn how to decipher Shakespeare like a pro if you do your homework as you should. Dr. Ryner has a great personality, and a true passion for Shakespeare. If I could, I would take another class from him in a heartbeat. Tests aren't the easiest.",1
"Professor Lai is very passionate. He puts effort in making the class engaging and interesting, will relate it to the real world. He will go out of his way to help you if you ask. He is straightforward about exams, no curveballs or trick questions. Rent the textbook and you're set.",1
He teaches so bad. No knowledge about the the topics. Teaches basic level examples in the class and puts high level questions in exam about which he never makes us practice or any idea.,0
Professor Young is the best MATH 211 professor ever. She explains things in ways that students can understand.,1
class discussion was interesting,1
"Doesn't care about the students, good for business instead of teaching,  doesn't facilitate learning at all, He is not good for teaching this course at all.",0
"This course was not very good, the teacher is really mean if you don't understand everything right away he yells at you. He doesn't help you at all to understand. He is one of those teachers that if you don't get  then you need to figure it out. Did not enjoy this class at all because he was so rude and mean to the students trying to learn and cant",0
"The lectures are boring and uninteresting. I've been playing music for years and even I can't get past how monotone he is in presenting the subject. He knows his stuff, but he doesn't bring it down to the level that most would be at in this class. The book is pointless as well, so you can save your money there. I don't recommend this class.",0
His tests are very difficult. Not because the material is hard but because he does not know how to word the tests. He is very confusing and become defensive when you try to get clarity. I would not recommend taking this class.,0
"awful unclear professor, hard exams, unclear expectations",0
"She is very hard to understand. She uses powerpoint, but I think she just photocopies the pages out of the book because it is exactly the same. She doesn't explain anything and acts like she doesn't understand what you are trying to ask if you have a question. Most of the people in my class were completely lost the entire semester.",0
"If you attend class, read the textbook and do extra work at home, you can get an ""A"" in the course.",1
Yeah just stay away from this Professor! Really hard to understand her directions at times I wish she would communicate more effectively with her students. Not bad but I would not take her again if I had the choice.,0
"Mr. Holt is a very knowledgeable instructor. He definitely know his stuff and will help you if you ask for it. However, his lectures are virtually useless. He is easily distracted by questions and goes off on long tangents. It's really hard not to like the guy as a person, but i would avoid him as an instructor. READ THE TEXT.",0
"I have mixed feelings about Professor Horan. I loved him up until finales week. It's an easy class as long as you turn in the assignments, but I ended up having technical difficulties near the end and almost failed because he wouldn't be understanding so-- ehhh. Overall liked him more then I didn't.",1
Professor B is a awesome! Her enthusiasm is infectious and made reading a lot more fun than what I had originally expected. I don't recommend international students to take this class unless they are fluent in English. I was born in California and thought this class would be a cakewalk but Professor B really expects a lot from you.,1
Not a nice teacher. Very rude and condescending. I felt like I was a bother to her if I had an issue. Not a people person at all. She was late to class on the first day.,0
"lectures were confusing, one word powerpoints that had nothing to do with the midterm or final exam. I was on the verge of failing the course, but the essay is a grade saver IF you follow exactly what she wants and uses the right format. She is a nice lady, but for soc202, not the right prof. Just throw the whole course away, not a bird course.",0
I love her dank memes giving her the BEST educational knoledges for me btw i go to SDSU,1
"Not really easy, but interesting so its easy to understand.  Seems like this will be useful in the real world.  He is very understanding, and loves to answer questions.  Kind of cute for an older guy.",1
I would totally take Hinton for every Biology course if I could! She was amazing! I loved her! She is so caring and hilarious! She goes off of topic a lot but make sure you show up to the reviews! Make sure you study the reviews because they are JUST like the tests (like word for word). Answer questions and she will give you bonus points :-),1
"First off not an easy class. Secondly he is a bad teacher, very smart, but bad.  Makes it up with the exams very easy.",1
"First off, shes a HORRIBLE teacher; I dont understand how she was awarded the Fulbright Scholar for teaching. She's hard to understand in lecture, and belittles you in front of classmates when SHE's the one who is unclear. She also doesn't reply to emails in a NICE manner. I've never met anyone more rude in my life. Stay away from UHCL bc of her.",0
Difficult professor. Hard exams hard lectures everything is confusing. Failed this class.,0
"extremely boring and extremely easy. there is not much work at all for this class and the work there is, you can easily get 100's. there are two online tests that you can work together with, and two book discussions (say one thing and you get a 100). a chill class but get ready to fall asleep every day. also very liberal",0
"still not my favorite as a person, but good prof. was very harsh and nitpicky but the semester got easier as it went along. I went to every class, including optional review daysreally helped my grade. 4 papers, online quizzes, VERY short readings, and options for what to write about, easy final. as long as you put the effort in its bad at all.",1
First of all i definitely could have gotten an A or B+ in this course but grading criteria is so awful and unclear made me get a C+. This instructor is always unclear about what are we doing in the labs and doesn't explain stuff well. If you got a bad group than you are probably gonna have bad grade in the final project. Lectures are boring.,0
"Definitely a tough class, but worth it. Her notes and lectures are confusing, but if you read and do the online homework you'll understand what's going on.  She even gives you the types of question that will be on the tests so you can practice online. She's always willing to take time out of class to explain something.  Go and show interest.",1
Professor Shine is the best professor I have ever taken. He is what every professor should model themselves after. He is an exceptional human being who strives for nothing but growth in his students.,1
"Gupta is a nice guy, but you should avoid ODE at all costs with him if you can. He teaches off of the slides that the texbook publisher made, and when he strays from the slides, he's confusing. He give NO PARTIAL CREDIT on exams at all. There are 7 HWs, a midterm, and a final; if you bomb the midterm and have mediocre HW, he won't help you out.",0
He's pretty awesome and obviously cares strongly about his students and what he does. His lectures can be slightly dry but he is very knowledgeable and can simplify things as well.,1
Really hard to understand. Goes over practice problems in class but the way he describes them is really confusing. Business calc is extremely difficult with him. Would recommend another professor.,0
AWESOME!! He makes class interesting and makes sure everyone gets a good grade. He also brings treats almost every Friday. His stories are hilarious and you can tell that he is super intelligent and passionate about his work.,1
"Great guy! His classes are hard because he doesnt teach, he tells. He teaches using his pre-worked solutions which makes it near impossible to learn. If you dont have hours and hours set aside to study and learn the material yourself, dont take from Dustin. BUT do befriend Dustin because he cares a lot about each of his students.",1
Alex could have taught MATH 0240 better than the professor if given the chance. Her classes were clear and organized and she gives really good examples of problems to help you get feel for what quizzes and exams (should) be like. She's always willing to go over concepts again and meet outside of class if you cant make it to her office hours.,1
I took arts 301 for non-majors in the summer. I attended every class except on my birthday and I completed all assignments to the best of my ability and he gave me a C+. So annoying because he doesn't really give you a clear direction of what he's asking for. He also doesn't tell you what he's going to grade or how many points each assignment is.,1
"One of the worst professors I've had. Never responded to emails, and went on tangents not related to the class all the time. Take another teacher for this class. Exams were almost impossible with her teaching.",0
"She had a passion for mathmetics  whose energy could be found in each subject from every lecture she taught. Best math prof ive ever had, 9/11 would take course again.",1
"The tests can be a pain and studying can take hours.  Lots of reading and on average three papers are due per week.  He talks very fast.  He gets off topic during lectures and doesn't cover much of the reading, or if he does it's not in much detail.",1
"My favorite course at Walsh. I kept all books after class ended and still refer to them almost monthly. Do all extra credit including the grammar book. Tons of reading and tons of work, but I found it valuable and eye opening. Do a little of the living case study each week to make the end of class more manageable. I would highly recommend McHann.",1
"I didn't mind Dr. Lim as much until the final.  I've gotten higher than 95 on all my homework, A's on both of my midterm and 100 on the semester project, and I left finals with an overall of B-....... The 3 hours exam was so freaking hard, I didn't finish in 4 hours... and trust me, I studied my ass of for that class. so good lucj if you take him.",0
Nice,1
"If you know statistics and can skip class till the tests your fine. Otherwise she will make you want to fall asleep. Most boring class ever. She gives weekly tests that she says is not for credit but shes a lie. She wants students to fail. She says one thing and then does other things. You can do better than this class, or teacher.",0
"Very good professor, was an easy A, he is the coordinator for Kinesiology and really knows his stuff. I would take him again if I could.",1
"She is a teacher who is very passionate about her students success. She will give you plenty of time in class to ask questions, and will move at a nice pace so everyone can feel like they are learning something. I wish I could take her next semester! ",1
"Great teacher! She is enthusiastic, fun, and really well educated on her subject. Pay attention to her and go to class and this class is pretty easy. Keep up with the reading also, there is a lot of it but reading it really helps on her tests. She's open to questions and ready to help students understand.",1
"Dr. Bhattacharya makes it very clear what you have to do to get an A in his course. He very much so cares about setting you up for a good career. If you need help or if you are struggling with your schedule, he will work with you. He is extremely understanding and his lectures are easy to follow. You should definitely complete the readings though.",1
Mr. Pierce is an amazing professor! Gives lots of quizzes but they are directly from the PowerPoints. He makes reviews for every test on the concepts that will be tested. I had 0 idea about animals and I got an A. TAKE THIS CLASS AND PROFESSOR do the work and get an A,1
"Professor MacArthur is a double edged sword. If you are a non-English major looking for an easy English class, he is your man. Just prepared to be bored to death. Bring work from other classes to do. However, if you are a serious English major, he is a waste of your money. You will learn nothing because he is busy rambling about irrelevant topics.",0
He is the best math teacher I ever had. he goes through the questions with you and he grades paper well,1
"Professor Cassidy is hands down one of my least favorite professors. I had her for PHIL321 and I hated the class. She gives out so much homework and is a very strict grader. Its a Gen Ed class and Ive never had so much homework in my life. She takes this class way too seriously. But besides that, shes a nice ish person.",0
"You'll learn a lot. You'll work a lot, this is NOT an easy A class. If you don't like violence, cussing (C  and F word)don't take it.  Brent is a GIFTED teacher but you can learn the same thing with tame content. If you like: South Park: cuss episode, Curb your enthusiam: Denise Handicap & Tarantio movies, take it. If not, chose another teacher.",1
"Professor McCarthy is one of the best professors I have ever had. She is very intelligent, well respected, and a fantastic teacher.",1
"Lectures can be boring but she does try to make it fun sometimes. If you don't participate in seminar she gets salty. LOTS OF READING. had her for 2P83 too, very similar. not very helpful when asked about essays/thesis construction & admits she isn't good at exam review. try to take other courses if you're an English major who needs the credits.",0
ESL teacher hard to understand sometimes. He is very unclear with his assignment instructions. Even though he gives a hand out with instructions he renegs and modifies assignments week to week. His individual project is a time consuming task that is riddled with busy work. You will gain nothing from it. The group project is somewhat interesting.,0
What an ego! I aced this class but the structure was awful and he only seemed concerned with all the work he was going to have with the grading and editing the final product. Not really what the students could do.   He doesn't respond to emails. Rarely gives anybody besides other tenured professors the time of day. ,0
She will explain everything and easy and nice way. I love her and believe me you will enjoy her class.,0
"Mrs. N is a native speaker and definitely knows Span very well, but she is a PAIN. She has many unnecessary rules that she will not negotiate whatsoever. The Span dep. is using a new book this year that is truly AWFUL. The online homework is full of errors but she will still not give you any extra points to make up for these program issues.",0
"He is a great professor! His sarcasm is so funny to me, but dont be scared to ask any questions. He loves helping his students. Make sure to go to his office for any extra help and read all of the material. Dont forget to do all of the the practice quizzes and take notes.",1
You can tell he knows his stuff but it is kind of difficult understanding what he's teaching. Tests are difficult.,0
"Worst, stuck up instructor that makes you have to write far too much about her single sided topics.  Don't get stuck in her class!",0
"Faith Lamprey is a nice lady. Her lectures are clear and easy to flow. Attend class, do the homework and you will pass. If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask her. She does not have an office at Rhode Island College, but she is pretty good at responding to emails.",1
Course is very comprehensive but examples are clear and extremely helpful. Professor is very helpful and clarifies any questions.,1
"The class was very easy if you show up. He tends to go on and on about random things, but it'll mostly tie in with what he's teaching. He is an amazing teacher who only wants to help you understand the lessons and achieve not only in his class, but outside. He is very welcoming, always asking how you are doing, or how your outside hobbies are going",1
"All the class is about the tests, but requires homework and turning in scratch paper from all assignments. No real in class instruction.",0
"Lacking of  example, the assignment is nothing about the notes. He talked a lot about the definition. the definition is useless. He thought he is a good teacher, you know....",0
"I sincerely took several  aspects of this class for granted, especially the production aspect. I was one of the students who felt we were doing too much in the class. Now as a teacher, I realize  every aspect of the class was relevant. Well, the professor was kind enough to award me an A- despite my failure to submit assignments timely.",1
One of the best..!!!!!!!,1
This class was okay. I really enjoyed it . The only thing is that there are lots of assignments if taken online. But overall is an easy course.,1
"She is the only one who could teach me stats and make it seem easy. Her workbooks are so helpful and she knows how to teach. Just go to class and do the homework. Stats sucks, but she makes it easy.",1
"Prof. Spiczak is really smart, but is a terrible professor. His clicker quizzes don't really help you learn the material, and doesn't mention material that is all over the tests. You definitely need to read all the chapters and go over lecture PP's twice.  Also, he seems really nervous and seems to be staring at the back wall rather than students.",0
"Tons of notes..doesn't really relate to the book though, and he uses an online code for homework, which is very difficult to understand. His office hours stink, and he doesnt like staying after class to help..wouldnt take him again thats for sure.",0
"Prof Dynes is an incredible human. Very empathetic, and willing to be flexible with your deadlines. The lectures were boring, as he would go over basic things like how to write an essay for half of the class. There are little nuggets of joy with social theory, but most of it is anecdotal and opinion. Felt like a lame high school class.",1
"I'm sure she's great for upper level classes because I can tell she's caring & intelligent. However, this was so much work for a 100 level class. & I don't think she planned her lessons. I was stuck listening to directionless ramblings twice a week. Take someone else for ENG 104, especially if you've waited until senior year to take it (like me).",0
-Grammar checks contradicted each other throughout the drafts of an essay. -Directions are mostly unclear and vague. -Talks more about her other jobs than finishing a chapter lecture. -Exams are not based on power-point lectures but unnecessary information from the textbook.,0
He does a great job keeping the class engaged. He is very animated and fun to listen to. Take homework and test reviews seriously and you should do ok.,1
"Took her class for UI100, and while it was a lot of busy work, as long as you did it, you should pass with an A. There aren't tests, just a few presentations that she gives you 2-3 weeks to put together. I reccomend it",1
"Mrs. Bolt was not very helpful at all. I had her online class and there were problems with Myitlab. You can never get help from them or Mrs. Bolt. She says to Email her if you had a problem but she replies back with a attitude and tries to brush you off. I went on campus to get her help, I saw her helping someone else, you can tell she was annoyed",0
"It is so disappointing that EWU lets this teacher teach at all. I have taken this class at another school and understood it very well, now I am in it here with this teacher and it is impossible to understand or learn anything. He does not grade anything or give any feedback. He also wont work with you on ANYTHING. Avoid this teacher at all costs.",0
"Great professor, not that organized but do your work and he'll pass you. EASY CLASS!",1
If you're a lazy student looking for an easy A I suggest taking this class over the summer for she caters heavily towards those students. Quizzes are online; she lectures when she is in the mood. Group projects are assigned and you remain in the same group throughout the semester. Hysterical and has a lot of good life experience to share.,1
"Basically, you're taught by the Teacher's Aid. There's a quiz every week, drops one. Lab practicals aren't too bad - theres 4. Make sure to pay attention to the models and powerpoints given.",0
"Took this class in the online synchronous format, but going to lectures was useless. Read straight off the PowerPoints he gave us. I read every textbook chapter and did all his practice questions, but then didn't do great on his tests. Don't recommend taking this course with this professor.",0
She is amazing! As long as you go to class and pay attention you will make a good grade. She does a Kahoot before each exam that basically give you the answers to the test. She attended ECU and is easy to relate to. She doesn't tolerate disrespect but she's very fun! Enjoyed going to her class.,1
Professor Licato was such a sweet guy. the class is very easy. if you follow all the instructions that he gives you will pass the class. Most of the work is done online and exams are done in class. If you have any problem just talk to him and he will help you. If I have the opportunity to take him back again I would.,1
Lectures are hard to understand because of the teachers accent. The teacher goes too fast and is not clear with explaining. The teacher assumes you should remember everything after just going over it once. I was not prepared for tests at all.,0
"Great Professor, she is a little off sometimes and tough on presentations but overall a caring professor. I would recommend actively participating and doing all the work. easy A",1
"I love this professor. Her lectures are clear and engaging. She obviously cares for her students and what she teaches. The guidelines for the papers are pretty strict, but exams are reasonable. Definitely show up to lectures and do the readings.",1
"Professor White responds to my emails with questions with ""no problem."" and my inquiries as to why I got a grade and how I can do better with, ""keep doing the work and maybe that will help."" Don't expect her to communicate with you, she also sends these replies 5 days to a week later. Exams require lockdown browser. Some coursework on quizlet.",0
"3 tests-Drops the lowest, a final and attendance. SHOW UP FOR THIS CLASS. 5 random attendance days. He gives you the answers to the exams so you don't need to pay attention or study, just memorize them before and you will pass. Final is a mix of all 3 review sheets so memorize all three and you will do extremely well. Literally a Study Hall. Easy A",1
"Professor Temple is extremely knowledgeable, but he told us to begin with that he'd never taught 21B. The subject was just not taught very well and the exams (which are the only parts of your grade) are very difficult and proof-based. The class was disorganized and just not a very good experience. Hopefully it can be taught better in the future.",0
"Clear about what he wants from his students but its alot. Way too many quizes that require meticulous reading of 20+ page almost every week. 2-3 essay assignments each semester on top of that and lots of memorization (ALL of the quiz answers, plus notes) for exams. Too much for a core class even though he lectures well.",0
"Just like the other person said, do NOT expected full credit on anything. There are no tests or quizzes and don't bother buying the book, we never used it once. Her PowerPoints were interesting though. Overall, I wouldn't recommend her.",1
"His class is a lot of discussion and some nonsense. He is extremely easy. U can rewrite your paper, but it will never be as good as an A. If u don't pass his class u need extra help.",0
She's great. Made class very interesting and there was high class participation. Did convert final exam into paper.,1
"yaya she was easy but i like SOC and i ddnt learn a whole lot, that made me mad,the tests were easy, and projects were eay but i wanted to understand the material, not just sit and do group activities. id take her if you needed the class, if SOC is your major, then no way jose.",1
"He is so lenient & fair! Unfortunately, No Curve to this class. 4 exams (50 multiple choice, 2 pts each) 5 bonus questions on the exams, 14 quizzes that are online (can be taken as many times as is necessary to receive 100%), 4 Writing assignments(1 page) 12 Chapter reflections (1 paragraph) Class is easy but study extra for test so you can get anA",1
"If you like going to class lectures to learn because you don't really read the book, this is not the class for you. Her classes are more for practicing what you read. Hands out lots of problems to work in class, felt like a waste of class time when we could have worked those at home and reviewed them in class. Doesnt teach the logic of accountin",1
"Dr. Shahrava has a very good understanding of what he does and has the potential to be a great professor, but his lack of organization or communication makes understanding his lectures impossible. Reading the textbook will usually save you with profs like this, too bad the exam questions are pulled from concepts in his lectures and not the book.",0
"Professor Woods was a terrible first choice. She over explains way too much, gives enormous amounts of homework that barely count for anything, grades HEAVILY on tests, and thinks the entire world revolves around her class. Had to drop her to save myself from miserable failure.",0
The most thorough lectures I've ever seen. He manages to cover every type of homework problem/test problem you're going to see. Always go to class and I recommend re-tracing through his lectures (from your notes) before you start homework assignments.,1
this was her first time teaching this class so it was okay. i thought she was helpful and i loved the videos she showed the class. i wished we had more time to discuss topics but over all a good class.,1
Dont bother going to class. You dont really learn much from lectures due to his style of teaching. Not friendly with students. The multiple choice part for the exam is usually from study guide.,0
"Honestly, the only thing that really killed me was the final. There was so much information to study it was unrealistic. The teacher seemed really nice, though It was an online class so it's hard to really tell. But yeah, there's a lot of reading and a lot of information. Don't think I would recommend it.",0
"Professor McArdle is really nice and his command of the subject matter is apparent. However, he's not very responsive to emails and often didn't return assignments (i.e. a very slow grader/wouldn't return assignments at all). Each class is a PowerPoint lecture. Class overall is easy though.",1
"admirable, knowledgable, funny instrutor. She is so emotional that she never hurts anybody by giving a lower than C grade. easy midterm and final. she was busy grading papers during class section, so you are free to do anything.",1
"OK so the homework-It's hard but doable. He's a very easy grader. For the tests, I never read the book- just went through the clicker questions & slides on D2L and got an A on all of them. The quizzes were online.. MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THE ANSWERS because he puts those exact same questions on the exam! 5 exams and drops one. He also rounds up A LOT!",1
Hilarious!!!,1
"Professor Hartgrove was an amazing lecturer, I enjoyed the way she explained ideas and provided examples. Taking her in person is much more enjoyable. She is known for being unorganized and it took her the entire semester to grade essays, however if you follow the guidelines you'll be fine. Textbook is required and can be used on quizzes and exams.",1
"the quizzes are hard because he only gives 20min for 5-6 long problems, but they only count for 5% each(and he drops the lowest one), and you have much more time for exams, which are 30% each. most people are not doing well but honestly as long as you understand material and study your notes you'll be fine",1
One of the best professors!! She's extremely nice and helpful and the class isn't that hard. If you have the chance to get her then do it! :),1
I did not find this class helpful.  Most of the information we learned came right from a textbook.  We learned this material in health and wellness but have to take it for majors.,0
"The study guides and practice quizzes were unhelpful for the exam(s). He has us practice simple forms of each problem in-class and on the homework, however the tests seemingly had multiple forms within one problem instead. When we are unable to practice them that way, that sets students up for failure. Also uses wileyplus, which is horrible.",0
"Fun Class, Hard Tests.  You gotta read the book and take notes forthis class.  He is a gret entertainer, but his tests can be very hard. you gotta work for an A in foresty wildlife and fisheries.",0
"If I were to go back to the begining of the semester, I would take this class somewhere else. Cristina says things that are not appropriate for any educator. She has told us that few of us will ever be able to get a job in the feild we are pursuing and is not encouring. When she says something nice, it does not come off as genuine. Good luck!",0
"I highly recommend Dr. Jones for senior seminar, even if you didn't like her in Genetics! She has a completely different demeanor in this course; she's very warm and understanding. Now listen closely when I say this: THIS WOMAN'S CAREER ADVICE IS INCREDIBLE. I did not expect to get much out of this course, but now I'm so glad I took it with her!",1
Awesome class,1
"King's class is based on attendance, so show up and you will be sure to receive a B. She is also very group orientated, meaning that over half the class is group projects/graded. This class is very focused on the now, so current events.",1
"This guy here really cannot teach. If you don't self teach i guarantee you will fail the course. His exams are easy until you get to the 10 point long answer question. Even if you answer the question correctly you can get a 5/10, this will drop your test mark 1 or 2 letter grades. Literally don't take his class if you care about your mental health",0
"COVID  online course. I think its bcuz its a language class but this course and 4920 posted up a recorded ppt, a pdf version, AND the transcript of the recording. I am a visual learner and this was amazing for me! I would recommend listening to the lecture and watching the videos, reading the book gives you way more clarity and in-depth info.",1
"A very tough grader, Very strict always speeds through things. In this course you mostly have to teach yourself to understand what he's talking about, wants you to read the chapter before coming to class.",0
Lectures can be hard to follow. Really nice and will always help you.,0
He is very funny but his quiz are very hard. You have to read each chapter before class to get good grade. His lectures are not very related to the exam or quiz so you don't have to be stressed out about taking notes.,1
"I spent so many HOURS a week on this class and am doing fine in lab but legit am scared that I'm going to fail and have to repeat the course. Tests are crazy hard, lab is hard and hw's are the only thing that can bring your grade up so DO THEM",0
She does not care about students and thinks she is more important than she really is.,0
Mrs. Fernandez is a great teacher! I do not understand how many of you think shes such a bad teacher! She gives great feed back in all your work! She makes the class fun and is willing to help when needed! I had a Two B in her classes so Im not brown nosing but the true is that shes great,1
Her lectures are a regurgitation of the textbook. Instead of explaining proofs she writes duh on the board and moves very fast through material. Tests are extremely hard and she encourages people to withdraw. The only way to do well in this class is if you have seen this material before. This is my 4th math class at Duke & by far the worst.,0
"EASY A, IF YOU CAN TAKE HIM. DON'T HAVE TO DO MUCH EXCEPT, ATTEND CLASS AND HIS TESTS ARE NEXT TO EASY. Teaches very well. Would definitely take him for following Spanish courses if given the chance.",1
"This guy is the worst. Plays favorites like crazy. God forbid you have your phone out in class or else he will take it. He runs his classroom as if it were a high school class, for an upper level business class with mostly seniors in it, it is quite ridiculous. He loves making people feel uncomfortable, has a serious superiority complex. Avoid! ",0
"What you do in class is she assigns a page from the packet, gives you wayyy too much time to do it, goes over it with everyone, and repeat. Homework is completion based, and she allows note cards for exams. Easy, but mind numbingly boring.",1
She doesn't want to see her students fail so will curve a lot but chem for engineers is a hard class to begin with so be ready to struggle.,0
Very good teacher!,1
"Professor Anderson is an average teacher. His pros are that he shows some interesting videos in class, gives study guides, and explains the readings pretty well. His cons are that he doesn't teach as much as you may like for a philosophy class, has quite a few absences because of his kids, and it sometimes isn't clear what readings were assigned.",1
"Mrs. Long was one of the best professors I've ever had. Her class is so easy and exciting. I actually looked forwarded to going to her class. She is not strict on attendance at all, but show up for 20-pt days. She has so many extra credit opportunities, its impossible not to get an A. She lets you turn in assignments late, and tests are not hard.",1
Tests are difficult even if you study. TAs grade essays and don't do a good job. He is not clear on how assignments are graded. It feels like a poi sci major class and not a GE class. Lectures are very very boring. Quizzes are super easy. Readings are interesting. Had a lot of potential to be great but overall not a fun or easy class,0
"This is the best teacher you could ask for. Yeah her exams were difficult, but everything was right in the notes. This professor really cares about the success of her students.",1
She is angry and disrespectful. She is the worst teacher at LAGCC. DON'T TAKE HER IF YOU DO YOU ARE GOING TO REGRET IT.,0
"I took her class in Winter 2013. Grades fairly, reviews well for all quizzes and tests. Japanese food day is awesome! My Japanese is now up to speed thanks to Professor Garrisi.",1
"She told me that college isnt for me and that I will never get a degree, all because I was habitually late by 5 minutes, which she considered to be absent for class. I work full time and was trying to get degree. She was very condescending and ruined my self esteem.",0
We were suppose to have mini quizzes about each reading. Right before the final she decided to cut them out of her grading criteria. I needed help with an essay and scheduled a meeting with her. She cancelled last minute and when I emailed her my question she didn't respond until the day before it was due. She was also late daily and unorganized,0
His instructions are confusing.,0
"Like the last comment said, take a SL class that is five units so that you will not have to take another upper division GE requirement. This class is a waste of time. Only her political view matters and that is what you will be graded on. Another student argued with her and she had the audacity to email us calling us complainers. Good luck.",0
I took this as a general art class. let me just say that if you are not an art/ history major do not bother taking this course. Her lectures are a bit dry. The exams are challenging(unless you love writing papers). Again unless your an art major do not bother taking this class. it will just add to your stress,0
She was awesome! She gives lots of extra credit and I made a B on her first test with no studying! Just take notes (which are slides and she posts half on webct) and you should be fine. I don't know what these other guys are talking about.,1
"Professor was very unorganized. Syllabus was changed but not updated, so class didnt know when anything was due or what was expected of assignments because she changes them without notifying the class. Very hard to contact. Does not use e-mail often. Lots of reading, long lectures where she gets distracted and talks of everything but the material.",0
"Terri is very nice, but she can't really teach. She just reads straight off the PowerPoint and doesn't elaborate on anything. It's pretty much up to you to learn the material on your own. Her tests and quizzes are all multiple choice, but she words her questions weirdly and asks things we don't really cover in class. Avoid if possible.",0
"Shes very nice if you ask for help, and very understanding. However, i took this class as an elective and it felt like a major requirement. Overall, i passed the class and learned a lot!",1
"She does not reply to emails in a timely manner. Days go by. When I receive a reply it is like its typed by a teenager. And I dont get clarification that I needed. All the homework is on this other Connect website (costs 100) so dont bother buying the book, unless you need it. Shes been very unhelpful. Im glad my class is online.",0
"I swam for many years and took this for an easy pe credit. I like him because he swam for a good part of his life and keeps swimming, but is also very intelligent with every stroke and many, many drills. ",1
Prof was cool but he reads off the powerpoint that he provides.,1
"Honestly, if youre willing to put in the work, his class isnt that bad. Your grade will be mostly exam-based, but he gives plenty of sample questions and gives some grading perks to help you succeed. Seriously yall, hell work with you if you work with him and show him that you care about his class.",1
"If she says shes doing the flipped approach get out now, this class was horrible. She did not teach us anything we had to read the chapters and it was like reading spanish. Gave us a quiz BEFORE we had time to ask any queations. All around terrible class",0
"She provided poor feedback and didn't follow the rubric for grading purposes. When I tried to reach out to her for help, she wouldn't respond until it was too late; or not at all. She wouldn't upload the feedback on the first draft till after the final draft was due. I would not recommend this professor with a ten-foot pole.",0
"Allen is easily one of the best professors in the IT department. If you have a chance to take him DO. His assignments are simple and easy to do, he will also scale assignments if the class does badly on them. His classes are never really boring, and he understands the difficulties of group projects. Also he records his lectures and puts them online",1
When you actually aren't miserable sitting in your 8 am class is when you know you have a good professor! Nelly likes to tell personal stories which is great because it helps pass the time. She lets you work in groups which is awesome and guess what!! YOU GET TO PLAY KAHOOT. . . A LOT!!!!,1
"This class is an absolute mess. I missed almost half of the listening assignments because he was not clear how to access them. A nice enough guy, but also very unreliable for extra help outside of class, due to his position in the philharmonic. This is the first ever music class where I will likely not do well, and I've been taking music for years.",0
Reads directly off the slides and does not do class examples. Uses Minitab which only people with PCs can use and it is not offered by the school. Teaches coarse through minitab but tests students using equations. Half of the the test is multiple choice and have no connection with statistics. Gives no reference material to help study for the final.,0
"At first, Dr. Fontenot came off as very rude and unapproachable, but once you get to know him he's very helpful and is willing to work with you. As long as you pay attention in class and do the things he tells you to do you will get an A. Have to be a good writer. Very few grades given.",1
His concepts are not clear and he simply answers doubts vaguely. Teaching is monotonous as if he is frustrated with his own life.,0
This guy gives a lot of tough love in the classroom.   He made the girl next to me cry one day;  but that is his style.  I would go with someone else next time. He is a little too harsh for my taste. ,0
"Very rigid, dont take his class",0
"He is awesome, he allows notes on tests and quizzes and is willing to go over problems that students don't understand. Go to the math lab for extra credit it will help you! Just take him no questions TAKE HIM.",1
hard but good,1
"Horrible teacher, needs to defleat her ego",0
Worst instructor ever. Assignments submitted thru link-received confirmation-she emailed me one week later stating my work was not submitted. This happened more than once.I turned in final assignment twice in error-and was told I never turned it in. When I resubmitted..both assignments were there. She's impossible! Slow and unorganized.,0
"Went into the class thinking it was going to be an easy A for credit.  It was not as easy as I thought, but with all the extra credit he gives you you'll be fine.  Class isn't really mandatory, but you will benefit from going to class as he gives you information that could help you with tests.  3 tests, a little on the harder side, but manageable.",1
"Prof. Evans has great lectures but is not clear at all in his expectations. For example, you'll complete your first assignment with no instructions as to what he expects in your answers and will probably get a low grade. There are only 4 homework assignments, midterm, final exam, and a ""subjective evaluation"" (participation and attendance combined)",1
"She's really cool, and she helps out quite a bit. She also makes some serious and funny quips that might go over some peoples heads.",1
Hilarious and super understanding,1
"Professor Kuhlman is very nice and listens to the students. His lectures are horrible. He just reads off a script or textbook. If you don't understand he will clarify for you but, what are we paying for?Funny teacher but not worth the money. There's no challenge in the class, if you need an easy A then its your class.",0
"Professor Persaud is a really kind person- if you miss a test, she'll give you the opportunity to make it up easily. Pay attention in class and you'll be fine. The only negative I'd say about her is she can be pretty loud, so maybe don't sit in the first row.",1
"Prof. Weber is the definition of laziness. No lesson plan, he teaches out of the book. He makes up problems that backfire in the middle of lecture. (frustrating) He assigns most of odd problems, but class notes are not enough to encounter the difficult problems. You must teach your self and speed lots of hours in the math success center.",0
"He tends to get on his soap box a lot in class. He rambles a lot so don't try to answer his questions. He tends to talk down a bit, I think this is due to having young children so he talks to everyone like that. He exams are very hard (multiple choice is near impossible to get right).",1
"I honestly don't know if she's a good teacher or not. She was extremely late giving back work and grading assignments and didn't respond well to inquiries regarding assignments. Additionally, none of the dates or assignment values matched when looking at the syllabus versus the actual assignments. Really disappointed.",0
"Quizzes were hard, had to use the book a lot, definitely take notes!! Most of quizzes and tests were open note, but still difficult. Pay attention and do the readings and you'll do fine.",1
Susan is AMAZING. She has so much knowledge on the sect of pre-production and she makes every class fun and interesting. She will help you if you take inititive and ask! She helped me a ton. Best professor I probably will ever have!,1
"I had a lot of good things to say about Russell, but they've been clouded by how she correlates eagerness to use quarantine productively with having all the time in the world. Course never had a set schedule (we don't know in advance what to read, when to meet, etc.) until 18 hours prior. Made life miserable & quarantine time even more uncertain.",0
FANTASTIC Prof. The best I ever had,1
His class was enjoyable to sit through and was super easy to pass.,1
"Mr. Andrews gives 3 essays and 1 research paper total 4 essays. he also gives 2 in class essays. you would also do journals, but very easy journals. he makes English fun, but you need to participate in class. you will read articles that are relevant in society, which is very interesting! sometimes i think he should just be a sociology teacher.",1
He is not very caring,0
"Worst proffessor EVER. All she talks about Is her family and how she lived in Spain, without understanding that no one cares. Always makes you participate and if you pronounce something wrong while speaking out she makes you look dumb. Gives a lot of hard test, you must complete the online homework, and you can only miss 2 classes. DONT DO IT",0
Idk why Schellhorn has such terrible reviews. I had her for FIN 200 and she's a really good teacher and offers to help you if you dont understand. The material can be a little difficult at times but she does her best to teach it and you just have to apply yourself like you would for any math class. I would deff take her again!!,1
This was a great class with a great professor. Sigal makes history of colonial Latin America really interesting. Pay attention to lecture in order to do well on the papers and the final.,1
The best prof ever,1
"He is a great teacher! My first semester of college has been full of awful teachers and boring classes, but he has made me love college. He does have an accent but he explains things thoroughly and makes things easy to understand.",1
She will not hold your interest.,0
"She was an easy grader, which I appreciated. Gave credit for discussion board posts and comments on other's posts. There were four group assignments and one group case study, which went pretty smoothly for my group. She seems to give 100% for completing the assignment. Two tests on ProctorU weren't difficult if you remember what's on the PPT slides",1
"Prof. Potvin is a nice guy but I feel like Physics with modeling is more suited for people who have taken some kind of physics before and have a core understanding of it. Like others have said there is very little that gets taught, instead you are supposed to work in groups and figure out the information with only a few LA/TA to help you as needed.",1
"I took him for a maymester class so everything was accelerated. There's a lot of writing about the films! The presentations are easy to follow through but it's hard to find films to watch on netflix/hulu (just google the movie honestly). However the peer review system is awful bc student opinion impacts your grade... aside from that, its ok.",0
He is the worst and does not care how hard he makes a 100 level class. I hate this guy with a passion.,0
"Prepare to do a lot of reading 150+ pgs a week. You have 10 quizzes, 3 journals, 5 discussions, and a 10-15pg final paper. It's a ton of work, but it's something you can use in everyday life.",1
"Very passionate and knowledgeable! Statistics is a very dense subject, but he made it very easy for me to understand! There were times when I struggled, but he was very open to answering my questions before and after class, and was patient and friendly the entire time! Beware: he only helps those who put in an effort! If you're a slacker, avoid!",1
LOTS OF EXTRA BONUSES CREDITS. THX DR. RANDY WATERMAN . THE  # ONE ONLINE BUSINESS LAW 2301,1
Talks about random stuff that is not related to the subject. Changes the date for papers. Not clear on the assignments.,0
Doesn't know how to teach or do the examples he shows. Jumps all over the place. Constantly says umm and uhh.,0
"too easy course , joke",0
"people need to stop rating before the final... but anyways, this class seemed hard at first, but it really isn't. it seems like she wants everyone to get a good grade. i ended up with an A+ and studied for only like 1.5 hours. make sure you go to class for iClickers though. and HW is a little tough, borrow the book or something.",1
"This Professor wants to prove he is smarter than everyone else. He tries to make questions tricky, add questions on material you haven't studied yet, and when you ask for help his reply is always ""read your syllabus"". Just so he can say he did not lie to you, to purposely make you fail!!!",0
"He lectures very fast and always ends up off subject. if you want to be able to read what he's writing on the board, sit in the front. If you can teach yourself, this is your class. If you do the homework you will understand everything but the test and quizzes are the only things he takes for grades so you have to do well on those.",0
"She's a gem, she loves what she does. She is respectful and patient. She sets clear expectations and holds her students to them. If you're take a class with her you will enjoy it and you will learn a lot.",1
"I side with the last commenter on Professor Gilbert being deliciously attractive. He is also creates the most inviting seminar atmosphere, it's definitely a treat attending his class.",1
"Takes attendance every class. Lectures tend to run upclose to the end. He's old school - no powerpoints, no use of iLearn whatsoever so you are unable to access any of the pictures or info that he shares. He speaks monotone. Seems grumpy all the time. Handwriting illegible.  I boughtused the Red CR.  Midterms: A-, B+ Overall Grade: B+",0
"This is her response after she put up a misleading question in a quiz ""Not all facts you are given on a test (and life!) need to be asked in such a way that NO person will ever make a mistake. The onus is on the student to read the question well and think!"" (while in fact, almost everyone misunderstood the question and got wrong answer) What a joke",0
This dude is awsome.,1
"This is an easy online class. Mrs. Bartee is very helpful via email when you need her or have questions. The only bad thing, no extra credit.  At the beginning of the semester, print out your modules of 100 questions and COMPLETE them, and you will have an A on every test. Answers I couldn't find, she was helpful about letting me know the answer.",1
I just took the final and can offically say that this class was a NIGHTMARE! I studied so hard and I still didn't do well. He made chem so difficult to understand. I actually think I know less coming out of this class than I did going in!,0
"Well, TO ALL STUDENTS TAKING instructor Yalan xing, turned out to be a nightmare more so rather than a learning experience, please take this as a warning before signing up for any of her courses, IT'S NOT A JOKE, It's your GRADE! IF YOU DECIDE TO IGNORE MY MESSAGE AND GIVE HER A CHANCE, PLS DO SO IF YOU EITHER, REALLY KNOW CHEMISTRY/ WISH TO FAIL!",0
Tom is a really tough grader that cares a lot about his students. SOC 206 is the reason I am a better writer today. Since SOC 206 I have taken multiple other classes with Tom.,1
"This guy is great.  At least for dynamics he is.  His lecture are pretty clear and he he absolutely loves the topic.  He hates giving out bad grades and gives you every opportunity possible to get extra points.  Only bad thing is he isn't in his office much, but will definitely help you when he is.",1
"Professor Felber set the standard for what feedback should be in an online course.  I've only taken 10 online courses so far, but Felber was by far the most helpful professor that I've had.  Her work isn't the easiest, but she is very fair and consistent with her grading.",1
"Yes, this class was absolutely atrocious. I tried twice; both times I got completely left in the dust. Quizzes are due in the middle of the day with arbitrary start/end times instead of at midnight, so I always missed quizzes with no make-up. Complains about students emailing her, but if you have so many students emailing you there's a PROBLEM.",0
"Bob is a brilliant teacher but grades somewhat hard. Because of him, my writing improved tenfold last semester. You should try and register for one of his classes",1
"If you love 75 minute lectures, this is for you. Lectures are long and his tests are over 2 class periods. Only grades are 4 tests that go over 2 class periods. The problem is its 75 questions and does not relate to the lectures all that well, so its hard to study. I would not recommend, there are definitely better options at Creighton.",0
"I took educ 275 with Karen. You have to go to class every day, and some days get long but the content is really important if youre wanting to go into education. There are two group projects and a few essays, but she cares more about content than rubric. Most days are class discussion or presentation. Definitely recommend for future teachers",1
"Dr. Y. overlooked the physics labs when I took it. My lab section was stuck with an awful TA, Joanna. Everyone complained, but Dr. Y. insisted that it was us and not her. I got a D- in lab and a B+ in lecture. I have a high B average in physics 2 lab+lect. this yr. My grades prove I understand the material yet I was still blamed b/c of an awful TA.",0
"Atrocious teacher to summarize. She uses COVID-19 as an excuse for her poor performance, but we're all going through the same thing. Awful at communicating and has canceled several classes due to ""tech"" issues. She has not graded one assignment for the semester & is making 500 point essays. She basically does not do her job. Paragon of bad teacher.",0
"Mrs. Lusk-Stern honestly made Psychology not all that exciting to me. It wasn't that she was a bad teacher and she is very nice and understanding, but her lectures feel useless and like they go on forever. Most of the lectures she gave only barely touched on the actual test, however she gives you very useful reviews so definitely USE them.",0
"If you have an 89 in the class, you will get a B instead of a B+.  I don't think that is very fair",1
By far one of the worst professors I've ever had. Easy class yet I found myself having to bend over backward just to get an A. Marks you down for no reason. Creates her own grading criteria. I had to email her before every assignment to ask exactly what she was looking for us to do as she never follows the rubric that is provided. It was stressful.,0
He gives wonderful lectures and is able to draw your attention easily. Environmental Issues with John Peck is a class everyone should take.,1
The best professor I've ever had in my life. He is awesome and his beard will make you feel cozy. He is a very legendary professor and I am so privileged to have taken his course. You will not regret it.,1
He is the worst professor of SMU. He makes the question paper way too difficult and wont given consider students problems. He does not reply to emails. Because of him I had to fail the course. Not at all Recommended,0
"The ambiguity of Dr. Eubanks' grading is extremely frustrating. You can expect to receive zeros on assignments with no constructive criticism or explanation, as he seems to have a complete disregard for his own rubric (which he almost never uses). His contradictory feedback makes this class even worse. Awful experience. Do not take this class.",0
"She is funny, and definitely passionate about the subject matter. The poor TA's do most of the grading, so get to know yours well. There is a quiz maybe once every two weeks, but she will sometimes let you use notes so it's not that big of a deal. However, the final project is time consuming so do NOT procrastinate! Stay organized. You'll be fine.",1
He pulls down your course off the D2L before you know your final grade without any notice. I was new to D2. I contacted his boss and the Dean. I scored a couple 80s on the quizzes but mostly 90s and 100s. I scored a 98 on the final exam and I still got a C. I was stunned! He doesn't return emails in a timely manner. I DO NOT reccomend this guy!,0
"Although Corsi is respected by many, I think his teaching style is irrelevant and unnecessary. He sits at the front of the classroom and begs the students to talk about what they read. He does not know how to lecture, instead demands students to facilitate the discussions. It is an easy class, if you attend and participate, but a waste of time.",1
Señor Newall cares about his students and this class shouldn't be hard if you're decent at Spanish and keep up with the readings and homework that every SPAN 210 class gets. He gives good lectures to supplement the homework and leaves a lot of his class for practicing grammar and conversation. Would take again.,1
"Professor Winogora is the best. He tries his best to make the class fun and engaging, while encouraging conversation. It's a fun time, and he doesn't penalize you for having opinions if you can back them up. He gives an assignment for every class, but they're usually short and just help you keep up to date with what's going on in class.",1
This instructor was the best instructor I have had at NWACC hands down! She was very prompt about grading our discussion posts and gave great feedback! She was very engaged with us as students and with the material. Too bad you can't clone her.,1
"Ms. Donham is a knowledgable teacher. Shes fairly clear in class of what to do and she basically walks you through all of the programming homework. Also, she lets you use notes on the test. Its an easy A.",1
"yeah, tell her she's pretty, and you will get a good grade",0
"Dreadful instructor! Completely unprepared, gives As pretty much to all as to compensate for her inability to teach. Shows up late, returns assignments way late. She acts nice in view of teaching evaluations: an insult to our intelligence. One of the worst classes at UBC!",0
Easy going professor. He never gives back your grades or post on Bb. Might seem like an easy A but must keep track of your grade by urself. If not you will get something different from what you think u will get. If u really want to learn spanish not a good choice. Everything mostly take home but make sure to ask what u get!! Be on top of ur grades.,0
Obviously there is a lot of presentation.  Feedback is helpful.  One main project with a paper and powerpoint and 7 minute presentation for the final.  Smaller assignments and group projects due throughout the course.,1
"Wonderful teacher!!! She explained the problems and made them easy to understand. We used the online course Aleks, the textbook was never even opened. Homework every night. she offered extra credit if you went to the math lab. I passed with an A!",1
"I wish I had listened to other reviews about her being a slow grader. It was week 4 before we had grades from week 1. This continued throughout the session.    She leaves feedback in odd places that no other professors use, so it's hard to locate.   Zero content in the class ""resources"" tab.   5th professor I've had at APU and by far the worst.",0
Be careful of the ideas you share in class.,1
"It's important to go to class, take notes, do the hw, and practice multiple times. His class wasn't too difficult. I felt that the material was easier than Macroecon. He drops the lowest midterm score and adds points to all 3 midterms and the final. He also provides good practice tests for the 3 midterms. Take him!",1
"The best professor I have ever had. This professor is super nice and super easy. If you really want to learn I highly recommend you to take this professor, he is very professional and the most important is that he is willing to help you. Everybody will pass his class.",1
"He's a good person, very nice and understanding but this class was extremely difficult. It was very hard to understand him and couldn't understand the material. I am not the best at math and the way he explains things isn't very clear. He'll teach things expecting you to already know what hes explaining.",1
"Patrick is a fantastic teacher. He is extremely helpful, his lectures are interesting, and you will learn! You do need to work hard to get an A but he will help you every step of the way. Definitely take his courses!",1
"DO NOT TAKE HER FOR HONORS DISCUSSION. As funny and sophisticated and intelligent as she is, I got absolutely nothing out of this class.  She asks too many questions during discussion, and no one knows how to answer them.  When a student tries to ask a question, it never gets answered.  She is a pretty fair paper grader, but this class was awful.",0
"Let me say off the bat that Duba is not my cup of tea. I think that he needs to spend less time creating humorously contrived analogies and more time learning how to teach and present information clearly. He is a neat guy, but a mediocre teacher at best. Still, he's much better than our little Greek friend.",1
"Dr. Z has a thick accent which originally was very difficult to understand. After about two weeks of lecture, I began to understand her more clearly. She writes everything she is saying on the slides and is very knowledgable about anatomy and physiology. Overall, she is very sweet and very approachable and tries to make this hard class bearable.",1
"I graduated over a decade ago, but Pearson's cruelty stuck with me. He seemed to think he was some sort of revolutionary acting teacher by being such a jerk with students, but really he was just rude, condescending, and on a power trip. I missed my grandpa's funeral because of him. That pretty much sums it up.",0
"Worst professor/class experience I have had at UCSC thus far. Unnecessarily mean and an absolute B. Horrendous experience, wouldn't recommend her to anyone. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASSES. Takes her frustrations out on her students and not one person I've talked to who has had her had anything good to say. Pretty much a 100%  ""hated it"" consensus.",0
I have enjoyed every single one of Professor Ferguson's classes. He knows the subject inside and out. You can tell that he enjoys his job and that makes a big difference. Show up with an open mind and you can very well expect to get new perspective and a laugh. He is definitely a professor who makes history a story which one can follow.,1
Brutal professor. At least half of the class had a failing grade entering the final. I might as well have taken $500 dollars and thrown it into a fire.,0
"Professor Ou Yang is great professor with in-depth knowledge in Accounting. The class projects will give you a clear understanding of how an analyst will do in real world. However, the final is a little bit challenging if you are not an Accounting major. Over all, he is a nice professor and you will be inspired by some of his thoughts and ideas. ",1
Didn't really understand the lectures,0
"Denice Douglas is a professional during the day and a professor at night. She may take a while to respond to emails. She is very understanding and has a great sense of humor. She's pragmatic in understanding that people have jobs and other commitments. Plenty of time to do homework, and she's very kind and respectful towards her students.",1
"Her expectations are unrealistic. It took myself and my fiance tag-teaming this course to get through it, my fiance is a teacher. Every week there are 6 writing assignments. There were so many links to so many different sources of information. It was absolutely ridiculous. If you are going back to school as an adult, you dont have time for this...",0
"Francis is very knowledgeable in his subject area. Though, he is not a native English speaker his ability to impart knowledge to his students is very rewarding. You will find his class very lively if you have some High School math foundation. He provides many worked examples, which are very helpful for the midterm and final exams. ",1
Prof. Lee was a great Intro to Art History professor. She does go fast but with the great result of having covered practically the entire history of art by the end of the semester. If you're serious about art history she's a great professor but If you're just taking this class for the requirement it may be a lot of work.,1
"This is the worst professor ever. I have never had so many assignments for one course, and they are all due at the same time, they aren't spread out. She will tell you to use tons of sources while also telling you to make up info. She never grades and then gets behind.  And once she gets to it she's a crazy hard grader. Never ever take this class.",0
Prof. Rico does a great job of making the material available outside of class which was beneficial if you didn't instantly grasp a topic. The course is pretty straight forward but he is easy to understand and an all-around good guy. 10/10 recommend.,1
"Super easy, will drop quizzes if a majority of the class does poorly. Entertaining lectures because he's funny and really loves his subject.",1
"If I could give Dr. Brown a 0, I would. He is by far the worst instructor I have EVER had. This was an asynchronous class, so there was no live lectures through Zoom, just videos he posted on the website. The lectures weren't helpful and he always rambled, never going back to the info that was important. Didn't give partial credit on the exams.",0
"horrendous and absolutely terrible. her explanations leave you more confused than before the explanation, assignments don't make any sense at all and quizzes are very hard",0
"Not only does Adrianne lead a miserable life, but she will make yours miserable too.  She is extremely stubborn and won't own up to her mistakes.  Her opinions are all that matter to her, which proves that she isn't a deep thinker.  Avoid taking classes from her!",0
acosta was an okay teacher but moves to fast,0
"I wanna say chemistry is hard but his class is easy to understand. I am currently having 98.6% after taking three lecture exams(still have one more and one final). He does offer extra credits for each exam and quiz, andthat helped a lot. Also, you must study every question on mock exam and practice problem cuz he will test the very similar question",1
"He's extremely rude for no reason. He always has an attitude, and teaches horribly!! You can barely understand what he says and if you ask a question he answers sarcastically. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND HIM! HE IS HORRIBLE!!!",0
Tries to teach too much in too short a time and isn't very clear or helpful if you have questions.,0
"Hawk is the most relatable professor you will ever meet. His class challenges you not through work, but by through everyday discussions. He's very open minded and gives pretty interesting prompts that will make you eager to write. He's pretty laid back in the sense that he will be your friend, but you do have to be prepared to talk a lot.",1
"Dr. Ford is a really enthusiastic teacher and puts every effort to get students excited about the course material. He doesn't generally use powerpoint. He does ensure all his teaching documents, handouts, slides and overheads are updated every year which is rare and undervalued. Dr. Ford wants you to do well.",1
Do not take him. If you ask questions he will denounce and embarrass you. He then gets angry people won't answer questions. Also he got mad at our class and stopped posting lectures on d2l to punish us. His book is full of errors and does not explain equations and formulas.,0
"I've never met a prof who specifies using a (TERRIBLE) template for submitting assignments and refuses to let students add/remove space after questions. There's not enough space and all she can say is ""you can format it to fit"". These are equations we're talking about, NOT a resume. Assignments are also not on the actual content ""taught"". Horrible.",0
"Mathi is a nice person but by far the absolute worst teacher I have ever had. Avoid at all costs. I personally have never done so bad in a class. I went to her office hours, had to get a tutor, etc. AVOID THIS PROF!! She is hard to understand and even harder to follow. Not technological, and does not give good feedback. save your gpa.",0
"Professor Hulsey is nice and wants her students to do well; However, her lectures are boring . She has a lot of connect hw assignments that aren't hard but are sometimes annoying. The tests aren't super hard, but you will need to study to do well. Hulsey offers extra connect assignments as extra credit, but they don't help that much. v average.",1
Great professor. Really cares about the material and is passionate. He makes it interesting to learn about (as much as he can). Tests can be difficult if you dont study and take notes. Assignments are once a week and fairly straightforward and not very difficult. Overall good class and excellent professor.,1
It is recommended to review your grade with other students and the professor. His grading is inconsistent therefore ask for an answer key. He did not update grades in the D2L only grade posted online was the overall final.,0
"Terry blows the trumpet so well. Unfortunately, he also blows on all else: his teaching, committee work, and advising. His insecurities make him a stubborn, narrow-minded, defensive type. His idea of intelligence is not knowing how to consider issues in an intellectual manner but memorizing obscure facts so as to appear smart. Socially awkward.",0
Extremely great teacher to have if you are a budding writer (poetry OR short stories). Hopefully we'll get more students now that we have writing Majors.,1
"great instructor, really helps everyone out and is lineant with the work he assigns.",1
"I had Mi-Sook for the new module-oriented foundation courses for Art majors. The thing I disliked the most was unclear directions-- changed from class to class, and if she misspoke, she would act like that's what she had been saying all along. Also, she was hard just to be hard, not to help. She generalized students, didn't feel like she cared.",1
She good. If you work hard you will get an A paper but if you do average expect a B or C.,1
"Awful. Took him four years ago, still salty about it. Wouldn't recommend.",0
"Every other class period there were quizzes that were from the homework. She said the quizzes were your study guide for exams, but they were much more than that. She would get confused in lectures, homework wouldn't match lecture, & exams were tough bc didn't match the way she taught in lectures. DO NOT TAKE UNLESS YOU HAVE THE TIME. ",0
"Always dreaded going to his class. Not helpful when you dont understand something. Pynn was an overall nice and funny person, but as a professor, I do not recommend AT ALL. Your grade depends on 4 tests that are not multiple choice. He grades extremely harsh and is not understanding nor caring towards his students whatsoever.",0
"This man is the love of my life. Awesome professor. His stories and his jokes make the class what it is. His lectures are pretty lengthy, however, so show up every week. Tests aren't too hard, they're you're typical psychology tests. Cherish any class you have with him, not all psych professors are this good.",1
"Highly recommend him. Took Cal 2 and 3 with him. Gave extra points in exams and still at the end. Always answers emails. Met with me at his office for extra help. Clear explanations. I would take him again, no question. Learned a lot from him. Best math teacher from all I had at HCC.",1
"Not really a cinema class, more of a study on social cultures and politics' effect on movies made worldwide. Some movies were genuinely a bore to watch but some were great films I wouldn't have seen otherwise. I made it through the essays, group presentation, and quizzes with only seeing 3/16 movies. The lectures were very boring as well.",0
"Caldwell is a decent professor. I was not a huge fan of his teaching style, he moved through material super fast without enough examples. But I did liked the notes he provided for every topic. He did give a lot of homework but he gave a lot of points for that. And the practice tests were very helpful, very similar problems on a real test.",1
"Professor- mostly serious, dull The class- only guest speakers, boring and long, annoying, heavy group work. On top of this class being pointless, he was not a good professor. Constantly talked about himself and about how he made it through college and complained about his paycheck like theres no tomorrow. Super Easy hw Pointless class but easy A.",0
"Most incoherent prof I have ever had, and I regret taking him. He just shows videos, can't teach. He has no degree related to what he teaches (check KPU faculty). Do not take him.",0
This class is the best class you will take at WSBE. It was helpful and you'll learn a lot about yourself.,1
His lectures are extremely well organized. His tests come directly from lecture notes (never used the book). He doesn't require any other work for the class. I enjoy this class bc it doesn't take much effort to pass. I highly recommend taking him!,1
Extremely inconsistent and unfair marking. Feedback that was given made no sense. Instructions for assignments were outdated. Her expectations did not align with the course syllabus. Very poorly designed course. Do not recommend to anyone. Not an Easy A by any means. Was not willing to discuss grades in person or over the phone.,0
"great professor and helper, take his class if you can.",1
"I am a straight A student, so I'd like to think I have some credibility. Maybe the problem is that Mastering Physics is a terrible system to try to teach with. However, she does not teach thoroughly.  Read the textbook regularly, it helps. See her after class, she explains info well there. Her lectures are useless, though.",0
She grades really hard but the tests are probably the WORST part. She only gives you 30 min for 20 questions even though in the syllabus it says 40 min. Her reviews are almost useless because taking the test there is more info that you needed than provided. 10/10 do not recommend.,0
Just a terrible influence on anyone actually serious about writing. Does not help with writing at all. one text goes on for weeks and she will mark you down if your vision and her's are different. Tip: if she makes a note on your draft do it exactly for a good grade. her exams are pointless. Avoid taking her unless you can take class high.,0
I agree with the student before me - everyone gets an easy A - just show up. Sometimes hard to understand.,0
She usually answers emails immediately but is kinda rude with her responses. DONT GO TO CLASS! she just reads word for word from the exercises in the text book and attendance doesn't count. just make sure to do the work at home. Tests are very time pressured. She's very unforgiving when you run out of time. MAKE SURE TO DO THE PRACTICE EXAMS!!!,0
Dr. Currier was an excellent teacher! I would really recommend her for this class. She wants you to succeed and she makes the class more interesting and manageable.,1
"Does not follow her syllabus rules. First extension needed two weeks before the end of the semester and she denies it. Syllabus states the second extension and after require a note, however she denies it for that reason even after showing her the syllabus. Now my A will be dropped to a C with no room to grow. Almost failing",0
Very unorganized and difficult to understand. He can be very intimidating. His tests were confusing and somewhat unrelated to the emphasized topics in lecture. He has cool ties though.,0
"Hey Jason, if you are reading this like you always do, I just wanted to let you know that you are one of the worst English teacher's ever. Gain some humility too.",0
"The worst experience ever. She doesnt help at all, you ask her a question,  What does your book say? Will be her response. The amount of work expected is excessive. Please save yourself the time and pick another professor. She expects you to know 8 chapters worth of material for her tests, no multiple choice questions either. Just horrible!",0
"Grading criteria is never clear. Susan has developed a bad attitude towards students and if she doesnt like you, you will know. You have to participate to get in her good books and even then, if your opinion is doesnt match hers she wont like you. She has no passion for the industry at all anymore.",0
"Ruder was an okay teacher. My one complaint is that he graded the 2nd half of our project the day that the 3rd part was due, which was not helpful at all. It's like a teacher handing back your rough draft the day the final one is due, and then complaining later that you didn't make any corrections. He is a good teacher, just needs to grade better.",0
Took a 1.0 credit class with her. You can tell shes very passionate about what she teaches. Don't be distracted or text in class cause she will get very butthurt about it and make announcements. Overall a wonderful teacher really engages with students. Only had one exam which was based off the notes and readings. You should do the readings.,1
"Great professor. She gives a good amount of extra credit (an extra 2% to your grade) in the form of optional online test reviews that you can take as many times as you want (and it shows you the right answer when you submit, so you can easily obtain all extra credit points). She gives an optional final that can take the place of a bad test grade. ",1
"This dude is an embarressment to higher education. Does not answer emails, everything is last kinute. Completely useless to grad students. Just go do something else, what a joke.",0
"very tough...lots of reading and writing. helpful, but an impossible grader",0
"Hans is the worst professor I have ever had at IUP. Regardless of the work you do, he just picks the grade he wants to give you. He tends to do in class activities when a large portion of the class isn't there. His lectures are extremely boring and he reads right off of slides. Lots of awkward pauses during lectures and he doesn't communicate well.",0
"If you can help it, don't take her for an online course. She is very hard to get in touch with, especially via email. Grades were posted timely the first few weeks of class, then she just stopped giving feedback, posting grades, and responding to emails until the last day of class. It's hard to improve if you don't know how you're doing in class.",0
very tough! if you don't understand she'll try to help but ends up being useless. Hated class with her.,0
He was a really nice and helpful prof. He gives you tests ahead of time so you can look over it and make sure you study the right stuff as there is a TON of material in this course. There are a lot of readings to be done. His lectures are interesting mainly because of his enthusiasm and passion for the topics.,1
"Do not take a class with this professor. Worse grade I've ever gotten, most of my classmates dropped the course prior to the end (now I know why). Does not explain things well, slow grader, accusatory. I will never take a course with this instructor again, & I would recommend you don't either!",0
I love Jason he was literally the greatest and I will miss not having him as a professor anymore.,1
Favorite professor since I've been in college. I'm actually taking another class of his next semester.,1
Great teacher! Extremely knowledgeable on American Foreign Policy. I liked that he was willing to give feedback on any assignment (both before and after the due date.) He allows you to submit as many drafts as you want. He is a bit of a tough grader and expects a lot from his students. Need to do the readings!!,1
Best teacher ever!!!! Prof Ball made math fun and easy to learn. Hilarious man and very very inspiring!,1
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS if you want to pass.,0
Professor Campbell provided scant feedback and is not open to others' interpretations - quite closed-minded. Not helpful during office hours and is quite condensing as a TA - she dominated the entire seminar and berated students' opinions. Does not want you to succeed. It baffles mean that she is still teaching. Absolutely awful.,0
"Ryan is a very nice guy and is receptive to feedback. However, he is not a very good professor and is extremely unorganized in his lectures. Doesn't really seem prepared a lot of times and students are forced to wait for him in class. He is very unclear on his grading and changes his expectations all the time. 10/10 would not recommend",0
PROF FARHAT IS COOL !! SHE HAS SUCH A GREAT PERSONALITY AND SHES INTERESTING BUT HER PAPERS AND RESEARCH TAKES FOREVER. SOMETIMES ITS HARD TO UNDERSTAND HER WHEN SHE TEACHES BECAUSE SHE SPEAKS VERY PROFESSIONALLY BUT OVERALL SHES AWESOME. SHE PREPS YOU UP FOR THE REAL WORLD AND SHE DOES NOT BABY YOU! *MAKE SURE TO NEVER SAY BAD WORDS IN HER CLASS,0
"Very generous grader in public speaking class. If you try, she cuts you a lot of slack. Explained exactly what she wanted and even gave examples of outlines to follow in the class. Wasn't  nerve racking since most speeches were with a team. If someone on team didn't do their part, she gave individual grades to members so, do your part!",1
"Pretty Hard. Lectures aren't that helpful, but they're not useless either. Homeworks will take at least 1-2 hours. Tests are really hard and not enough time was given. Not many things are graded, so it's hard to end with a good grade. I messed up on the first few hws, which led me to fail the class. I wish there were another prof to retake it with.",0
This is my second course with Leila. She's very helpful and understanding of students' circumstances. I like her lessons both online and and in person. Strongly recommend taking her classes.,1
"Awful course layout - 4 exams spread over the semester with term paper; also overemphasis on ""community service learning"" where you basically do academically-based volunteer work for organizations (How can this be worth 40%?). Lots of reading in this course as well, but that's to be expected for courses like this one. Lectures are incredibly dull.",0
Tough Grader. I feel like she doesn't give out A's at all in this class.,0
"Lynn talks excruciatingly slowly and the lectures are painful. She grades homework so harshly for absolutely no reason and doesn't explain things well AT ALL. I would rather drop out of college than take this class again. She made me cry on the first day and if you like yourself at all, don't take her class. You will fail.",0
"Presents relevant content with practical application.  Conscientious, generous, invested, knowledgeable.",1
Terrible experience... Her voice is quite low... Too much homework always due in a short time...,0
Liked him as a person but is horrible as a professor. He should stick to what he is good at- writing. He plays favorites and I never had him as a professor prior to Sales. However in my one and only semester with him I found all the rumors to be true...worst semester ever. IF there is ANYONE else teaching Sales - Getaway from Gerber!!,0
"Easily the best prof I have had at UNC! His lecture style is clear and well-paced, he handles questions well and you get the sense that he is on your side. As someone who had NEVER taken a physics class in high school, I came into this class scared but I felt that the class was well-structured and Prof Wallace taught the content very well.",1
"Great Professor! He is tough for a reason, he wants you to succeed and is by far the best professor I had since being at DePaul. If you're not serious about getting in the business then you have no business being in this class!",1
"I took Dr. B's class at rose state. He is very funny, but his test are way to hard. He does give you a chance by writing critical essays and things like that.His opinion of you I do think might effect your grade and he is not afraid to call you out.I really like him as a person though, very funny guy.He does make History interesting.",0
Prof. Cutler had done nothing to help her class. half the people dropped out after the first exam and lies about what will be on quizzes. She does an awful job at explain questions that students have. It seems as though she is setting her students up for failure. I would NOT take this ever again with her.,0
"Love his classes and personality, which is really interesting, however it's just way too difficult. I think he tries to prepare us for the real LTAM exam difficulty, but the pace is just too fast. Exams are usually a lot harder than HWs and quizzes, which can be a shock attack to lots.",1
"This is hands down the worst professor I have ever taken a class with. Please heed my advice and don't listen to the other reviews and get fooled like I did. Maybe at one time Jeff was a good teacher, but now, I wouldn't even call him a teacher because he does. not. teach. He drones on about irrelevant things & tells people their OPINIONS are wrong",0
I had Professor Were for two semesters and I always enjoyed her class. The lectures were structured in a way that made French easy and understandable. I had originally planned on just taking this course to get the language requirement out of the way but now I hope to take more French courses in the future.,1
"He does not communicate no matter how many times you email him. He will also give you points off but not tell you why and tell you your essay was written well. Very unorganized, not clear when things are due.",0
One of the best profs at PSU hands down.  Fair clear engaging.  You will learn and love it while you do.  It will change you as a student for the better.,1
"Lectures/discussions are mandatory, attendance will be taken. Exams are easy as she gives a complete study guide with all of the material on it, just memorize. Papers are graded rather harshly (especially the first one). They look for a very specific format for the papers and it is up to you to figure out what that is.",1
This professor is great and easy! Take him for any EDU course that you need. You will not regret it.,1
"Professor McCormick was very understanding and quick at responding. Her class is very easy if you don't fall behind. It's an easy A if you do what you need to do. She has a few projects, quiz's and 2 exams throughout the class. Sometimes it can be a lot of reading but most times she provides a lot of Power Points, which are helpful.",1
"the worst ever. she makes the course so so so hard. also, she challenges the students. She feels satisfies if the student can't answer her quizzes or exams.",0
"Honestly the most nasty professor I have ever had. Rude, doesn't make sense and blames you if you don't understand the information. Come on shelton.",0
"The only thing you need is the access code, didn't use the textbook. Attendance is not mandatory. I only went to class for a month and stopped. Everything is online aka, assignments and exams. If you go to class the day before and exam she'll tell you what's on the exam There is a research paper but it's for participation. Easy A. Would take again.",0
He is a chill man. Very smart and teaches well. Very clear and super helpful!!,1
"Get ready for boot camp, because that's what you get. Non-stop work, she seems to flaunt how many students she has turned into the Deans for plagiarism. Very strict on everything, there is no room for anything but what she wants and when she wants it, and it is a lot.",0
He cares deeply for the subject and that makes the lectures so much easier to sit though. ,1
"If it is your goal to learn the science of nutrition, do not take this class - with this professor. Expect to find all of her test questions searchable on Quizlet (even the online midterm), and to be blindsided for the final. Personally, I know a lot about nutrition - A LOT, and I hoped to learn something here. Nope. She is a robot, sadly.",0
"Professor Wood cares A LOT about her students. When ""life"" happens she will be there for you 100%. If you care she will also. She wants you to understand the meterial, and also pass her class. She is so smart and makes math easy for those who find it hard to understand. She is my absolute favorite professor. Keep up with the work and you will pass",1
BEWARE!!! He is a horrible online teacher. I DO NOT recommend taking him at all. He doesnt respond to emails whatsoever. I went to meet with him about my grades because projects that I turned in months ago still hadnt been graded. He didnt know that he hadnt make the final available to us until I met with him that day..,0
"very dull and boring, his time has passed. great guy, but not too effective on the educating side",0
"Frequently late to class, rarely responds to emails, tests you over things that aren't covered but doesn't use the book. She requires you to purchase the book even though it's on canvas... We're very behind and continuously get farther behind because she goes off on tangents about her kid or husband. DO NOT take",0
THe BEST lecture ever ever,1
"Easy, Easy, Easy. This class is basically a highschool review.",1
I missed class due to medical issues and had the papers she did not want to help me catch up and asked me to withdraw so i wouldn't fail,0
"Great guy, just not a good teacher. Lectures were almost impossible to follow. He did more examples as the semester went on but still not enough. Exams are pretty difficult (averages were around 50%) but he curves strongly so that the average is around a B-. He does want you to do well. Just can't explain material well enough. Self taught myself.",0
"Dewey's not the best COMS teacher. He doesn't answer emails at a timely matter. He also doesn't post grades on blackboard. He evaluates every speech but never passes back what you got so you can't really improve on anything since you don't know where to improve. Also, he did say that there will be reading quizzes but won't tell you when they are.",0
"The topic matter was very interesting, but my major complaint is the way he talks to students. He loves heckling people and making you feel badly for attempting or guessing. It's really unfortunate because the class could have a lot of productive discussions, but if you get called on randomly and don't answer correctly he will make you feel small",1
"He sincerely cares about his students and their learning. Doing all he can to help them. He provided examples of all materials presented and was very interesting to listen to. He told us what he expected and there was no tricks on the test. If you study hard, you'll do fine. Lee is a very interesting professor and I have recommended him to others.",1
Take her class before she realizes she's way too good for Reynolds and leaves. Love her. Wish she would teach every level English class so I never had to take another professor's class. A true gem.,1
Watkins is a genuine professor who cares highly about his students. He has traveled the world and has the most amazing stories. I would take another class with him in a heartbeat. He likes to engage in discussions which makes learning more interesting.,1
"Positives: he grades on such a generous curve you're bound to get a decent grade. Negatives: you must show up for ALL classes to take notes, and he gives homework every day. If he doesn't like you for whatever reason he is extremely rude and disrespectful! My friends and classmates have told me I should report him to the Dean for what he's done!",0
"First off, HORRIBLE professor. Don't even take him at all. Avoid at all costs. Don't expect to make up or re-take a test if you fail. Theres no chance of improving your grade. I have an A on all the homework because I dedicate my time, yet I am still failing.  Tests are not even as close as to the study guides. This is CALCULUS. It is a hard class!",0
Best English teacher! I would definitely take again,1
"Criminal justice professor that lectures more about politics. Very irritating. Guy rambles about how bad trump is, which whatever thats fine, but don't do it in class when I pay large amount of money to attend school here.",0
Amazing professor. Makes morning enjoyable and he is very detailed about his lessons.,1
"He was an okay teacher, you could tell it was his first class ever. He didn't do attendance often but when he did, it was in the form of group discussions in class. Not too bad, didn't grade too harshly.",0
"his bioethics class was great. interesting material, and if you're willing to participate great discussions. he is really enthusiastic, and you will get a lot out of his class if you put in a little effort. tough paper grader, but he's willing to provide as much help as you ask for.",1
"Most boring teacher ever! She lectures all class and puts people to sleep. The class teaches the basics of word, powerpoint and excel. Its suppose to be pretty easy if you know how to use these programs, right? NOPE there is so much homework due every week and there is a test every week. She thinks we don't take any other classes. NO NOT TAKE!",0
Professor Yemut teaches straight from the text book. He lectures 2 hours straight. Lets u leave 30 min early. His tests are hard. He does offer 10 points extea credit and drops the lowest test grade. I was .2 ponts away from a B �� wich sux.,0
Gets in your face a lot. Treats you as if you're still in Middle School. I wouldn't recommend her class at all. Less than half of the class stayed for her class before I left.,0
"She was not very clear.. She would start speaking and stop mid-sentence. She may be good at teaching other subjects but speech class is not for her. But one thing I like about her is that when you give your speeches, she doesn't critique you harshly like other professors do.",0
"I sm majoring in business so I had to take Macroeconomics. Be warned you have to teach yourself in this class. Most of what you learn will be on the test, but some questions you have to read 3-4 times cause they are ""trick"" questions. You are required to do a paper at the end about how to boost Maine's economy, and she gives no help whatsoever!!!!",0
"AMAZING product, would buy again. I recommend this to all my friends.",1
"I took TV production this year and I am learning nothing! Molloy is such a joke for TV and Film. They should call the class, TV production for Dummies. This is a TV, it is square, anything techncal I have no idea how to teach. Talk about a teacher who is crying out for students to like him. Maybe he should change his teaching style and be a so call",0
"If you're looking to fail math, she's your teacher! She's probably a nice person, but she's a horrible teacher. She assumes everyone in the class has already taken the course in a previous school or something.Relies on MathXL to teach, lots and lots of MathXL. If I wanted to teach myself math, I would have just bought a textbook.",0
Loved Professor Yarotsky! His class was amazing & he made the information interesting. It's a lot of material so be prepared to study hard for the exams. Take notes during lectures because exams are majority based on the lecture. Use the book just to go over what he says. Can seem overwhelming but he's fair and a great teacher.,1
"rude, careless, unhelpful, seems lost. I mean, he is the only prof for CORP FINANCE and there is a huge waiting list for the online version of this class which explains a lot.",0
Very easy class if you do the work assigned. You will never stay the full class. He lets you out early every time. Expect to go to class to write the essay and then leave. You will love his class.,1
"5 questions quizzes every class bout assigned reading, sounds easy right? Wrong. Questions always consist of the most trivial parts of reading! Tests are multiple choice, but don't let that fool you! They are still extremely difficult! The course material is challenging to say the least and his ;lectures do not clarify anything! Also talks too fast",0
"Highly recommended professor. Makes an effort to have you connect to the class and material. He's very knowledgeable on the material and interested. Not one of these robot professors who just reads off powerpoints. Key to succeed: Review the class material prior to class, go to class and participate, show up for reviews and ask away.",1
Could not even ask questions because she talked the entire class period. If you tried to ask something she would shush you. Infamous for going on tangents that do not even relate to the material. She crammed 6 assignments in the end of the semester because she used up all the time talking about irrelevant topics. I would not recommend taking her. ,0
"One of the worst professors I have ever  had. He didn't explain the work in a manner that all students could understand, & would not help students that were not clear. His class was  with out a doubt the longest hour& 40 minuets ever. Stay away...",0
"His lectures are boring. He never gives back any grades until the very end, so you don't know how to improve lab write ups. The semester long paper is really important to him only after he give back the rough draft. He kills your writing. Readings are really boring and long.",0
"Roxi was ALWAYS late to class. She grades you based on 5 essays and 25% participation. If you aren't her favorite, she is very rude and intimidating. Lots of reading and papers.",0
"The first professor Ive ever rated 5 stars. I absolutely enjoyed myself in his class. Attendance is mandatory if you want an A and doing the homework will save your life on the quizzes. It took some effort to keep an A in his class, however, he really made learning the material exciting and hes always so willing to help. Favorite professor by far",1
She is lecture heavy but it isn't tested. You will mainly write short papers and group activities. It is an interesting class to take if you are not a ling. major.,1
"She's awful.  I'm taking her for Phonetics, which she says isn't her ""specialty.""  She never knows the right answer, and we're always correcting her because she contradicts herself. Maybe she's good at teaching other subjects, but not this class",0
He didn't make his grading criteria clear at all and then scolded the whole class for missing the point of the paper. He will make your life so much harder than it needs to be. Take literally any other professor for this class if you can.,0
dread going 2 that class. doesn't talk about anything that is on the tests just talks about 1 topic for more than 3 weeks at a time but than expects you 2 know all that is on the quiz/tests. extremely boring and has too many readings. each assignment is doing a reading from each book which makes things a little confusing. DONT GET HER FOR A TEACHER,0
"in office hours he refused to tell me which multiple choice questions I got wrong (after the exam): how is someone supposed to proactively improve their stratgies and weak areas, if they are not told which questions are wrong. What is the ppoint of picking up an exam that has no marks except for a total on the top. He doesnt even post an answer key",0
"Worst class I've honestly ever taken. Majority of the students failed due to the professor being very boring, off topic constantly, and confused.  Despite the fact that he is nice older gentleman, the stress level within the class IS NOT WORTH IT. Do not take this class unless your willing to cry after seeing your test scores.",0
he is very hard; i would not recommand him at all !,0
Extremely rude and doesn't help you if you ask. Tells you that you did an assignment wrong without telling you specifically what you missed.,0
"Read and ""Practice"" what he gives. Don't study text book. His sample papers will be easy but exam will be really tough and confusing. No assignments. No attendence.  Russian accent. Only problems even though he gives theoretical questions in sample paper. RTT is a must read topic.",0
"15% curve on exams, lotsa extra credit, extra credit exam, 2 attempt optional exam that drops lowest grade, answers any and all questions with much depth post class and  well during class. Lectures are def way worse than  Sarathy but Sarathy def isnt better since both have same book and tell you to study the whole chapter but Sarathy doesn't curve.",1
Blanton is super boring. He is a nice person but a horrible professor. He will try to make jokes; you will not laugh. Half the class is spent on him trying to figure out the computer. Not the worst class but you must be disciplined; it's easy to fall asleep.,0
"She will take any chance in class to promote being organic. She talks about her personal life a lot to try to relate to the lesson. There were 3 test and a final. If you look over the study guide and memorize it then you'll pass. She counts the class activity at the end as classwork, so come to class and you'll be fine. There's a presentation too.",1
"I am an upper level student and I found the exam unnecessarily hard. He went over the lecture notes but failed to mention that there would be many questions that weren't in the lecture. Also, he had too many answers to multiple choice that were ALL TRUE, and you had to pick the ""most"" true. His lectures aren't worth attending if you read the book.",0
"The kind of professor that won't give an A. She was helpful when I needed it, but she could be very hot or cold. She would snap sometimes and be extra sweet others; I couldn't tell exactly what she thought of me. Definitely a writing-heavy class with quick deadlines, but you learn a lot in 10 weeks. ",0
Professor Hopkins is one of the best professors I've ever taken. She is patient and very caring. She wants you to succeed in this class. If you need her to repeat any material she does not hesitate to make sure you understand the information clearly. I highly recommend her! Take her class!,1
"Do yourself a favor: don't take this class. If you need honors credit, take psychology. He is so bad that he told us that ratemyprofessor is full of students that failed the class and are illiterate. I obviously didn't fail and he was bad enough that I needed to let anyone that is considering his class know that they need to reconsider.",0
Prof Bone was a nice person overall but expects a lot out of her students. Grading criteria are very specific and there are a lot of assignments that she expects to be done (even if they aren't for a grade). She pushes students to critically think and participate during class. Some of her questions on tests/quizzes can have tricky wording.,1
Worst professor I ever took this semester  she's disorganized and confusing ended up getting a D in her class BIG MISTAKE!!,0
"He can be hard to understand at times, but he's highly intelligent and perhaps intimidatingly so at times. The better your attendance, the better you'll do. He can make snide or condescending remarks, but I've never felt insulted. His sense of humour is rather dry, and he often compares French to other languages, which can sometimes be confusing.",0
"Knows her stuff as far as English goes, but makes a few too many assumptions about other things. If you have a passion for the intricacies of English, more power to you, but not everyone feels this way and often times this class that you'll fail for a couple absences is a waste of time that could be spent on the unclear papers she has you write.",0
"Very clear and organized. Handouts are very helpful when studying. Lots of material covered, but prof makes it easier to understand. In class short answer midterm and final.",1
Excellent Knowledge about security,1
"He really helps a lot and has an interactive class. He goes around to make sure you understand the math. The tests are managable if you go to class, and he gives a pretty good curve as well. From what I heard, I would take him over any other 302 professor...",1
"If you like spending the entire class listening to podcasts of other people. Being treated like kids in middle school, and being read to. Then you might find enjoyment for taking her as your professor for the work is fairly easy. Oh and if you have 2 unexcused absences you can lose a letter grade.",0
"I took Organic Gardening with her in the spring semester this year, and shes very good with technology so she has a lot of in-class participation activities on TopHat. Thats fine until someones internet stops working... Also a lot of what she said we would need to know for the final was not on the final. If u need an online class, ull want her.",1
The BEST prof at GB!!,1
Take a class from her at your own risk.  She is very confusing and hard to learn from.  You will be learning everything on your own.  She is unwilling to help students.  Also her test are written in a very confusing style.  I would say try and find another instructor if you can.,0
"Mostly had test and group work was considered to be a grade. She also didn't offer reviews for her class and was just expected to know all of the chapters. I would say her lectures were good, but I feel as they didn't cover everything in the chapters/tests.",0
"I loved Professor Landrum. He does only lecturing, no activities but he tries his best to make them interesting. Only have quizzes and tests so you HAVE to stay on top of your reading. However, his tests are easy. Very straight forward, no trick questions. Definitely recommend him!",1
"talks/writes/moves very quickly, difficult to contact, homework grading is very harsh, tests vary in difficulty but he curves. relatively hard class, but i passed. not sure how much really sunk in, but i suppose i gained some sneaky reasoning skills...",0
Easily the worst professor I have EVER had here in my time at Temple. Completely arrogant in many regards. Sees the world in his perspective and if you do not agree with him your wrong.  Worst books I have ever had to read for a class. DO NOT TAKE!!!!!,0
"I would never want to take this professor again. I took a 100 level class and it required so much work! I wrote at least 12 papers and had to do a 15 minute presentation with a group. Very boring lectures, assigns a lot of homework, tough grader, and assignments weren't explained very well at all. I do NOT recommend this professor at all!!",0
"lectures are 3 hours and most of the lecture is examples of examples without examples lecture are an hour He is a harsh grader he does make a study guide for quizzes He makes his test straight from the N+ textbook He has ridiculous turn in times, sometimes 2 weeks others 3 days He doesn't give you any lab time, you have to go to the lab on your own",0
"he is cool. just learn 50 artworks for each exam, write two papers and you will have a good grade.",1
"The people on here who actually liked Prof Peters must have sucked up because that's the only way she'll like you. Her grading is lame. When she does leave comments on papers, they are completely illegible. She ruined my interest in English. Better participate or she'll fail you. Reading is a must. Least favorite teacher at SBCC or any school. ",0
She is no help. ,0
"I thought he was a really good teacher. Everything that was on the test was thoroughly went over in class. Didn't even bother to buy the textbook, and still managed to get an A. His class had no homework when I took him, which is a big plus.  ",1
Really hard to understand him and expect you to learn everything on your own. Do not recommend this professor.,0
"He is a really nice guy, but wouldn't recommend him as a professor. Very tough class, could teach better online, 85% of grade is in exams with little time. I scraped through at the end with a B. Wish he gave more practice exams/material. Lots of people did very, very poorly. His microphone is bad so listening to lectures hurts your ears.",0
He often went off topic and his lecture slides were terrible. He clearly cares a lot about the material and the students but his lectures have nothing to do with what you're tested on. The multiple choice on both the midterm and the final was very difficult.,0
"In a creative writing class, she is a really good professor albeit stubborn and at times rude. She knows the craft very well and she does a good job engaging with your poetry in a meaningful, helpful manner. However, as a teacher she is a bit disorganized and can be a harsh grader. If you are not on top of your work, do not take her.",1
Going to Think Tank for help on her WebAssign homework is essential to passing (sometimes there will be things on there she doesn't cover in class). Her classnotes are helpful- always review materials from the unit before the test because she usually uses problems from notes. Beware of missing homework that she posts the night before it's due.,1
Haldane is TERRIBLE. Do not take whatsoever. She rants about things having nothing to do with the class for the whole period. She makes you read long readings and then you never have a discussion on it but she expects you to be able to write about them in the midterm and final??? Was supposed to be an easy A but that didn't happen.,0
"Nice man, very patient with students. Although class is not mandatory, it is important that you go to lectures because they're only twice a week. Quizzes are 1 day before the test. A lot of hw.  Grades on completeness. Tests are hard, but should be easy if you attend all lectures. Willing to work around your schedule.",1
This instructor is very vague in her assignments and will turn around and tell you you didnt read the assignment if you didnt do it to her standards. Everyone in the class gets confused and while she seems like a nice person she is not a great teacher.,0
He is a rude person who uses words to hurt you if you don't understand the material making you feel dumb. when the course is very hard if you dont understand it with difficulty math involved. He slams his hands on tables and doesn't help you if you dont understand sometihng.,0
"Lotssssss of reading, but Quizzes and assignments aren't too difficult",0
Online class in which the professor was not required to grade anything. Would not answer questions or offer ay help whatsoever.,0
"He an amazing teacher has very good notes for you to study with. textbook not needed but helpful when taking his term test and essay test. good thing is it takes two days. can write on terms to help essays. there is not final for the class, but there is a 10 page paper due at the end during finals week. if you see a movie that fits ask him about it",1
"This professor taught management and did a horrible job, so they moved her to business communications. It's horrible too. At least she is consistent but the lack of knowledge and preparedness show. If you get have to take the class take it with the part-time guy that used to be at DSC! My department should have hired him! This class as is stinks!",0
"Took this course as a birdcourse but it was NOT because of the prof. The course content was SO easy but the exams and MARKING was UNFAIR. I think Natalie would be a better prof if this wasn't an online course, she was helpful during the ""field trip"" but was so hard to reach through email. The quizzes, test, and field trip really boost ur mark tho!",0
DO NOT TAKE!! Failed to communicate - took 3 weeks to answer questions regarding mid-term. Mid-term and final are essay formats. He is not organized and doesn't seem to be engaged or knowledgeable. Do yourself a favor and choose another professor.,0
"She one time deducted 30 points from my friend's grade because he was staring off into space during one of our 75 billion guest speakers, and he tried to explain to her he has ADHD and Aspergers and she said he would have to make up his grade with other assignments at a later date.",0
"Essay prompts are pretty ridiculous but not impossible to get done. In-class presentations do not help in any way, but she seems to think they do. Journal Entries aren't entirely difficult, just a waste of time and unnecessary. Not bad, but I would NEVER take her class again. Terrible teacher.",0
Very boring lectures even though the prof is nice. It is fairly easy to pass her classes because the exams are all projects. Attendance is mandatory (she makes us sign a paper at the end of the class) but I've worked on other projects in her class while she was talking. Easy A but boring.,0
"I had Xandy Gilmore for A&P 1 & 2 during the summer, I had no interest in science, but I needed this class to transfer. Xandy was by far one of my favorite instructors at Vernon she made A&P fun and interesting I would find myself eager to go back into her class. She also taught me new was to study and memorize things that were important.",1
"Terrible experience. Very unorganized and lacks the necessary communication skills to teach remotely. Whole grade is based on 2 tests taken in a totally different format than 3rd party software she uses to ""teach"". Unreasonable expectations, passive aggressive emails, no passion. She doesn't care and it shows-don't waste your time/money.",0
"Engelhardt knows his stuff. If you participate in class, it'll help your odds. However, you NEED to study a lot to do well on exams. (6-8 hours for a typical exam is fair for his class). His practice exams will take you by surprise compared to the actual exams. So ask questions, and you might just be successful. Exams have HUGE curves (10-20%).",0
lectures are unorganized and boring. Feedback i recieved on my papers (which were the majority of the grading) were 1-2 bullet points that were not constructive at all. I wish i didn't take this course.,0
She can be very grumpy.,0
"A very decent class. Not a huge amount of work, but there is a 12 page paper at the end and a weekly discussion that really isnt bad at all. Tests are annoying though, they are very complex with multiple essays and he only gives you 24 hours to do them so sometimes that causes issues if you have other obligations. Other than that he is great!",1
I really enjoyed taking his class. He presents the lectures in fun and easy way. I wish that he teaches academic classes not only ESL classes because I learnt so much from him. Such a great professor.,1
"He is the worst teacher possible. All he want's to do is talk about himself. His quizzes and tests are based on novel readings, that have NOTHING to do with sociology. Tests and quizzes are short answer and essay. They are extremely specific questions and if you don't read you will not pass.",0
She is super nice and tries to be very helpful but the textbook is very dry and so is the material. ,1
very picky,0
"HILARIOUS and nice! You have to show up to class and semi know the books he assigns. He grades papers really easy. You have to be willing to talk because he expects students to lead the discussions. The final is a bit challenging; the questions are hard but I'm pretty sure he curves it. Just show up, talk about the readings and you'll get an A.",1
"Prominent, highly accomplished Executive with ""Real World"" Experience in top management.The best professor I've had in 4 years.",1
"Interesting subject matter. She obviously wants her students to succeed, so she is willing to work with you in order to help you with assignments. The Study Circle assignment sounds overwhelming, but it's actually pretty easy and quite fun.",1
"Gail is an absolutely wonderful teacher. She's straightforward, authentic, and very knowledgeable. She doesn't let you slide but she will do everything she can to help you succeed and understand the purpose behind assignments. She personally checks in on all of her students in a way that lets you know she's invested personally and professionally.",1
"Noble knows this class can be taught in 4-6 wks so that is why he gives busy work...to fill in the rest of the time. You'll learn the history of UNO, who everyone in HPER is & you have to type your entire college course plan - yes the very same thing your advisor does for you. Also, there are 6 wks of guest speakers...all of which you are tested on",0
"She is really nice . But she takes this course way to seriously. Do not expect the easy A's you should be getting out of this course. All the assignments are marked hard as if they are upper level English papers. Students sometimes received 0's on assignments, in foundations. The class is interesting as well but it is not an automatic A class .",1
SHE IS EASY BUT STUDY HER NOTES AND HER REVIEW. STUDY HER NOTES NOT ONLY HER REVIEW. SHE IS NICE AND CLEAR. GOOD LUCK!,1
"Tests are fairly easy if you go to class, pay attention, and do the weekly homework. She uses clicker questions to give credit to those that come to class. She does a lot of cool demonstration/experiment type things during lecture to relate to the topic. There is a required trip to the Allegheny Observatory. Overall an easy intro course.",1
"Patrick really knows his stuff, is passionate and informed about the subject.  His lectures can sometimes get bogged down by class discussion but he is a very kind dude and very helpful after/outside of class!",1
"He is an extremely harsh grader, gives unclear instructions, and penalizes you if your work doesn't reflect his personal preferences. I took the class when we first started using Zoom, and still received my worst grade. Heartless & apathetic. Get's a power trip over his ability to give students poor grades. It's sad he doesn't want you to succeed.",0
Great professor.  Very interactive with the discussions.,1
"I loved Professor Vavova. In the beginning when she explains all of her requirements for the class, she seems like a hard and tough professor. Taking her class though, she is laid back, nice, understanding, and hilarious! She is one of my favorites and I would recommend any class with her. Most students take her more than once.",1
The way she does her class is nightmarish first she makes the most interesting subjects seem boring she basically allows you to cheat on ur online quizs does not have a midterm but a cumulative final that is guaranteed to screw u over 90 MC 5 T/F 3 SA doesnt do a review class because she believe that you should of been studying all year,0
"Routers was a tricky class for me especially once we got into GNS3, but he definitely helps you get through the labs. Lectures one day lab the next day. First half of class you use Cisco Routers and Switches to get used to the CLI and how to set them up. Next part of class goes to GNS3. He gives you all the information on GNS3 you just have to look",1
"VERY BORING. class moves very slow even though material is easy. Could do the lecture in half the time but it drags. Allows one absence. Does a lot of group work during class that is pointless. Discussions, no textbook, essays, group projects. SO BORING and she is kind of confusing ",0
"Doesn't go through examples thoroughly. Practice and practice more! The key to passing the tests is know your reactions top to bottom, backwards and forwards. I'm not joking. Half class dropped, many students in there were repeating the course for a 2nd and 3rd time with him. Reading the book helps a lot/homework. Lectures don't cover everything!",0
"Professor Leonard made the class as straight forward as you will find. Show up, read, and do the study guides and the tests should be a breeze. There are a lot of notes to write down but they are so helpful on the test. 90% of test questions are word for word on study guide.  As for lab, just show up and put in some effort and again you'll be fine.",1
Mr. Caldwell went through math problems way too fast and got irritated if you stopped him with a question.  Majority of the class was frusterated with this teacher.  Did not pass his class... took same class from another teacher in the summer and got an A... Figure that problem out Mr. Caldwell!,0
"Before taking his class, I had been in three photography classes and I loved all of them. When i was in Doug's class, I loathed every second of it outside the darkroom where he hardly ever showed his face. He was overly picky on assignments and failed a majority of the class for minor things that were totally irrelevant to the content.",0
Makes the class very interesting. Make sure to take decent notes and show up and you'll finish with a great mark. Slides aren't useful for studying but help make the class interesting.,1
"Not interested in helping students, more interested in being a gatekeeper. Rude and mean-spirited.",0
"This was by far one of the worst teachers I've taken during my college career. She's unruly, rude, and makes you feel less than adequate if you don't understand the material. The labs were extremely hard to do online and not in person. Most of the time the material she said was ""going to be on the exams"" in fact weren't. Please take another teacher",0
"Very helpful, extremly knowledgeable of history, a teacher whom is passionate about her students and the work she is doing.  Honor to be in her class.",1
"Highly recommended. You need to attend every class and participate and get feedback on your code if you want to do well. Kaminski is kind enough to set up an entire website full of examples. Practice them and you'll do fine. You don't NEED the textbook, but it is an incredible reference in missed something in class.",1
"O'Leary is full of fun dad jokes and always lighting up the class with his joy. He's there for support, even bringing in the BARK dog program to class for stress relief. He truly is my homeboy when it comes to chillin. 10/10 would recommend",1
"He's such a great person and I think his intentions are wonderful, but he is so disorganized and just doesn't teach in a way that is helpful to students. He teaches straight out of the book, so you're better off typically just teaching yourself",0
Great instructor with years of medical field knowledge.,1
"So Denise is ok, but I only feel like she has been ok is because she's been talked to by someone about being rude so she changed. I haven't had an issue with her, but the class is rough. She is confusing and gets extremely defensive when you challenge her. Not that reachable outside of class and seems flustered a lot when people have questions",0
literally the hardest math class i have ever taken and this is supposed to be easy. hell spend a whole class doing one problem and then by the end hes done the whole thing wrong. hard to understand when he speaks. i learn more from the homework and teaching myself then from him,0
"This is a horrible professor. Please stay away. He doesn't know how to teach, he is hard to understand.He seems like a nice person, but teaching isn't his thing. His handwriting is very sloppy. He doesn't use any technology besides an overhead projector which is useless.He goes off on a rant when u ask him a question and makes you look stupid.",0
trust me when i tell you this guy will never understand your point of view on anything its either his way or the highway he is absolutely a terrible professor and you'll hate having him as your lab instructor,0
"She is really funny, but often crosses the line. She has a hard time staying on topic, but is receptive to student feedback. She also down plays how hard the course is,so when students do poorly, they are shocked. She could use some social grace training. But nice lady overall.",0
Most of the notes are given in class so if you don't go to lecture you won't be prepared for the test. There is a lot of homework and in class quizzes but it helps to cushion your grade for the test.,1
"Good lecturer, knows his stuff. The class is just really kind of boring and nothing is really worth writing down in the lectures. It can be interesting at times but most of the time it's dry. Most of the student taking the class are Business majors who just want a Humanities credit so they don't really care about the concepts they're learning",1
"I didn't really enjoy the ""old school"" format of the class with lessons on the whiteboard and all. I would have probably liked opre 3360 more. However, this class is super easy and if you show up and take good notes you will definitely get a good grade. He's also super helpful in office hours so meet up with him whenever you have questions.",1
"NEVER REPLIES TO YOUR EMAILS !! Beside that though, he's a really good professors because he makes you do applications that you would implement in real life for the labs and exams.",1
There are a lot of assignments to do.,1
"Professor Freedman is a great instructor. He is accessible, extremely knowledgeable, and passionate. He pulls together lectures in a way that made me connect the dots about big issues on globalization. Style: lectures (he does best) and class discussions (ok facilitator) He is realistic about college level work so you might have to do some.",1
"The type of teacher that expects everyone in the class to discuss the reader, and is very salty whenever you do not. He also expects you to do writings in 30 minutes and to regurgitate every word of days lectures into each of your papers. Dont take him, take my advice. Hes unforgiving and gave me a 40 point deduction for leaving one topic out.",0
Hes very good,1
Was the very first course I took towards the major and offered a very comprehensive view of field. Appreciated that he valued my expertise and experiences. Very helpful and learned soooo much!,1
Had him for both 114 and 115 and was certainly a solid choice. He is very passionate when he teaches which is always nice,1
"A waste of my time. So many assignments that feel as though they belong in a 3rd grade class. Attendance is worth a huge portion of the grade and its almost impossible to sit though one of her lectures. She will spend whole class periods talking about organization and time management, and stuff the majority of us already know. Not a college class!!",0
"Mrs. Calvert is always willing to help so don't be afraid to ask her questions. Also, at the end of the semester she will go around the classroom and quiz each person so make sure you know your stuff!",1
"It is easy to get responses from her. She cares about her students. If you listen to her lectures carefully, you could understand. She sticks with the syllabus, she grades holistically on papers. There are no exams or midterms. She offers advice about the tutors. Being present and participate, you'll pass. I recommend her for Writing I.",1
"I took a class with him at UFV, and I see students from SFU and KPU have the same opinion. Changing schools has not changed his teaching style. Good Luck trying to get him to respond to emails. I'm still waiting for a response from ;6 weeks ago. I would NOT recommend his class. For a first year course, he expects too much",0
"Dr. Falk is the nicest professor that I have dealt with, but I had a hard time learning in this class. Every day I was so confused and did not know what I was writing down. The homework dealt with topics that are not even covered until a few class periods after they are due and the exam grades are always really bad in regards to the class.",0
"Christina is a great professor. Be very sure to do the homework right as you get them as they are long and sometimes hard. But if you pay attention, take notes, you will do fine in the class.",1
Decent teacher but very boring class write everything on over head. Just study for tests for material and she will pass you,1
He is  a good professor. respectful and funny plus nice to everyone.,1
"One of the best professors out there. I like to learn. So she makes the lectures interesting. She's always up to date with scientific facts and help me relate the class work to real life. I learn the hard core science and great applications. Overall, I worked hard but it was worthy. She cares about students and is always willing to help.",1
"For world literature there seemed to be a lot more work than I had expected. Every week a quiz and discussion post due, as well as four essays. If strong accents are something you have a hard time with in the learning environment, I would avoid this professor. The notes she writes on the board can also be hard to follow as well.",1
"I wish I can give him a zero. I have no free time. Terrible teacher. He was extremely rude and disrespectful. Besides the workload, he was not a good professor or person. He does not care if you fail or not. He was so bad I had to drop his class, which I have never done before. He gives F's for fun. DO NOT TAKE HIM, YOU WILL REGRET IT, STAY AWAY.",0
Class is boring and professor is not teaching the useful content. not recommend if you want to major in business. he's nice though,0
I AM AN A/B STUDENT AND PROBABLY GETTING A C OR D IN THIS CLASS.  DOES THIS TELL YOU ANYTHING?,0
"Useless, grades you based off how other people do. You can do really good on a presentation and he won't have any complaints but you will still get a B. Horribly boring. He basically talks to himself the entire class and makes corny jokes that he thinks are hilarious.",0
"Prof. Marchand is extremely respected in her field and knows her stuff. You will get what you put into this class-- if you want to grow and learn, this class is for you, if you want an easy A, look elsewhere. She wants her students to succeed and gives good feeback on essays. Participate in class and get to know her, you won't regret it.",1
"He is funny but you can't deny his holier-than-thou attitude. He used to disregard me in office hours and participation because he genuinely enjoys humiliating a student who volunteers to contribute in class. Also I once asked him to review my bugged code and he scuffed at me ""your attempt isn't good enough for a rudimentary problem"" So opinionated",0
Great math teacher!!!! Never understood it from any other teacher.. She is very clear.,1
Instructor made class interesting and was very knowledgeable.,1
Majority of the class is self taught. I recommend DOING the wiley plus from the first day..those extra points will be neccesary.Majority of my class dropped early.,1
"crazy long papers, lectures are awful and there is random class work that is graded, tests are abnormally hard for a teacher who literally just reads off a powerpoint all class.",0
Lots of extra credit but tough class and not so good of a professor,0
"This is my second time taking a class taught by him. He lectures, draws what he is lecturing, and his lectures and drawing coincide pretty closely to the textbook. He's always willing to help during his office hours. The term project was super hard but it was really cool to actually use what we learned. He has been my favorite professor so far.",1
"Very difficult to understand due to accent, does not know how to explain things well at all, could have been an easy A but because I barley learned anything from lecture I did not do as good as I could have done",0
This class was extremly hard! It was a writing intensive but no writing intensive credit!! strongly discourage this professor!,0
I absolutely do not recommend her! Online class is terrible! Gave tons of assignments at beginning of semester without any kind of discussion/lecture. Never replied to emails. Kept saying her computer was broken when the students went to her in person. It's midway through the semester and still no contact? Please! Try using other excuses!,0
Not a very good lecturer.,0
"Professor Birch's 4650 & 3050 are structured the same way and its not designed to give you any feedback nor help you improve your understanding. 90% of your grade is based on exams . Average on most exams were between 60-40% so good luck and don't expect him to help you, since all of your work is thrown away!! Guessing is encouraged, No Home Work.",0
"if you take her class you will during semester, she does not care student. she is great instructor at PCC I never want to take again.",0
"Great teacher, but tests are over the top. I'm used to getting 90+ on a test that I study decently for, but with her tests, I spend two days studying and wind up with mid 80's. But she knows her stuff, is very helpful, and gives great feedback.",1
I really like Dr. Lorimer. She knows her stuff and encourages people to participate. I liked reading the sources from history and using the iClicker/REEF to earn participation points. There were a lot of assignments to help people who dont do well on tests. I would take her class again!,1
He over-complicates things in his lectures and is not great at explaining. He is mean when you don't understand something and want to ask a question. He takes away points in exams and lab reports for the smallest details.,0
"Strong accent, hard to understand",0
Is very disorganized in giving his notes. Never sure what is going to be on the test. Says everything he talks about is important but goes off on tangents making things more complicated.,0
"Awesome... the best prof I've had so far. Makes seemingly boring materials very interesting, always gives clear, insightful lectures... I'm convinced he's a genius. I had this class early in the morning and he actually made me WANT to go. I wish I had him for more classes.",1
"This class was amazing, the one thing is there were no lectures, just powerpoints posted and we read them ourselves. Not a lot of assignments either which is always great. The course overall was great just no lectures!",1
"Good Proff ... always checking to see if every1 is ""comfortable with the material so far""",1
The workload for this class was way too much. Many late nights were spent working on this class when I shouldve been focused on classes related to my major. Attendance is a must. Shes a very harsh grader. Be prepared to spend 1/2 the class talking about BS. After wasting class time she will throw in assignments at the end. Class never ends early.,0
"HW due on test day; tests are multiple choice YAY!, 4 ques. pop quiz for every chapter, very low stress and he is very understanding to your needs. He is willing to help you! If you put in the effort you cannot fail, he wants you to pass! This was my 2nd semester with him for these reasons! I could not have passed without him",1
"She is very boring, has surprise quizzes so you have to come to lecture, and is very unhelpful.  Quizzes and tests suck.",0
"Pretty easy class overall but the content can be confusing at times. He lectures well but goes really really fast which was frustrating but he posts all the lectures so that helps out. His exams are short answer but the study guides are pretty straight forward. Nice guy, willing to help you if you need it. I would take another one of his classes. ",1
I can't possibly fit everything wrong with this teacher into 350 characters. My favorite story: She graded my rough draft with few marks. I fixed those things and was proud to turn in my final paper. After grading that she claimed that I missed the point entirely and wanted me to write a new one at nearly the end of the semester.,0
"Incredibly difficult to work with, and rude when asked questions. Made up words like ""dramatical"" in an ENGLISH class.",0
"Très long et plate, en plus de ça il n'est pas claire!",0
"In order to do good in this class you need to ALL the work and do it exactly right. He takes off points for EVERYTHING. Tests aren't hard, though.",0
"MS. MAGALLON IS ONE OF THE BEST ENGLISH TEACHERS AT CHABOT. VERRRRRY HELPFUL, NICE, SMART, CLEAR, UNDERSTANDING, SEEMS HAPPY TO TEACH NOT LIKE OTHER TEACHERS. A LOT OF GROUP WORK. WHICH MEANS MEETING NEW PEOPLE!! SHE IS THE BEST TEACHER EVER. U WONT REGRET TAKING HER. SIGN URSELF UP FASSSSSSSST!!",1
Nothing really special about him. The tests are all mc questions but really hard. You definitely need to study before the exam. His tests are so hard all of the tests were curved by 10-15 points each. At least he noticed how hard his exams are to help not fail anyone. The discussion posts every other week were super easy and a grade booster.,1
"tough teacher, very hard to comprehend what she is even talking about and she loves to speed through notes like it's a race. tests aren't too bad but she will pick tricky questions to make you work for it.",0
Great Professor!!!,1
Worst prof ever,0
"Asynchronous online class, consistently changing her syllabus, late policies, and assignment details. The most work I've EVER had for a class like this. For each exam we're asked to write two single-spaced pages each for three questions and a paragraph each for the other 4. Double-spaced this is 15 pages... Take anything else but this. HORRIBLE!",0
"Ericka is super nice and relatable. She's very real. The only downside to her class is not having a study guide, but she really knows all about voice. When it comes to fluency, study the powerpoints! She will bring in an expert too. EC is given through videos shown on the day of the test. 4 tests, 10 short assignments.",1
His class average was a 49 till the last week. the entire semester I didnt have above a 76 till the last week of class and I had the highest grade.,0
"Yes he is a great professor. I had him my freshman year. So thing you want to know about him is that, he love to assign paper about print and digital culture. If you are good at writing papers and love reading he is definitely your kind of professor.",1
Professor Luley is amazing! His lectures are really engaging and he is organized. He challenges you to work hard for an A but is a fair grader and gives plenty of feedback that you can take into consideration for your next assignment. Participation matters! He also will make time for you if you ever have questions or having trouble with a concept.,1
I wouldn't recommend this professor. She demands the class to be very conversational as it is a mandatory factor of every class and your grade. She's very strict as well when it comes to due dates. She gives extra credit but it truly doesn't factor into your overall grade much so it's useless. I felt like I wasted my time taking this class.,1
"The online homework was easier to understand than the lectures. As caring as he seems to be, there was no belief in me to pass the class after failing the first exam. Great person, awful instructor. Doing the tutoring, extra help during office hours, and testing accommodations did nothing to help understand.",0
"He is very nice and super funny, but really only teaches the philosophical part of chem in lecture and expects you to know everything else. So if you dont know very much chemistry itll be hard to say the least.",0
"Dr. Guerrero is sweet and caring. Even though it is a blended class and we barely meet in the classroom, she recognizes her students by name and will say hi if you pass her on campus! Projects are interesting and relevant mostly. She is also very understanding, and will let you turn in assignments late or will help you a lot if you need her!",1
Will read ninety percent of poets and one or two outside novels for any given period and tested on all of it.,0
This class blowed! He didnt teach us anything. Had to figure out everything on your own. All quizzes where on excel.. sorry kiddos!,1
"Dr. Kelley has been super understanding with COVID-19 circumstances. The class is easy as long as you keep up with assignments. A TON of extra credit opportunities! I maintained around 110% because of all the extra credit. Great professor and easy, manageable class.",1
I can't say enough about Professor Romani. She is awesome and caring and her class is great. I never thought that I would have FUN in a college class while learning.  I wish I could take her for all my classes and I am very lucky I am a major and will have her again.,1
"I checked his ratings here before taking the class, I still took the class. It  this was one of the best classes I have taken at Cal State LA. Cervantes is a very knowledgeable professor he expects students to do their work. Take it, he'll teach stuff you can make easy money off, if you work and pay attention of course.",1
"Worst class I've taken at JMU. Henigman is all over the place and difficult to follow. Canvas is extremly difficult to navigate. Lectures are boring, she doesnt make material intersting. Mandatory attendence but you cant gain points. Four shortpapers throughout the semester and 12 page final paper that she is very unclear about. Avoid if you can.",0
This professor helped me to obtain scholarships as well!,1
"He is the most caring person ever, he is a really good teacher and his ways of explaining math are simple and sometimes funny, 100% recommended.",1
WOULD NOT recommend Eric.,0
Professor Ordoñez is an amazing educator. She cares about her students. She is tough beacuse she wants us to be good clinicians. She does not sugar coat anything. I like that about her. She is straight forward about her tests. She is a very knowledgeable DPT,1
"Mock is very passionate about American History. History has never been a great subject for me, so I had a very hard time. Somehow I made an A! His class is passable, but if you're like me and history is NOT your thing, then TAKE NOTES, participate, be active, and cite the heck out of your sources for his papers.",1
Great teaching style.  Very fair.,1
"I have never left a rating, but this dude is something else. Anything that isn't auto-graded in mindtap is graded like sh*t. Group projects are a nightmare, attendance is a grade and I was marked absent for a no-class holiday and wasn't given credit. Emails take years to be responded to. Basically do not take unless there is no other option. BIG NO",0
The best professor on campus,1
"By  far the worst professor ever taken out of 4 years of  school. she goes on about her  personal life .waste of time and doesn't grade clearly  , i would recommend another professor if this is your major",0
"Dr. O'Leary is nice but I do not like the way he teaches after having to take 3 of his classes. Lectures are confusing, The homework is ripped from the textbook and often unrelated to the lectures. The exams are long and only easy because he allows the students to take the answers into the exam. He actively discourages learning.",0
She will make you work for your grade. She curves her exams and offers lots of extra credit only because majority don't do well on her exams.,1
"1.)  Not interested in teaching the class,  2.)  Did not follow syllabus,  3.)  Was not prepared for laboratory experiments, 4.) Had low expectations of students in the class,  5.)  Good at explaining difficult concepts in a simple way.  I estimate that 95% of what I learned came because of my own studying, not because of the instructor.",0
He is a great professor. He loves what he do. He is funny and classes are entertaining. Just study the lecture book. The quizzes of the lab are from the homework.  ,1
"This guy is a jerk and a half- he seems like he knows what he's doing in lectures but if you talk to him individually, he'll treat you with utmost disdain.  He shows up at class like 10 minutes late and then blames class being late on the computer and projector and then treats the repair people with comtempt.  What an a$$h0le of an individual.",0
grades harshly and doesn't accept any late work no matter the reason. I won't take her again or recommend her class to anyone,0
"She's Amazing. THE Greatest professor I've ever had.  Like everyone else said, her priority is for you to understand/care about the material taught which is exactly why we're taking this class.  It's like she's preparing us to become model citizens of the world.",1
She is laid back and easy going. I loved her class. I hate ging speeches and yet I wanted to go to that class.,1
"She did not giv clear instructions, and she graded whether she like you or not. In the syllabus she stated that it did not matter how you did grade wise on your papers and test it was all up to here",0
"Prof. Bucklin is loud, vulgar, can be offensive but also sometimes funny. The class is relatively easy if you show up but she has quizzes that are hard. She also gives assignments and then takes 3 months to give you one grade back. The class feels like a waste of time because I don't pay attention but I still have a decent grade",0
"Ive always been terrible at understanding math, yet I got an A in this class. Professor Steiner explains everything super clear and always takes the time to make sure everyone is on the same page. Assignments on MyMathLab are really helpful not only for grade but also to study and practice. Looking forward to take this professor again!",1
I thought that this class was going to be very easy but some of the assignments we did were difficult. All of the assignments are done online and if your answer is slightly off you wont get any credit. I also didn't think she was very helpful especially during finals. An A is for sure achievable if you put in enough effort.,0
"Stay Away. Only grades are 5 tests, each 20% of final plus each one only has three questions. Misleading about curve. Since each test is worth two letter grades, one mistake and you fail the class. Speaks poor english. No help if stuck and no extra credit. Take other classes to avoid this professior.",0
Listen to me! If you are planning on taking her class RUN! as far away as possible you wont pass. She is the worst professor at Valencia. You will not learn you will write 8 papers every Wednesday. And her test is hard even the multiple choice but majority of her test is open answer and all she talks about is giraffes! Online work kills you! RUN,0
"Lit. of Ethnic America was very easy, but was also easy to fall behind in. She was a good professor but her grading was all over the place. The class is reading heavy but it is easy to manage. Not much to complain about because I am taking one of her courses again.",1
"Easiest Bio course given at UD! Never went to class once and I am overly cotent with my grade. He's pretty boring and have a monotonous voice but attendance is not required at all. He's not one of those bio teachers who tries to trick you, his questions are straight forward. I wish he taught more Bio courses.",0
"This instructor is terrible at getting back to students, grading, and completely unorganized. This was the worst course I have ever had. I would not EVER take a course from this instructor.",0
She is the worst math teacher that I've had thus far... she never gives enough examples and I always find myself confused and reading the text book to try and figure out whats going on. If that's your cup of tea then i suggest her for trig...,0
She only allows 3 absences. If you're on your phone or daydreaming she counts you absent. She is super hard grading on papers. You have to read short stories and take quizzes on them on very specific things from the story. She barely smiles and is very monotone. I would not recommend taking this teacher.,0
I have a problem with him making us buy his book during class.,0
Tough class. Attendance is mandatory and she is a really tough grader that it will affect your grade even if its a few points. She also leaves a lot of work and reading. She also sucks at responding back to emails even when its really important. Even after the pandemic she didnt even make accommodations its like she didnt care about it or us,0
"Although no textbook, Tons of readings. Could not finish his sentences all the time, but his sense of humor helped a little to make the class interesting, and can't forget his funny gestures. Kind of a tough grader, really have to study and put work into essays.",0
I love Dr. King.  You should take lab from him at all costs.  He is super relaxed and makes you feel comfortable.,1
She's amazing. She really cares about students and wants you guys to succeed. Just make sure to keep up to date with all homework assignments and she even lets you make a study guide for the test! SHE ROCKS! ps: she likes green apples :),1
"Holly is very knowledgeable. Beware-she expects u to know how to hand code before taking her interface class. If u aren't an,expert you will spend many sleepless nights coding. Her class is 90% discussion and 10% designing. Wish she were more,willing to help. Rambles about her,personal life instead of helping you.",0
"Dr. Nelson was delightful. His blistering criticism was always specific and helpful, and he is one of the few Davidson profs who actually gives you useful advice for after you graduate. He has a rep for being mean, but he was always kind and truthful with me. And he remembered my name afterwards!",1
SHE IS TERRRRIBLE!!!!!I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND TAKING HER FOR ENGLISH..EVER!,0
"Dr. Meehan is a nice lady and knows her stuff. However, if you miss one class, you miss so much! She's isn't very willing to help you catch up. She drops your lowest test, but doesn't allow you to make them up even when you have an excused absence. She does want the best for her students though and will like you if you put in the effort and show up",1
"This guy is the WORST professor here at NCSU. But the bad part is, he has tenure. He doesn't teach, he just reads the notes in class. He over explains things that really don't matter. He makes you feel like an idiot and a failure when you go to his office hours. I never fell asleep in a class, but I practically fell asleep in every class.",0
"Dr. Wilson has a poor knowledge of the information in the course. She often asks the class questions that she does not know the answer to herself. I do not recommend her as a professor. I would rather skip her classes and read the book myself. She swears by her lecture notes but they are useless, and do not correlate to info on the tests.",0
"One of THE best professors at MCC, this guy is humorous and he explains the topics very well and gives plenty of real world examples. If your taking an economics class, his class is the way to go, I took a night class where lecture was 3 hours long and it went by in a breeze. I would take his class again in a heartbeat and highly recommend him.",1
RUN! DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER! Boris Maizel has to be one of the WORSE teachers Ive ever had. Find ANYONE else but him.,0
"She would try to engage the class, but I don't think teaching is her strong point. The online Cengage program is ridiculous, the textbook reads like it's catered towards high schoolers, but the material in the exams online is nothing like what we learned. I barely passed them, despite having a strong interest and background in abnormal psychology.",0
"worst teacher i have ever experienced in my student life, very tough grader. He runs the autocode to run your program, so if you miss anything in the program you end up with 0 grade, thats  how he grades. no sympathy at all ... but unfortunately there is only one professor who teaches cs320 at csula. I dont recommend him at all...",0
Avoid taking him. He failed me. I took Calculus 1. He expect the students should know everything. He just write notes on board and expects students to know everything.,0
"The most wholesome professor ever!!! He is very caring and understanding. One thing I really enjoyed was how he really tried to connect the coursework and readings to a higher purpose, which definitely made the course a lot more enjoyable.",1
His lectures are clear and he trys to answer everyones questions. He gives homework which you dont have to turn in but it does help to study. Olny 3 exams each worth 1/3 of your grade. Exams are just like the lecture and homework problems and gives partial credit as long as you show your work. One of the few good math professors at UNLV.,1
"Would love to see her stochastic processes, but avoid her if you can!",0
"She will write one word on the board and then stare at the class waiting for a discussion to spark. Also none of the readings will relate to this discussion so may as well skip all of those. Then the tests will be graded by her ta who isnt at discussion. The entirety of the tests are on the discussions, so you will be marked off for reciting her",0
"I want to hear the professor lecture to get a better understanding of these older texts. I don't understand why she insists on listening to other students opinions the majority of the class time. I get it, participation matters however we do not pay to hear fellow students' tedious musings. Enjoyed the material, not the professor.",0
"Mrs. Bolt is very knowledgeable about her field of study, that being said i would have to say she doesn't enjoy to teach. She grades extremely hard for a class that is suppose to be simple and it doesn't help that she is unorganized. Mrs. Bolt expects the world of her students but doesn't put in effort into the class",0
"He makes you work hard for his class, but you learn a lot.",1
Dr. Roberts truly cares about his students. While the material is dry...he makes class time fun.  Be prepared to read alot of journal articles.,1
"SON COURS EST SUPER PLATE!!! 
 iL NY A PAS DE FIL CONDUCTEUR!",0
get a good TA,0
"Took two classes with him and loved them both! He is a truly caring, respectful professor who shares his lived-experiences as an Ambassador in a relevant and informative way. He is a very fair grader and offers great feedback. He shares fellowship opportunities and truly wants to see his students succeed. 100% would take a course with him again!",1
"Don't take this class...ridiculous amount of material that all seems irrelevant. I'm not afraid of hard work...but 50+ pages per class period is a graduate course. He's rather rude, kinda degrading, his TA for the section is just as terrible and obnoxious so that didn't help. Listen to the ratings for this professor regardless of interest level.",0
Hard class but not necessarily a bad teacher.. you just need to do your part. The tests are very hard but his curve is awesome. He also gives a quiz almost every class worth 10 points to keep you on your feet. I would say it's not the end of the world if you sign up for him but he's probably the hardest teacher for 120/121.,0
"Very interested in the material, but as she said herself, she is ""self-righteous"".  She will never admit she is wrong.  She's a great professor though, and if you can stand being slightly belittled and talked down to, you'll learn a lot.",1
First half of the class she focuses on health economics and the second half is mainly health policy. Midterm killed everyone. Final is cumulative. Take good notes and literally write down everything she says.EVERYTHING. Lecture notes are ok but lack organization. don't need the book bc reading it just makes you hate the class more,0
Its like watching George Clooney lecture intelligently on the most interesting topics in the world.,1
Professor Lhota is literally the best professor I have encountered in my entire life. I have never met a nicer person before. She's really sweet and care for the students. She gives really good feedback on the papers. There is no pressure in the class if you do the work. Take her help if you are stuck. The class is not easy but she makes it easy.,1
Participation is the key to your success in this class.,1
This professor needs to take responsibility and quit teaching at CSULA. No student should suffer with their grade and learning because of this guy.  Albert didn't  grade anything until finals week and doesn't bother to reply to student emails.  Midterm and Final was 10x harder than the homeworks and made students suffer. 1/10 worst  professor ever.,0
he grades hard but is a really nice guy.  worth the work.,1
"Objectively not the best teacher, but far from the worst. I found her easy to get along with and decently clear at communicating why I received the grade I did.",1
"I hate her online class, its poorly put ogether. She forces you to post these half-hearted, mindless replies to stories NOBODY reads. Her online tests are set up in a stupid way, where if you accidentally hit the wrong submit button, you CANT go back to fix it. DO NOT TAKE HER FOR ANYTHING. She takes the class WAY too seriously for a lower level li",0
"If you take his course, don't stand out.  He will grade you based on your visual appearance, class, etc. He spends most of his time on personal business and cancels class a lot. He thoroughly answers questions, but with a patronizing attitude.  He'd be a great guy if he wasn't so insecure and full of himself. Talks about fellow staff negatively. :(",0
He thinks the material is easy and judges students for getting bad grades meanwhile he doesn't teach it correctly. He thinks that if you fail a quiz it's because you didn't try and there's a quiz every week,0
"He is terrible at explaining concepts and he does not prepare for his tests which are extremely difficult. He is available for office hours, but he lets all students into the room so that it is really hard to get your question across.",0
"Extremely condecending.  Extremely fast and just rushes through everything. All geades come from 4 tests and a final, no homework, no participation, no extra credit points. Grades test Extremely hard giving little to no partial credit.",0
Fantastic class. Midterm and final can be hit or miss (because you might not be able to figure out how to do it!) but plenty of potential bonus marks.,1
"Nice guy who tries his best, can explain some things well, but other topics you are totally lost. Needs to do examples.",1
"Her lectures are somewhat interesting, but can be rather boring at times.  She is usually very disorganized and sometimes tells you something and then forgets that she told you.  She is very caring, though, and wants her students to do well.  At times she is not very clear with her feedback on your work and exactly what she expects from you.",0
"Death by powerpoint, dull class.  Takes too long to grade assignments, little to no instructions on divisional participation, very nit picky when grading, takes off too many points on assignments, the in class final scenario is ridiculously difficult. Most students didn't finish the final in time. You'll be lucky if you end up with a B average.",0
"I LOVE Chrissy. She is the most wonderful human and lecturer. She makes her class incredibly inclusive and provides such quality and informative information. She understands that some of us can't afford a textbook, so she doesn't require it. All of the exams are online- so you can use your notes. Truly, she is the best professor at SDSU.",1
"Unclear on assignments, had us set our own due dates. Purposely graded tests wrong so u can correct her and get bonus points. If u like nature and writing about trees, this is your class. Otherwise, stay clear. She cancelled 8 classes this semester, not including holidays.",0
Taking this class during covid 19 pandemic. His setup is a camera pointed at the whiteboard. It is constantly unfocused and he stands in front of his writing making it very hard to take notes. I contacted the engineering department to help set him up with a digital whiteboard and was told he had one and didn't want to use it.,0
"Professor Con was a very sweet lady but she was very hard to understand and was quite confusing at times, I sat at the front of the class and still had trouble writing down notes, because we would turn them in for a grade. When it cam to SIMNET, did everything she asked of me and at the end of the semester she failed me.  I wouldn't recommend her.",0
He is an excellent human being and professor. Inspired me to continue onto the graduate program. Great mentor and really wants the students to learn and succeed. The class discussions were indepth and often made you forget about the time. I looked forward to his classes and would highly recommend his class to anyone.,1
First prof to make real sense of community policing.,1
He is an awesome teacher. He fully reviews before a test and he assigns current events. Sometimes he shows videos and I think he actually likes what he does. He's a cool guy and you'll learn a lot from him. :),1
"I find it hard to believe that Ms. Hansen is allowed to teach.  It is a waste of BSOL's money to keep her on the pay roll.  She does not respond to emails.  She is never clear on what is expected from the students.  Very unprofessional.  Walks around the class with no shoes and cusses like a sailor.  Can honestly say, I did not learn anything.",0
"She wants you to understand the material. Wonderful professor, really helped me grasp the concepts of business calculus 2.",1
"He wants to see everyone succeed but he also wants to see the effort. He does not curve or give extra credit. He gives partial points on the test. His tests come from homework, class & textbook examples and old tests. Homework was challenging but could be googled (but you should still try it). And watch out for the multiple choice! They're tricky.",1
"This guy speeds through organic chemistry material like it is simple addition in a calculus class. He does not teach well. If asked to break something down he is sometimes understandable, but plan on using him as a supplement to the textbook. I strongly advise taking anyone but him if possible.",0
Very tough prof.. make sure to attend every class or else you will pay the price.,0
Awsome class.,1
"Professor Nearing is a great. I took her online and it was easy she gives you the work for the whole semester and all you have to do is 3 fireworks assignments out of the book and a 8 page website from dreamweaver that you have to come up with, also the final exam is very easy 100 questions",1
Easiest A I've ever gotten in CS. If only every math class was like this. Feelsbadman. Protip: Practice exams are very similar to the actual ones.,1
She is a good at accounting but not necessarily teaching but she can be rude sometimes especially if you're late or aren't showing up. I would not take again.,1
Great Teacher,1
"Others comments on Hansen are very accurate.  It is clear she attempts to ""scare"" students in an attempt to hide her own insecurities.  She outright degrades students and if continues in her current actions, will eventually get BSOL sued under the ADA or other.  Ms. Hansen ignores the BSOL handbook, and embarrasses BSOL in conduct and appearance.",0
"He is so confusing the way he teaches class! A lot of reviews say he's scatterbrained; that is completely true. He assumes you know everything he talks about & unless you ask questions, he doesn't really address things you want to know. Assumes you know everything & relies on you reading to learn, he doesn't have lesson plans. I don't recommend.",0
"Doesn't respond to your emails and is very unclear about what hes expecting on exams ?s and in homework assignments. The absolute worst teacher I've ever had teaching an online class(and I've taken 6 classes no prob) , and supposedly he never even took a class on campus but still can't create an online class that operates smoothly and efficiently. ",0
"Prof. O'Quinn was fantastic! Lectures and assignments really made you think, but were a good challenge. Very approachable and funny - makes lectures enjoyable. Sometimes hard to see how he is connecting all the concepts but by the end it makes perfect sense. Would definitely take a course with him again!",1
She goes over things fast but very fair when it comes to tests and grading. She is willing to help you. Tests are easier than quizzes are easier than homework.,1
"Dr. Lane works very hard to help his students succeed. He only asks that each student does their part towards their success, that is each student must work for their grade at their maximum ability. He is always there to help when a student needs it and will generally give great examples that lead to possible exam questions. ",1
"The man is a jerk... yeah, he's intelligent and you might learn a little, but he's constantly saying the opposite of his notes and the text book, and he's so arrogant that if you try to say something he doesn't know he throws a fit. Always talks about how wonderful he is and he's insensitive and unhelpful.",0
Originally went into this class unsure if I would care much for it but it ended up being my favorite class this semester! Matlack is so passionate and knowledgable so his lectures were always enjoyable. Make sure you write down all the in class notes and draw his little doodles. Your notes will end up looking like a field journal by the end!,1
Great class!  He was a great professor.  Make sure to do the reading!,1
Awesome guy- extremely friendly and happy. Material is HARD. I still don't understand half of the material and it's the last day. Don't take this class unless you are a neurologist or biology major. It's not a psychology course.,0
Ree is a wonderful teacher. I changed my major after taking his class. ,1
Too much material for him to teach. I've never heard anyone say anything good about him. Very arrogant and impressed with himself. I am a little confused why he teaches this class since he mentioned he had a degree in engineering. He forgets about the PP behind him that goes along with his lecture and clicks through it at the very end. Avoid.,0
"He's interesting to listen to, but gives uber-hard tests.",0
One of the best professors here! She can relate to a lot of her struggling students because she too struggled getting through college so she is extremely patient and forgiving. She is also very organized with the way she presents the material. It is very easy to get used to her teaching style and make the most of it!,1
She really wants her students to succeed. She took the time to reach out to individual students to make sure they passed. Really wanted to make sure everyone did well and understood the material. Used fun videos and examples to teach. Also really kind & funny. Just an excellent teacher. If i could take her for every Japanese level i would.,1
"Attendance matters a lot in this class, she does a lot of in class assignments so it's fairly easy if you attend class and pay attention. She is definitely one of the more tough grading professors I have had for a writing class. She is pretty straight to the point and rules are strict.",1
"I didn't really enjoy Peter as a teacher. He was super unorganized and wasn't willing to help me outside of class. One time it took him 3 weeks to grade our tests... 3 weeks!! (Mind you, he only teachers one class.) I was embarrassed to be one of his students.",0
"So much reading and memorization for a level 200 course. Quizzes are open book, yet they are built to trick you. The final exam is on all course content which is 15 weeks of slideshows, videos, articles and textbook. Teachers are nice but they don't realize how difficult they made this course especially as an elective. Would not recommend at all.",0
"Easily the worst college class I've taken. She assigns a lot of reading that is really hard to get through due to the content being repetitive and, in my opinion, too advanced for undergraduate students. Her lectures are her just reading off the power point slides. Discussion Board questions are often so specific the they are too hard to answer.",0
Decent Teacher just does not know how to present material in a understandable manner.,0
"We never had an essay assignment and there were extra credit opportunities. The tests were tough but as long as you payed attention during class you did fine. The textbook was used a lot, we had weekly readings but it wasn't ""mandatory"" even though she told we should read it. Overall I liked the class a lot, and definitely would  recommend it. ",1
"I am so delighted to talk about Jonathan Ball. He is and will be my best, his kind is hard to find. He is down to earth. teaches for the dullest to wake up, very funny and makes you wanna be in class everyday. please take him and you wont be disappointed.",1
"Took Terrorism from this professor. Clearly once a great class, but after decades has devolved into a long lecture on books that we do not read and general opinion. Not your typical history class -- No historical background in the traditional sense. The subject matter is fascinating but the class was disappointing. Almost dropped it twice.",0
"Very inconsistent, he LACKS a lot of communication with his students, does not respond neither emails or calls. He will not mark you in you are even ten minutes late. Heavy accent, if your a good listener you will do fine he literally reads off the power point, and often rushes through everything. He's very knows his stuff but lack teaching skills",0
"Overall good. There were just four exams, they were always 50 questions and all multiple choice. Study guides were provided. Homework was online D2L discussions. About 12 were available, but you only had to pick any five of those. Lectures could get boring, but all the notes were available online. Many extra credit opportunities posted on D2L.",1
"This class is tough and he is sometimes tough on grading papers. Yet, he is very helpful outside of class and his lectures are clear. I would recommend him.",1
"i dont even know where to start. if youre reading this. DONT TAKE THIS CLASS. for me she was the only option left so i was like why not? and i wholeheartedly regret it. trust me, if shes your only option, just wait till next term to take this class. its not worth it unless youre a complete math wizard god. shes the worst teacher i have ever had.",0
"Dr. Ranft is a great guy. However, refrain from taking his ethics class. Everything has a right or wrong answer whether or not your values are different. He loses assignments very frequently and is often late to class. His test are ridiculous and most material is from Google. If you have options, do NOT take his class!",0
"Absolutely horrible...seems easy when you are in lecture and are reading the book, but exams are harder than the anatomy exams. MC with answers like A,B, None of the Above,All of the above, 2 right answers for all questions. Very detailed on exams with obscure questions from specific cases. Bad lecturer, lecture puts you to sleep, AVOID AT ALL COST",0
A great professor with nothing but great ways of reaching us students. We loved how hes available whenever our group had questions. I would definitely take him again.,1
"Very unorganized, the whole blackboard site was very unorganized and professor didnt post some of the information that was supposed to be on there. When students asked questions in class she would say she didnt have time to answer, yet went on tangents about her personal life and stuff that had nothing to do with the material.",0
"Her online class isn't even a class. It's terrible. She waits a month to grade essays and when she does, she gives no feedback. How in the world are we suppose to know what mistakes we make, if she doesn't point them out? She's not teaching. She just grades papers late with no feedback. She must enjoy killing our honors gpa.",0
Lots of in-class examples and real world applications. He also has a sense of humor that helps ease the serious nature of an organic chemistry class. I loved this class! Just read the book and be prepared when you walk into class and you will be fine.,1
This class was by far the most BORING class I have ever taken. It was seriously painful. She is ALL lecture and power points. She was really nice and her tests were super easy but the class was so boring. If your looking for an easy A this class is great but so boring.,1
He was not helpful when I reached out to him for help with my online class. I reached out more than once and it didn't get any better. I don't recommend him at all.,0
Very helpful - just ask for help!,1
It was boring to me.,0
horrible and very rude ! don't take any class with him,0
Its an intro to accounting so material is the same between professors. Very helpful professor willing to meet with students. Tells you exactly what will be on exams so if you don't study blame yourself. Got 100s on every exam but many classmates did not do as good. Just study the material an you'll be fine.,1
"Paul is vague, unclear, unhelpful, and ultimately a waste of time. Even if you work many hours on a project that's clearly amazing, he'll probably criticize it for some obscure reason. Very biased against certain types of art and will make class miserable and for those who don't agree with him.",0
"Heavy accent. Tries his best to make you look stupid. If you don't know the answer to a question, he will humiliate you in front of the whole class. Does not help with questions or misunderstandings. He will compare you to himself, ex: ""You are not working as hard as I did."" I am an A-B student and I am having a very difficult time passing.",0
"Ronda is a wonderful teacher, very highly recomended.  Although she can come across as a bit reserved in class, and have strong opinions on the right way to do things, she is always open to listening to others ideas (and often says she learns something new),and is always willing to help with projects.  Very inspirational teacher. Highly recommended",1
"Mary is the best. If you apply yourself, you can learn a ton from her. She is funny, smart, and down to earth.",1
"Very cool guy, very humble, knows his****, has two masters and a bachelors degree. definitly wayyyy better the Mr.Norris",1
"The tests are sadistically pedantic and very long. No bathroom breaks. Lest you think the assignments are any easier, they are not. They are also pedantic, and time consuming. The lectures are equally as confusing. She's really a nice person, but consider yourself lucky if you pass this class without crying while mired in desperation at least once.",0
"i had a tough time in this class, i felt it was really difficult. she gave multiple pop quizzes and one midterm and a final. when i did the final, i really thought i was going to fail this class but once i took the final i have no idea what i did but i ended up getting a good grade in the class.",0
"This course was infamous for being difficult but after taking it with Pat Morin I don't see how it was considered to be an extremely difficult course at all, the lectures were thorough and also recorded which is a plus, and we were told exactly what to expect for the midterm. Also was very accommodating for the current situation.",1
"Before coming to college, I heard horror stories about crazy professors who didn't care if you got an A or an F. Dr. Hauck proved those stories wrong. He set time outside of class to help me understand all of the material I didn't understand. His tests were straightforward if you paid attention during lecture, and he was super fun in lab. Take him!",1
"Believes history to be your only class, expectations are sky high. Handles her review for her difficult test quite poorly. Wouldn't expect her to be here next semester.",0
"She's a great professor. There are short writing assignments every week or two, but they help prepare you for class and they're not time consuming at all. Her tests can be fairly easy if you look at the study guide she provides. Attendance isn't mandatory, but we have in class assignments every once in awhile, but you can miss two. I recommend!",1
"Her lectures go by so fast you don't know what she is saying. Test heavy for sure. She gives no extra credit at all. I am extremely good at math but she only grades her tests for the correct answer. She does not care about the process, only the final answer which sucks. I will probably fail this class and have to retake because I bombed the midterm",0
"Professor D'Sa is extremely smart in his field. There are two tests; both 25 questions and multiple choice. He is willing to help and will not trick you. He will tell you what is on the Exams, verbatim. He is the ONLY teacher that lets you use a financial calculator! Take advantage of that! Otherwise, formulas are not easy to memorize.",1
"Prof Amitava Dutta is very knowledgeable about his subject, he cares about his students, he responds his emails very fast and his YouTube video is very helpful. Don't expect to get an easy A, you have to work hard and you will learn so much like SQL, ER using Visio that is related to your future job.",1
"The class consists of heavy reading work, weekly reflections, and an overarching group project that is based on the idea of creating a well rounded lesson plan. Note that this is a foundations course, so it was my first ever lesson plan. We were verbally torn apart in front of our class for 10 minutes. Still got an A but it was not a pleasant time.",0
"Dr. Boyes is such a great teacher. He is very approachable and even though he can go off topic a bit, he helps you understand the material. That being said, his lecture slides do not contain all of the information you'll need for the exams and you will have to read the textbook if you want a good grade in this class. He is clear about this upfront.",1
"ALOT of weekly assignments. It is challenging to be on top of it because there are many assignments and 1 major individual project. I've learned alot about marketing due to these assignments she gives. She is kind-of a tough grader. If you can't do EASY (multiple) weekly tasks, then this class isn't for you. DONT BUY THE TEXTBOOK.",1
"Awful. Didn't grade anything and gave tons of lengthy weekly assignments.. at the end of the semester I had 4 recorded grades. 95 95 87 74 I ended up with a B.. I did over 20 assignments (essays, projects, quizzes) I have no idea how my grade was calculated.",0
I get my money's worth every single class session.  I will all professors were this passionate about teaching.,1
"She gave me a B in the class, and I have no idea why.  Not that B is a bad grade...but I made A's on all of the assignments and I participated in the discussions.",0
Love her! She is passionate about her work! She is a great lecturer and givrs fair assignments and grades,1
"Was failing in the class.  She gave extra credit assignments. Work really hard, and she will give you a A.  I worked hard to get my grade up, and ended from a C to a A-.  Must work hard and be dedicated.",1
I am so glad I had this professor. There were not really any proofs and he taught what would be on the test and explains well. Most of the grade was based on 2 midterms and a final but both allowed notes and were the easier of the questions. If you understand the quest hw then you'll be fine. Office hrs are super helpful. The textbook is optional,1
"This class very much based on participation. Not necessarily in class, but on your group projects. There are a good amount of assignments, but they aren't too difficult. Just make sure you get them turned in on time and you will do just fine.",1
hard with easy matrial. Very judgemental and opionated. Just lacks a lot as a teacher. Avoid if you can. Waste of money.,0
"If monotones and boring lectures aren't your cup of tea I wouldn't recommend this professor. He is nice and his classes are interesting but the 3 hours of lecture are hard to stay awake in. Attendance is a must, and there are 2 roll sheets so you can't skip, homework is easy otherwise just be prepared to feel like you're in high school again.",1
"She cares for her students and really wants them to pass. She also breaks down what you have to do well enough to understand, easy going and so joyful. I'd highly recommend her.",1
"Rick is a super-caring guy, very invested in education and health promotion. I've taken him 3 times and I have found that he is most knowledgeable in strength and conditioning, but could have done better with KIN Anatomy (still great though). Fairly easy, but he still makes you prove that you know your stuff.",1
"he's a good professor that explains his information really well. He gave out study guides to complete that helped so much with test. You do have to get the book but honestly you dont even need to read it. I passed without reading it, just come to class and take notes on the powerpoints and youll do great.",1
She's not even a business teacher!,0
"Class started out with 35 students, 5 remained and only 3 of them passed. I recommend taking Newman, he is more thorough with his teaching. It is a hard class, I get that, it's college, but Kula's teaching habits weren't for me. I dropped his class and took with a different professor and it was 10x's easier to comprehend.",0
Dr Thomas is a tough professor but he really wants the students to do well and think as individuals.,1
He never tells you what he wants bc he doesnt want to stifle your creativity then takes off points for stuff that wouldve been clear if he gave rubrics. feedback sucks and gets annoyed when you try to talk to him/clarify things. His lectures are cool and so is he but he rambles and is unhelpful. he doesnt realize that hes condescending ALL THE TIME,0
Dr. Wike is such a nice lady and she makes the class extremely interesting. I took the class a year ago and still remember most of the readings because they leave an imprint on you!! She does a very good job preparing her class especially her reading selections and her witt and inteligence are clearly shown in her classes. Take her. I love her!!!!!,1
"Excellent supplemental/elective choice for those needing an option. The course expectations are organized well. The professor opens 2-3 weeks at a time, allowing those students that need to work ahead to do so. Personally, it was like an online counseling session; the course requires that students self-reflect... excellent class",1
"By far the worst teacher and human being I have ever had the displeasure of meeting. Genuinely does not care about his students and will make sure you don't pass. Dan singer summed up: 40 min to explain one question, messes up then yells at you for not catching his mistake. He will try the same question next class and still mess up.",0
Very caring and willing to spend time out of class going over things,1
Matthew is so kind. He is cares so much for his students and is very invested in his classroom. I highly recommend taking his class if you are taking FDN. The work is very reasonable and enjoyable.,1
"Took MET205 with her a while back, she was always very clear in her lectures and her grading was always fair (she also got grades in pretty fast, which was nice). Sometimes the lectures were a little slow-paced, which made it hard to stay focused in the mornings, but otherwise she was a pretty good professor. :)",1
"I had her for Children's Lit. She is extremely unaproachable, dont email her for anything...she'll read your email but wont respond to you...the amount of work you get for the class is overwhelming...we had to read 2 books the week before finals! a 3 credit course...pathetic! the amount of work everyone did we should get 8 credits! Dont take her!",0
"Good natured prof, quite knowledgeable, tests are challenging but you can get a good mark",1
"I like Yvonne, she's passionate about what she does, she's nice, but I don't like her teaching style. I took Exploring Photography, more like, ""history of photography"", she is way into art and film, you'll be using the darkroom for pinhole assignments and won't be learning much about your digital camera. Lectures are long and not hands on at all.",0
"Professor Chang is extremely professional, nice, respectful and knowledgeable. He knows how to engage the students and make us participate. Very helpful to students regarding writing their papers. A very good professor.",1
"Class and Professor Unorganized and unclear. Never know what is expected. Arrogant, self serving,controlling, retained hardly anything. If you can take a different professor for this class I would recommend it.",0
"She never explains her project expectations, frequently uses profanity in class, and is heavy on favouritism. She grades difficult to make her classes seem more intense than they actually are. Surprised if she runs her 2 hour lecture for longer than 45 minutes. An easy way to get a good grade is to just go along with her jokes.",0
"For US Politics, Lois is really easy. All you have to do each week is fill out a ""Study Guide"" and that is mainly graded on how well you cite your sources (Use Chicago or APA). It may seem useless to do them each week, but the midterm and final are completely based on them- so study them and you'll do fine. If you want an easy A, take her",1
"Has to be one of the easiest classes at Rutgers. Minimal work, but a lot of it can come down to your TA who grades your final paper and short assignments, but on the whole ridiculously easy. Definitely take it.",1
"Stoner is a funny guy but his voice will put you to sleep. BUT GOOD NEWS... he gives his students all the tests back with correct answers at the end of the year so go look on note swap and every quiz, test, and essay question are waiting for you. Bad part is attendance is a must because you have in class quizzes every day",0
Un cours facile avec un A assuré. Présence obligatoire et 3 heures a tous les cours. Gors travail d'équipe et présentation orale. C'est bon pour remonter ta note!,1
"Organic is hard as it is, but she believes if you do not do good on her stuff that you will fail at your major and you need to change it.  She's not very inspirational.  Her test go from easy to hard.  Her grading system is very helpful and if you're good at chemistry she will be your bestfriend.",1
"Mr. Harvey was awesome! The class was very easy, show up to class and participate. He makes learning fun. I would absolutely recommend this class.",1
If your education and your grade is important to you also if you are new to chemistry then then AVOID this professor AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!!!!,0
"Prior exp recommended, not req'd f/program-- maybe it should be due to lab. Go fig, 3 labs & they R never ""open"", false advertising. BTW, 10 peeps failed the catheter 1st time, it's a program issue. I have gone above & beyond what is req'd class wise. When I was looking into exp COC called. At least I got away from YOU! Why do ya care A.F.?",1
"Professor Epley gives a substantial amount of feedback on graded papers, which was extremely helpful. We did not write that many papers, and I hardly had any homework. Class participation is important, but the class discussions are stimulating. If you try in this class, you'll get an A.",1
"Very fun teacher! Show up and try hard at each project and your sure to get a good grade. Study hard for quizzes, they were a bit challenging even for someone with photography experience.",1
"She is VERY into the material she is teaching. Although I am not english major, I admire her zest for life. Good teacher!",1
Mr. Watkins is one of my favorite teachers at NOC. he makes learning about other countries fun and educational.,1
The work that she expects you to do is reflective of a 400 level course. The depth of questions and speed at which she expects you to finish exams is not something that someone who is just trying to get their associates degree should be worried about. Just take someone else.,0
"Really fun guy! As long as you study the textbook and do all of your assignments, you'll get a good grade. Very understanding and makes long classes interesting with his examples. Offers really nice extra credit opportunities too!",1
This class seemed easy until finals came around. She makes the chest sheet for you which for me is not very helpful as what makes sense to her does not make sense to me. She was however very understanding during the other parts of the course I doubt Ill pass this class.,0
"I won't deny his intelligence. But he could care less about teaching. After whole semester he still does not know anyone's name (class of 20). I've been called 4 different names. If you don't agree with his view, he'll grade harsh on you. Professors like him made thinking illegal.",0
"Going into the class it seems okay, grades are made up of three tests (drops the lowest of 4) and participation. But the tests are ridiculously specific and difficult, i9f she mentions something in lecture, even in passing, assume its on the test. The average participation grade was 12.5/17. Unnecessarily hard, don't take it.",0
"I literally completed this entire course in 6 days. It was easy but there was reading involved. The quizzes are short and you only get one chance to take them, and they count for a big % of your grade. Tests were all short answer but easy since they were vocab from the back of the textbook. There were less than 10 total assignments. So easy.",1
The course was awesome. Loved the material and the course set up. What was missing was the teacher. No feedback and when we tried to ask questions he would never get back to us. I honestly could not tell you a single thing about the teacher. the course was great but I would choose a more involved teacher to get more out the class. ,1
Terrible teacher and calls out students.,0
"Elementary Logic is very much like Algebra or other forms of math.  If you do not enjoy math or are not good at math, avoid  Elementary Logic.",0
"Burnier was awesome! He made his grading style very clear and stuck to the syllabus schedule. All assignments were known about in advance giving everyone plenty of opportunity to complete it. Some of his lectures were long, but always had a purpose that he class benefited from. Be sure to attend class, and read the assigned material.",1
"I lived in his office by the end of the semster.  He is the hardest teacher you will EVER have but he is beyond helpful because he is very knowledgable.  It wasn't uncommon to spend more than an hour per problem.  You may not get a great grade, but you will learn so much!",1
"Professor Misako Van Der Poel is great! I don't understand why most comments say that she is a tough grader. If you pay attention in class, participate, and ask questions you will do great! She lets you work with everyone around you in every single quiz, her tests are based on the study guide she gives you. I wish I had her this quarter again!",1
"This is my 2nd time taking this course & yet again, I am on the verge of failing. Looking at past comments, I have no idea why he hasn't been fired yet! He is rude & refuses to help. I went to his office hours & it was like he wanted nothing to do with me. 66 years old. Why hasn't he retired yet? HE NEEDS FIRED!",0
"I've never met a professor so picky about work, I'd understand if this was a more advanced course like thesis 1 or something, but 3D design is a beginners course and he is ruthless with his students, you better make sure nothing in your pieces are off because he picks it apart like crazy, he's a funny guy and chill to talk to but extremely picky",0
"I hate this class. Group work, forced class discussion, and a lot of homework.",0
"This professor is very knowledgeable, but she spends SO much time discussing diet/food topics that are unnecessary for this specific course. Because she spent so much time going on tangents about nutrition instead of delving deeper into our A&P topics, I didn't gain much from her lectures. The class is an easy A, but you won't learn much about A&P.",0
"A remarkable lecturer and person, easy to approach, breaks out into song during lecture & class and makes things fun/interesting. Don't get me wrong you'll work hard, ie: loads of HW, labs & tests are hard. But worth it! especially if you are a bio major. After this class you'll have strong foundational knowledge in all things cell/molec Bio",1
"Professor Humber isn't very good, though he does try. His tests are difficult, but he grades very easy, though sometimes it's frustrating how arbitrary his qualifications are. Take him if you want a decent grade without too much work (at least, in comparison to other sections), but if you really want a good Calc II professor, try someone else.",0
Very tough professor but wants to help you as much as she can.,1
"I'm normally not the type to be negative. I'm a hard working student and do my best. This wasn't an English class, more like Political. All our papers were on politics. She would spend endless time ""sharing"" her opinion. She gave me and another a C when he didn't even finish the paper and I only had 2 errors in five pages. I do not suggest. Awful.",0
"Instructor Camp is very obviously passionate about the subject he teaches, but he teaches the class as though everyone in there is going to write professionally. He grades very harshly and you will not rate an A if you do not exceed the required number of pages. If you value your GPA and are not into constantly revising papers, I do not recommend.",0
"Pat is actually a really smart teacher, when you're taking his course you will feel it cause you'll not be able to understand what's going on at the most time (maybe because I'm not smart enough). The midterm worthed a big percentage, and there're totally different things in his assignments. Anyway, happy to say goodbye :)",0
Very rude and slow,0
HE'S THE BEST!!!!(:,1
"Gilmore was such a great professor! His class was my 1st upperdiv Sociol course and I got an A! He is a very fair grader and makes connections that students are able to understand in lectures. He does't have any slides but he tells you what is important for the test. Attendance isn't mandatory, but is strongly suggested! Take Gilmore if you can:)",1
In this class you will learn about the cultural aspect of filmmaking. Deep dives into film techniques and events that impact various countries and how they revolutionized film. The readings are interesting and the professor is very knowledgable. I don't think the class takes a lot of effort but you do need to study in order to write the essays.,1
I loved Prof. Nuneville!! She was so nice and made lectures interesting. She's high up in the Arlington County PD which is so cool to hear about her career. She also brought in so many guest lecturers because she has so many connections which spiced the class up a bit. I highly recommend taking her!!,1
"She is a horrible teacher and I would not recommend her to anyone! She talks down to you and she picks favorites. I seemed to had in a bunch of assignments, but never got any back, I never knew how I was doing in that class. If you don't agree with her, she's not going to listen to you. Her classes are quite boring too, lots of lecturing.",0
It blows me away that this is a foundations course. It was by far my lowest grade. She marks this assignments like English papers and if it is not absolutely perfect then she throws a 65 on the paper. Do not take foundations 201 with her you will regret it.,0
"There is a lot of reading in this class that is very, very dense so do not take during a heavy semester because you will spend a lot of time reading. Lecture and section are mandatory. Professor Roberts does not give a very organized lecture, but the material is really interesting. I am still confused about what they wanted for the papers...",0
"One of the strictest graders I've ever had.  Marks off often for written answers and usually just explains it by writing ""more detail"" with no explanation as to what she means.  The material itself is not difficult and she makes it easy enough to understand.  But when it comes to grading, she doesn't seem to care if you demonstrate understanding.",0
"She really tried hard to help us but had trouble with a lot of things.  Test were really hard, and she is hard to understand during her lectures! Her point scales were messed up, but get your work in on time and you will do fine!  I pretty much got C's on the test and still passed with an A.  So do your work and stay on her good side!",0
"Sad, sad case. She's hopelessly stuck in the effete, pseudo-philosophical theory camp of decades ago. Can't think outside rote memorization of Derrida and Heidegger. Ridiculously pretentious to boot. Study with a serious *scholar* instead.",0
rude to students calls us stupid and lazy by saying all we do is play on our phones. tests are unbearably tough and half the things on the test he never talks about in class. Whenever u ask questions he rolls his eyes won answer them because apparently he told you about it before. I could go on and on about him! If you see him as your teacher RUN!!,0
"Professor Hersh was a nice lady however she gave way too much work. I don't think she considered the fact that students have other classes to worry about. We had to write a 4-5 page reflection paper every week. Yes, every week. There was a lot of reading and writing. If you take this class, you need to be able to handle the work load.",0
"Susan is nice enough, but she tends to pick favorites in the class, especially the ones who are getting A's. I ended up dropping her because her grading process is really unfair. I dropped the class",0
"Dr. Keyworth doesn't lecture, instead he creates an engaging discussion that makes you more interested in the material. Very approachable and will help you pick out a good research topic or clarify readings. He assigns a lot of readings but they are essential to answering the essay questions on the exams. Now I feel inspired to visit China. ",1
"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Dr. Curtis as a person. As a teacher? Not so much. She rarely lectures on the topic at hand and instead tells stories of her family and her time in the field as a sex anthropologist, which would be hilarious if not so off-topic. Passing the class is doable, but you have to do the work yourself to memorize the textbook.",0
"Attendance is not mandatory, but show up anyway he gives extra credit. Occasionally hard to understand but overall a good class.",1
Fantastic teacher!,1
Probably the worst teacher I have ever had.  He is incredibly boring (he only uses powerpoint) during class and the readings he picks are painful.  He is also a very unfair grader and grades based on favoritism.  He also assigns an insane amount of work for an intro class.  He is also very unclear and unwilling to help students.,0
She is very approachable and s a great teacher...very willing to help,1
"Super easy class if you put in the work. I would study like 2 days a week and I was averaging an A on the quizzes. The cool thing is if you maintain an A in the class you don't have to take the final! He's a little dry at times, but its an interesting class. Would take again.",1
I would not recommend taking this class unless you are very interested in linguistics. There are no slides and lecture can be repetitive and dull. Attend class because your best bet is to repeat Sam verbatim on exams or you will probably be marked off.,0
She is a very tough grader and is super picky on papers. Her tests are dumb as well. Her teaching is dead boring and she is very mean. Avoid at all costs.,0
"Assignments are not specific. Whenever I ask her a question, her response is ""refer to the assignment."" Poor grammar that makes the assignments confusing. Posts assignments in modules that are not due that week. Would not recommend this teacher to anyone. I've taught myself more about communications than she's taught me. Teacher's Rate: 0",0
He's a really nice guy but doesn't always seem to understand questions.  Homework is minimal.,1
"Where do I begin. How about the fact that we finished the curriculum BEFORE SPRING BREAK. We hadn't had exam 1 and he was already teaching exam 3 material. I use the term ""teachcing"" VERY loosely. He does not work out problems contrary to what he says. He puts a piece of paper on a project and reads the numbers for 15 seconds. A V O I D. ",0
Great Professor! Explains well and clear grading criteria. No surprises,1
"This class takes 4x as much work than other courses and the grading is tough.  Hardest B that I earned, but I learned a lot and gain good experience. At the time, I griped about the workload, but now that I have a job, it was the best course that I had at UNT. It gave me an edge over others that started my company @ the same time since I already  ",1
"The best prof ever have, easy test but hard assignment.",1
"This prof is very knowledgeable; however, the workload is very large and it is extremely easy to loose track as to where things are going. No matter how much of the book you read, the classes and test will contain things that are not covered in class.  If order to obtain a good grade, make sure you have a light course load or have no social life.",0
"The poor guy is an open book. His insecurities, in reguards to intellect, are quite apparent. It really shows in his pompous, arrogant, and jugemental behavior. I think Steve would benefit from a good self evaluation before classes begin in the spring.",0
overall the material is great but unfortunately this guy does not have the ability to provide an example and clarification to the class. Hw is copy and paste which he will provide to you and during the exam he doesn't care whether you're cheating or not as long as your near the average or above the average you'll be guaranteed an B past exams need,0
Did not learn anything throughout the whole semester.,0
"The professor seemed cool at first, but he doesn't care about opinions. He is hard to understand and his class was extremely disorganized. He struggles quite a bit with technology. He chose a book for the course that he blatantly conflicted all the time, making it hard to study. This course was much harder than it should have been.",0
Awesome teacher!,1
"Professor Johnson is overall a really good professor. I had trouble with his class at first because Im a hands-on learner, and his class is all lecture and power-points (he posts them all online though!) However, when I reached out to him, he made the effort to make sure I understood material so Id do well on the final. :) Be sure to study hard!",1
"The most monotoned, boring teachers i have ever had. He i the harshest grader too, he took points off of my essay because he disagreed with me opinions. DONT TAKE HIS CLASS! ",1
He is a nice and funny guy but I would not take him again. He acts like he offers so much help but really doesn't. You really need to know your stuff to pass this class.,0
"Absolutely awful! Was extremely disorganized and appeared confused by the material when questioned about it in class. Very dry to listen too, as well likes to say the word 'um' or 'uh' several times in a sentence. Two assignments were easy, however, her exam is over email which makes me nervous as she appears to have no skill with technology.",0
"HORRIBLE professor. She's very unclear, hard to follow her lectures. Tests are hard & she purposely tricks you, its NOT type of problems on the study guide or classwork. Im great in math & had a very hard time to keep an A cuz of her teaching style. I had to teach myself almost everything & went to other professors for help. DO NOT TAKE HER",0
"He moves too fast in lecture. When he ""works out"" problems in class he just puts a previously worked out problem on the projector and has a contest with himself to see how fast he can go through it. ",0
This man clearly does not use a learning plan to prepare for his lectures. Time and time again he will awkwardly asks questions that have nothing to do with the material and google things for the whole 2 hour period. Sobie is also very unclear about what will be on the exams or quizzes and when they will be. Dont take him!,0
I think prof zeman is one of the best instructors I ever had.  I took her this past summer for microbiology lab.  Even though it was a consolidated summer course I feel she kept the material interesting and easy to understand.  I learned so much from her which will come in handy for my future nursing career.  Would def take her for another course.,1
She is so sweet and honestly one of my favorite teachers Ive ever had. I took French 1 with absolutely no background in french and passed with a 99. She tells you everything you need to know for tests and always emails back pretty quickly. You get points for each day you are in class and you learn important stuff everyday so you should go to class,1
"Great class,  learned a lot on a topic I thought I knew a lot about. Great professor and was very helpful in advising about his class and your educational career as a whole. ",1
"Tom seems like a nice guy at first, but then you quickly come to realize the mundane nature of his lectures. A typical day in class alternates between lulling you to sleep and painfully awkward. The tests consist of 5 essays that will be picked apart to the bone. There are much better courses to take to get the most from your money.",0
Boring. Do not expect her to answer your questions in a clear manor. The tests are straight from the book and you only have 3 or 4. Not hard at all and I hate studying. However she expects you to turn in a 10 pg essay & powerpoint on a group project at the end of the semester! Pls drop if you can not dedicate personal time to meet w/ your group!,1
"She's very nice, and the homework is incredibly easy. But she's incredibly unclear about what she wantsexpects, which can lead to missing a deadline because she wasn't clear about the deadline, and she refuses to take late work (except of course when she doesn't). Nice, but not a college-level teacher. Lots of youtube music videos and an easy book",0
Take him for calc 1. He gives you all year to turn in homework and his study guides are almost exactly like his tests. Very helpful. I definitely recommend him.,1
"Stay away from her. Grossly unprofessional. Almost her entire class is failing. Her test averages are the lowest of all sections(multiple semesters). Insults students. Actually wrote up false paperwork about a student to retaliate against him filing a a complaint with dept chair. ""A"" students go become failing students in her class.",0
"Does not make expectations clear. First paper almost the whole class received C's. She lectures like below average professor, struggles to get her point across, and only has you read the books and post on discussion board...yet grades like we are grad students. Even grades low on participation if you are active! I would not recommend her class.",0
I know she comes out with a low rating. She is constantly off topic and you really end up learning much of the material on your own. However she keeps the class interesting and fun. And she really enjoys and understands what she teaches. She just has a difficult time explaining it. I still recommend her overall.,0
"Sometimes it's hard to understand what he's saying, but he usually speaks directly from the slideshow (which come directly from the book). He puts the slideshows on Blackboard so the students have access to them. However, that does NOT mean you can skip class. If you do, you'll get lost.",1
"All he does is read off powerpoints and show youtube videos. He's a nice guy and means no harm, but he's just not a good teacher. He allows a cheat sheet for tests, and has all homework and quizzes online so your grade can't be that bad. But I wouldn't recommend to most people",0
"Grades are based on only two exams, the midterm and the final . Thus, he gives the opportunity of receiving extra credit though participating in class and/or handing in answers to the questions he gives at the end of every class. Lectures are interesting .",1
He was not really helpful at all. He never gave us graded assignments back on time. He was disorganized and did not follow his syllabus. He graded papers way too hard for no reason. I didn't learn really anything in his class.,0
"Worst  , professor  , very difficult, and boring  course . I love biology , but   this professor , scare me  to love biology , science   I didn't learn nothing  from his course , I'm feel sorry for myself . This professor is out of my list .Never , ever again classes  with  him .",0
"Such a fun class! As long as you show up, it's really easy to pass.",1
I loved this class! It was really easy for me and Trina was extremely caring and genuinely wanted the students in her class to understand the material. She was born to teach!,1
"Easy A in my opinion. If you are a student like me(someone who pays attention in class and reviews their notes for the exam rather than study from the book) you will be fine. If you are a ""dumb"" student, don't take the class. She is the only teacher to give soooo much extra credit at the end of the test, it's crazy. Im in Chem 2 rn and I miss it.",1
Bring a pillow to class....,0
This class is horrible with him. I attended this class everyday. Some TAs grade very hardly. Not helpful. Not clear. Not easy.,0
"Out of all the math teachers I ever had Mr. Abdel is certainly the best. Like many people I'm not a genius in math but he really worked with me and I actually understand the problems.  He is a fair professor, if you show up and do the work and participate, he will notice.  If you skip class and are lazy don't expect him to give you extensions. ",1
I constantly had to email him to check and change the grades because of mistakes. Responses I got back felt sarcastic and made me feel like I was annoying him for emailing. I will not be taking another course from him again.,0
Physics 101. This should have been an easy A but everything including the syllabus was unclear from the start of this class. No one in the class knew what was going on because he only had 3 assignments throughout the whole semester. I went to him for help multiple times throughout the semester but he was just rude. Worst prof I've ever had.,0
"I felt he knew the subject well.  He was helpful when I had questions.  Online forums were interesting, but I don't feel I learned much from them and they took most of my time every week.  Final was hard since he gave us a sheet that was supposed to have all the subjects on the final, but a lot of the questions asked were not on that sheet.",1
Great Professor with real world experience,1
"Doesn't explain criteria explicitly for assignments, difficult to understand what she's looking for. hard to get extra help because she seems to think everyone should know what she knows after multiple degrees",0
"If you really want to learn, this is one of the professors you will want to spend time with. She will challenge you, but that's what you are here for. Cindy White is easily one of the best teachers I've ever had, her lectures are always engaging and well constructed.. Yes, you will have to earn your grade and you will be glad you did.",1
"I personally loved having him for Psych 304, everything was made very clear during lectures and he goes over the problems specifically. His tests are kinda weird bc he focuses a lot on math during lecture but his tests have conceptual idea that need to be explained thoroughly in order to get credit. I recommend honestly",1
"she seems a little spaced out sometimes, or shes very forgetful about things.  shes a nice person but that wont help you learn anything!",0
"In laymans terms - lots of smoke & mirrors. The perception he gave in class was different from what was posted. Some good stories but there was a lot of ""did I say this in this class or last class"" while at the same time insisting he said something that he did not. We proved this in class and then had a surprise assignment. hmmm",0
"Professor Dagenais is one of the worst professors I have ever had. Her lectures are bland and way too long. She also made a 10 page research assignment only worth 28% of the final grade. Claimed that memorizing 64 + artworks is ""spoon-feeding"". Overall a prof you should avoid at all costs, even if that means delaying your required course.",0
"Her tests are what killed my A grade. They are hard because there isn't always one right answer, you have to use her teachings to figure out the best answer. I got 's on every assignment but D's and C's on every test. Other than that, I really liked her. She's extremely organized and she always responds to emails and questions. Very personable!",1
I took this class in the summer.  It was very difficult.  I am excellent in mathematics and got a C.  She let us go 30 minuets before class was scheduled to go every day. She only taught us the basic applications of geometry and didn't dig deeper into the subject unless we asked her at the start of class.  She mad the homework very hard to do.,0
"Excellent professor!  Very helpful especially with such a difficult course on-line.  There should be more professors like him at La Verne!  You can tell that Mr. Nelson puts effort into both his students and his work. Very, very helpful!! And this was an on-line course, can you imagine if he were teaching on-campus!? He'd be excellent!!!",1
"He is a Red Sox fan.  He likes to talk about them.  He isn't a bad guy, he uses real life examples and likes to talk about politics too.  The class wasn't that bad.  Hard, but he gave me a decent grade at the end.",1
This professor seems like he is never ready for class. He will print your midterm on the day of during the class time. He never posts assignment on moodle on time.,0
"this guy,he thinks he's smart but I am so regreting taking his class.sucks that there is only one Organic Chemistry lecture for BSU...during lecture he talks alot but its useless...Its better off to study through online lectures from other universities. I studied with Yale online lecture and it helped me to pass this class.",0
"Capstone was crazy. Nothing seemed related to anything.  Don't get me wrong, the man is a genius...and a good teacher... I just wouldn't recommend taking capstone from him...you'll get no direction whatsoever. I think he'd be great in other classes.",0
"His quizzes come directly from the homework (which is optional) and the tests are composed of a bank of questions he provides. (With the numbers changed of course). So if you put the time into his class you can get an A for sure. However, his lectures were boring and largely based on theory instead of how to solve it. ",1
"I took this teacher online for medical terminology and she was amazing, she was able to answer all of my questions very quickly. Plus she made the material very easy to understand.",1
"Great professor, would have loved to have her presentation notes that she used to show us on the board on eCampus to study off of since the book is awful at explaining topics.",1
"She's a veryyyy nice lady. There is a lot that you go over as it covers alll of Africa. But, it is an easy A. She's very clear on what she wants and studys for the exams with you the class before the exam. Don't get the book. I brought it to class once and never used it after.",1
"Shes terrible. She talks in circles and barely makes any sense. She takes attendance every class so you have to go but you don't learn a single thing. She is extremely unclear about everything yet expects you to know what she is talking about, when a lot of times it seems like she doesn't know what shes talking about. Never take her classes.",0
"Good teacher.  Read his notes online and thenotes you take it class and you will do good :) Dont bother on buying a book, you won't open it once...",1
A lot of homework but it is all fairly easy. She is very organized and will post every assignment due for the next few weeks so you are prepared. A lot of group assignments that require you to meet outside of class.,1
"Pretty difficult, even for a beginner level chem. lectures are dry and boring. Most of the tests are from the book, so don't overly rely on lecture. Just spend a good chunk of time studying from book and you'll do okay.",0
Worst WRC professor  ever. never explains always talking about random stuff. doesnt grade essays untill 2 months later. avoid her at all cost. her ratings were higher when i checked they must have been bs.,0
She is such an amazing professor!! Shes very understanding and patient with her students as they are learning ASL and includes a lot of fun activities in the class. I would 100% recommend anyone who either has to take this class as a requirement or just wants to learn ASL to take it with Professor Hellmann.,1
"The class is easy if you have programming experience(any kind of C is even more helpful). He gives extra credit opportunities for doing extra programming on lab/homework assignments and is helpful if  you can not get something working, just make sure to address it before its due.",1
Very clear. He ROCKS!,1
Tests are too long to complete in the allotted time. She gets off topic easily. Lectures are boring and hard to follow and her feedback is unclear and always needs further clarification. I would not recommend this professor to anyone.,0
"He obviously knows a lot about the subject but is just a terrible teacher. He plays a video which teaches all of the concepts and he isn't too keen on doing examples after to actually use the concepts you just learned. However, his class is easy simply because he tells you everything that will be on the tests and you can use a cheat sheet.",0
He is very easy. Make sure you go to class and participate. Thats how you will get an A!,1
"I don't recommended taking this class with this professor if you're planning to transfer. She will NOT take the time to answer questions, go over exams or  review for any major exams. Her grading criteria is confusing to which makes you believe you'll  pass.  ""I don't know"" is her signature phrase.  I",0
"Sometimes Professor Spaeth's explanations of grammatical concepts were difficult to understand, but having the information in the textbook helps you follow along. You have to be ready to answer homework problems and translate in class - participation is very important. Had 13 quizzes, some of which are pretty difficult, but she drops the lowest 3.",1
"Trombley is the worst teacher I have experienced. I was having a major surgery on the day a test was given. I asked if I could redo the test, but she informed me that he doesn't give redo's. I told her my situation, and all she said was you should have scheduled it another day. I scheduled this months before signing up for this class. Unforgiving.",0
I took astronomy in high school and attended almost every lecture for the class but it was still extremely challenging. Reading the chapters and taking notes in lecture was a breeze and I felt I understood everything until I would get my tests back! Very nit-picky grader for an introductory class and tests basically make up your entire grade.,0
"Dr. Miura, while being pretty lecture heavy, clearly knows a lot about the material and cares about his students' understanding of it. He also gives homework assignments that are pretty easy to get As on, which helps boost your grade, and is nice! STUDY FOR HIS TESTS!! They're directly out of his lectures, so if you study you should do well.",1
Dr. Butler is the bomb dot com! She really knows her stuff. She makes the content fun and easy to remember. Lectures are short and her sense of humor makes the time go by fast. Exams are easy A if you study and attend class. I used to hate chemistry and she made it one of my favorite classes. Homework and labs are simple. Take her!!,1
Most boring teacher. He does  not know anything. He keeps teaching and students don't get anything.,0
"Great guy! I wouldn't say the class is super interesting but Holt is just an exceptionally nice, honest guy. If you put in a little bit of work, talk in class every once in a while, and show reasonable effort and understanding, you will get an A.",1
"Dr. T. is one of the BEST bio professors here. He's really passionate about the subject, he  truely cares about the students, very helpful and approachable. This guy is the best!",1
Jenny is amazing! You need to go to lectures to ensure you actually know the material because she does not post any lecture slides or lecture content so you will not know the material unless you get the notes from friends in the class. The tests are fair and the assignments are interesting!,1
Goes on so many tangents. Lecture slides are not detailed. HW questions are made by him and so specific to what he says in class. I find it hard to learn in this class because he doesn't necessarily follow the textbook and there's not that much outside sources that help since its such a specific topic.,0
"Took his for Phys 2211. This class is a tough class, however, this professor makes it much tougher. There are only 3 Tests (60%), Homework (10%), and the Final (30%). The tests only have 3 questions which are extremely hard.  I beg you, do not take this professor. Wait a semester if you have to. Pick ANYONE else.",0
"Ms. Wang is a great professor. She's helpful, doesn't micromanage, and is very understanding. Teaching method is very easy to understand, and is at a very healthy but not fast pace.",1
"Took her in fall 2017. Uses ALEKS. Gives ton of opportunities for extra credit. Tends to lecture quickly, but encourages students to let her know when she moves too fast. Allows a 3X5 index card cheat sheet (highly recommend hand-written over typed) for exams. You can work on HW in class if you're ahead. No office hours since she's part-time.",1
"After having several emotional breaks due to her, I changed majors.",0
I took her seminar class. Shes very sweet and is a pretty easy grader. Its kind of an unnecessary class but shes the perfect professor to have for it. Shes also always eager to help students.,1
Her class is extremely interesting.  I have learned so much from her.,1
"Really easy to get coursework in. Lots of reading, but thats to be expected with a short summer class.",1
"If you are a weak math student, do not take this course with Ostry. His lectures are boring and not interactive. He does not provide assignments to keep you on track throughout the semester, and the text is hard to understand without supplemental material. As many people before have said, take it with Amsel.",0
If you take this class seriously then she will take you seriously. Class should be easier than she makes it but prof is passionate about restoration and has lots of good points to make aside from the readings. Exam questions tend to be technical and not always based on the main points so study. Really wants you to learn.,1
PROFESSOR LEE HAS GIVEN ME A CLEARER UNDERSTANDING IN THE SUBJECT OF COLLEGE ALGEBRA. SHE IS PATIENT AND TRULY CARE FOR HER STUDENTS. I DEFINITELY TAKE HER CLASS AGAIN.,1
Most caring professor I've ever had. Genuinely cares about every student.,1
"I would lay down my LIFE for this woman. Best professor I have ever had. Not sure if I want to marry her or to be her, but probably both.",1
"Dr. Park was the worst professor I have ever had. If youve taken this class you should be entitled to free therapy. I have a near perfect GPA and I had a 40 in this class. If I wanted to struggle this much, I would have packed a bag and tried to climb Mount Everest. Her tests are impossible. Not sure why she has such a good rating on here.",0
"FSE100 is an easy class on its own, as there are no tests, but Muhlian sure does make it quite unenjoyable. He is very bad at explaining what happens during lab, and oftentimes the whole class (including the TAs) are confused about what we're supposed to be doing. During lecture, he's also confusing and not very engaging .",0
"Mr. Lee is a great professor. I honestly do not know why he has such a low evaluation in here. I took Accounting and Business Computer Applications with him and the classes were pretty easy. He eas very helpful. Sometimes it may be hard to understand him because of his accent, but if you're willing to to all the work you will have an ""A""",1
Do all the readings and the tests should be easy. Can't just listen to her lectures because they were short and just skimmed the information. Readings take a while but they are engaging because the online textbook includes a lot of pictures as well as vids and practice questions along the way to make sure you understand. Tests were multiple choice,1
"Disorganized, cannot hear a thing in his lectures, grading takes more than a month. His midterms are quite easy but the finals stab your back. He goes off tangent soooooo much it's kind of hard at times to understand if he's lecturing or not.",0
Dont know why she appears to be so mean on our marks: the lecture room is far from the other lecture buildings but she will always start the participation questions at the very beginning of the class? She doesn't consider if people would get injured on a slippery road when rushing from another classroom far from hers. Tends to give everyone lowmark,0
"Personally I felt the course was a bit unorganized and formatted in an usual way. There is a lot of reading and the course is broken down into multiple assignments. If you put in the effort, it's possible to get a good grade in this class, it can just start to feel dragged out pretty quickly.",0
"I took English 101, 102, and British Lit with Tucker. She is really sweet and is extremely clear on what she wants. She will get angry if no one shows up though, ALWAYS go to class. I went one day when no one showed up and she gave a pop quiz for bonus points and it was comprised of opinion questions so everyone made a 100. Great teacher.",1
"I'm a junior and took this class as an elective. Mr. Mac is by far the most fair, consistent professor you could get for a weed-out class like this one. That being said, this class can be a handful! Read the textbook, really try to understand the examples, and make sure you have a firm grip on concepts. Not a very math-heavy course. Would recommend",1
Makes class enjoyable by sharing experiences . Has many extra cred opportunities . Sometimes will follow a PowerPoint .,1
"Professor Fowler was quirky and always interesting.  I had no interest in Chaucer prior to signing up for this class, and just did it to knock out a pre 1800 requirement.  Now I absolutely love Chaucer.  She was very helpful and I definitely recommend this class to anyone.",1
"Professor Makover is probably one of the worst professor I have ever come in contact with, barely explains stuff in class and runs over it very quickly with no examples. He refers to our knowledge and compares it to 4th and 5th graders, even though I have heard him say multiple times that ""Our knowledge is probably better than his.""",0
"Professor Xing is a great professor. Organic chemistry is a tough subject, however it didn't seem as bad as people say. If you pay attention in class, study, and do the homework assignments, you will do well in the course. You should definitely take her. ",1
Please skip this class if possible. There is absolutely no communication or organization throughout the quarter. The poor TAs were always struggling to catch up with the professor and I never knew what was going on. The lectures and exams are extremely intense. He's very passionate but not the best professor for an intro class.,0
"This man looooves to waste trees and give the most amount of worksheets. In my opinion, this class is a very easy A, but the material on homework, quizzes, and tests is very inconsistent. He is very scatter-brained and all over the place with his explanations. He's funny and all, but I learned nothing about how to teach kids math",0
"He is very good professor for accounting. He write everything on board. He explain everything slow, so no one stays behind. If Final exam grade are grater then all other text he will ignore the other grades. Get ready to take notes. He give study guide for exam which is a great help.",1
"I don't know if it's Covid or what, but this semester has been a disaster. She doesn't return emails or check in with students for WEEKS. The quizzes are filled with mistakes that she refuses to fix and sent a defensive email when she received feedback about it. Classes are poorly organized. I got more out of my interactions with peers than her.",0
"This man has seen everything that psychology has to offer. He is the sweetest, and if you're invested in his class, he is very good to his students. He goes on a lot of tangents, but he is amazing to listen to. If you get bored, just count how many times he says ""what"". Would 100% recommend him and only him for psych.",1
"I honestly would not recommend him. He will give a certain type of example on the board during class, but will give you quizzes and tests on a completely different example you DID NOT do in class. Coming from someone who took Calc in HS and understood it really well and could do it in my sleep, I find it really hard to learn from Tripp.",0
Wonderful teacher!!! He helps you understand if you don't quite get it and he wants EVERYONE to succeed! Wish I had him this semester!!,1
"He's not the best professor, but he's an actual decent guy when you speak to him. He has a weird humor; you just have to get it. He gives four quizzes and drops the lowest grade",0
"Good class, he knows his stuff.  His test questions involve alot of extra information you don't need to answer the question so watch out.  Very helpful and friendly.",1
"A sweet person but her teaching style is pretty awful. Despite the pandemic, she has actually made it more difficult to complete this course and has been kind of insensitive to the course load that her students have. Since then we have essentially been teaching ourselves, while she continues to assign things while still not grading past assignments",0
A really nice person but not a nice professor. The class is poorly taught and the textbook is useless. Homework problems are often impossible to solve and tests are for creative mathematicians. Almost depressed by taking this class.,0
"Good guy. You have to put the work in throughout the entire semester - I didnt and had a tough time with the final exam. Teaches accounting in a unique way, which helps you stay focused on an otherwise mundane, difficult subject.",1
So Not sure if it is because we had to switch to online but this class was unnecessarily difficult. The test averages were around 65 to 50. The tests were timed which was a huge issues it felt rushed and like you didn't have time to go over your answers. On top of that it's a lot of material over short periods of time.,0
Useless teacher. Comes into class consistently later than he says he will and explains why he was late. He makes the classes run past the end to compensate for his tardiness. It's a common exam for this course so do not take him; he will waste all of your time.  I'm going to give a formal complaint to the Dean tomorrow.,1
"Professor Hooper Mark has been my strength, though I know quite right that I am going to learn a lot from him when I first met him but never think that it will be as much as I did. In fact, Hooper your mode of teaching is really superb and clarity of words as the best teaching method which I believe will continue linger in all our heart.",1
"Easy class and really sweet guy! he honestly wants every1 to do well, very forgiving about things like late assignments or re-dos. not a particularly interesting subject, esp if its not ur major, but he does his best to make it very simple. Very clear instructions on assignments, presentation at the end of the course on whatever topic u want.",1
"Rebecca is very passionate about communications - it shows when she is delivering content.  She is very nice, approachable, and understanding.  Do read the book - she loves to use terms and concepts from the book during class.  The quizzes are also based on the book.",1
Very scary... She hardly understand your questions and her tests are very hard--8 choices for mc questions. Try to avoid her...,0
"A very nice woman with very rigid grading. However, she is a very good teacher and if you go to her office she'll help you as much as she can. Just watch out for the homework assignments. They take up a ton of time, and she only picks 2 problems to grade so you can get unlucky and have the one problem you got wrong picked.",1
Fowler is totally disorganized. Class discussions are rambling and unplanned and it's not clear what you're supposed to get from them. Class is almost entirely digression. Horribly unstructured.,0
final exam worth 50% of your grade. Was rude to students who asked questions.,0
"there are 3 ""tests"" which are long essays. hint: If you write over 20 pages for a test, you will probably get an A for the test. he always lets us out early, and only keeps you for an hour. our discussions are interesting and he is really funny. I would take him again!",1
"Joanna is amazing! She makes learning Hebrew a fun activity, not a chore and gives lots of helpful hints and explanations to remember spelling and grammar. You need to practice outside of class but it's not overwhelming amounts of work and class is always fun with videos and tangents about her daughter!",1
"The man is all over the place!  I've had instructors before that you can tell they feel it's beneath them to be forced to teach at a community college level.  I get that vibe from him.  Condescending.  His quizzes are easy if you listen to 10% of what he says.  The rest of it is just talking to hear himself talk, I think.",0
"Took advanced nutrition with this professor.  He teaches the first and last third of the class.  You should attend class because there are some mistakes in his packet, otherwise, his packet is pretty much what all his lectures are about.  He tests on the lectures, so make sure to attend so you're not studying extra material.  Very easy!!!",1
Burke is great!  He is always willing to help you if you need it.  If you do the work you will go good. ,1
"Funny guy who gives laid back lectures. Great teacher. Class is homework heavy like any math class, but he gives out group quizzes and likes to pad your grade as much as possible. Very dependable and will help you at any stage.",1
"There are four tests, of which he will drop one. The class of 70 students averaged 61% on the final three tests. The professor is loud, and sometimes inappropriate. While it is apparent he knows the material well, he does a poor job conveying that knowledge to his students. An obstacle to overcome, not an introduction to the subject. Avoid!",0
"I have heard good things about this professor before I took this class. He is an awesome person, but this class needs another professor to teach it! Avoid him at all costs for MIS 300. His lectures (which are fun and interesting and very much off topic) on powerpoint DO NOT MATCH what he tests on. Study the text, have a friend sign you in. Easy A!",0
"He's a typical overworked PhD student who doesn't want to teach. He often rushes through slides and responds rudely to questions. He won't take late hw though he doesn't grade it for weeks, and he will make your life hard if your project doesn't interest him personally. His pop quizzes are easy & open note.",0
By far the best professor in the ICS department. I feel like this class really teaches you a lot. There's a major curve at the end and it's fairly easy to do well as long as you score well on the projects.,1
This class was more like a honors level course. The class was completely unbearable and it didn't help that the professor was extremely not helpful. She had no idea what she was talking about. She assigns way to much hw. Way too many papers are handed out. And journals for a math class!?,0
"Midterm was horrible. Average was 60%. A few questions were not even discussed in the book or in the slides! so pay attention to what she speaks of. Quizzes are straight forward and class project is easy. The final was much better than the midterm, it focused mostly on topics after midterm.",0
She thinks her students are idiots and thus acts idiotic.,0
I had him a year ago for the Holocaust class. I loved him!! Super cool and easy going. Very Laid back and loved coming to class!! Take him if you can!!,1
I took Alisa for math 108 and from the very beginning found her very hard to stay interested.  She was very monitone.  She also rarely worked problems on the board unless asked.  I went from 2 prior classes with an A to having to withdraw from her class.  I would NEVER recommend her to anyone.  She is super nice though but that's all I can say.,0
"I took Prof. Mihill for ASCI 490. (Capstone) This class was extremely difficult, however, Prof. Mihill is such an amazing teacher.  He was extremely helpful and patient and replied to my questions within a day, because communication is imperative while taking this class. I can't say enough good things andwould absolutely take this Professor again.",1
Emari is honestly the best professor at Stockton. She is an amazing professor as well as just an inspirational person. She gives to much to not only her students but the community as well. She will take people on the waiting list if there is enough physical space in the classroom.,1
"Overall, I have enjoyed this class. Lee is very knowledgeable on the content area, and he seems genuinely interested in student learning. I feel I learned a lot from this course.",1
"Would never recommend, professor is really unclear in wording on quiz questions, impossible to get full points on anything. She does not seem to want her students to succeed. Unstructured class.",0
Lizzie Brock is one of the best English teachers I've ever had. She is very caring and understanding and makes sure you are working to the best of your ability. She also gives one on one time for those who need it. She really want you to learn the material and pass.,1
Sociology what? Is there such a science? Don't know cause I didnt learn anything.,0
"Workman is a predictable teacher. Will confuse you toward the beginning of the semester, but once you warm up to his teaching style, you will understand that he is a lovable guy. He cares about your knowledge of the field of psychology and is a pretty easy grader. He takes attendance every class, so show up to class if you don't want to lose points",1
"Too easy. If you are someone who is wanting to improve on grammar andor their writing skills, do not take him. He plays too many movies in classes, which I find to be a waste of my money I am putting towards the class to earn the credit. He could be rude at times to some. I would not recommend him.",0
"Andrea Milburn is by far the best professor at SDCC! She is so enthusiastic, down to earth, inspirational, and always pushes you to be your absolute best. If you are ever going through a hard time or just need someone to talk to, Andi is always there and has great feedback for anyone too! Highly recommend this professor as she goes far and beyond!",1
"TAKE THIS PROF!! He is so chill, but really wants you to succeed. Attendance is not mandatory but you'll wanna go because this man is hysterical. He is an easy grader, so if you do the work you'll get an A. Overall great class, and great prof, one of my favorite at UCF.",1
"I took this class online and loved it! Mr. Neely is wonderfully passionate and knowledgeable about the subject, which makes it even more fun to learn. I found the tests challenging but the coursework rewarding.  He also provides well laid out lectures, extra credit, and truely wants his students to  succeed, that's an A+ plus in my books.",1
"Professor Westover is one of the best instructors I've ever had! He gives great and immediate feedback. Is respectful, willing to work with you and very knowledgeable. Weekly assignments. As long as you read all of the information, you will do great. All open book, open notes. Gives ample time to complete research paper! Would take him again!",1
He is absolutely AMAZING! A complete riot and wonderful professor. Class is NEVER boring and something new is taught daily. Online homework is a breeze and tests aren't horrible. Studying is necessary for them though.,1
Pilla is such a nice guy. Walks you through every step of the math problem and goes at a very good pace for those not strong in math,1
"only 4 reports!!no tests, no study  love her the easiest profesor in browad college. 4 reports on your opinion!take her you will get a easy ""A""-THIS IS THE TRUTH.",1
"Professor Boris seems like he is passionate and knowledgable about Philosophy, but I did find it hard to grasp what he was trying to come across most of the time. I also couldn't focus too much because I was constantly writing notes and trying to transcribe all the ideas he would constantly throw around.",0
It's a hard class because there is a language barrier but if you want it she will sit with you for however long you want. She also very much wants to share the culture and knowledge with you.,1
This class is very very challenging. I would NOT RECOMMEND it unless you are a music major or enthusiast with some prior knowledge of music theory or art history because those themes are much more relevant than the appreciation portion. Professor Neely is very knowledgeable and passionate and offers extra credit which saved me.,0
"I had a lot of trouble getting him to answer my emails about my grades being incorrect more than once. He was friendly in person to talk to, but never got him to answer my emails till the very end of the semester. You should be fine on tests if you take good notes, but were only short answers. Assignments were decently easy for the most part.",1
Arrogant ***!,0
"Professor Arranz is great. He is very passionate about what he teaches, he also talks about the Basque Country which sounds amazing. Please participate in the discussions in class or it will get awkward. He is very easy going and respectful. He wants the best for his students. Put in the work, participate and you will get a good grade.",1
"Professor Waller is a fantastic professor!!  She is helpful and fun and wants you to get it.  I loved having her be the constant professor during my 2 years while class professors changed every 8-16 weeks.  Looking back, I'd say she was one of my favorite and most encouraging professors in the whole program!  Thanks Professor Waller!",1
Awesome teacher. Very funny and actually helps you understand what you are learning. Would recommend to anyone taking a&p 1. Quizs every week and 4 exams with 3 practicals. As long as you study your notes you will pass. ,1
Worst professor for this class. Love the class material but she assigned way too much work for a gen ed class. Not to mention she basically completely ignored her students when classes became online.,0
"Prof. Kumari had one of the most enjoyable online classes I have ever taken! Her expectations are clear, each Module structure is easy to follow and understand, and she provides personalized feedback. The course itself is tough, but Prof. Kumari offers generous extra credit, and no proctored exams for this class. Would definitely take again!",1
"Tough class, but she was always available to help me. If you are willing to put in the effort, you can really get a lot from her.",1
"Hands down the best professor I have ever had during my experience as a college student. You will definitely leave this class a better writer. He teaches extraordinary writing techniques and has uplifting feedback for any student that raises their hand in class. Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend!",1
"Every poor review you read about Dr. Kovach is true and I cannot stress enough that no one is exaggerating. His labs were unclear as he didn't give thorough explanations. Remote learning in his class consisted of weekly ""quizzes"", which always had 38+ questions and we really only had the book to study from because his Powerpoints were so vague.",0
"Mi Sook was not a helpful teacher at all. I worked my butt off in this class and she did not even notice the dedication me and other students put into our work. Although she was nice at times and tried to help, she usually ended up messing up your project. Try not to get her for a teacher!",0
"help me. no one has any idea what is going on, he rushes through chapters and when they test comes no one knows what's going on. this class is a nightmare, he is also really boring, monotone and plain rude. don't do this to yourself.",0
"All my assignments got graded the day before grades were due, during a 3 month semester. Often very confusing in his lectures, but i took it pass/fail so it was easy if you just do the work.",0
"Marjan is great. The subject matter is difficult, but she makes it fun and easy to grasp. I am definitely taking all my science classes with her!",1
He is a really nice man.  Lovable old guy.  I had a really good experience in his class because he is so smart and helpful! Thank you Mr. O!!!!,1
You will do a majority of your work through MyLabMath with almost no communication with the teacher herself and when you do talk to her she is always aggressive and hardheaded. Your entire semester grade is essentially just the two exams and that's it since she weighs their grade so heavily.,0
"Very good guy but it's difficult since CMPE-160 is just by nature a tough class. He really cares about his students doing well, and clearly knows what he is talking about. Very tough grader though, seemingly minor things will noticeably cost you on quizzes and tests (i.e. not labeling the select pins on a multiplexer). Great professor overall.",1
"Bigler is a bit intimidating but only in the best way possible. She wants her students to acknowledge their ability to learn and to apply themselves in their own ways. She doesn't do a lot of hand holding, you have to figure out a lot for your own. It was a challenging, yet beneficial course. I'd recommend her to anyone who enjoys challenges!",1
He is amazing,1
save your gpa and don't take her class. trust me,0
"Dr. Parker was always available to read through our drafts, gave consistent feedback, and was not terribly difficult to please (all you have to do is follow the directions and ask questions).",1
He uses his own material that is easily accessible. Exams are open-book but it really won't help because the problems can be really confusing at times.  Key to success- keep your head  and follow your instinct,1
"Dr. E tries to scare everyone the first year of Chem E classes.  If you like it, stick with it.  Rants about impossible tests and quizzes - they can be hard, but arent mainly.  Make sure to understand how to use excel.  GO TO CLASS, the final was optional if you didnt miss any grades or had an A.  Lots will drop, dont be afraid.",0
"Sigh, so over this class. Her teaching method is hard to follow. She gets off of subject more than once each class period. You basically have to teach yourself. Be prepared to work if you take her class.",0
"I had to take two classes with this teacher. The first semester all he gave us were two reading assignments with papers, providing little to help your grade if done poorly on them. Also his comments on papers are confusing and not helpful. With this teacher, be prepared to use sources such as smartthinking to help you and to work hard without help.",0
"Answers questions quickly, very nice and allowed deep dive into work. Will definitely be looking for this professor again.",1
"Always ends class early, very easy lectures, extra credit is offered, and she allows you to have a notecard on exams. There are several homework and in class assignments but they take no more than twenty minutes to finish and are always explained well. Gives ""study days"" where she cancels class so you can ""study"" which is cool. Great Prof.",1
amazing!! best teacher ever!!,1
"I spent a lot of time navigating broken technology. I emailed the professor about issues (the website being down, the links being broken, not having access to the library database). She did eventually respond to my emails but my grade still took a hit for things that weren't my fault. Very frustrating class at times. May be better in person.",1
In her SOCW 315 class you better be prepared. Her paper is the hardest paper I have ever had to write. Do not slack or wait till last minute to do this paper because you will not get a good grade on the paper. The simulation clients was the best part of the class. Other than that their are quizzes everyday at the start of class.,1
hes good,1
"I love McMillen he is a fantastic choice for Marketng. You will not regret it! He knows what he's talking about, and makes class fun and engaging.",1
"You enter this class thinking that you will feel better about your efforts, when in contrast you leave feeling like a idiot. He makes it out that you will succeed, but makes it near impossible to get a decent grade. VERY monotone, so I warn you DO NOT TAKE HIM",1
Marvin is certainly the worst professor i have ever had! do not take his classes they are terrible and he is a aweful teacher. i have never rated a professor before but he is just to awful to not.,0
She is an awesome teacher who gives great lectures and keeps you engaged the entire time during class. I took her over J Term and despite three hour class sessions she kept us entertained and learning. Great professor!,1
"Pros: Let us pick between a group project or a term paper Cons: Has no charisma and was the only class I've ever taken where I looked at the clock every 10 minutes, only read from textbook, took attendance marks, often got sidetracked during lectures I wouldn't take again, that's how boring this class was. Marks fairly so just study the text 2pass.",0
Really good teacher took him 2 times. He tries to help you pass. As long as you put effort youll pass. Would definitely recommend,1
"She's a nice and kind woman, but she's very stubborn and not really willing to see other views. If you write exactly what she wants you to (meaning, agreeing with her opinion) you'll do pretty well, but if you try to challenge any of her views, expect to get hit hard. Very unclear grading criterion.",0
"Professor Mantell got very sidetracked. By the third week, our class was behind 2 lectures. She is very sweet, but she gives too much information that is not needed for the course. My fiancee is a bio major and helped me throughout the course and she even said she was not a good professor. The ""mean"" for our exam grades averaged out around a D.",0
i never thought i could write before i took this class.  i got all A's and i had a great time in class.  ms. trapp would joke around with us but she taught us so much.  i would definitely take another class with her. i never had a teacher that cared so much.,1
Was super nice however used apps that didn't always work. She was willing to work with you but it did not always help. The homework does take tons of time so be ready to spend a few days doing it. she doesn't have a set criteria when it comes to the notebook that she makes you write in.,0
"Accounting is truly the hardest course in college.  I literally passed 1 test bombed the other and never got two back.  By Professor Sullivan making the class so hard the weekend of the final I busted my ass and read the book over and finished the class wit a passing grade better than my expected D.  Not as bad as peep make him out to be, but read!",0
"I really liked this prof and thought the weekly MC questions were good in helping me study and not put off reading until the last min. She pulled a lot of stuff from news, recent events and apply them to lectures. Good info and relevant. We aren't the most talkative class, but she tries. Super enthusiastic.",1
"I had Mazamit for Cultures & Contexts: Modern Israel. The material of the class was interesting, but I have to say Mazalit made the experience during this class beyond miserable for various I found her to be extremely difficult to follow up with during office hours . Her grading was confusing and shes rude when confronted about a grade.",0
"Real personable teacher. Easy to have conversations with the class. Heavy course load, but fairly easy.",1
"She is truly invested in making he students succeed! I highly recommend her. She's kind, intelligent, and will help you when you need help! She uses power points that are helpful! She makes Chemistry fun! I enjoyed Chem 130 with her and plan on taking Chem 151 with her!",1
This class was horrible. She grades on however she wants and doesn't give back any comments. Her scantron tests are not even covered in the book.,0
"Mr. Odien is a very good professor with a distinct drive and passion for what he does. His well-presented lectures are important to your success in the class and his personality makes everything interesting. He is always available to help, even during tests. That being, if you're looking for an easy class or dislike geology, I wouldn't take him.",1
"This class wasn't too bad, I've definitely taken harder. She is really nice and tries to make class fun sometimes by bringing performers to tie the music with lecture. There is one paper, 3 quizzes, and a final. She doesn't post slides. Don't buy the book, just study your notes and listen to the music examples on YouTube carefully.",1
"Class consists of 5 discussion boards, 4 quizzes, midterm, and the final exam. There are 3 agency reports you have to get done by the end of the semester.",1
"The homework wasn't ever too hard and he went over it the following class and allows for questions whenever. The homework didn't count for anything, so make sure you do well on your tests. He always gives a bonus question or two at the end of his tests.",1
Evan is a great professor! He makes lectures easy to follow and tells you what to focus on for the quizzes. Take this class if you need it for your major or just to take a good class! 10/10 would recommend.,1
"Professor Bacaner is one of my favorites that Ive ever had. His class really taught me how to suck the fat off the top of my prosperity. Also, I really enjoy his lectures about how to achieve a beautiful harmonious balance in ourselves and in society. Overall, I believe there is not a word in the English language to describe Bacaners teaching.",1
"Rambles on and doesn't make sure her students fully understand the material. Never know what's going on  the class and the notes do not help me. No personality and class is overall extremely boring. I use to love history and wanted to major in it. After taking this history class with Professor Piel, she has completely changed my mind about history.",0
Horrible professor. Dont take him. Very disrespectful and rude to students for no reason. Grades too hard and assigns difficult work.,0
I am so glad that I took Professor Dattolo for Spanish! His lectures were amazing and very clear to understand and his kindness towards his students was always evident. If you take Spanish Professor Dattolo goes highly recommended.,1
"Makes you buy a $90 access code just to access the homework which is 100 questions PER CHAPTER and you have 2-3 chapters due at a time. Crazy tedious work, each chapter takes about 2 hours to complete. STAY AWAY. Find someone easier.",0
3 Exams: are extremely difficult. No notes on the exams. There is a Term paper or book review you have to do. Final exam is accumulative,0
"He teaches in Avery unique way, make sure to be attentive. Classes are fun and entertaining rather than being boring and dull lectures.  Easy course. Very conceptual, no memorization. Useful.",1
"Mr. Tyson is not a very good Political Science teacher. He is not very helpful and will not communicate clearly with his students. His lectures are EXTREMELY boring and there is little chance to get your grade up in this class. I think there are 4 tests including the final, and a few quizzes. DO NOT. DO NOT take him. You can do so much better",0
Dr. Wike is a great Professor.,1
"This teacher is amazing, he is clear and wants you to learn. I am very happy that i recieved him as my psych profesor because a lot of the other students at IUK complain about their psychology professor being complicated and hard, and i can honestly say mine isn't. You still must do the work, but if you pay attention and do the CPAs then an A is just around the corner.",1
"The guy hasn't given an A on an essay this semester.  Makes you turn in a rough draft then tears all your ideas apart.  No chance to get anything higher than a 3.3.  Anyone who says ""A B is a good grade"" in his syllabus is not a teacher to take.",0
He was an wonderful! He was always free to help and you will  be grateful that you took the time to get help!,1
"With the transition to online classes, he has been working very hard to make everything very organized and if he makes a mistake he is not afraid to give back points. He is a decent lecturer and provides quizzes with each online lecture to make sure you are on track. Class average is curved to a B which is fair considering the exam averages are low",1
I took an online class with Scott and found him incredibly difficult to work with. There were no consistent due dates for the assignments and when interacting with him through email and forum posts I found him to be snide and condescending.,0
Great easy online course! Mrs. Robertson makes the discussions interesting and easy! Just do all your work on time and you'll get an A!,1
"I wish I didn't take the advice from people leaving reviews here. I do not care how good you think you are at math this guy was a rude awakening for me. It wasn't until I started skipping class and teaching it to myself did I improve. Marks you down for doing math problems ""in a way that is confusing"" to him even if you get the right answer. Run.",0
Awesome. Nothing else needs to be said...,1
Hands down the WORST professor Ibe ever taken at DSC. Very unfortunate he is the only professor teaching physics or else I would advise to avoid Dr. Tulsian at all costs. Hard to understand him through his mumbling and rarely explains what he is doing in his class work problems. Extremely rude and condescending. F-,0
"Class is interesting, and tests are easy if you study your notes and read the recommended textbook.",1
"Difficult, unhelpful, unresponsive to questions, designed to make you struggle and fail.",0
"She wasnt ever direct in what she wanted and Was a very harsh grader. She was very scatterbrained all of the time, would not take this class ever again. Literally avoiding taking her class this upcoming semester.",0
"This course was very intense but is easy to pass if you dedicate a lot of time to the weekly assignments. The weekly assignments tended to be very time consuming, though.",0
Make sure you study for the Exams the homework and chapter reviews are easy but you have to work to understand key elements for the exams. The work is spread out pretty evenly so you don't feel overwhelmed. The professor is somewhat responsive to questions but I didn't have many.,1
I am a criminology major so this course was very important for me. Our first test was supposed to be over 3 chapters and was only over 1 because she got so off topic while lecturing. She is not very organized and poor at communicating with students (especially during finals week). I have never been this unhappy with a teacher.,0
"The teacher in my opinion was a little hard to understand. This course was mostly about literature and research based which I struggled with. I put my all into all my papers and got C's in all of them even though i put everything in it that he required. He is big into ""Big"" word which I'm not the greatest at. There is no make up work!",1
She is a very tough teacher. You can learn a lot if you dedicate the time to her courses. She expects you to come prepared to class. If you aren't she will scold you. Find another teacher for this class if possible.,0
"great class, and a great teacher, just got screwed over by the TA's because they lost my homework and extra credit ending me up with a B+ and teacher didnt do anything about it",1
best computer teacher ever!,1
"Hey knows his stuff.  He tends to teach a little fast, but will go back and explain if you don't understand.  Really nice guy and easy to talk to if confused.  Only 12 quizzes and 4 tests.  Must study for tests!!!!  Very important that you go to class, he goes over everything that you need to know!",1
"The level of difficulty should be 1 but this professor has impossible expectations. I received a 100 on every module, but debatable discussions etc. that are graded by her were given a 70. I followed the rubric step by step to ensure points were not deducted. Either she didn't agree/like my viewpoint or she just didn't actually read it.",0
Dr. Sauser's class consists solely of taking notes. Some may find this to be a bad class but I like it. Yeah it gets old taking so many notes but I'd rather write out all of the information that may be on her tests than to have to try and figure it out for myself. Her tests are still difficult but that is only because of the amount of information.,1
"This class is a joke. I received a C in this class, which I will take the blame for, I didn't work as hard as I should've. That being said, I am a 3.87 cumulative student, and this was the hardest class I've ever taken. The review sessions do not adequately cover the material on the exam at all. This is supposed to be a Intro class, its not. MCAT.",0
Brilliant and very supportive professor.,1
"This is the worst class in the history of the world. The professor is horrible, antipathetic, and has a ego problem. I had never disliked a class so much until I took this one. The course is completely irrelevant and useless if you're not going into research or Ph.D. This class shouldn't be required.",0
"Susan is pretty good. My problem is that she has no problem publicly calling students out when they do something wrong which does not foster a good learning environment. She needs to be better about responding to emails & getting off task. Overall, she's okay. If you like spastic, energetic teachers take her. She does chose favorites though.",1
"The only way you will pass is SI, practice problems, and learning on your own. Lectures are useless. Anything above 1 star is just a person relieved that they passed, which was likely not due to Ahmad. Dont forget that.",0
No.,0
"My favorite teacher this semester. He is very relatable, doesn't treat you like a child. He is always available for extra help. I did not feel like the textbook was essential. Expect pop quizzes but they're easy. ",1
She clearly cares about her students but unfortunately does not meet the mark as a professor. She assigns readings and documentaries that are very long and complicated and blatantly boring. She puts thought into her lectures but unfortunately does not capture interest. She is also very set in her opinion and does not make room for other ones.,0
Dr. Ryan Hunt was amazing as always.  This semester more so - my dad had a stroke mid-semester and ultimately passed away.  Dr. Hunt was so kind in allowing me time to get work completed.  The night I came for an exam he told me I didn't have to take the exam that night I could have another week or more whatever I needed to study.  I took the exam ,1
"I loved Crawley both times I had him, for physiological psych and for psychological apps of stats. Tests are tough and there was a quiz every class for physio, but that was only to help us stay on track and ensure we were reading our books. You can tell he knows what he's doing and he loves it. He's always gone out of his way to help when needed!",1
Hes ana amzing professor. Keeps the class usper interesting and knows exactly what he is talking about. He keeps it very real. Hes very good!!,1
Amazing! I had him for an 8 am and he was amazing! His lessons were very clear and he made history fun.,1
"Professors Burnier often goes on long tangents unrelated to the course material. Sometimes it's interesting, but most times it feels like a waste of class time. I occasionally feel like I'm in a history class instead of an English class.",1
"This course gave me a better understanding of how government operates. I looked forward to coming to class each week because Professor Reece made a class that most may find boring, very entertaining and interesting.",1
"Jimmerson goes by the teaching philosophy that all students are empty cups, and she is an overflowing teapot of knowledge. In other words, she is condescending. She is small-minded; if you don't fit into her definition of what makes a person intellectual, she will treat you as if you're inferior to her. If you're not good enough for her, good luck!",0
She has no consideration for her students. Many students asked her if she could possibly make changes to the work load due to Coronavirus. She told them in the 8 years she's taught this class no one struggle with the course load. She failed to acknowledge that none of her other classes took place during a global pandemic.,0
"Pros- She gives great feedback.  If you've hit a roadblock, she's there for help. The final is extra credit worth 50 points. Cons- Get ready to basically live in the writing center if you aren't a strong writer, and if you're looking to get a good grade in her class. Can be a little confusing at times. Very strict grader.   ",0
"While Sam is a nice guy and pretty funny sometimes, I really didn't like this class/his lecturing style. Don't take this class if you don't like Linguistics, and especially don't take it if you learn better with visual aids because there were no powerpoints at all! Overall, don't take this class if it's just for your distribution",0
"Jayne has a great knowledge base when it comes to nursing. If you have her for lecture, you will have no problem. If you have her for clinical, however, she is very intimdating, belittling, and angry. Many students have literally felt emotionally traumatized after having her. She will make you feel like you are incompetent and worthless.",1
"Overall he was ok. PowerPoints and notes were sometimes missing or disorganized. Goes over class time, 4 test most are over 100 questions multiple choice and short answers, the last test is considered your final which is not cumulative. 3 papers which take him a while to grade, but they are not hard just time consuming.",1
She uses inappropriate examples in class and tries to push her political beliefs on students while teaching totally unrelated topics. This is very distracting and unprofessional.,0
"I have never rated any professor before but because this class was SO bad and because he was the most boring teacher I have ever had, I want to warn anyone who thinks about taking this class or this teacher in general...DON'T DO IT.",0
Do not take this professor. She is extremely rude and inconsiderate. I went through horrible family problems and she was not willing to accommodate for me. This professor really made my mental health worse. All I learned from this course was that she needs to be more compassionate...,0
"Never replies to emails, never clear about assignments, never clear with tests, terrible lecturer",0
"Trig was tough. Trig has a lot of content anyways but she expects you to recall college algebra as if it were yesterday. Be prepared for fast paced class sessions and also raw feedback. Great teacher overall, I feel like she is somewhat misunderstood. If you want to be held accountable for work, this is you gal.",1
"I would like to see this professor care more about teaching the students about the material rather then grade acomputer generated test. Seems he doesn't want students to be lazy with his course, but yet his leading example is just that, unless you ask for help you will fail, unless you know the material at his level the tests are impossible to pass",0
"What's better than a funny English lady? A funny English lady that can teach! Great Professor and ALWAYS there for her students!!! Take her, easy A! Work hard and write well and you will not regret it!",1
"It's not clear what he wants. His expectation in the syllabus is that you write something ground breaking to get an A, but stray too far from the ideas he gives you in class, you lose marks. He says that he wants us to explore ideas and find meaning, but you lose marks if you try. For someone who teaches English, he's not good at communicating.",0
Fantastic instructor and extremely accessible outside of class. The class is great and division of points is all very logical and fair.,1
"Decent professor if you're into writing. For those soley fulfilling the requirement, this will not be fun at all. Lots of reading, quizzes and tedious assignments.",1
good prof. very clear instruction.,1
Awful professor for this class... Lecture slides suck!! 2 papers 1 project one midterm and final.... For 101 class... It's not worth it,0
"Great teacher. Relaxed, approachable, knowledgeable and easy on the eye :o",1
Definetly not reccommended. Very vague in what he wants and rarely offers any valuable input for improvement. How you do well in his class is beyond me. Not all approachable and very rarely interesting. Would avoid at all costs,0
Does not let you make up missed homework everything online and she doesnt clearly go over everything such as tenses,0
Brutal,0
"There is so much reading. The worst part is for the test, she gave us 54 terms for us to define and only 10/12 will be on the actual test and out of those 10/12, we only have to do 5/6. Lectures are alright but they do not redeem for how much reading there is or how she handles the test study guide.",0
Toughest grader I have ever come across.,0
"This class is fairly easy; he just goes through some PowerPoints and you take a quiz after. The big assignment is having to write a 9 page essay about your life, but it's not difficult, since it's about yourself. He was sweet and funny, and I'd recommend him if you want to pass psychology easy.",1
Would NOT recommend taking her classes. Lectures are all off slides and she does a very poor job of teaching an intro CS course. Will take off many points on homework assignments even when the code runs correctly just because its not written exactly the way she wants it. Dont take her if there is another professor teaching the same class.,0
"I have never been very good in mathematics, so when I entered this class I was very uneasy. But, Professor WIldman made this class easy to understand and was extremely helpful. All you have to do is ask and he will bend over backwards to help you.",1
Amazing teacher. Would 100% recommend him as a teacher and this class. Very into what he teaches which make the class fun.,1
"Professor Rao is always open for students to talk to and makes the course material extremely accessible. Her class is lecture-heavy, but the lectures only sum up to 2 hours of lectures per week; it is extremely manageable. The only hard part of the course is the homework, where she doesn't prepare you for the math sections very well.",1
"This is literally the hardest class I have ever taken in my life (seriously beware), but Paul Young is such a fantastic person and professor. He cares so deeply about his students and is so accommodating. GO TO HIS OFFICE HOURS! He will sit with you and work through every issue you have with papers/tests/concepts for hours. Take a class with him.",1
"He has no clear grading criteria, his methods of grading and teaching are all over the place. His PPT slides are 100 each and he jumps around and skips slides, which makes it really frustrating. He only scribbles stuff on the chalkboard when he tries to further explain a concept but still doesn't make any sense. Exams are unfairly difficult.",0
"Having taken a course with Professor Lopez before, he is still very interested in challenging one's creativity when investigating Renaissance Drama. His lectures are fine, though the content can be a bit much to take in at times. I definitely recommend taking any courses you can with Professor Lopez.",1
"I generally found Professor Wolverton's class to be enjoyable, but nothing that blew me away. I believe that she is a very good teacher, but her lecture style personally did not suit me. She lectures almost exclusively on the chalkboard, which can seem unorganized and scattered at times. She's also a tough grader, although not unfair.",1
"Worst teacher, why am I even calling him a teacher. EVERYONE failed EVERY test, highest test avg for class was a 52, with a 20 point curve. ",0
"I love Matthew to death, don't get me wrong, but this class in the way he taught it for ME personally was unbearable. Discussion's are pretty uncomfortable at times due to topics discussed in class (Race, Gender, LGBTQ, Women's Rights, etc.) , and is usually very one sided. However if you can sit through class and tune this out, its super easy.",1
"Listen-DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH ALINA. She is inconsistent. This professor will say one thing (especially at her office hours) and do just the opposite.  She will say attendance is NOT mandatory, but then publicly embarrass you.  DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH HER. you will REGRET it!!!! If you can avoid this class, take it with another professor.",0
"DO NOT RECOMMEND. She is an extremely tough grader. And is very nit-picky w/answers. Her powerpoints for the lectures are very confusing and didn't have a good flow throughout, they were very hard to follow and study. she gives quizzes every Thursday (worth 15 pt). she made us buy a mobile chem app (used only 12-15 times) and a HW website. AVOID.",0
"First off, dont expect your emails to get a response. He and the TAs dont respond at all. This class is an easy A but don't expect to learn anything.",0
"I HAD HER FOR MY HYBRID CLASS, AND SHE IS EXTREMELY HELPFUL, I HATE MATH WITH A PASSION, AND IM REALLY BAD AT IT, BUT I WAS SURPRISED WHEN I WAS ACTUALLY LEARNING FROM MRS.MERRILL, SHE WILL EXPLAIN WITH ""APPLES"" LITERALLY SO YOU LEARN.. SHE IS A GREAT TEACHER AND VERY HELPFUL !!",1
"A lot of the class is filled with banter, which can sometimes get repetitive. Throughout the class he'll bring up things he's heard in the news recently, and asks the class what they think about it. It can be awkward with a lot of silence, but as the semester progresses students learn to indulge him. Also, he's difficult to reach through email.",0
"She moves fast in lecture and lectures almost directly from the book. I ended up teaching myself more from the textbook, but that's pretty terrible too. Lots of homework and tests are unpredictable (no practice exams)! If you take this class, be sure to be in a study group from the beginning. You're gonna need it.",0
"Professor Redding is the reason I decided to major in sociology. This class gives a broad view of a lot of subtopics within sociology. You'll definitely learn something you never knew before that will come in handy. The lectures are beyond interesting. You have readings with quizzes, participation, three reflective essays and some exams. LOVED it.",1
"The professor is kind, and that is it. She teaches an interesting subject, but she is a very boring teacher. She didnt live up to her make up policy. Also, I already study psychology on my own time and soon realized she was halfway teaching information. Do not take this professor if you want to truly learn psychology.",0
This class is super easy. Open book tests and pretty much no homework besides reading. He can get kind of boring once in a while but he's a alright teacher.,1
"Mr. Spence was not a very good online professor. He never assigned any due dates unless a student emailed him. Even then you never knew what work you were supposed to complete because the due dates would take you to a blank page. Also, he would assign the quiz in the late afternoon, and he would have it due by that night. Overall unprofessional.",0
"Dr. Mark was an interesting professor but she cares about her students. Class was so easy. She gives a review for each test/final that help A LOT! I ended up with a 99 in the class because she has so many participation grades, quiz grades (rly easy), yellowdig grades, and then the group deliverables (not hard but takes long). Lots of extra credit!",1
"I took Prof Steiner for Intermediate Algebra to prep for College Algebra and this class was a breeze. She really takes her time to fully explain everything and make sure that every student understands. If you struggle with math, I highly recommend her. There is a fair amount of work, but it's easy to understand. The study guides prep you for tests.",1
Honestly a good guy that you can talk to. Unfortunately his lectures are extremely hard to follow and are super theoretical. A lot of over complication on simple topics. Self-studying is required to pass. Don't take unless you are super into theoretical math or confident about self-studying a lot.,0
"I've never had class with KC, but she is in choir with me and she is so awesome. She is so nice and friendly",1
"This class is horribly boring, it is impossible to follow the lecture becuse she is jumping all over the place and very unclear. Attendence is graded so you have to come to class. Tests are easy though, but this was literally the worst class I have ever taken at UMass.",0
Get rid of the sentence patterns. Errr. Tries his best to help but doesn't always help that much. He lost me very easily and I felt confused 90% of the time.,0
He is amazing and wonderful  i wont be tired getting his classes..............                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ,1
"I thought Ms. Kelly was a great teacher judging from the reviews on here, and even from some earlier experiences with her. I am now writing this review to warn you all to be careful of her. She's a complete ghost after I've sent her a couple emails and even forwarded one for a follow up. Never heard back. I have now dropped her class.",0
Amazing instructor. Loved the course.,1
"I have a 4:30-7:10 class, about 5:30 every wednesday she has a guest come in and talk. This is soooo boring for some, and for others interesting. Nuneville, will teach you the lecture for about 45minutes - 1 hour and after that her guest speakers come in and talk for the rest of class.",1
"This man loves science too much for his own good. He will spend an entire class period going over something that he loves but will not be tested on, yet will only briefly mention something that makes up 25% of the test. Be prepared to study every small bit of the chapter as he grills you on the smallest details of the readings and lectures.",0
"He is very well informed and is always talking about current events. This man is woke!! There is like 8 one and half pages essay you write every other week, a midterm, group project, book report, and final. As long as you listen to his lectures its a pretty easy class. 10/10 recommend!",1
Absolutely terrible and incredibly condescending. Refuses to meet outside of class and makes fun of you when you dont understand,0
Great at explaining material and giving extra credit. Likes to bring in treats to hand out to students. Very nice and friendly.,1
He is a great lecturer and is passionate about his material.,1
"After being in class for 5 months, I still have not received a single grade on anything. I am doubtful he even reads the papers he assigns. He promises to send feedback and grades but NEVER actually does it. He pushes his due dates a lot because he doesn't post his assignments on time. SO ANNOYING!",0
"By far the worst professor I ever had. HE is not organized, rude when a question is asked, hard tests.. you won't learn in his class, there are many other great professor teaching this course,",0
"Long lectures, went over basic math problems related to the chapter we were currently on however on the test the questions were exponentially harder. At the end of the year she promised my class that we could make up any missed work for full credit so I spent my time completing everything then saw she failed me and didnt put in the make up work.",0
"The teacher is very knowledgeable about the subject. She has a passion for writing and for teaching writing. She always makes office hours available. She gives a lot of work, but you learn a lot.",1
"Ezell is awesome! He allows 6 unexcused absences per semester which is definitely doable, but he does give pop quizzes to ensure attendance stays up. The quizzes are straight from class work and the tests are straight from the quizzes! Super easy to get an A in if you keep up with your quizzes and review them before each test!!",1
"The study guides are basically the tests. You must go to class to get majority of the answers to the study guides. There are 5 exams. There are 2 papers. That is it. There are no guidelines to the papers, which makes it hard to write and she destroys the papers. If you like women in history, take her!",0
"I did take his class his class online during the whole COVID19 situation. Despite that, it wasn't enjoyable at all. He's hard to understand in both speaking and writing. Don't expect him to respond to emails at all. Makes too many mistakes in class. Tests are way too hard with little time to finish. You're better off looking for someone else.",0
"Do not take a class with her. She made me hate math. She does not teach and expects you to teach yourself. She is a real stickler with grading, does not matter if you get the answer right if you don't show enough work. There really is no need to make a student's life miserable. Her notes are not useful and gives a lot of homework. She is baddddd.",0
"Boyer's cool and his Cisc 101 class is extremely easy. Its just that he's a total bum. Oh and if you need to email him about something, don't bother! He won't respond back. He's virtually useless. And it's weird that a man who teaches CISC has to stare at the keyboard and types only with his pointer fingers",0
"One of my favorite professors here at ETSU. Very few grades, only 3 tests plus final and homework, but they are very fair. He gives out sample tests before every test, which are very similar to the actual tests. Just know how to do those, do the homework, and you will end up with an easy A. Highly recommend, especially for a subject most people find difficult!",1
"Dr. Beckman is a very knowledgeable and intelligent professor, his classes are very interesting and usually not too difficult if you pay attention in class. You will probably do a few projects in his class, but he doesn't give too much homework and is a very fair grader.",1
"First of all, she knows her stuff and she is quite enthusiastic about it. She encourages participation and cares about the students. On the down side, however, she grades way too hard and she takes too long to get back to you with comments and help. When she does get back to you though, her feedback is excellent.",1
"I thoroughly enjoyed all the material and Sondra's posts online, however, I strongly recommend NOT taking this during winter quarter like I did. She assigns a LOT! of reading and videos to watch. The workload would be manageable during a normal semester but I was scrambling to finish on time every week during the winter quarter.",1
"If theres anyone that can take an easy concept and explain it in such a way that leaves you more confused than when you started, then this is your guy. He's smart but he's not a good teacher. This guy needs to go back to working for some company because HE CANT TEACH.",0
"I took English 2332 with him online which most people expect less work because they cannot go to class either working or no transportation.  He gave 3 assignments everyday which is alright, but his tests were confusing and too little time on the online test.  If you're not a reader do not take it with him.!",0
Expect to receive most of your learning experience by reading the book. I'm upset this teacher talked about everything but accounting for most of class. Homework given but randomly requested back for grading. No study guides for tests. Interested in busting people on cells or talking than more than teaching. Couldn't learn.,0
"Is huge on participation but doesn't have it organized at all. Make sure you just speak aloud like the rest of the people. Don't skip class it really hurts you, you will lose 5% each time and he has no mercy. Make sure to participate even though its really hard since he's really boring.",1
"Great professor, responded quickly to emails.  Tells a lot of jokes, but it keeps things interesting.",1
"I took her remote class in the pandemic and it was rough. She graded nothing of mine until after the semester was over and she assigned multiple 100-400 point essays that were not only graded late, but also harshly. I also drowned in weekly assignments. She was laid back on due dates, so much so that it only became damaging to everyone in the end.",0
"Lectures have attendance taken because you can't learn from anywhere else, and she makes it impossible to learn there. No notes, nothing. Just hope you heard what she said. Heavy and unfair grader, don't expect an even decent mark if she disagrees with your thesis. Also, lecture pop quizzes that spring up out of nowhere, somehow even in seminar.",0
"I've found a technique to deal with prof like these: JUST REMEMBER YOU ARE AT A STATE COLLEGE. Enough said? You get what you pay for, even if cheap college isn't necessarily cheap. It's clear when a prof doesn't know the material they are teaching, but what isn't clear is why they expect you to know it. Input is Output so TEACH YOURSELF in upperdiv",0
"Had him for intro to lit. He is a really cool guy. You go to his class, read soemthing, leave. It's really dumb if you fail his class because it is so easy. He's really helpful. I hate poetry, but he helped me understand it. Take this class!!!!!",1
"Econ20a will prepare you for this class, which is why I did so well comparatively. Midterm questions are vague. It asks one thing but she wants another answer that wasn't discussed in class. Question says ""Discuss"" a quote,but she doesnt mean proscons,she means is it truefalse. Students were very unprepared. Class did horribly on all tests.",1
"he's a very hoottttt professor. you will find him in his office 24/7. he covers the course material very precisely. he is cute for an old man. overall, he is a good professor as well as an advisor. I RECOMMEND HIM!",1
She doesn't accept any late credit and gave an essay on the first week of class. I can't stress how unforgiving she is when a student makes a mistake. I wanted to take this class so that I could learn something about English but instead I can't stop myself from being discouraged because I missed an essay and now can't make up for it. 2/10,0
Many of Dr. Hines' lectures build upon one another. Skipping class is not a good idea as you will fall behind on these lectures. Attendance is graded by REEF polling questions. Go to class and keep speed with the lectures and it's an easy A.,1
"What a horrible professor! Unorganized, ill-prepared, unfair & rude...I actually had to go to her boss about a grade b/c McClung can't figure out how to give a peer review assignment. Tried to give me a 0 b/c no one would send me a paper to review! Her boss sided with me. Grades VERY harshly & I have my doubts about if she even reads the papers!",0
"I registered for this class to be taken on campus but COVID hit and turned it into an online class. I was VERY nervous, but she is a great caring teacher. She provides all the tools needed to learn and actually grasp the work. I definitely recommend her!",1
"Good teacher and is passionate about what she teaches, but she forgets things easily, like makeup tests and quizzes so make sure to remind her of those things. Also make she to check your email right before class because that is when she will cancel class if need be.",1
"This class was very straightforward and easy. We had to purchase an online textbook that had the course system build in. We had a discussion every week based on the chapter we read in the book. We had a test every 4 chapters we read. Overall, the class was very easy and informational.",1
"Although he might know what he's talking about, the thing is when he rambles and goes too fast, it's extremely hard to follow!!! Also, his writing onthe board was so hard to read, I barely took notes. So, if there was another teacher to take, I would say take em'. But your SCREWED, cuz he's the only teacher!!! overall, I absolutly HATED this class!",0
"Lots of her ""stories"" were full of inaccurate facts. She is not the sharpest tool in the drawer...likes to talk about herself too much...boring.. teaches diversity class too, as if we need that info any more.  It's 2010 Ms. Rogers...we know their are other races, we just all want to be the same now...",0
"He is very strict on attendance. Clear grading . He prepares you well for test/quizzes. However, the class was boring",1
"She is a TOUGH COOKIE! This class is hard if you don't put in your all. If you want to pass this class with an A, I recommend doing everything she tells you to do. She will try to intimidate you by picking on you and blast you with tons of questions. Believe me, when I tell you to study, study, study! Good Luck!",1
"Kato sensei is great! I agree with the most recent review. She's cool and caring and she was always available to talk to, ask questions and go over work. The class atmosphere was good, everyone made friends and we learned at a steady pace. Tests were always fair. The beginning can be a bit hard if you have never learned any Hiragana, but it was ok!",1
"Half of his lecture notes are nonsensical abbreviations that only make sense to him. Class is very conservative/ Christian based. Very much emphasizes what he agrees with in the class (lectures pro life for a hour and 45 mins, then 15 mins of pro choice coverage). Claims theism is the only logical choice, bases it on the watchmaker theory.",0
"Dr. Baumann is very unclear with what he is looking for on assignments. Even if you answer a question correctly, he will mark off points for not including every detail he is grading on (even if you are not given a rubric). I would recommend taking a different professor . You might do poorly due to his grading, even if you know the material.",0
"She is a wonderful professor who seems to care greatly about her students. The class has a lot of reading assignments and essays which are very time-consuming. She is a very tough grader and has very strict deadlines, but allows students to rewrite their major essays in order to attempt to get some points back.",1
One of the best math professors Ive had at RCC. He makes the math easy to follow and explains all of his steps. He has a great sense of humor and keeps all of the classes lighthearted. He also follows the textbook so when you study outside of class its easy to relate the text to what was learned in class.,1
"don't take this professor! on the last day of class, he said we 'can't ask any stupid questions', my friend asks him to repeat a question and says ""class is dismissed, get out"". He assumes we ONLY take his class with no other work for other classes, is the rudest prof, and will call you out in front of the class if you have your phone visible.",0
"THE HARDEST CLASS I'VE EVER TAKEN. Dr. Hollis is a fantastic teacher, really enjoyed the lectures. His tests are incredibly hard and you can be blindsided by the minutiae he will ask about. A lot of writing too, no memorization or preparation for how the information will be tested. Labs are a lot of work but easy good grade Quizzes easy to mess up.",1
"Very nice, knowledgeable and technically sound professor. Lecture heavy though.",1
"The professor is very chill, nice to talk to. But what he did in exams is not fair. He just left us all on our own, no clear criteria of what to do in exams. Once the exam is done, he posted the actual criteria and deducted marks. If he didn't mess up the exam I would have given 5 rating :(",0
"the lectures for this class were super short and the assignments were usually based on our supplemental readings, which were skimmable and usually somewhat interesting. lots of discussion boards and ""perusall"" assignments (like a group annotation activity). i actually really liked this class and it was not hard. just devote like an hour per week",1
"This is probably the worst teacher in the whole Peralta district, at least for CIS. Lectures are ridiculously long, usually at least 2 to 3 hours long with no breaks. Doesn't respond to emails, doesn't have a clear grading rubric, no feedback on homework assignments. Literally forgot we had a midterm. Take anybody else but him.",0
stay away from harry,0
"You always know exactly what she expects out of you. Clear guidelines and you can revise. Although, if you do the outlines that she gives you, you shouldn't have to revise much.",1
"More of a hybrid class. You need mymathlab. the subject is harder for me than most but hes a great teacher, funny and laid back. practicing the math concepts is a must. Hes Not a fan of extra credit so do well on all exams for good measure of your grade.",1
"Awesome teacher!! Grades are just 4 essays and attendance. I used to no like writing but after I took this class, I started to really like writing. Definitely take this class. I loved it so much. Dr. Hartman is amazing too. Very nice, caring, personable, and helpful.",1
He is SUPER easy. Doesnt provide any extra credit anymore. His attitude is what I dreaded in this class but it you want an essay A TAKE HIM. Attendance only matters on presentation days.,0
"At first, I wanted to drop this class but as the course progressed I could see improvements in my writing skills. Grades were based on written work. Do not worry about getting it ""right"", it is better to have an original idea than to interpret the material perfectly. Do not repeat yourself, be clear and confident in your writing even if you aren't.",1
"Wane is unorganized, unclear in both her lectures and grading criteria, and overall the worst professor I have had. Her lectures had no structure, and everything she said was overtly opinionated. While opinions are fine, objectivity is needed when describing literary schools. I got an A, so I'm not just complaining because I flunked. She's horrible",0
"David Englund cares about Econ but is not a good teacher. He uses tricky clicker questions to lower your grade. No homework, 4 tests and the final. Dont buy the book.",0
"She is a good teacher. She has a big ego, it does get annoying sometimes. I am an average student. I passed the class. She likes to be very intimidating and loud. Her lectures were good. Class was interesting and fun, not boring. I learned a lot. I would take her again for another class.",1
"Dr. Evans is definitely a toughie, but the classes he teaches are very interesting and he knows so much about his subject. His tests can be brutal if you don't give yourself enough time to study for them, and his feedback on the tests is usually illegible because of his handwriting. But besides that, he has taught me so much & I've enjoyed classes.",1
"If you are looking for an ""easy"" (3) Theater Credits to satisfy your Fine Art requirement, look elsewhere.  This is class nor Professor will be an ""easy"" course.  She has no tolerance for truancy and you will be expected to read every word in the book, be quizzed with no heads-up on what you are being quizzed on AND you better perform via GOTE!",1
"Metzl is an awesome professor! If you are looking for your R&E req., this class is great- interesting lectures/guest speakers. Some reading, but it's fairly easy. Take the honors section if you have the opportunity. Though I had no interest in women's studies before, this class used both history and current events, and made me care. GREAT class.",1
Brandon Jones is so far my favorite professor at NAU. He really cares about his students as well as the subject. ISM 120 can be a difficult class but he makes it enjoyable.,1
"Don't take him as an elective. His class is HARD (so he grades on a curve), and if you don't have much of a biology background then I wouldn't recommend taking his class. As a person, however, he's super nice and caring (although quite scattered - his lectures are all over the place). Overall, nice man, but not a very good teacher.",1
barely passed this class. She is very strict with attendance and will mark you late even if you were late for 2 minutes.,0
"He is a great TA. He cares that you learn the material, helps beforehand during exams and quizzes. I would definitely suggest taking his discussion class.",1
She is difficult. Only give 10 minutes only per quizzes and it's given every week for sure. She takes off points for the tiny things like if you don't put a degree symbol its like 2 points off. So ridiculous! She expects a lot of memorization. SHE DOES NOT LET YOU USE FORMULA CHARTS FOR THE EXAM! You would have to learn the formulas by memory :(,0
"There is literally an assignment due every class day, from essays to paragraphs to literally anything you can think of. Honestly entirely too much work. If you have a class that needs extra attention DO NOT take this class.",0
"Professor Dendy was amazing! Truly learned a lot in her class. There is a lot of work to be done in this class, but she tries to help as much as she can. it can become overwhelming but as long as you do the work you'll be fine.",1
"Gary is a great hands-on teacher. I took 370 with him and it was a great, very unique. This class, on the other hand, is nothing like 370. It's all about reading the textbooks, and picking out the important info. Except, he tries to teach it like it's 370, which doesn't work. He doesn't tell you what he will test you on, you just have to guess.",1
"Don't understand all the bad views on here. It's a hard subject, but he makes the class as painless as possible. Some studying is required but that comes with the subject. You can tell he's really passionate about what he teaches, and he gives a very generous curve at the end of the semester, along with dropping the lowest test. Pretty cool guy.",1
Really dedicated to making sure every student learns the material. Doesn't use powerpoint or hand outs but instead writes and goes through everything slowly on the white board to make sure every one understands. If you go to class and take advantage of all the resources she provides econ suddenly feels very manageable. Also gives extra credit,1
Great teacher and always willing to help.,1
"This class requires you to teach yourself. Make friends, do the homework, make sure you know the content, you'll be good. The online material is MUCH easier than the lecture ones. I have friends who took the lecture, and honestly the online version is way easier. Given that its a 400-level class, it won't be a breeze. Put in the work * you'll be ok",0
"seems disorganised makes bad jokes and will make simple concepts difficult to understand as he has a way of teaching that seems like he is trying to show off how much smarter he is than everyone else. Will not post notes or HW solutions, tests can be easy",0
"She is an Ok professor. A lot of reading. And she talks about her kid a lot, and her private/elite education, and possibly she may end up in a better school than queens college...considering she may have a trust fund. Lucky her. Anyhow, I would sort of recommend her.",1
Larson is a great professor! I recommend taking as many courses with him as possible. Content is super beneficial and he is a great guy.,1
home works are so long like 8 parts per question basically. possessor is kind of boring. no cheat sheet for midterms his definition of cheat sheet is a formula sheet. random memorization of schematics. test tend to be long and boring.,0
"Her lectures are unfocused and you MUST go to class in order to get the information needed to pass. She is enthusiastic about it, but her voice tends to be monotone/soothing so try not to fall asleep...Good luck....",0
"Dr. B is a really genuinely nice guy that seems to care, and I love that. But any prof who thinks reading bullet points from power point slides (and that is all that he does) in order to teach students does not know how to teach. You want an easy A? Take him. You want to actually learn? Good luck. I am not sure a good algo prof exists at Auburn.",0
Amazing professor. Funny. Very useful if you pay attention,1
"Best professor I've had at the Lake! She actually is very engaging of her students in her class, and teaches the material in a way that students can relate it to everyday life. Would definitely recommend her!",1
professor is good but be ready to work. if you don't like to do homework then don't take this class. this teacher will teach you everything properly but is a bit dry on the humor side. If you like to learn this is the class.,1
"TERRIBLE!!!! If you have the choice, do NOT waste your time or money. It's extremely difficult to be successful in this course and she is not helpful or friendly whatsoever.",0
Her lectures are super boring and long. She sits on her desk during lab and will not walk around and help students. She's very lazy and doesn't care about her students. Don't take her if you don't have to.,0
"very oppinonated woman.  Gets on her soap box way too much and plays favorites big time.  Stay on her good side, and be sure to never question a grade she may give you, b/c she will hold it over your head.",0
"Run the other way! This teacher is insane. She is an extremely hard grader and the only way to do good on a paper is to buy one offline from someone with their masters. I couldn't wait for this class to be over. Nice person, but a pain as a teacher.",0
"First time taking this professor. Above all, I learned a lot about Spanish literature and its awesome writers. It always involve the students hard work in order to get an A. Dr. Hess  is knowledgeable and makes the class interesting and funny. I highly recommend her.",1
Professor Barnes is really nice and her class is easy. There is a lot of online quizzes but they were easy. She is not strict at all.,1
"She's the only teacher for the class at LSC Mont. So if you can go to another campus do so, don't take it from her. Very disorganised and rarely helpful. The final was the most work I'd done in the class and they hardest thing.",0
"Daniel Baker is one of my favorite professors here at Delta, he is really caring and funny and cares a lot about this work. There are test and quizzes every week on the chapter that is being taught but they are not that hard. The reading is kinda heavy so be prepared. You have a test every 4 chapters so pay attention. Highly recommend him!",1
"Hands down best professor to take for a difficult class. Anatomy is one of the hardest class I ever took and this professor made is easy. She doesnt give notes but she will write things down on the board she gives you what you need to know, willing to work with her students. She truly wants her students to pass with good grades. Take her!!",1
coolest teacher ever...,1
"good teacher, easy to talk with, fast and fair marker.",1
Took this class 1st sem. of my sophomore year when I decided to switch my major to psych and it was the BEST start to the major. Her lectures were engaging and I never missed a class or got bored even though it was an 8am. She makes the material easier to understand by including stories of her experiences in the field and using lots of examples!,1
"His exams are tricky. There are only 22 multiple choice questions per exam. You need to study the slides carefully, read the chapters thoroughly and take your own notes to get an A. During your presentation, he will ask you questions out of no where so be prepared and know your companies well. He's not very helpful outside or inside the classroom.",0
"Mr. Clark is a good professor, if you show up to class everyday and do the homework you should pass. your final grade is based on only three test grades so it is imperative that you do not fall behind and study a lot for the test. He posts past homework problems on blackboard and slides from class. There is homework every night never takes long.",1
"Mr. Sudovar is a very successful businessman. He provides the class with real world, applicable thinking regarding business problem solving. He is the best business professor that I have had in my schooling. Other professors teach the  theoretical and generally do not have real life experience in business. He is dedicated to supporting the students",1
"He overexplains simple concepts to the point of confusion, and is so high energy it gets tedious. Everything he says starts to blur together, and I found myself nodding off in almost every class. Math is hardly ever difficult for me, and I already knew the concepts from this class from high school, but I struggled with this teacher.",0
"Chris's class is pretty laid back. The grading revolves around four easy essays, a research paper, and a written midtermfinal. He gives little lectures on writing and other random things and is a rather easy grader on most of the stuff. The textbook is just used to read the short stories in class nearly every day. It's overall relaxed and easy.",1
"Papageorgiu is amazing! I highly recommend him! He will assist you with any questions you have, and he is hilarious.",1
Pretty easy professor and class.  Weekly quiz based off the powerpoint/pdf readings.  Of course weekly DB's that were easy and 2 projects.  She doesn't communicate very much and grading was very slow.  I had a D in the class the last day because so much work wasn't graded yet.  Ended up with a 95.,1
She is the worst yet!! She teaches way to fast and expects you to keep up. Mind you if you have been out of a classroom for a few years I recommend you take a few remedial courses as she will assume you know what steps to take and what she is talking about. She grades hard and rushes through the homework and rushing the lecture. The worst by far!!!,0
Taking French 2 with him he expects us to be basically fluent in French and expects us to know every exact detail FROM French 1. Comes off friendly but can be uncaring and unsupportive of students who need help.,0
"This class is awkward and hard to follow. He has his own rogue opinions about marketing and teaches it from an econ/finance perspective. You basically have to disregard everything you know about marketing, econd and finance and just answer his questions the way he wants you do. Hard to follow his lectures. Heavy case based  with group presentations",0
She is very nice but there is a lot of material for the class and generally we do not go over much of it.  The Cultural Anthropology is never specifically talked about in class but is a must read.  Be careful if you don't read you will have a hard time catching up.  She doesn't really get much accomplished in class as I think she would like.,0
Nice guy but too disorganized to run an online class. Spent hours trying to figure out which site each assignment was on (never used blackboard like most online profs). Paid $100 for book + $100 online course fee and got an A but couldn't even tell you what Human Geography is. Easy enough to fulfill requirements but you won't learn anything.,0
"Loved this class with Munguia she is a great professor. Board work made the class very fun, and I always learn something new. Be sure to keep up with the lectures before class, and reading the textbook helps a lot. She makes her class a bit challenging because she knows what it takes to find and keep a job in the real world. She's cool I like her.",1
"If you are taking Trigonometry with Prof. Gaworecki, then get ready to spend most of the semester focusing solely on Trig. You will have to keep up with her during lectures and she hands out pop quizzes every other day. (I would recommend studying the homework before class in order to not fail the pop quizzes.) Study weeks before the exams to pass.",0
"Her participation grading - stupid. Claims the way she grades you for coming is rewarding but you buy an app and get legitimately graded. You could show up and try but get a 50 on the questions. Her quizzes - easy. Use google and powerpoints. Her ""business problems"" are rough. Isn't challenging. you wont get an A. Time consuming... Learned nothing.",0
Great course. Very knowledgable professor.,1
"Was one of my favorite professors at LSU so far. She is a fairly challenging teacher but she is very passionate about what she teaches. I went to her office hours several times and she was always nice and willing to help, especially on her researcher papers (definite thing). Would definitely recommend her, as you will learn a lot. Worth the effort.",1
Excellent teacher.  Always helpful.  Wish he taught more classes.,1
"He's a fossilized piece of animal dung, worst notes ever, hardest tests ever, absolutely no respect for students.  Goes out of his way to make you feel like an idiot if you ask him a question or answer one of his.  Curses technology when he can't figure out that you need to plug the cart INTO THE WALL, NOT BACK INTO THE CART.  PLEASE RETIRE.",0
"If this class was physical it would have the best one. But due to the current events (Covid-19) this class has turned out to be disastrous. When everything became online you would expect zoom lectures like other professors do. However, Professor McFaul refused to ""adapt"" and instead kept sending long emails continually to cheer us.",0
The class as a whole is a little disorganized and isn't taught that well. I do not recommend taking unless you want to have mental breakdowns every night.,0
"while i was in his class he goes off topic, grades his students off english 121 and expect his students to know how to write a paper and does not guide his students on any assignments. Speaks very low he tries to be funny but personally i did not learn anything from this class i am retaking english 28.",0
I enjoyed the content of the class and I feel like she presented it in a way that was understandable. I liked the online format where I could print out the slides and take notes on them. The reading quizzes were difficult and really made me pay attention to the text. She knows the material extremely well. Be prepared to work for a good grade.,1
Nice guy but horrible class. His grading system is ridiculous! Lectures are a bore. Would not recommend..,0
love SAM such a solid guy who genuinely cares about what hes teaching,1
SAVE YOURSELF AND YOUR GPA!,0
"ISWK 2006EL online. most unreasonable marker I have ever had, doesn't read your full papers only focuses on the first 2 pages. penalized marks b/c I didn't use an article she labeled as ""extra reading"" & not part of the course content. always overwhelmed by the online platform, not helpful, no exam review, angry online, made me want to drop out.",0
Professor Spaeth is super kind and patient. The class is very interesting and goes into Greco-Roman magic. There is a ton of readings and some big papers which are time-consuming. Overall the class was intriguing and she was always open to helping people during office hours and gave great feedback on papers.,1
"Great teacher and likes you to participate and ask questions, if not he will start calling randomly. He is very clear about the concepts and explains them in different ways. Extremely funny, sarcastic, and may pick on you but only to further explain concepts. Quizzes and exams straight forward from notes and definitions.",1
"Prof. Perez is fine, she is very strict but she explains the material very clear. There are 3 exams 50 question each. The exams are worth 30% each and attendance is 10% of the grade. She gives a lot of extra credit which helps a lot!! I will take her again for another PSY course next semester.",1
"This was the last class available when i searched for this class, i didnt do much research about the professor because it was a last minute thing. Now i know why so many people skipped this professor. His lectures are confusing, his notes are hard to understand, and he makes the students feel dumb. Do yourself a favor and skip him.",0
"He had some pretty cheesy math jokes.  Also, he liked to explain the history of what we were learning.  However, that was all he explained.  He didn't explain anything that he did which was hard for someone who hadn't taken a Calc class before.  Also, his weekly quizzes were different from what we did homework on and studied in class.",0
Rebecca is a great teacher! She does in class assignments that are pretty fun and that help you to understand the material better. She is great with adding multiple different learning styles into her teachings. Only a few short homework assignments and two exams. I would definitely take her class again!,1
"Some days he is hands off and lets the student ""leaders"" lead the newspaper but other days (most days) we are mindless drones just making the stories and pages the way he tells us.  He makes you dumb down your writing then talks to you like your dumb.  I want to write for the NY Times, not the press telegram, thank you!  Made me hate journalism",0
Stay far far away.,0
Had a very negative experience with this professor. The class goes for the full 2.5 hours and is unbearably slow. Bases her teaching off slide shows and is VERY lecture heavy. The premise of the class is to build up skills and give a mock-lesson for the class. The professor basically verbally bashed us in-front of the whole class. Not proffessional,0
"Someone needs to get this woman out of a classroom. She outdated. Her instructions are vague, her syllabus is vague. I didn't learn a thing in her class. She started class 15 minutes late every day, and always has to leave in the middle go move her car. She is very set in her ways with her 1938 budget!",0
"Everyone should take Prof. C for Business Comm. He is the best professor I've had at Fordham. Extremely clear teaching style, funny and helpful. Will make you a great speakerpresenter. One of the friendliest professors at Fordham. You will learn so much from this class, and have a good time every day, too.",1
Dragged out the topic's due to lack of participation from the class. She was organized with students work but a tough grader. Assignment descriptions weren't always clear.,0
Tries to throw you off on exams. Didn't round up my grade when it was within 0.4%,0
"Professor Humber is a solid teacher. While his class may not be the most interesting, it is fairly easy and allows you to think about linear algebra. He goes through review of the previous class each day which is nice if you miss class. Also, do his homework, as it is pretty close to what to expect on the test. Good guy :)",1
She is smart and knows her stuff. No doubt about that and she is a good person at heart but I wish she could at least see how it is for first time learners when it comes to micro. We don't have a PhD in that field and need more time then what was given to UNDERSTAND. I took anatomy and so much other required classes for nursing major. I couldn't de,0
Kim is an awsome person always willing to stay after to help and clear up things with you if you dont understand the lesson. Some might get a bad impression because of her accent but hey its a math class number arent diffrent. She always gives awsome reviews for test that help out alot.. Overall awsome teacher just do work and ask questions!!,1
"Spring 2017 for operations management 1. Solano was one my favorite professors at SRU. He comes off as strict initially but warms throughout the semester. Solano is an excellent teacher, definitely my favorite non American professor. OM is a math course that uses Microsoft Excel heavily. Take OM directly after Productivity Software if possible",1
"The class is relatively stale. Hard to focus in and I would do my best to avoid the QSI Hailey Burgess (most hardlined instructor) Albert is enthusiastic about the topic, which makes it a bit more easier to take in. But still not worth taking over other classes. If you want a fun class, this isn't it. But if you LOVE history, go for it.",0
He is a great teacher.,1
"This guy is a joke!!! Over half of the class is going to get a D or lower for their final grade and he thinks thats a good thing....will never give a student an A its one of his policies, test are impossible and admits to making them that way on purpose...worst part is he is the only teacher that teaches this class!",0
"If I could go back in time and choose another professor I would. DO NOT take his class  he is monotone, unclear with his explanations, and at times it felt like he was trying to shove his religion towards his students. Take -a n o t h e r-professor. I barely learned anything. I was interested and fascinated by philosophy until I took him.",0
A wonderful teacher very passionate about what she teaches.  Field trips where great and so informative.  Gives many chances to be successful in her class and has a big heart.,1
"Absolute worst teacher I ever had. Avoid his classes at all costs. He is rude, inconsiderate, gives no instruction on all and expects students to learn everything on their own. Spams your inbox all day with useless announcements and takes credit for work the students did themselves. Abandon all hope, ye who enroll here.",0
"Do the work,  study the material, pay attention, participate ( which is easy), Mr Meeker enjoys (loves) teaching Psy 180, you are given everything to pass  ",1
"The professor makes the material very interesting, the course isn't hard either. He's super hot. I dont know why I was always afraid of him but then I realized he's really nice and helpful. I will always remember this professor.",1
"You really have to learn it yourself. Plus, he will wait until the end of the semester to grade anything, so you have no idea where you stand in the class. However, he does curve. A lot. Big curves. Like where did that come from? Still a stressful class though.",0
"Prof. Hinshaw is by far the best prof, I have ever had: he is interesting, smart, REALLY involved and interested in the material himself, he is funny, and seems like a genuine and caring person (just as a side note). If you have to chose one professor to not to miss during your time at CAL, Hinshaw is definitely the one!",1
the projects and assignments for her class are hard and she asks a lot and doesn't give you any time to work on the group projects in class. she dosent give tests just a midterm and final. she gives good study guides and is willing to help you as much as possible,1
"She has done an extremely poor job of handling the pandemic, and has shown complete disregard for students' digital safety and privacy. When I brought this up with her, she basically told me ""if you don't like it, drop the class"" which is an extremely inappropriate response. 3 1/2 years at UBC and I've never felt so disrespected by a prof.",0
"This is a newer course at UCN and is lecture heavy, but you learn a lot of great information. Vanessa is always easily accessible and gives great feedback. Make sure you ask if you don't understand something, and use the Pearson tools that are accessible to you. Study hard because there is A LOT of information to learn",1
"Crowley knew her stuff, and gave you all the tools to pass her class. No homework for points, instead she takes attendance. She assigns homework and expects you to do it on your own, her tests are similar to the homework, if you dont do the HW, you dont do well on the tests. Has all the 'distractors' - its tough but she is GREAT!",1
Jackie is by far my favorite professor I've ever taken at WCU. She makes the class as easy as possible and is so clear with what she expects from students. I took her twice and wish I could take her again. She really is the best professor on this campus,1
"I took Professor Thompson's summer course of Micro and it was easily the hardest class that I have ever taken. Does NOT give out extra credit, claimed that he did and at the end of course, never gave it out. Tests were timed 1 minute per question. Lectures were unrelated to the material. I was unemployed during Thompson's class and still got a B.",0
"She is one of the easiest professors I have ever had. You are graded by attendance, group projects, and 2 exams. Exams are basically the Power Points and if you put some effort in you will receive an A.",1
"Boring speaker, monotone, with no passion. I have Aspergers and have difficulty with social situations. He did not accommodate my disability, just scoffed. Group projects would have been much better if there was a discussion board, forum, or chatsomething to get to know classmates and discuss problems. If I could ask for a refund I would",0
DO NOT take her.. She refuses to help and she just struts around the class. Her tests are impossible. If you struggle with math then do not take her. And I did all of my homework assignments,0
"Mrs. Tersteegen is a good teacher. Buying the thin textbook is a joke and a waste of money. Thicker textbook we used often, other one twice. You don't have assignments sucks to be you points off. Definitely learn some things.",1
"I took all her classes when she taught at UCSD. She's genius and changed the way I look at everything, taught me how to think more critically. Lectures were fascinating. To do well, read all your assignments, show up, and see her during office hours--in other words, if you're a good student, you'll do well in her VERY interesting classes.",1
"I love Ronda! She is a great teacher and she really pushes you (in a good way) so that you keep up. If you do the homework you will get a good grade, but you will have to do the work. She obviously loves her work and really wants you to succeed. She aspires to make the material understandable and interesting.",1
she is the sweetest! if you need psych 1 Dr. Guimberteau is the one ya'll.,1
"Even though it's not an easy A, he is really there to help and if you work really hard and see's you trying he will compensate. He also curves exam grades if class average is low, definitely take this course with Du.",1
Syllabus says you are not allowed to contact the professors. Backtests aren't relevant to what you will be tested on. PILOT tutoring wasn't helpful. 3 exams make your entire grade. Grading system unfair and system to ask for a regrade basically doesn't exist. I took an exam in October and no one ever responded to my regrade request.,0
"She makes class mandatory but shows up late, grades papers late and doesn't help you understand the material well I would not take.",0
"Lots of people like him because he is funny, but frankly I think he is just a lazy drunk, didn't grade any hw till the very end, never saw the correct answers so know I got things wrong, no way to know why or how to fix.",0
"Never used book, BUT you have to use a online code for HW. GREAT professor, his notes on the board are fantastic compared to other teachers. Worst part of class is only 2 tests! Midterm & Final. 1 online homework assignment every week (Graded). Really knows his stuff, his accent is pretty good and tries to be very understood. SUIT GAME STRONG",1
Shes a VERY HARD teacher shes horrible she never helps you when you need the help she expects you to know how to do the work take someone else who will help you.,0
"Professor Prez is a great teacher, he assigns a lot of readings. But you kind of don't need to do all of them, just do the one that the asks you to reference in paper and you'll be fine. He gave the prompt for the midterm to us to take home and write on an index card and then copy in class. One paper to do at home. And the final was take home too!",1
She does not respond to emails. The instructions for the big assignments are not given until the end of the semester. The big assignments are very difficult. Wish we could have received them earlier. She waits until the end of the semester to grade.,0
Exams are so unnecessarily hard. Avoid at all costs.,0
Professor was always available for my questions and helpful with my queries when I was puzzled. The added bonus I gained from this class in addition to in depth network administration knowledge was an industry standard certification for network administration which will be extremely valuable for job hunting in a competitive employment market.,1
He is a great professor and i would recommend him to everybody that i know! As long as you dont miss the deadlines his class is an easy A. He is very clear as to when the dead lines are and the Projects and Tests are easy as long as you listen.,1
"Terrible professor. Very difficult tests and quizees which the class is not properly prepared for. Most people in class recieved low grades in the C range. The MOST BORING teacher i have ever had, he talks in a monotone voice. Very inconsiderate with his grading.Recieved a bogus participation grade DNT TAKE. One of the worst teachers ive ever had.",0
She has powerpoints to present everyday but every slide is a stock picture with a title. Class is VERY awkward and uncomfortable. She is also very one sided and liberal in her material and it is hard to discuss opposing viewpoints. Towards the end of the class she got very hostile and would rush through the class. Made me rethink my major.,0
"He's easy-going with his students and encourages participation. The course itself is incredibly easy and he grades fairly, so chances are you'll do well. There's also not much homework or tests to worry about, so this was a pretty low-stress class.",1
"Very helpful, upbeat, great sense of humor with an amusing feminist twist on everything.",1
"Never a boring class, you do get a lot of work but everything you do is helpful and essential to getting a good grade on the essays. Readings can get a little overwhelming for some, but it wasn't a problem for me. Her class does require a lot of time outside class, but if you fulfill all the requirements and ask for help you will pass",1
"I definetly dont suggest anyone to take this professor. Unless your willing to have a hard time comprehending what it is that he wants you to do. Although I think he is very knowledgeable, he seriously does not know how to teach.",0
Great teacher took her fall 2019 for econ 2301 and 2302 econ in the spring online. She cares about her students. Glad I took her for both my economic classes. I hope to take her college class offered at LU also.,1
If you're concerned with your grades I would highly recommend taking this class from another instructor. The classwork is far more extensive than needed and the instructor is very inflexible.  You will be required to do several hours unrelated volunteer work and raise a virtual child online which is time consuming and holds little educational value,0
"Park's tests are mostly from his notes but changes the problems a little. However, he is a INCREDIBLY tough grader. It is ridiculous how harsh he is when giving partial credit. Also his humor gets old quick. Rude in office hours too. AVOID HIM.",0
She really helped me out with deciding my classes for the next sememster. She's nice and gave me some suggestions that I never considered before.,1
"Hope and pray you don't get her for you senior internship LYHS friends. Communication is SO low, and I had to do ANOTHER senior project because she didn't think me getting a 3,000$ grant for my site was ""good enough,"" even though I was the only one who worked on it. I'm looking forward to May 11th so I never have to see her ever again.",0
This guy is very dedicated to his teaching and I felt like I was important to him. He doesn?t teach many classes at Keene but if he did I would definitely take him again. He is not very easy but he will help you do well. Be sure to come to class and look like you are paying attention. He is scary looking but pretty nice.,1
Really mean,0
"A lot of people have issues with Dr. De Vos but he is a great professor. He has definitely grown on me throughout my semester taking him and I have learned so much in his class. Also, he gives you all the exam questions on the study quizzes so if you study those then you will pass the class. All you have to do is try and you will pass.",1
"worst professor, giving thousands of homework and expect you to finish it in less than a week. her precal 165 is the worst class to take online, please run, do not take her online",0
"Dr. Thompson' class was so fun! Attendance isn't mandatory, but going earns you extra credit on exams and the tests are all based off of lectures. She keeps her lectures fun and engaging and she's so funny!! Highly recommend.",1
She's the best professor i've ever had . Very clear and gives alot of examples . She's funny and her class is super fun . ,1
"She's awesome, it's a comfortable environment to really discuss interesting topics. I would take this class again in a heartbeat. She lets the students have her number and you can text her at any time and she will respond very quickly,",1
"The tests are made to take more than the allotted time, he is extremely vague, and does not post grades until the last minute, and he NEVER posted homework or participation grades.",0
"He's kind of all over the place, we pretty much focused on the same topic all semester so I didn't feel like I learned all that much. He has a very specific way of thinking so on assignments and tests you have to keep that in mind. Overall I really wish I hadn't taken this class.",0
Makes it tough for a 100 level class.,0
Might be a great researcher but definitely a REALLY bad teacher. Most of his explanations are unclear and messy. Will not answer student questions. Barely available. Cannot solve his own exams without making mistakes.,0
"Professor Epley's class isn't that difficult as long as you follow instructions and do your assignments. We did have a few pop quizzes involving reading, so I would recommend keeping track of homework and essays and getting it all done ahead of time. Overall, it was a pretty fun experience.",1
"I had Dr. Thomas during her first semester teaching. She was amazing! She truly cared about the students in the class and wanted each of us to succeed. It was a lot of studying for the lab quiz each week, but it is doable. She made the more boring or in depth material fun and relatable to us. Also, lots of opportunities for extra credit.",1
I don't even understand how she is actually employed...,0
"A very good professor. He cares about the students, he is fair, he presents the material in a clear way. Absolutely recommended!",1
Do not take this class if you care about your GPA. He refuses to give out good grades and there are only 3 exams which are so difficult. Teachers like this should not have a job.,0
Paoline puts an outline on the board every class and it's your job to collect the important information as he lectures.  He makes it simple to get good notes.  If you study your notes you'll be perfectly fine.  Good teacher in my opinion.  He loves his subject and it translates. 3 tests,1
If you are not good at math do NOT take him. He skips a lot of steps he feels are common sense but for those of us not good at math are important to understand the material. Quizzes every week. Doesn't answer questions thoroughly. I never felt comfortable enough to ask questions because of the way he responded to others when they asked.,0
"I found my class with her incredibly boring, nobody wanted to participate, and it was difficult to pay attention because of the low energy level of both professor and student. Some of the articles we read were interesting, but I was one of the few that actually did the assignments. Grades tough, you have to write extremely well, but borin",0
Tests are much harder then other chem professors. Shes okay for lab but avoid taking her for lecture,0
"This professor is frustrating. She is knowledgable and has a neat approach to science instruction. Unfortunately she is rudely sarcastic & unable to ""turn off"" her 7th grade teaching style. She has no interest in credential candidate success. She grades font, margins & spacing to the point of failure. Horrible at communicating in person and email.",0
He's really nice and pretty laid back. He is always willing to help. One time I and nearly the entire class hadn't written a paper that was due and he gave us all an extension. Such a sweet guy!,1
"Course was fairly straightforward, and Evan made it easy for us to understand what we should expect to know for exams. Engaging lecturer, would recommend.",1
Tough but extremely fair and knowledgeable. You will grow as a writer and critical thinker.,1
"If you want a lazy class and hope to pass, this is the teacher for you. You don't need to read, just show up to every class and turn in the work. There's only 6 essays, this including midterm and final. Don't expect to learn, challenge or know what is going on in class. If you ask him for help, you'll be more confused than before.",0
"Cesar is fun! You'll like him. =)  The class is only somewhat difficult, but he keeps it fun. You'll need to participate a LOT in class to earn an 'A' for that requirement. It will make a difference on your overall grade, so don't be afraid to speak or make mistakes....just talk!",1
"Dr. Handy is the best!!!! She has always helped me with whatever problems I had with certain questions for the homework, quizzes and tests. She knows what she is doing and supports you - she WANTS you to succeed. She is answers emails promptly, grades fairly and is the nicest professor I have met on campus.",1
Really tough quizzes are extremely difficult ,0
"Hi everyone. I am not usually rated for any of my professors. However, I think you need to know about this one. Homework is extremely heavy. Making sure you have time for it. She grades our work very hard. Trust me, to get a good grade even in a discussion is very difficult.",0
She is very smart but sometimes treats her students like children. She yells a lot and is constantly taking phone calls during class. She does not put up with any type of nonsense. She can be very mean and rude. She is very tough but means well.,0
Amazing professor. This man actually cares about his students. He accepts all opinions and has very interesting things to say. Death and Dying was one of the most memorable and interesting classes i've ever taken. Some of the things that Prof McLaughlin said changed my life. Thank you,1
"The professor is tough, but really knows her stuff. Always willing to take time outside of class to help. Great teacher.",1
"Professor Fischer is a good professor. This is my second time having him as a professor. I had him for PHIL001 and the format was exactly the same apart from not having quizzes. Two midterms (20pts each), Attendance (20pts) and Final (40 pts). Exams are short answer questions. As long as you do the readings and take notes, it should be easy B.",1
Amazing lecturer! She really puts work into her lectures to help her students succeed. Her tests are usually based on the lectures so attending class is a must. She does a lot of visual demos for you to understand the concept.,1
Nice enough prof but she strays from the topics and the text and slides used are extremely dry. Gave no real indication of what might come on her tests or how they would work besides saying they were written exams.,0
"Professor Kleindienst is a cool guy, can be funny at times but his class is ridiculous. Group project almost seems completely unfeasible and pointless. First case study he doesn't give you an example, just a template and tells you he'll explain after it's discussed in class. Still grades you as if you knew what you were doing. Would not recommend.",0
absolutely do not take his class. this man should not even be employed. he plays favorites like its his job and will make the peoples lives he doesnt like a living hell. he acts like hes grading a harvard students paper. he grades so tough to the point where its ridiculous. he took off my introduce yourself discussion board. like what?,0
"Well organized lectures, all you need to do is write down exactly what she does on the board. Tests/quizzes are easy + mirror examples given in class. Didn't even buy the textbook because my notes were enough. Sometimes takes attendance, but don't miss class because you won't know whats going on. Pretty easy grader compared to other physics profs.",1
Her class is very challenging and rigorous. Lots of quizzes and homework. But she responds to email quickly and is a fair grader.,1
"Horrible professor, lecture heavy, homework is one attempt, chapter test one attempt, rude, arrogant, never available, 3 tests and no extra credit",0
"Even though she was an online professor, she taught the material well and very concise! Easily accessible when I needed a question answered, very straightforward materials/tests, light but comprehensible coursework. Well rounded professor in general!",1
Professor is very sweet and very understanding.,1
He is a nice guy but his class is difficult. You have quizzes from the book every week and he expects every student to participate in the discussion. You are graded for participation. Sometimes his grading was very hot and cold. He didn't ever have anything good to say about my discussion posts and left long messages as to what I didn't do right.,0
She's late every. single. day. and keeps you late. every. single. day.,0
"6-week course. Frequently goes off-topic in his lectures to talk about events or his own rants. If you are a girl, expect to be called up to the board or computer frequently to write stuff he's teaching. Lectures are usually him reading directly from slides, doesn't expand on material. Didn't follow the syllabus. I feel unprepared for CSC202.",0
"can't say more than what's already been said. Evan's a solid choice for a professor. group projects suck oh so much but overall the class was neat. you will (or should) learn a lot about brain imaging techniques that will be useful to know whether you are a psych major, premed, or just interested.",1
"Professor Allen is funny and is super fascinated by earthquakes. There are course captures that allow you to not go to his lectures. Really recommend re-watching his lectures before taking exams. Midterms and Finals are fair, GSIs are really helpful too.",1
"Very nice indeed, plus the class is pretty interesting.",1
"Professor Barron is definitely unique. Her lectures were sort of interesting, depends on the day/topic/mood shes in. she is very specific about how she wants things done so just follow her rules and youll be okay.",1
"Having prof. Current online was honestly a really bad experience. I dreaded this class and its outdated materials and lectures - I was bored out of my mind most days. Assignments were pointless or confusing, as was the Canvas page. Most frustratingly, he showed an unwillingness to listen to the concerns and ideas of students. I'm so glad to be done",0
"Good teacher but gives a ridiculous amount of homework. Try 5-10 assignments a week; oh & there are 5 papers. Additionally, many of the assignments seem like busy work that she doesn't even grade based on effort/quality. If you do poorly on an essay or miss an assignment, it wont matter bc there are so many assignments to balance out low scores.",0
"I found his lectures rushed, disjointed, and unclear. This is partially because his powerpoints are a mixture of the textbook publisher's ppts as well as a few other professors' lecture slides. It was easier and clearer to read the excellent textbook and skip all lectures. That aside, he's helpful out of class and his exams are fair.",0
It's a language class! IF YOU DON'T PAY ATTENTION OR DO YOUR HOMEWORK YOU WILL FAIL. Don't blame Nadeau! She was great! She gives you all the tools you need to start learning French. I thought it would be very hard to get a grasp on the language but with her help it was very easy. If you're struggling she'll help you. She's very caring and sweet!,1
"Professor Nelson was kind of tough at first, but he is one of the most nicest, caring, and thoughtful professors. Due to the pandemic, he decided to put the submit date for all assignments as December 5th. We had no tests, and he also cut 42 points to help our grades. This may not happen to future students, but it was rare, and helped me a ton.",1
"Dr. Cochrane is extremely nice and super helpful! She's an easy grader which makes the course fairly easy as well. Although attendance is not mandatory, she does like to give in class writing assignments on random days worth 100 points relating to the text(super easy read!) so I would suggest attending:) great class!",1
He's very good with feedback and will take the time to explain himself and his expectations. I would recommend him to anyone. Really enjoyed this class.,1
Hard teacher ,0
Terrible.,0
Worst teacher ever in the whole universe!!!! Did all my work not even miss one paper or a class and he gave me my first D ever.He expects 101 work when he does not teach it!!!!!,0
"He is unorganized in the beginning of the semester (with assignments from last semester's due dates appearing on the to-do list on CANVAS) and will not respond to emails. There is an extra credit opportunity for all of the discussion posts, so take advantage of those, quizzes/exams are difficult. I did not use the book, but it would have helped.",0
do not recommend her to anybody,0
Great professor! He is very helpful and clear on the content. There are only 3 tests and 3 papers with no final so its a pretty easy course even though the tests and papers can be somewhat challenging.,1
Tough grader but excellent in discussion sections at covering the material. Fair grader as he learns your writing.,1
"A very poor professor.  All he does is throw formulas on the board.  He will brush questions off to the side because he has no interest in engaging with students.  Exams are very tough, but he puts his head down and does not care if half of the class cheats.  Overall, quite a shame since the material is very interesting.",0
"really nice, but can bite your head off, but dont take it personally. class is mostly boring unless your interested in the engineering of the equipement. dont have to go to class, but there are some small things that you have to know to get A+ which you have to get somehow. Has a stutter with ""s"", tries really hard, but has to learn powerpoint.",1
"Her lectures consisted almost entirely of reading to us the concepts from the book that were going to be on the test.  Reading them.  Word for word.  And repeating them for those who did not have time to write it down the first time, even though it was right there, in the book.",0
he was really cool and made class fun,1
"I dont use this ever, but here I am to warn you to not take David Stone. His average on his exam was a 47% (the first was a 58%), and the final was a 51%. He refused to say what the final exam average was until I asked the TA. He literally sent out a PDF explaining he's not fair bc life isn't fair and hence he wouldn't curve and to just suck it up",0
"really tough grader, extra credit is only worth one point. She is not helpful when you have concerns about your grade and has a very smart way to respond, always. since her english isn't so good, her lectures are not understandable. Do not recommend her.",0
"Funny enough, I took this class because of the rave reviews I saw on here. The reality of it? This instructor hardly respond to e-mails or discussions, it takes around 4 hours to listen to a lecture, study the material, and take a quiz, and in addition, you don't get much time to complete quizzes. Very time consuming, I would not recommend...",0
DO NOT TAKE THIS MAN FOR STOR435. JUST DON'T DO IT YOU WILL HAVE TO LEARN EVERYTHING ON YOUR OWN AND HE GIVES A HOMEWORK DUE EVERY CLASS PERIOD. He cares not at all about teaching this class,0
"Don't be deceived by the goofball. Was the best class I have ever taken and the smartest professor I have ever had. He doesn't act like a ""know it all,"" but he really knows it all. He is beyond funny! Cares about each student. If you ask for help, he will take the time to help you think it through yourself. He loves snacks, orange and fun people.3",1
"She's Great Clear and to the point, breaks material down so you understand, stresses what pts you'll need  to no for test mutiple choice & matching only Gives realistic examples and has a Great sense of Humor She's so AWESOME that I'm taking her again for BI 152 Easy A as long as YOU apply Yourself",1
"Lectures were kind of monotonous, so it was hard to pay attention. He posts slides online. 1 midterm exam, questions are easy if you even just review lectures. Final was a paper, which was time-consuming but not too difficult. Had a required field trip to a Sikh temple (w a reflection paper on it), which was an incredible learning experience",1
"Sandra is such a kind lady! A great first year prof, she really made my experience enjoyable! She wants the best for her students and always makes sure students know that they are being thought of. Her lectures and helpful, readings are necessary, and course material is applicable to real life! Her tests and exams are fair. Overall, great prof!",1
I took Physics 121 and 123 with Nikolai and he's solid. Any class in the physics 12X series is run very similarly aside from lecture style. Nikolai sticks to powerpoints and is fairly learning catalytics heavy (in class participation system). His explanations are great and easy to understand. Study lecture homework questions LC for easy midterms.,1
"This class was so hard. I really struggled with it, even after studying a LOT! I did pass, barely! The tests never seemed to be what I expected or we were encouraged to study. This didn't help my HATE for history. I did much better in the 2nd part of this class with a better teacher.",0
Rudest and unhelpful professor ever. She's out of the country 2/3 of the semester and does not return grades on papers and midterms until almost the end of the semester. She never replies to emails and when she does she's so rude. The tests are impossible and not from the book. She does not care for students and does not deserve to be a professor. ,0
She's not even qualified to teach college courses.  She told our class that she only has a Masters degree in Education - not even in Biology.... Goodwin should give her the pink slip..,0
"Don't take this, I love writing and she made my experience horrible, she speaks in a condescending tone and makes you feel as if your opinions do not matter",0
worst professor ever. Be prepared to watch his lecture's recordings because you won't be able to keep up with him when the lecture is live.,0
"I would never say I was good at math, like at all but Mr. Eisenberg is a really good teacher. His lectures are easy to follow. He has the class set up so that as long as you pay attention & actually try then you will pass with a good grade. He gives you examples of the exact types of problem that will be on the exam & is always available for help.",1
"She's not bad, but really boring lecturer. You have to remember all the readings though, and she takes off for every little thing on exams. Nice person, but boring. Tests aren't bad if you really know about everything she says in class. You need to go to class to do well in the class. ",0
I just wanna make sure everyone knows to never take this class. Like fr... These positive comments are actually cap. Like please save yourself and do not take this class. If you want to get anything more than a D good luck! YOU NEED TO GET EVERYTHING RIGHT IN THE CLASS. LIKE NOT EVEN CAPPING EVERYTHING. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS,0
This professor knows the material- cold. I think someone must have received a poor grade a few years ago and put up some cra* here. He doesn't have a final- you work on papers through the semester- so you know what you're doing- he helps and answers questions- unlike most other professors at the school-  take his pretrial lit- you'll know whats up,1
I recommend everyone to take her for ENG 1O1 or ENG 102 if you can. She's literally the best English professor I had. All you have to do is attend class and do all the papers she assigns and do well on the exams and you'll pass. She really cares about her students and tries her best to make sure everyone can get a passing grade.,1
"Mr. Narin is cool...I enjoyed his class, textbook used was easy to follow and exercises were many to learn from...If you are structured and committed take this class!  If you want to be spoon fed take another class.....",1
Don't take this class unless you like learning while competing in Marvel Themed Chemistry Cosplay. He encourages students to dress up and connect chemistry to comic book heroes. He gives extra credit for non-store bought costumes when you wear them to class.,0
"I would not recommend Hertz. I took an English course with him over the Winter session and had the hardest time. He seemed like a nice guy in the beginning but repeatedly gave me rude comments and feedback on assignments, and offered little guidance on how to improve my writing. He would tell me I'm doing well yet give me poor grades.",0
"I took the Evolution of Hip Hop honors seminar. While very easy, you have a ton of work due each week. On top of class (attendance is mandatory), expect 2-3 hours of outside work. That being said, he is a really cool professor. I liked coming to class and learning more from him. ",1
"He's a good guy. This is a great class to take if you just need to get your gen ed math requirement out of the way. You still have to do the work assigned and put in a little effort, but all in all it's easy. May want to consider a different professor if you'll be taking higher maths, though. Doesn't let the class drag on-- teaches what's necessary",1
"she is terrible when it comes to writing notation, does't accept homework once class starts, says an answer is wrong when it is right, basically impossible to do anything correct.",0
Drop and wait until he isn't teaching to take the course.,0
Liebling is the BEST lab professor you can get. I missed 2 labs and he still gave me an A. VERY understanding and goes out of his way to accomodate your needs. The field trip is definately worth the extra credit-- and so are his drawings!!,1
You will not learn anything. Have to memorize a lot. Get an Iphone thats what most of the class did? I didnt do that otherwise I would also get a descent grade. You will cry and memories of class will not go away. You will regret but have no option. EE dept doesnt care about us they onlycare bout money. You be ready to kill your GPA.,0
"I don't recommend this teacher, she seems to treat students like if its high school, for a college course students need to think critically in order to make assignments, but she uses high school techniques such as memorizing things for the exams which is pretty high school, my advise: avoid this teacher too much homework and no points for it.",0
DIFFICULT class but great professor!!! Really cares about students and always willing to stay late to help u understand material.,1
If you go to class and take notes the class is fairly easy. The study guides are a outline to the test which makes it super helpful when studying. Rarely used the book unless I missed a class or used with the study guide. The assignments can be lengthy but the topics were interesting and we only had 4 assignments. Would recommend for an easy A.,1
"This course earned my first C in my 3 year college career.  Teacher would make us do hw and take tests before ever teaching the subject, which she thought was a hot new teaching method, so the only reason to take the class was for the weekly quizzes, because after that you would not learn anything new. Reading the book was the only way to learn.",0
"Her classes aren't that bad, but her manner of dealing with students is the real problem. She targets students she doesn't like and makes them feel completely worthless.",0
"Took online Summer of 2019. He provides materials, no need to buy the book. Seems like a very down to earth guy but I never reacevied the grading for two out of four papers. Papers also were the only thing we did in class over summer. Had a paper due every Friday final included. Four papers only so do them to pass!",1
"So funny and nice, makes gen psych enjoyable to go to. Would highly recommend!",1
"If you took Intro to Chem in HS prior to this class, you might want to reconsider! There is loads of homework (online, texbook, lab, etc.) & so much money to be spent all on supplies for the class. Easy grading if you do all the work, but 4 midterms is NOT it. She expects you to memorize absolutely everything. Had to drop due to too much stress!",0
"Very poor experience in her online class. She took a week to respond to emails, posted an exam ten hours later than promised, and tested us on very obscure details from our course notes. The final assignment (worth 25% of our final grade) was based on calculations about mining that we had never been taught in the course. Would not recommend.",0
"Things aren't always clear when students do the readings, but Prof. Duina does such an amazing job clearing everything up and talking about theorists. LOVE DUINA, take a course with him. And he's sexy.",1
"Probably the worst 1L Professor at Iowa. 30 Question MC Final on Civil Procedure, 5 questions on international law, 0 questions on minimal contacts/personal jurisdiction, 0 questions on the Erie doctrine. Yep, sounds like a Maya Steinitz Civil Procedure final exam.",0
"He is an amazing professor! Took him for intro to EADP and helped me absolutely love the subject and field. He is very knowledgable, organized, helpful, and very funny. This was a 3 hour long class but he is very knowledgable about it. Attendance is not mandatory but he does pop quizzes or participation points. Amazing professor!!",1
Julie is wonderful! very helpful!,1
Great professor. She's always willing to help inside and outside of class. She cares about her profession. Only thing is is she takes forever to grade papers and homework. Do her work and it's an easy A.,1
The absolute worst. Take anyone but him trust me,0
"There is so much reading for this class! Moreover, I feel like this class is mandatory on attendance because she reviews the articles and goes over a lot of things that is on the exams so if you don't do the readings but go to class, you should be fine on the exams. Also, her exams are short essays. Jacki is really sweet and is willing to help out",1
All Im going to say is only the strong survive,1
"I took this class expecting for it to exhaust me through out the semester, but over time realized this is not as hard. As long as you take the time at least once a week to read the new modules, and study for the exams.",1
She is by far my favorite Professor. She answers all your questions and really cares for her students. She was very helpful if you don't pass then it's because you didn't try because she does everything she can to make sure you get an A.,1
"I learned a great deal about the history of African American slavery in her class. You must read (chapters aren't too long)to do well on her test, though she gives a review and complete the writing assignments.",1
He was a good teacher who had very clear lectures. And students were encouraged to ask questions,1
love this teacher if you need an astronomy lab take him..cares about your grades and is a real nice guy :) 2 thumbs up :),1
"Goldner is by far one of the best professors I've taken so far in the History department. He clearly know his subject and adds a great personality to lectures which keep you engaged which is important for a history course. He's somewhat strict about classroom etiquette, but I can respect that since it feels like he puts his energy into his lectures",1
Very sweet teacher that encourages debates and discussions. At first I wasnt interested in theology at all but Dr. V made it interesting and I want to minor in theology because of him now.,1
You must come to class! He takes attendance at random. His class is SO boring and all he does is show videos. I learned nothing in his class but passed with a A simply because he only had 2 finals and they were both take home essays.,0
I had him last Fall and he was a great guy to learn from.  I spent a lot of time after class looking into virtualization technology thanks to him.  (He's huge on it.) The tests were not the easiest but if you go to class and listen you'll do just fine.  It also helps to make sure you write in good English.  He's a stickler for that.,1
I have taken him for microbiology twice. He has improved so much. I was worried at first but i am so glad i took his class. He is a great guy! Show up to lecture and study. You will do fine.,1
"Highly recommend. She makes the class clear and cares about your success. Honestly, a super easy course if you can write a proper essay for the labs.",1
"BAD!!!! DO NOT TAKE HIM UNLESS YOU WANT TO FAIL he is really bad in teaching,lecturing,grading,assisting,communicating, just the WORST!",0
She failed to teach things well to the point I learned more about U.S history in my Africa class. She spent two whole days going over Indians in the new world and spent maybe five minutes on the American revolution. Her class is random crap she decides to talk about. She repeats things differently and goes too fast. Powerpoints were useless.,0
"I'm taking this class right now and I've never met a person as miserable as Ron Freda!!! everyone in the class is often confused about the material because we're too afraid to ask him a question with the fear of being ""chewed out"". He's so rude, if you ask him a question he speaks to you like you're literally nothing.  DO NOT TAKE HIM!!!  AVOID!!!",0
"The discussions portrayed as if they were easy until they were graded. Syllabus does not tell the full details of how she grades. You are not able to see your grades right away even on quizzes, so days after you find out if you passed or failed. The class may looked easy, but the grading is the worst part.",0
Great professor! Loves chemistry and is very helpful. She also has a good sense of humor. I definitely recommend going to class because chemistry can be a very hard subject.,1
"If youre okay with taking a class by a professor who is unorganized then this is the class for you. On the first day he didnt show up because he forgot he had a class. Hes VERY unorganized, and confusing. He gives out 3 different assignments every class, he does not explain what he wants you to do. He doesnt listen and is not very helpful at all.",0
"Excellent teacher but as everyone points out you have to work, so many essays but he is always available in his office or the writing center. Very organized but will tell you to go through extra steps when writing rough drafts.",1
"Best Prof I had so far. She will literally spoon feed everything you need to know, her PP and lectures are great. You can get an A in her class by just reading her PP and supplement, she goes over cases, but they are not on any tests. Its all black letter law... Very Thoro, even a take home essay...",1
Tests were fairly hard. She got a lot of problems wrong while teaching and would ask the students to check her. Would not take a class from her again!,0
"Don't take if you're not good at math. She doesn't teach. Her goal is to answer questions for 20 minutes then have you work with your peers to figure it out. She won't explain any concepts. You will learn by reading the book. She is soft spoken and will put you to sleep. No study guides cause that's ""baby sitting"". TOTAL MATH NIGHTMARE. BEWARE.",0
"Do not take this class if you don't like politics. He is very dry when giving the lecture as it is easy to fall asleep or not pay attention. His grading criteria is mostly based on tests which he makes extremely difficult. The exams are short answer, multiple choice and essay. He also hardly gives extra credit and doesn't care about his students",0
"Horrible! Gives out worksheets that don't make sense or missing information and don't realize it until someone points it out. Answers very vaguely or his answer isn't helpful at all. Very stressful to work with. Sometimes give you readings that barely if any, helps with the homework. He is the definition of why not everyone should not be a teacher.",0
"Easy to understand with an accent. kinda boring, will make you want to skip every once in a while.",1
Take this class and professor! Her class is easy and she is super nice. She is very helpful and seems to really want her students to succeed. The book you read in class is good and interesting too.,1
"Attendance is a must, but not mandatory. If you attend class, it's an easy A. If you need extra credit, he gave it out twice to those who attended class (before a holiday/break or when class was sparse). 2 papers, 3 exams and some section work. Overall good prof, just need to pay attention and ask questions if you get lost.",1
"This professor has been one of the greatest I have had when taking online courses. She has been very involved and very helpful. This class was definitely difficult in terms of trying to balance work and school, but it was the only class wheres I actually retained information. A lot of work, but Id take a class with her again!",1
"Professor Peng is a really caring person who accommodates students by giving extended due dates understanding that we have alot of stress at the moment with the pandemic and online schooling. Her course breakdown was a simple 2 case assignments, midterm and final. Powerpoint slides worked well with textbook so use the textbook for her class.",1
"SHE IS A CRAZY PROFESSOR, SHE THINK THAT  THE STUDENTS DOES NOT WORK SHE GIVES A LOT WORK TO DOING FOR EXAMPLE  TWO PAPER PER WEEK, PLEASE STUDENTS DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS IF DONT WANT BECOME A CRAZY STUDENT",0
I had Professor Bemisdarfer this past semester for CRE101. It was a great informative class. The material is good and I learned a lot. Professor Bemisdarfer was actively involved in the class and was a great experience. I would definitely recommend.,1
"Passionate about his subject, but lectures can be hard to follow. He tells stories with no relevance to the curriculum. What you read and what he lectures does not always equate to the same. To do well on his test, take notes on what he says in class and write that as your answer.",0
She is very accessable. Wiling to help anytime.,1
"I am confident in my belief that those who wrote negative reviews for Mrs. Liu did not apply themselves or pay attention in her class and then blamed her for their bad grades. Calculus is tough sometimes, but Mrs. Liu only tests you on the concepts that you should be an expert on, as long as you go to class.",1
"Very helpful with feedback. You do need to stay on top of the work for it to be a easy class,  but if you do you will pass. You also get out what you out in. Very understanding of outside issues if you must be late on an assignment.  Not a standard teacher with just standing there lecturing. Class participation is  vital",1
"I loved this professor!  Her lectures were well organized, the class was in-depth without being too complicated, and she used entertaining stories and analogies to relay the material.   Show up to class, do the homework, study for the exams, and it's an easy class to pass.  Plus, it was a lot of fun!  Highly recommend.",1
This man should do us all a favor and retire.  His class is hard and he rounds down instead of up for your final grade.  I should have got a 2.7 but he gave me a 2.6.  He is the type of professor that looks at teaching as only a job and takes no interest in the student.  The tax assignments were VERY time consuming and worth little points.,0
"Not a nice experience, she is very unpleasant and mean even to those people working very hard. You will regret taking her classes.",0
Lectures are very confusing and work can be hard to follow. I'd recommend taking Differential Equations with someone else.,0
the absolute worst professor i have ever had. DO NOT take this class if you aren't already good at economics because she is not going to teach you AT ALL. good luck if you're stuck with her.,0
"she's the bomb! she expect you to come prepared, she's clear with what she wants from you, and always willing to help. amazingly knowledge-able and talented as a teacher. also a really wonderful woman to get to know.",1
"PROFESSOR FARHAT IS TRULY THE BEST PROFESSOR YOU CAN EVER HAVE AT BERGEN! She is so understanding and tries to help you out in any way that she can! Not one lecture is boring, she makes them really fun actually, and her stories are really funny. You can relate to her so much, she is HILARIOUS! I recommend her 100% take her, you won't regret it!",1
"This class is all quizzes and tests. Horrible professor, constantly slandering students. You have to read the chapters and show up to class, to get a good grade.",0
She was a good instructor. I took her for chemistry 102.,1
Excellent Instructor. She is very caring and responds to email promptly. Communication is important. Make sure you do all your class participation and DQ's. Great class!!,1
"I enjoyed coming to class each day. The stuff you learn you can actually put to good use. We had 3 tests (lowestdropped) and a final (got review guides for each exam). He was very on top of current events. Did give 10 attendance assignments, but very hilarious so just come to class and you'll be fine. Responds quickly to emails. Take this class!",1
"What can I say, a lot of the students that he had in his class were people that were in there several times. And I see why - he is not clear nor is he very helpful. You have to have some idea of what you are doing in his class, or you will fail.",0
"Would HIGHLY advice that you take someone else. lectures were long, boring, repetitive,  and did not show some techniques to work on our writing. the grading on papers where heavily graded. he did let you rewrite the papers but it was only for ten ten extra points. if you need more English classes  for your major would suggest you go look elsewhere",0
Takes forever to grade things and takes FOREVER to respond to emails. The layout of the course is super confusing. I got an A from literally writing all the study guide on tiny index card for midterm and final. The rest of the stuff I did mostly copy pasted stuff on Google. Text is difficult to understand and totally useless. Don't take if you can.,0
He likes to edit things last minute which can create some anxiety. But he gives you a clear expectations and even has a test review day Before exams so youre able to prepare and he is very fair and lenient on grading I recommend this teacher,1
He's a funny guy! Though he does expect you to participate a lot in the class. His papers he assigns are fair. His class requires you to think a lot.  I definitely recommend this guy!,1
"Professor Yue is awesome! She pays attention to all her students and takes the time to understand us not only as students, but as individuals. My favorite part of learning in her class is how interesting she makes it (i.e. if we have trouble recognizing a character, she'll tell us a story to help us remember the character itself and its meaning).",1
"Having taken Professor Killough as an ""Introduction to Teaching as a Profession"" class, I do not think she is the right person to teach this class. Yes, she has many years of experience, but she does not teach teaching very well. Very unorganized. Very sarcastic. Rude. Gave a very negative outlook on teaching. Several students dropped bc of her.",0
"Really thick accent and at times hard to understand. Quizzes can be rough, but they were taken online so it makes it 10x easier. I got an A, but that's because I scored almost a perfect score on the final. You don't have to show up every single day, but you do need to come to class like 90% of the time. ",0
"Her lectures were dry and boring . As long as you show up and hand in the work you can get a solid B or A. She is a tough grader and gives a lot of handouts, fyi.",0
"Extremely rude, especially when you ask for help. Doesnt explain anything well. Doesnt allow enough time to complete the 2 part exams. Class is easy though, all the assignments come straight from the book.",0
"I'm convinced Professor Brannigan-Wisniewski wrote that comment on December 14th talking about a ""disgruntled"" student. Honey - face the reality of what the students are saying and get over it. We didn't enjoy your class and you clearly aren't the best at communications contrary to what your profession might state. Reflect on yourself! Disgusting",0
"I took his class in Spring semester . Just want to share my opinion for who want to take this class. If English is your second language and you are not VERY GOOD at Enlgish, want to get A with ENG1302, DON'T TAKE HIS CLASS. I had D grade with his class EVEN I finished all the essays in class and I have to take this class again.",0
"Prof Merkel is the best!! He is such a sweet, intelligent man. He knows his stuff and he expects you to know it as well - verbatim! If you can memorize, you can do well. Don't procrastinate, memorize early and you are golden. He will tell you EXACTLY what he wants. No excuse to fail! He will help in any way and evaluate practice exams!",1
His class is very difficult and was very frustrating. He assigns no homework or review. The only graded assignments are 4 essays and the final. You almost never receive feedback on assignments so it is impossible to know what you did wrong and how to improve at writing. Class started with 32 students. By finals only 7 showed up.,0
"Graded by 3 exams 50 q mc (but she said they're written response from now on due to online), ec quizzes, and tophat homework on 12 chapters. Can get off topic when talking but it's insightful to know so it doesn't bother me. Very passionate about teaching, strict about cheating so beware. She provides lecture videos and always answers emails.",1
"Mr. Wisla is a very educated man and knows what he is talking about but he should stick to working and not teaching students. His classes are dreadful and awkward, he does not teach enough in the time span of the class, he just says one thing and calls on half of the class to provide their opinion. It is not a class anyone looks forward to.",0
"Professor Soule is one of the best English teachers I have ever had. He gives great feedback on all papers and he's always willing to help. He requires a lot of writing to be completed in the semester. He's a tough grader, but he's fair. He really wants his students to succeed and thrive in his class.",1
Awesome professor!!. knowledgeable and caring.  Her teaching methods and working through problems in class made it easier to understand accounting. She is one of the best.,1
Great class. Homeworks are doable. Tests are tough too but not impossible. Attendance is mandatory. (part of participation grade) The material itself is interesting and challenging. You can reach him by email and he'll email you back soon.,1
"Dr. V is a very good teacher, she is always open to help if you don't understand things. Homework and quizzes are online and factor into your final grade. Study more than just the study guides given for exams and you will do very well. Do not skip class because you wont be able to get the powerpoint notes. I would definitely take her class again!",1
Extremely unclear about EVERYTHING. Doesn't let you pee during class. Reading/paper every night. Busy work assignments.,0
Really great professor! He tries his best to make lectures fun and interesting. His grading system is very fair and as long as you do all the work its a real easy A. He does his best to help you learn and to help you with anything you don't understand. Very relaxed guy.,1
"Newhouse is the most boring speaker I have ever encountered. Do yourself a favour and take the online INDG class for the 1000 level. Everyone is unorganised, assignments will say one thing but the syllabus says another. If they want people to continue in the indigenous studies stream, they should at least make this course enjoyable.",0
"Favorite professor. Took him my freshman year 8 am class. I thought I would dread going to an 8am class, but it was relaxing. Grades easily as long as you follow instructions and try your best. The quizzes are VERY easy as long as you memorize titles and pictures. I would HIGHLY recommend you to take him if you can :) it'll be worth it.",1
"Dr. Hill is a good lecturer and is very willing to help. His exams are somewhat difficult, and you will be graded on spelling and grammar. If you read the textbook, attend lectures to get the rest of the material, do the practice exams, and ask questions during the review session, then you should be able to pass the course. ",1
His teaching style is terrible.  Every time you ask a question he says you should have learned that in high school.  He goes out of his way to let you know that you are stupid.  If you love yourself you will not take this man for calculus.,0
This software class is very paper heavy. We take tests and quizzes using scan trons and do homework via paper labs. Also be prepared to keep track of your own grades because he never posts the grades online. He would give us our quizzes and tests back for a few minutes and then make us give them back to him. Good luck learning.,0
"DONT TAKE HER! She is such a hard grader. She is so anal about grammar & punctuation. She is not helpful, even when you email her for help. Her tests always have mistakes & she doesn't notice until we're taking the test. So many articles to read, so little time. She's not understanding. No late work accepted. She says u dont need the book.. U DO!!",0
very very helpful. gives every phone number possible out to students and u can reach her at anytime. gives you notes and goes over them in class. lots of hw but its so worth it. i learned so much from that class. she expects a-lot from her students but shes great,1
"Plain terrible. She's very knowledgeable about the topic but is next to terrible at explaining the material. She talks about her personal life way too much and goes on tangents about her life, rather than the topics we need to learn. Expects way too much out of a level 100 class.",0
There is NO structure to her teaching style whatsoever. She is extremely vague on assignments and gives out meaningless work that have absolutely nothing to do with the course (Midnight Robber). Also completely unprofessional in the classroom with all the unnecessary profanity she used. Ive had to shorten this as much as possible due to word limit,0
Best professor in the department. Never learned so much and had fun doing it. Really enjoyed going to class.,1
"His tests are tough, make sure you really study. His lectures contained a lot of material, and were live one day and recorded the other of the week. He took forever to respond to emails with questions. His weekly homework assignments were challenging. The lab reports are challenging, make sure you get a good group.",0
"If I had an accurate portrayal of what his class was really like, I never would've taken it in a million years. Don't expect to actually learn that much about epidemiology. This class had the potential to be awesome but fell totally flat because of the prof. Got an A but would never put myself through that again. His personality gave me gray hairs.",0
"Easily one of the worst instructors I have ever had. I had to learn everything out of the book. He would constantly make you feel embarrassed if you failed to grasp the material that he considered easy (outside of lecture he isn't as bad). His lectures were next to useless as his notation was hard to follow, and he spoke in a rambling sort of way.",0
"I would never take a class with Dr. Miura again. He took a long time to respond to emails and when he did they were not clear. His office hours were not helpful. He grades extremely hard and expects you to rewrite his definitions word for word on tests. If you do take him, try to get high grades on the homework, it's worth 25% of your grade.",0
"Great teacher, best one I've had so far. She's so sweet and very clear and specific during her lectures. They might be a little long but they're very helpful. Goes over what will be on tests and will help you whenever you need it! I would take her every year if I could!",1
"This is an Intro to Java class. Coming from not knowing any Java, I quite enjoyed it. She is usually late to class and it seems like there isn't any lesson plan she follows. Takes awhile for her to grade things. Codelab is a waste of time so just get the answers off the internet. Expect to spend a lot of time later in the term on assignments.",0
Stacy is an INCREDIBLE teacher!!,1
Worst teacher ever!! I did not learned a thing in his class and for that I suffered in my next English classes. If you want to learn DO NOT TAKE NORTON!,0
The greatest professor I have ever had.  He is fun and interesting and the only professor I have ever seen break into a Russian jig in the middle of class. He helped me to become a better student and tighten my writing. He is tough but it was all worth it. KQ is a great man and students shall consider themselves lucky to be graced by his presence!,1
I did not learn anything in this class. If theology is your major run. This class was hard for only being a core credit. He is a tough grader with no rewrites. He gives a paper and a final so prepare.,0
"By far the worst teacher I've ever had. She thinks she's a good teacher... but she's not. She begins every class by telling us we suck and that its our fault for not understanding the material. From a student that has attended every class, I can say shes terrible. Lot's of work, never a break. Maybe if this is your only class you can succeed.",0
Kildea is awesome. Makes class fun with really funny and witty comments. Always there to help you if you need anything. Doesn't require a textbook.,1
"Coop is a nice guy, but definitely the worst professor I have had. I currently have him for physics. It is not worth coming to class as he just rambles on and writes so small on the projector that it is impossible to read. I have never learned so little in a class. It's much more beneficial to spend class time studying on your own or with a tutor.",0
"Nelson is an outstanding teacher! She's a beautiful person, inside and out, and her goal is to help everyone understand the material/appreciate music. When giving examples of music terms, she either plays it on the piano or sings it quite well. Be sure to listen to the entire song in the listening homework, because she might trick you on the test.",1
Shes hilarious and her stories are great. Youll know whats expected and theres no random assignments. Everything is clear and she reminds you ahead of time. Only one research paper and few assignments.,1
"His class, tests, and quizzes are the definition of that one meme. Sally has four apples and gives one away.. calculate the mass of the sun.. like bruh Alot of college is self teaching/learning. But this class takes it to the next level. He lectures off slides with no additional context of HW problems. Very few examples and guidance given. avoid",0
Nice guy but not a good teacher. He did not reach me and didn't make an attempt to do so.,0
"I am a Semester 4 student of the paralegal education program and Ms. Pemberton is by far the very worst teacher at Humber College. She is very anal, she does not mark your valiant efforts well, and she is far too strict. Take another else for Criminal Summary Convictions and your grades will be great!",0
"He is AMAZING!! We only had 7 media critiques (at least 350words except for the last one which was 2-3pages), 7 quizzes and online participation on Yellowdig (commenting, posting, liking, etc). I wish I could have taken him in person. If you have a chance to take him, I HIGHLY recommend that you do!",1
"I took Chaloupka for Exercise Physiology LectureLab.  The lectures are necessary in order to pass the course.  Taking notes on the PowerPoint is really helpful because the lectures cover a lot of material.  He is willing to help with any questions, and will go over any topic that you do not understand. Great professo",1
"I had him for a visual concepts course and I swear that was a trial. He was so particular when grading but explained nothing when giving the assignment. It was so annoying. I almost wanted to quit the art program. I mean, I got a B. But no matter how much I pestered him I could never get a clear answer on how to get an A.",0
Brilliant guy.  Subtle sense of humor.  Absurdly knowledgeable in his field.,1
"This professor has been so great! She really cares! This class is online and asynchronous, a challenge, but this professor is the most available of any I have ever had! So many of my classmates are trying to cheat and are mad that they can't in this class. Very organized. Straightforward. I am studying and doing great!",1
"The midterm and final are extremely hard, also I took the hybrid course which is almost impossible. I recommend taking the actual lectures. ",0
"Very nice lady and can tell she is passionate about what she does, but does not communicate with the students well. She doesn't follow the syllabus and is scatter-brained. However, it is a somewhat-easy class and is an easy grader. She does boring lectures and if you hate group projects, you're gonna hate this class because it is nothing but that. ",0
Professor Wu is very knowledgeable and passionate about teaching his subjects. He makes sure that every students understand the concepts. He is always there to help when you ask for it. I learnt a lot from his class. If you make an effort to read his notes and do his assignments while listening to class  you will perform well.,1
"Doesn't care much for students teacher does not help those in need only the ""teachers pets"" wouldn't recommend taking ANY classes from her",0
He was great! Class was C++ online. We had to attend lecture virtually twice a week. He understood if you had to miss and had many resources including extra videos as well as recorded lectures on the topics being covered. Answered all questions asked and very helpful when students needed more help. One of the best professors I have had no doubt.,1
Goes super in-depth more than you need to know she thinks that we are all medical students,0
Zimmerman threw the syllabus out the door in the first couple of weeks of class. She would switch deadlines and move points around because she forgot to give us a midterm. This class was not made a priority. My advice: avoid her and this class at all costs during the rest of COVID. The only positive thing I can say is that she responds to emails.,0
He is your worst nightmare come alive in flesh and blood... enough said.,1
"The best nurse I have EVER met. NOT mean just HONEST!! AND a caring sweetheart! The first comment is TOTTALLY WRONG about her! She has the intelligence, experience, and dedication!! She may be at times serious in what she does because, HELLO NURSING IS SERIOUS! I have learned so much from her. YOU ARE THE BEST MS. S!! YOU WILL LEARN FROM HER!",1
"Hands down, one of the nicest professors I've had. She listens, understands, and wants to you to succeed. Her assignments are simple, but require effort. As long as you stay on top of it, you should be fine. Take this professor's class! You won't regret it!",1
Unorganized and no concept of time management - lost grade book for some of the semester - I never knew how I was doing during the semester.  I spent 1 5 weeks feeling frustrated and confused and bored.,0
"One of my favorite professors! She makes the dry materials interesting, very organized and super nice!",1
"I am thoroughly unsatisfied with instructor. If you do not attend you will not pass, and I mean she will make your life super difficult to learn or even attend her lectures. The classes are usually entertaining but I find I do not always learn what I need to in the time given due to long periods of non-related topics.",0
"Bartlett is my role model. His class is a different animal; nothing like any other class in DMSB. His style is unconventional, in the best way possible. In the beginning you will be intimidated by him. You will come to learn that he genuinely loves his students. Shaking his hand on the last day is extremely rewarding, to say the least. Take him.",1
She is very knowledgeable but her class is hard if you don't pay attention. Dr. Yamazaki seems like a kind professor. She goes by very fast when lecturing and her tests are very hard even if you study. Take this professor if you are willing to put in the work and like Biology. If you're just trying to fulfill the requirement try another professor.,1
"Good teacher, cares about his students, maybe to a fault actually because the tests were too easy and easiness doesn't always promote learning",1
"Great teacher! Works with everyone so no one is left behind, great notes. as long as you show up and do the homework. You'll pass her class!",1
The worst class I have ever taken.,0
"She said at the start the focus was on learning and not on stressing. Barely any homework and the homework that we had was fairly easy. She hates tests so we only had the required midterm and final which were also easy to pass. Otherwise, she was the nicest and coolest professor I've ever had. Definitely would recommend.",1
"Ah, he's okay. The lectures were rarely on topic honestly and the grading system was beyond annoying. He's not really even sure about assignments (all up to who you get as your TA) so he was pretty unhelpful and unapproachable overall. A good guy who cracked a few good jokes every now and then, but I avoided taking another history class by him.",0
"I really wanted to like this class because the material was so interesting. However, the professor was very unorganized, not posting assignments until the middle of the week that they were due and very unresponsive to emails. I wanted to be understanding due to the pandemic but people told me she's always been this unorganized.",0
"Maher has been great for me in both Mammalogy & Bio Stats. Very laid back teacher but at the same time he knows how to enforce his material properly. A lot of it is straight from the book so buying the required book(s) is highly advised. He has some good humor, is very approachable & good at answering questions. Would take again. -NL",1
"Don't waste your money or time, unless you can  teach yourself or have help at home. He doesn't answer your questions when being asked. The only thing I did like is that the test were the same as the  homework.",0
"First meeting she gave all the students attitude. Only did 1 review for the first exam and for the rest (including final) decided not to. We have to work around her schedule (she sleeps at 7 pm) and she lacks communication. If I didnt have any background knowledge of calc in high school, I wouldve failed this class. She doesnt teach at all",0
Where do I start!!! Lets just say hes super!,1
"Took his class in Spring 2020. His transition to go fully online was smooth. He truly wants to help students who need guidance or willing to put in consistent effort. He responds to email quickly & offers office time via phone. . For his papers and essays, follow EXACTLY the structure of the essay. Recommend: Grammarly to check for errors",1
Please do not take with him. he is the worst ever and ever. He does not know how to teach. he just copy powerpoint from another professor and show in the class. he does not even know whats in the powerpoint because that was other professor slide. worst worst worst. you will regrett after middle of the class. do not take with him.,0
Mrs. Palma is an excellent math instructor. She has good methods of doing math. She keeps you informed of how well you're doing in her class. I strongly recommend her!,1
"Took him during summer semester. There was a lot of readings, fill in the blank questions after reading chapter, assignments to make you understand what you learned. Wasn't tough on us. He did tell my class that he would usually have students take oral exams but luckily we didn't have them, could be different. Overall nice guy, expects a lot from u",1
"Would definitely not recommend her to anyone. She gives out a lot of assignments, papers every week, takes weeks to grade them, its November and none of my papers have been graded from the first month of school yet. She goes off-topic a lot, never responds to email, would never take this class again.",0
Bad communication skills,0
"Great professor. Keeps lectures entertaining with his dry sense of humor, and tests are very manageable. Highly recommend this class.",1
"Dr. Kalinowski encourages her class to perform well academically, but she's concerned with more than just grades. She cares about each of her students' ability to grasp, retain, and apply so that we can easily transition into a nursing career and be successful. Goes above and beyond for the students who reach out and makes a strong impact!",1
"Senora Sanchez truly is a nice lady. She really wants all her students to do well in the course and to learn something new. She's extremely passionate but can sometimes go off on tangents because of it. If you don't like having homework, don't take the class, she gives a lot of it but it's more so tedious than hard work.",1
"Prof made the class needlessly difficult. Started Summer A with about 200 students but by the 2-3 week half the class dropped because the exams were nothing that he told us it would be. Only saving grace is doing well in the lab. Prof was not very helpful, also seemed to get fed up when people asked too many questions.",0
Great teacher and helpful .... Take him.,1
"She was really funny and nice in class, but a super tough grader. If you didn't say something at least 3 times or more in class, then she would take points off your participation grade. Never could get full points on an assignment, she would always find something wrong with it.",0
"Overall a good prof, interesting class but he gets VERY sidetrack.  Really nice guy & he wants to know & help his students.  Don't be fooled by his cool attitude, he is a tough marker and he does expect quality work.  Attend classes and don't leave essays until last minute and you'll do great!",1
"DO NOT TAKE HIM FOR ANYTHING! YOU CAN NOT, I REPEAT, CAN NOT UNDERSTAND HIM, AND HE IS USELESS WITH COMMUNICATION. HORRIBLE GRADING, HORRIBLE SPEECH, HORRIBLE...HORRIBLE...OH YEAH....HORRIBLE.",0
"I enjoy music and everything about it, but it's difficult to be enthusiastic about music when Prof. Keister is lackluster and dull. Class was easy and so are the tests! Review lectures given and you should be golden.",0
"On the first day of class Mrs Shapero walked in with a matching exercise outfit and a recyclable Trader Joe's bag. I had a sinking feeling in my stomach, expecting her to be stuck up and lame. I couldn't have been more wrong. Mrs S is the least prejudiced, most helpful, most passionate, most authentic professor I have ever taken. Highly recommended",1
"Wont cancel class under the harsh virus, and being really mean. Class is boring",0
One of the best professor ever.  Very knowledgeable about various topics and enthusatic about what he teaches.  What a hottie!,1
"She's a great professor.  She teaches well.. quizzes aren't that bad but her exams aren't easy.. so you have to study your material really well.  But I recommend her if you want a nice, laid back teacher.  I wouldnt take Baccari or Cunningham... they are way too fast paced....",1
Grades more grammer and writing than content. would not recommend this particular professor.,0
Programming was fun.,1
Stay away from him. He cannot teach. I have had much better teaching from my High School teacher. His bedside manners are horrible. He will judge you and it is automatically assumed that the student is bad. Not true. Their entire department needs to be overhauled. I wish I had never come to SMU. They keep him so he can make you keep retaking $$$,0
Tests were almost nothing like material covered in lecture. He rarely went by the textbook and seemed very disorganized.  This class was unnecessarily difficult because of him.,0
24 CHAPTERS IN 3 MONTHS!!! ENDLESS READING AND GRADING MAKES 0 SENSE! CRAPPIEST TEACHER! She has an attitude for no reason. She does absolutely nothing for the class and you WILL have to teach yourself everything.,0
"Worst teacher ever! takes weeks and weeks to grade! SLOW to answer emails. Doesnt teach at all, and the sad part is: LoneStar college does not provide a choice. LoneStar college needs to fire her and get someone else to teach because she is useless!",0
Great professor and clear when he teaches. His tests can be tricky from what he has taught but it really enhances your learning. Don't give up because you will earn what you have worked for. Great guy overall,1
"One of the worst professors that have ever had. I was behind, due to a sudden shift in work scheduling  and contacted her through email. That vfery same day,  and requested to contact her at her office phone and that she was available until 9 that evening. It was 4 pm and I called after I saw the message,  called, and she never answered or emailed.",0
Proud is one of the best professors I had at SUNY Oswego. She is very passionate about social studies and that is shown though out her class. Miss her and wish I could take another class with her.,1
"If I could describe his class with one word, ""disorganized."" His scribbling on the board was hard to read and all over, making note taking a tedious and pointless process. Difficult to follow along in class. Not much notice was given on when tests, quizzes, and worksheets were to be assigned. Unless he changes his ways, avoid him if possible.",0
Completely worthless professor who does not know how to teach or keep his student's attention. Half the students are failing because he refuses to acknowledge his own errors. Grades specifically on grammar,0
"Martin's lectures are incredible. You can tell he enjoys teaching the subject. There will be many definitions and ideas that you need to be memorized, but there is always plenty of time to do so before any midterms. While in class, be sure to be avidly taking notes, as there isn't a book or overly helpful slides to review later.",1
He is a stickler about deadlines..,1
"Rammaha is an actual genius and for that reason, he shouldn't be teaching classes as basic as Calc II. I was fooled into taking the Honors section (DON'T) and as a result, he had high expectations; I used YouTube to study for the majority of the class because my notes made no sense from his lectures. I've never struggled with math until I had him.",0
She ROCKS!,1
Insightful,1
Throughout the course he provided many extra credit opportunities and the workload was not heavy. Their were 2 quizzes each week based off of the lecture and two essays topic of choice relating to class which was very easy. The exams were fair as well. Overall a wonderful teacher. Definitely recommend taking his class.,1
"You are not going to learn programming in his class. He only taught few algorithms but didn't do any coding in the class. Also, he only calls out girls names in class and make them solve the algorithms on board. He is unprofessional and his jokes are sometimes inappropriate. It's an easy A if you help him in his personal life problems.",0
"Went into the semester looking forward to having her as I've heard she was a great teacher. All she did for our class was powerpoint after powerpoint (and they are not posted online). She is very passive aggressive, and got angry when students would take notes on their laptops. Won't take another class from her.",0
"Mrs. Sundberg refused to accept my final paper, although it was complete in full, which granted me a 42% overall final grade.",0
"Professor Cox was born to be an Anthro professor. She truly encompasses what it means to be cultural relative. She has real world knowledge & always takes time to share this with her class. As complex as these times are, COVID , she still managed to nurture each of her students inquires & truly provide a great transition & educational continuity.",1
Her teaching style did not work for me,0
"Only take him Only if you absolutely DO NOT HAVE any other choice, if you do have  choices , please take somebody else. Stay away from this guy, he doesn't help at all.",0
"Lots of quizzes and homework, no final exam, just a big group project with 5-8 other people, she tries really hard to make it interesting but it just isn't and the concepts are just annoying to have to remember, we get a cheat sheet for exams and she grades attendance. Easy class but veryyyyy boring...",0
This professor was not helpful at all. Students would have questions but she would never fully answer them. She would not give me the grade I deserved after writing good feedback on my papers. Class time was a complete waste of time. I did not learn anything. I would not recommend for anyone.,0
"Absolutely amazing instructor! Her only goal is for you to become a nurse! She is real-world oriented. She wants her students to know what nursing in the real world is like, not just in the classroom. She is very talkative and hilarious.",1
"Gerard is a good professor, she knows a lot about HDFS and has her stuff together. This class is definitely one that you have to earn your grade in. She is a fair grader. The most important thing is to start your essay exams and FOO papers earlier than you think you should..but you should definitely TAKE GERARD! Everyone loves her.",1
Olga is a wonderful professor. She keeps everything concise and easily understandable. There are worksheets that need to be completed each week along with the chapter exams. She's very helpful when asking questions and she makes the flow of class go by properly and smoothly.,1
The last comment is totally not true and the most foolish thing I've ever heard.  Kristy invests herself in her subject matter and her students.  She is smart and creative and fun.,1
Do not take professor Ricar. This is not about art at all it is a history class. She gives tons of assignments per week that are graded purely on word count. She cares more that you address her by name and respond to her thoughts than she does about you understanding or doing well in the course. not worth it. do not take.,0
"Professor Cooper is absolutely amazing and I'm really happy I took this class with her! I'm not an art major so none of my projects were good, but Im still doing well in the class! One thing I don't like very much is that she picks favorites and doesn't pay much attention to anyone else. As someone who struggles she just walked by me a lot.",1
"Yea, shes funny alright! Hilarious Especially when your accused of cheating or doing something wrong during a practical that you NEVER DID! I received a C on my Practical when the person that went before me did terrible and got an A. She attacks beauty and will make you feel less of a person if you are beautiful with brains. Be cautious with her.",0
"For me personally, I came in already fascinated with the topic of French History & Culture so the class was pretty enjoyable. Sometimes the homework and tests could be a little too difficult and time-consuming though. I thought the end of the semester cooking project asked way too much for a Gen Ed course. But overall decent instructor.",1
"Honestly don't even know where to start with this guy. He's unorganized, rude, boring, and seems inadequate for the position. During lectures, you can't help but notice how it seems like he has not clue what he is talking about and that observation is proven when someone in the class asks him a question or to elaborate more. Stay away!",0
"I hated his teaching. Hate is a strong word, but that's why I used it. He once spent a whole class (1hr45min) talking about his office, ways to get to his office, and mistakes students make while navigating to his office. No powerpoint. No weight to his words. NEEDS improvement.",0
"Prof vraiment super ! Je l'ai présentement et wow ! Il ne fait définitivement pas l'unanimité, mais vierge facilement offensable, s'abstenir ! Un excellent motivateur, très exigent, mais également très reconiassant. Selon lui, il s'agit de sa dernière session, très décevant, car il était un très bon communicateur. 10/10 mon Decoste",1
Not a fan. Hartman doesn't really seem to care too much about her students unless you're a part of the English department. I've gotten attitude one too many times from her and I would not recommend her if you're a student who needs help outside of the class.,0
"I would recommend taking somebody else if possible.  She has a split personality.  One day she will be cool and other days she goes into full-blown psycho mode.  I am not kidding.    She doesn't allow students to use laptops or cellphones to take notes or look up stuff to help out.  If you take her, good luck.  You are entering a nightmare.",0
"Incredibly knowledgeable and smart, a practitioner within the field and has been published many times. You will learn from him, having said that... he is extremely condescending and sometimes is a bit sarcastic. He is intellectual and gets frustrated if you are not on the same level as him, he expects a lot from you but seldom gives feedback.",1
"This was a great class, I learned a lot and I know I will need it all in nursing school. One thing I liked was that she does the reviews throughout the class instead of just right before a test. That helped me because then I didn't put off studying.",1
His teaching style was exactly what I was looking for. I enjoyed his class and learned useful stuff.,1
"She is wonderful! You will learn a lot about public speaking. Really gives you an awareness of everything, big and small, that factors into a good speech; stuff you wouldn't even think of. Very supportive & fun to be around. Everyone in the class will learn each others names quickly, and it creates a really friendly and supportive environment.",1
"I took his online course. He never gave me my essay grades back, and every time I emailed him, he NEVER emailed me back. I got one email from him the entire class. H wasn't helpful at all, you pretty much had to be on his level to understand everything 10/10 would not recommend this teacher.",0
"Absolutly horrible. Moves way to fast, does not cover material in an understanding way. Pop quizes with no notice.",0
This was the most confusing class I have ever taken!  There was no syllabus and I was literally dumbfounded by us having to respond to ten posts!! I didn't really know what was going on half the time because of how the class was structured.  VERY CONFUSING!,0
"I took her for Social work with Individuals. She is a nice professor but doesnt not explain ANYTHING. She has a hard time getting her words accross because of the language barrier. Her ""quizes"" are hard. But besides all that she is a nice woman. You just have to make sure you know whats going on",0
He goes over the course too fast. He went over a semester worth of course within 2 months. All he did was review for the last month. so bascially skip class? you will not pass or you can just by hitting the books forever. ,0
"Chem is really hard at fe, but mitchell honestly makes it enjoyable, I took chem 1 with chamusco would never do that again, now took it with mitchell would honestly take His chem 2 class.... test are hard but he does care about his students so if you want to learn he will help you",1
"She is an amazing professor!!! Actually, my favorite professor out of the entire Biology department...she helped make Bio such an interesting field...as long as you are committed to work hard and study for her test, which are a breeze since everything in the sudy guide she gives is in the test.  Just do her work, there's plenty of extra credit!",1
"Best professor I've had here at St. Thomas! Really cares about all her students, super nice, easy, and makes class a lot of fun. I was hesitant to take it as an 8am but she made it go by fast and let us out 10 mins early each time (sometimes more if the weather is nice). Understands this is likely the last Spanish class needed for credit. Take her!",1
Best prof in GB,1
"Honestly Professor Schap is actually really enjoyable and can be funny in lecture. However, his material is very challenging and he grades tough. Every class will go 5 minutes over so be prepared for that if you have a class after. Additionally reading the text and doing the problem sets are a must to do well in the course.",0
Stein is undoubtedly a wizard and knows what he's talking about. He is super helpful if you actually put in the effort to ask for help one-on-one. Will make you seem like an idiot in front of class when you ask questions though. ALWAYS has office hours. Tests/quizzes a lot like old ones. Uses Course Reserves.,1
Compared to the other teachers in the department she is one of the toughest. She goes strictly by the book but also adds a lot of extra grades that aren't needed. I feel like I worked so hard and still don't even have the grade I want.,0
"Never showed up to class on time. Don't expect papers back for a long time. She's a complete mess. Super nice woman, but avoid at all costs.",0
You will be suffocated by work and consider changing your major many times. She takes a while to warm up to but believe that she cares about you and the field of education which is why she gives you work and is tough. One of the most influential courses I've ever taken and Dr. Jones is an amazing educator,1
"If grammar or spelling are a challenge for you, beware she will go after you 1-on-1 & in class. You HAVE to read!! You will not survive the blackboard post or class discussions without it. My class read 4 novel sized memoirs. You are graded super subjectively on ""if you are getting it"" & you are graded on two essays and BB posts. No tests/quizzes.",0
"The only way I passed this class was by getting a tutor and that is saying something because I've never needed a math tutor before.  He goes off-topic constantly and students at least once per lecture have to correct his math mistakes.  He is very lenient with giving partial credit, even so many people fail due to his confusing explanations.",0
This is a great class all you have to do is be involved and you will actually enjoy it and good results,1
Essex county college need to put this professor full time he's very good i did not like math before because of him i can say I'm very good at it . very best professor ever i will have A for math 100.,1
My favorite instructor! He's very approachable and will help you in any way.,1
Professor Wenstrom is a hard grader on written homework and unit exams when it comes to finals she changes the point value for each question but I struggle in her class with understanding the problem being asked on written homework and unit exams so I have to work with a tutor to help me fully comprehend the directions on homework assignments.,1
"This lady has no idea how to teach. She makes you put an absurd amount of work into her class and expects everyone to just know things without her telling us or to figure it out ourselves. Shes not the worst, but she wasnt my cup of tea",0
"Sullivan is very disorganized, things are often not graded on time and he takes a very long time to respond to e-mails, or just does not respond at all. Notes given in class are often very different from the things we are expected to read online and in the book and there is no correct way to prepare for the test, all of them have been different.",0
"If you write papers as you did back in middle school, you'll get good grades on the essay. What is meant by this is that if you write the thesis like you were taught in WRTG150, you will get a bad score.",0
"Great Teacher! he explains everything as clear as day. everything he discusses can be found in the book which makes the tests easy to write. he tells you what he expects from everyone at the beginning of the semester and it doesn't change. just do the work, pay attention, and take advantage of every free concert opportunity you can.",1
"James is an awesome teacher! I loved his class & his sense of humor. We learned a lot and he was very patient with our group. He's an amazing guitarist! Also, it's too bad he's married... Rawr! :)",1
She is nice but she is a harsh grader.,1
"He is by no means a bad prof, but I will never take him again if possible. He gives you all the exam questions before hand so as long as you study those you will be fine. Most of class is spent on tangents, and had to rush through most material because of it. Since attendance was mandatory this made coming to class difficult.",0
"Dr. SInha is a very nice lady, but her lectures are poorly organized. Not just her, but the prof she co-lectures with. The tests are similar to lecture, but you must read the book and truly study from the BIS labs to do well. She needs to work on organization and making points clearer. I don't recommend taking her class.",0
Over complicates simple concepts. Takes months to post his lecture notes on the online platform. Unorganized.,0
I enjoyed him!  He really gets you interested and thinking about topics.  Writing is hard in general so the class is not going to be easy! He tells you what needs to be improved.  I definately learned a lot from him and my last paper was perfect which was awesome!,1
Really cares about her students and wants you to do well.,1
don't take his class!!,0
He was really nice and cared about his students learing the material. He made learning astronomy fun/easy. Your grade is based on 5 attendance checks and 3 exams. All you have to do is memorize the answers since he gives you the questions that will be on each test. There's no homework and you don't need the textbook at all.,1
"A very big disappointment as someone who was suppose to ""educate me"". After receiving a 0 on a exam essay, I had put a lot of research and preparation into, I went to his office hours. He ""re-read"" my paper, told me it was well written and on topic and changed my grade to an 85. Leading me to believe he never actually read it while grading.",0
Arrogant.  Be prepared for a purely academic approach to Marketing.  No practical application from a prof with no real marketing experience outside of academia,0
Show up for class and study hard.,1
"Dr. Robichaux is absolutely amazing! Ive enjoyed her class since day one even through covid! Her test are straight from the slides, but you have to study. Its a lot of information, but she word the information in a way the students can understand.",1
She grades discussion question assign. (which are due once a week) with either a 0 or 100! nothing in between! so just beware! attendance is a must b/c she puts class notes on tests but role isnt taken.Its a LOT of reading too.,1
the only good thing about the whole school,1
BOOOOOOOOOOO. Bad professor. Makes a 100 level class way harder than it has to be and offers zero extra credit. If you want to get an A make sure you memorize the lectures and everything in each chapter as he will pull random questions from the book that were never covered. Only need a 50% to pass though if you're okay with a D.,0
"She is a lovely lady, but man does she grade hard. She took points off because I forgot to put the accent over the word résumé on my cover page. Other than her old style teaching ways, and can't get ahold of her by email she is alright.",0
This professor always likes to assign nonsense homework and make us read or watch nonsense movies. Always those few students make response in her class and her handwriting is really hard to recognize. But the good thing is no midterm or any quiz. All we have to do is a final paper.,0
"Professor Sullivan is a great teacher, but lectures can be confusing and boring. You have to read the books to understand the discussions. He gives mini quizzes on the readings which aren't too bad and often open for interpretation. Read the material and pay attention during lecturesdiscussions and you should be fine! ",1
"Took the class online, and was pretty difficult. (70% homework, 2 exams 15% each) Required a lot of reading and a lot of homework assignments. Still, Mr.Monnin assisted a lot in the challenging homework and even curved the grades. Overall, a good professor that is recommended.",1
I wish I had Zakar for all my classes. He was so nice and actually cared about his students outside of just school stuff. He is by far the most genuine professor I have had both at community college and SU.,1
"The instructor is passionate regarding the subject,but a little overboard in expectations for a basic class. His attitude that knowing what may be on an exam might cause one to focus on those points, rather than focus on the entire presentation suggests that the exams are based upon what he considers important,rather than on what one has learned.",0
"One of the most boring classes I have ever taken, I was really excited for this class just to catch myself falling asleep every single day. Attendance is super lenient but he makes it very hard to go to class. Zero group activities or any engaging in the classroom, I don't even know a single persons name in my class. Exam study guides are 10 pages.",0
"Mr. Luckett is passionate about Social Work and  truly wants his student to learn something.  Attendance matters and sometimes this counts for extra credit when you show up 100%. If you take detailed notes (especially during the text review day) there's no reason you can't pass.  Great teacher, I enjoyed his class. ",1
"The amount he expects you to read is unrealistic, impossible, and actually humorous. He is obsessed with reading competency, very odd . He sends a 3 page letter explaining why he is such a hard grader. I am bummed hes the only on I could take for this course. Awful..",0
Quizzes and exams are hard. All of the assignments are all rushed together. Most confusing class I have ever taken at UNA. ,0
Don't take her trust me you will regret it,0
try and avoid. doesn't respond to emails.,0
"Interesting guy with lots of great stories. He will tell you up front though that he is a TOUGH grader, which he is. He is unorganized with his lecturing and has very few grades. He will also take like 2 months to grade papers.",0
Probably the worst teacher ever.  There was no point to even goto class except on Friday's for the quizzes because all he did was read off the Power Point slides and then post them on Angel.  Tests were so long for 50 minutes.  What a dick.,0
"Nicholas Bahr is an excellent professor. My class was pretty small and he truly cared about his students. He let us choose between either exams or extra projects and the projects were very manageable. I had him for Brand Management and I learned a great deal in this class. For this class you could probably get by without the book, but I used it.",1
"AMAZING. very clear. reviews the basic so you aren't lost on the easy stuff. very straight forward, honest, and funny. haven't needed to go to office hours but i have a feeling they'd be very useful. let's us vote on which day we can't to take tests. quizzes normally 1-2 questions and very easy. no pop quizzes.",1
"Dr. Jaja is the most unaproachable person I have ever met, She would test us on things that we never learned, accused me of cheating when I asked her to fix my grades. Overall, rude and not nice.",0
Professor Scoville is a great man with a big heart. I would have enjoyed the class more if we didn't get stuck on the small things and focused more on the larger topics.,0
The class was really good. Just please make sure to log on to the website to know when your assignments are due. Write them down or something. The assignments were pretty easy to me & her videos literally show everything you need to do step by step. She responds to emails quickly & is an overall good professor!,1
"She is the best professor I have ever had - keeps you entertained and knows the subject well. I highly recommend her. Plus, her assignments are easy.",1
"Gives Good Notes, Lots of online Homework, Preclass quizzes also online. Tests and in class quizzes can be a little tough. Overall a good choice. I struggle in math and recieved a B.",1
"She can not teach, at all. She is horrible at running an online class. Her midterm was confusing and childish. The questions and possible answers made no sense. I only took this course because of my major. If I didn't have to there is a sure thing I would have NEVER taken this class. And I certainly wouldn't of taken a class with her teaching it.",0
"She gives prompts that are TOO vague. She made us write too many papers, and have graded only one. She dropped the rest because she thinks ""we going to work way more the second half of the semester."" She uses Grammarly for grading... gives us no help in our writing. I couldn't switch our of her class :( do NOT take her class.",0
"Took her course during some major holidays so grading took forever, but she did provide good feedback and ways to improve. Tough grader, really makes you work for your grade. I would take her again, but only if there were not better professors available.",1
What to say!! I don't know. Truely speaking he has no quality to teach in any north ametican universities. Don't take his courses in future.he has lot of things to learn specially how to behave with the students.,0
He genuinely cares for his students and wants nothing but the best for everyone.,1
"This was the worst professor I've ever had! not only is he completely unclear about his assignments but he has absolutely no regard for anyone's privacy and he will tell your business to the whole class. His grading scale is ridiculous and between his monotone lectures and his rambling on about unrelated topics, I found myself frustrated daily!",0
"She is a good teacher, but not an easy marker. however, if you follow the guideline in her assignments, you are more likely to get a good grade. Always try to revise your work to improve your grade.",1
"I absolutely love Prof Cutler. If you do take her class though, be ready to work for your grade. Attendance isn't mandatory but your grade will be MUCH higher than someone who skips if you go to all of the scheduled class sessions. She is very caring and I recommend having her as a professor. Highly recommend skimming lessons in book before class.",1
He is the BEST!!! TAKE HIM! SIMPLE! He makes Math easy and fun!!! Def recommend this guy.  Also hes crazy funny!,1
One of the best professors I've encountered. She is incredibly caring for her students and will provide you all the opportunities you need to pass her course!,1
She does not care if you go to her office hours and show that you are really trying in the class. I had what I thought was a good relationship with her and she still gave me a C. She screams in class a and you cant understand her that well at times. I would never take her again. DO NOT TAKE HER!!!,0
Interesting class! Awesome professor.,1
Took her for both CHM 090 and CHM 151 and she has been outstanding. She goes over the power points thoroughly and will stop for you to answer questions. and 99% of homework is optional so if you already understand the material you're free. She gives a study guide for all tests and final which are VERY useful and related! AWESOME TEACHER!,1
Best class I took all semester,1
"Unbelievably easy class. Good if you just need a class to pass easily; however, you will not leave the class with a clear understanding on the important subject of Sociology. Sweet lady.",1
"Avoid at all costs! Will tell you to do things one way and then mark you wrong for doing it. I had to turn in 2 homework assignments late because I was sick and he gave me zeroes on both of them because they were ""late"".",0
"Take this teacher! She is clear, funny, helpful, responds to emails, and wants students to do well. She is a very talented teacher. She does explain things REALLY fast which is good and bad. Good b/c it keeps you on your toes and bad if you are lost. Only down side is that she rushes you during exams-NOT ENOUGH TIME! FRUSTRATING!",1
"This class is easy as long as you stay caught up on all readings. He gives quizzes on random days and he assigns a reading every single time you meet in class. EXPECT TO READ (it's a literature class, duh). You must participate or else he will call you out and he will possibly mark you absent if you do not pay attention when he is talking.",1
"She is clear about the topic, but the homework is difficult. Gives a lot of homework. Is very strict on deadlines, and will not give a second opportunity. I have no desire to take her again. ",1
"He's a really nice guy and likes to have fun with the class, but he is a very strict grader and asks you to remember a ridiculous amount of detail",1
"Yes, he does have a lovely smile but he is a great professor period. Great lectures, knows how to keep you awake. Always available via email. On the final he brought us munchkins. Final was easy as well, multiple choice was simple if you studied it. Essay choices were what he said they would be. He's a fairly easy grader. Participate&do good papers",1
Legit don't go to her class all the lectures are online and the exams are easy.,1
"Julien for eon 102 was a waste of time. First and only live class was a disaster of random questions and him having no lecture plan. after the first week it was very unclear on what mindtap readings and assignments were to be done. Besides that first lecture he did not teach, only assignments and short videos which weren't super helpful.",0
"Dr. Carr (he received his doctorate in Fall 2020) is truly a leader of future leaders. His class is helpful on so many levels and can assist anyone. He makes you read for sure and there are many assignments to help reflect on yourself. He requires a lot and sets high expectations, but it only serves to help you. Dr. Carr is inspirational.",1
"When they said the best, i almost laughed. She was, at first, the nicest person ever. I started off stong, and she made me believed that i was doing excellent even at the end. Then when i received a NP i was shocked nun the least. The books were interesting and easy to follow. As a person, she is awesome... as a teacher,Never Again!!!!!!!!!!!",0
Volunteer class at art an camp. Taught kids basic Spanish. I learned no Spanish! Waste of my parents tuition money! Worst of all! EVERYTIME I SPOKE SPANISH TO THIS LADY SHE RESPONDED IN ENGLISH! What a shame! If she is so apathetic that she can't even try to further the ability of her students then she is in the wrong profession!,0
"He's really strict with attendance and being on time, so be careful with that. The assignments are 100% writing, and what he wants you to say isn't always obvious, but his office is always open for questions.",1
"If you struggle with math, try to avoid if possible. He is a very smart man, but skips a lot of mathematical steps  that you normally need to piece it all together.  You need to take the initiative and learn outside of class with his notes, textbook and tutors.  Tests are hard but fair. ",0
He is nice but not the most interesting person to learn from.,1
"Sara is a very nice person at heart, but as a teacher I think it is hard to have her. Her grading system is very confusing and doesn't allow for students to keep track, and she makes the class very lecture heavy, which often leads to boredom from students. There is definitely a way to make the class more interesting. Wonderful person, not teacher.",0
"I loved professor Lhota! She is so kind and helpful and is with you every step of the way. All you have to do to get an amazing grade in the class is to show up, do the work which is very easy. We had 3 essays all semester. The 3 essays are supposed t be 4 pages long but she believes in quality over quality. Overall an amazing Professor!",1
"Unorganized.  Late.  Makes unrealistic demands - she had to cancel projects and parts of projects because she doesn't know how to make a schedule for summer.  Makes her religious beliefs known, and she's judgmental.  Refuses to talk about controversial topics due to her own beliefs.  Must rely on book for info, attendance required.",0
"I don't like science but Mark List made it easy. You will need the textbook for the homework,he is pretty lenient of accepting late assignments & still gave full credit. The exams were easy as long as you review the clicker questions and there is at least 1 pic with terms on the exam. He also rounds up.",1
"I learned a lot, and my writing improved as well. However, u always have to try your hardest in that class, and it was challenging to me, even tho i often did well in English in HS. If u expect to get an easy A in this class, don't even bother taking this class tho. If u do wanna learn and improve, and are willing to do a lot more, then go for it.",1
"He uses a ""flipped classroom,"" so basically, you are paying $4,500 to teach yourself the entire course and then have him grade your tests. He has a thick accent so his lectures are a little difficult to understand, and they're SUPER boring, but he's a nice guy and will provide help if you need it.",0
"Took Intro Anthro for global awareness (GA) for core credit. Took her Monday night class. Reading assignment due every Monday and all the readings were over 25 pages of PDF documents, took forever to complete and she graded them tough. 3 essays which she wants done perfectly. And one final which covers the entire semester. No not recommend.",0
"She's pretty disorganized and not super interesting, but her class is easy to pass. The exams are way more involved (and graded harder) than you'd think, given how easy the day-to-day work is, so study hard for the midterm and final. Overall, don't love, but it's still a pretty easy class.",0
"She wasn't bad at all. My biggest issue is the homework. She will definitely assign homework at like 10:45 and ask it to be done the next day. Once she assigned it that morning. Personally, I think she expects too much during class but it works out in the final exams.",1
"This class is awesome! There are no tests and there is a speech assignment each week; he does not require the use of a textbook. DO NOT BE LATE, he is very straightforward and will call you out on it! I loved going to class because it was fun and the speeches we did were interesting. ",1
"Taking this class from Hansen will make all the difference. -Go to the lectures, all the test material is there and he doesn't upload slides -Offers good amount of extra credit -Lectures are eye-opening, interesting and funny -Makes it worth your time. Covers issues like child labor, civil rights and animal exploitation",1
"This class is ideal for people who are either majoring in Astronomy or have taken Basic Astronomy prior to entering. If this is not you, I don't recommend you take him. Tests are easy as long as you study everything. Beware of the HW - it's designed to trick you! My lowest scores were on the HW because they were ambigous/unclear.",1
"Professor Jassen is very nice and cares about her students. I have a strong science background so this class was easy for me, if you don't have one you will definitely need to study a ton! The class was more of an intro to anatomy and physiology and less of the cell bio I was hoping for, however I still enjoyed her class. Would highly recommend!",1
I personally hate this class. The layout of the class is Horrible.,0
"If you can avoid this professor, literally do it. Her online site is beyond convoluted and she doesn't make expectations clear. If you forget to turn something in, good luck. She also responds to emails in the rudest way. Seriously don't know how she got so many good reviews. Avoid, avoid, avoid!",0
Eileen is a phenomenal teacher! She knows her stuff and has a talent for picking the perfect song to complement your voice. I took lessons with her for 3 yrs and I went from so so to getting rave reviews on my singing. If you do not practice you're gonna get it when you see her and she will criticize you. She gives praise when praise is due. <3 her,1
"I love Karen, a really nice professor who tells you everything you need to know to do well in assignments and a genuinely engaging professor",1
"Alan Moss is a good professor. His AG101 course is super easy to pass because all you have to do is show up and do the in-class assignments to get an easy ten points. He posts all his lectures online which makes it really easy. There is 2 exams and a final, which are created by the students. Super easy class and easy going professor.",1
The last project for her is manditory attendence but evrthing else is optional she also does not put a lot of things online so make sure you are there to get them,1
Dr. Lin is one of the best professors at Emmanuel! Take every class that you can with her- she is awesome!,1
Okay let's begin. 1. She uploads the notes (if you're lucky... up to a week after they were covered in class) but without the pictures which she tests you on. 2. Not one soul on the planet can memorize every archaeological site in the world to put it on a map! 3. can't hear you! 4. memorize ALL of your notes for exams or you're screwed!!!!,0
"She is honestly the best stat professor. I was worried about math this semester but glad I took her class. The hw wasnt hard, the exams were similar to the study guides, and there were only 2 projects. 100% recommend.",1
"This professor is very condescending. Random pop quizzes, so beware! He speeds through lectures and doesn't really teach, so prepare to learn the material on your own. I do not recommend his lecture or his lab.",0
This guy is a total jerk. He's told me to my face that his priority is not to the students. Wonder why he's such a bad professor? You will learn nothing from this man. All he cares about is his precious research.,0
"I really enjoyed this class. It is an easy A but its also inspiring. She changed my outlook on a lot of things. Class is only discussions, a few papers, and quizzes (drops 2). Talk a lot in class and stop by her office hours and she'll love you. A lot of reading but totally doable. Best gened for this cluster!",1
If you're continuing with chemistry TAKE WENDY's CLASS!!! Her tests are SIGNIFICANTLY harder than any other prof's and they will whip you into shape and really force you to truly understand chemistry. If you're NOT continuing with chem; AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE her tests are so damn hard and if chem doesn't mean much to your program it's a GPA dropper,1
She is hands down one of the best teachers I have ever had. She can come off as intimidating but many of grew to see her as a mother figure. The writing assignments can be a little hard but if you can find a topic you are passionate about it all comes easy. Show effort! She will quickly get to know you. She cares about you and wants you to succeed.,1
"Very kind, very caring, very understanding. Im not the math type, but he helps, nevertheless",1
"Had Ams for Ochem 1 & 2. Ochem 1 wasn't bad but not as good as it could've been. Ochem  2 was a disaster b/c he stopped caring about the students and teaching after he received his tenure. There was not additional help outside of the lecture that left you confused and unprepared for test. If you want to get a good grade/learn ochem, don't take Ams",0
"She seems like a nice person during lecture, but I emailed her for help on something and she was so rude to me... I would think that someone who has dedicated her life to teaching would be a little nicer about doing her job.",0
Dr. Gordon is hilarious in a cynical sort of way. If he's feeling nice he gives bonus points! He tells you what the essay questions are on the test and lets you have a note card. He gives hints as to the multiple choice but make sure and study for those. Book quizzes are easy if you write down the points he gave. Can't use phones or computers.,1
"I love Professor Carson so much. I took him for ENGL 1101 and 1102 because he is so sweet and cares so much about your success. Lots of reading and quizzes on what you read but he always goes over EXACTLY what is on the quiz. His classes are small so he will know YOU, do not skip class. His humor is underappreciated. Easy in-class essays! TAKE HIM!",1
Grade is solely based on exams and pop quizzes. He will dock your grade after three absences from the class. Tons of reading but the exams and pop quizzes aren't too difficult as long as you do the readings and pay attention during class. Exams get easier through the semester as you go.,1
I love Professor Pham for Biostats! She mad the class easier to understand and had a lot of really help examples in class. She also has practice exams before our actual exams and she goes over them in detail. Definitely take her for Biostats!,1
The class is very interesting. Homework every week. 3 big exams. A lot of discussion questions related to current events.,1
"I do not recommend anyone to take him. It is so incredibly difficult to understand him. I have to rewatch the lectures multiple times, and sometimes I still don't understand what he is talking about. If you actually want to learn something, stay away from this prof. I dread attending the lectures, it irritates me that I am unable to learn anything.",0
Hard Tests. Rambling Lectures. READ THE BOOK.,0
"Get prepared to read a lot. The quizzes are really hard and he doesn't help you with your studying for your final exam.  Even if the class is online, I feel that his the kind of teacher that doesn't want his students to pass.",0
Her use of real life examples adds a level of humor and rememberable applications to topics. Going to class makes the topics stay in your brain.,1
"Unorganized. Assignments can be a moving target, meaning that requirements or expectations can and do change, without clearly setting expectations for everyone. She's knowledgeable but only somewhat helpful. Be sure to think about your question before you ask. she doesn't exactly hear the question you're really asking.",0
He is such an inspiration to us all. His sessions are fun and engaging. Knows a lot about the subject and always takes out time to help us.,1
He is a great professor and really makes your use your critical thinking skills. Do not take him if you just an an easy A.,1
"Hands down worst prof i've ever had, not sure how he has not been fired. Grades by his judgement, not what questions you answered correctly. Tests you on things he didn't even talk about, and are 10 pages in length. Best of Luck!!",0
very good teacher has good humor. does give alot of home work and strict on writing essays but is willing to work with you. to fail his class you must be an idiot. if you try you will pass.,1
"Professor Schubert is awesome! If you pay attention in class and do his assignments, you'll get an A.",1
I had him for the 260 classes and there were no reason why you shouldn't pass his classes. he goes over the examples in the book and I'm hoping to be able to get him for the 201 class he is that good of a teacher to me. He's understanding when it comes to the class and he always ready answer any questions you may have and hes funny as heck too!,1
She's too subjective. The course goes in circles and it's so theoretical it hurts. No substance. Unnecessarily tough grader. Take Brenner.,0
"she is literally the worst. rude to students, not understanding of why some stuff cannot be turned in on time, homework and what is due is usually very unclear, classes are boring and she reteaches things we learned in high school- i hated showing up and it ruined my entire day. save yourself",0
"way way way to much work. from one honors student to another, save yourself! besides being a tough grader and giving huge assignments, she is fairly nice and approachable ",1
"All AC 470 classes do the same tests, projects, and homework, but the professor makes the difference. She is AMAZING, and will make you fall in love with audit as well as herself. She tells inspirational stories about her life and Deloitte (she worked there!). Even if you hate accounting, she will make you want to go to class and be the best! ",1
I dropped the class on the first day because he doesn't let you wear a hat.,0
"I think Joe is either a love him or hate him kind of guy. I like him but as a teacher, he wasn't super helpful. I was always confused and didn't know how to do the work. It was a pretty easy class, but his teaching style just wasn't for me and my classmate. We switched at the semester point to a different professor. He is very nice though!",0
"The take-home quizes were based on the book, but attendance was still graded.  A sign that an instructor doesn't know what they're doing.  I dropped the class because I  got sick of extrapolating conclusions that weren't in the book.   If you're not learning anything, then why are you even here?  Seriously, no joke, don't take a class from her.",0
"Professor Lorentz is hilarious. His lectures make me laugh and they help me remember so much more. He makes everything in the class very interesting and explains things in detail. Show up to class, try to avoid taking a class that is more than an hour a day with him because you will get distracted from his lecture. Other than that, he is GREAT.",1
"Took CRJ711 in the fall. He teaches with Professor Horn and in total we had 4 papers. Three of those papers were 8 pages and the final paper was 10 pages. Two will be on corrections and two will be on policing topics and theory. Do the reading before class, they will throw pop quiz if not! Tough Grade on papers, Do blackboard discussions they count",1
"Wishing I was able to take Teachout. Dist. learning class is 100% w/ no textbook. WAAAYY too many lectures, articles to read, and a Mt. Everest size list of HW assignments (of which the ""lecture"" never prepares you for. On top of that, there is no zoom meetings and no consistent office hours. A plethora of discussions on top is an insult to injury.",0
"Great professor, would definitely take a class with her again!",1
"He was my reason to get up for my 8:30 classes. My only regret is not going to enough of his office hours :( Great prof, attended every lab and helped everyone, even if they didn't need help. Hopefully I have him again soon!!",1
"The most insulting aspect of this class was the fact she using cross-word puzzles.  My God, I thought I was back in elementary school again.   This is not a college-level instuctor and I will never take another class with her.  The Department of history has the best professor on campus and the worst.  Very sad.",0
"Funny professor,very kind, but being very strict with attendance.  Only lectures, no need for participation. Always write all important points and definitions on the blackboard, clearly and orderly. Quizzes and tests are usually about some items mentioned on the blackboard,  not difficult if you understand and  memorize them. Worth to try.  ",1
"Homework and in-class problems do not prepare you well for the quizzes and tests. Homework is ten times harder than anything you talk about in many cases, and I already took calculus and learned a lot of the information for the course in high school before coming to her class. Don't be afraid to ask others for help.",0
"Pire prof que j'ai jamais eu. Il donne 10% pour la présence au cours, 2 de manqués et c'est 0. 1er partie du cours est sensée être l'explication de la matière. Il explique aucunement la matière. 2eme partie exercices en équipe sur cette dite matière non expliquée et il ne répond pas aux questions. Votre manuel sera votre professeur !",0
"His tests are pretty difficult, but he is an amazing teacher and you will learn so much! He gives a lot of chances to help you raise your grades. The class is hard but an A is definitely possible if you try.",1
"Prof Schuster is the most interesting lecturer I have ever had the pleasure of listening to.  He does make you work for it, though. But he's always there to help. The papers are easy because you can turn in a rough draft to him and he will tell you what to fix. You have to memorize a lot for the exams, but I learned a lot by doing this. Got an A.",1
"MARK LIST IS AWESOME!!! For a subject I've always found to be completely dull, he made it the best possible. He runs a very interactive class. There's a lot of group work, and he's always nearby to help. There aren't very many homework assignments or projects, but you definitely want to be in class for the classwork and to prep for exams.",1
"Can't use computers during class, very hard grader on papers. Lectures teach you nothing so you'll learn the final material on your own",0
Super nice guy and not a harsh grader! His class is super straightforward and if you pay attention the tests and quizzes aren't hard.,1
"He will not, ""he will not..."" round your 69.15% to a 70.00% even if you are were close in passing the class. Find other Professor that is more considerate. He will not answer your email or ""will just say grades will be out soon!"" You been warned to not take any of his classes. Dont say you never read this... good luck finding a better professor.",0
"Spectacular prof. He will definitely wake you up at 8.30. I'm not into accounting at all (econ. major), but I loved his class. The homework assignments aren't that tough, he's often in his office, and has very interesting case studies in the wake of corp. scandals. Grading is fair (emphasis on tests). I want Thibodeau as a motivational coach.",1
SHE IS THE BEST!!!!! she is very great!!!! when i was about to fail she told me what all i can do in her class to get my Grads up and inspired me to do BETTER in my studies! Great teacher hands down!!,1
"I'm in love with this teacher and wish he would ask me to marry him. He is an amazing teacher and is extremely smart. He will answer any questions you ask him, and he doesn't sugar-coat the facts.",1
"Expect to have to teach yourself absolutely everything on your own time, which is extra difficult because everything you research will be in a different (and more standardized and sensible format) than what she teaches. I have yet to meet a single person who thinks she is good at teaching material. Tests and quizzes are also obscenely difficult.",0
"BEST PROFESSOR!!. learned a lot from him. he teaches evening class, 6 to 8:45. you should definitely take him. cared a lot about his students. No difficulty at all. highly recommend.",1
"Started this 8 wk class with her, ended up dropping to take with a different teacher in 16 wk format. She is a tough grader, both tests & quizzes are pretty difficult, but doable if you read. There is a TON of reading, but not many assignments. She's willing to help, but overall tough.  She's okay to take but go w/ someone else if possible.",0
"Professor Olson is very passionate &loves her subject, Anthropology. Even taking an online class, it shows through! Get ready to read long chapters & tackle difficult subject matter. Quizes are open book, but tough as they focus on obscure questions that you have to dig for. You will write & post papers & discussion Board. Still, great class!",1
"Very interesting class. Dr. Clementz is funny and always willing to go back over unclear material. Tests are very tricky though and require a lot of studying and reading from the book. If you're willing to put in the work, it's worth it.",1
"We're taking an online program called ReadingPlus and its the WORST. I get it done, but I dont learn anything from it. Has nothing to do with reading really. It FORCES us to speed read. we should be able to read at our own pace. And forces us to advance when we're not ready. The whole program feels like a video game. Horrible program.",0
"I love Professor Lusk! While her classes tend to be pretty lecture heavy, I generally don't get bored listening to her. Her lectures are honestly quite thought provoking and interesting. She tells stories that make her lessons pretty applicable. Don't skip her class, I relied a lot on what I learned in class for tests. Also she grades pretty easy.",1
"Easy class, but boring. It's basically more detailed Linear Algebra 1. Attendance is required but you won't really learn in class since he goes over alot of irrelevant topics. The tests are take home and you have a whole week to work on them. 40% of the grade is attendance+hw and he gives you a 100 as long as you put in some effort. Def recommend",1
"To respond to the person on the bottom, he does give 90  if you do the work well and ask him for advice. But overall Mr. November is a spectacular teacher, he showed me a new way of writing essays.  Tip: Always come to class, he gives you credit for that.  Ask for advice on your essays, if you want higher grade.",1
"I learned so much from Professor Currys class. Readings can be dense, and there is a quiz almost every class. Discussions are engaging, and help to clarify the readings. Be sure to brush up on your grammar before taking her classmost points lost will be from poor grammar on essays. I dont think she gives A+s. I had 97.9% and got an A.",1
"Dr. Costanza is TRUSWORTHY Professor. He is God fearing, and even if you were an Atheist, he welcomed you. He was not biased at all. He did it by the book, if you get an A in his course then you must deserve it. He is very polite, understanding and he cared about his students. There was no such thing as ""an easy A"". ",1
Take literally anyone else. Chemistry is a strong subject of mine and I am struggling to do well in this class. Get a tutor if you wind up with Brown because he does not teach what's on the test. We spent 2 lectures on a chapter that was supposedly on a test just to find out on the test that it didn't matter. Do not take Dr. Brown,0
There were a lot of test which is good but they were a lot of questions and people were often rushed. His grading policy is really harsh and the quizzes are due at weird times. Hes really funny but gets upset when people ask questions. Not very helpful if you dont understand the information,1
She is the best Anatomy teacher I have had. Test are not to bad. I think we had 4-5 Test. She prints out notes that go along with the lectures powerpoint. Give you a break in the middle of class. Def would recommend having her!,1
"Dr. LaPresto is an excellent educator.  While she does demand a lot of students, she's also very fun and truly cares about student perfomance and academic life in general.",1
She has a poor attitude towards her students. I felt as though I was a burden in her class. There was a lack of time management throughout this course. She tried to cram ten chapters into the last two weeks of class.,0
Waste of time to go to class. He just rants about non-relevant topics that are fairly self explanatory. He doesn't actually seem to understand to what he's teaching. It was the worst class I've ever taken.,0
"Terrible prof and crazy hard class. I did not pass with Georgi as my prof, I have retaken the course and got an 81%. The difference was that Georgi is not a good professor at all. Hard to understand, rushes through material, poorly answers questions. He is no doubt a very smart man but not one that is good at teaching others. Avoid this professor!",0
"If you do not like writing papers do not take this class. His finals consists of hand written essays on multiple topics, as well as a case study and a large practical. I personally did not enjoy his class but I know others who did. He makes his lectures fun and keeps them lively but this class was very tough learn so much in a short period of time",0
I had him for honors core and I absolutely loved him. He was so precious and he wasn't too harsh grading wise. I got an A on pretty much everything I turned in and it was not that difficult. Not to mention he might be the cutest professor I've had so far. I loved him!,1
"She is very strict with attendance, hates people arriving late and if you skip class you will probably fail. There are a lot of discussions posts in her class. She is not nice with her students and her class can get boring, the only thing I liked about her class was hearing everyone's speeches.",0
"By far the sweetest woman I've met here, absolutely love her class",1
"Not an easy class, material is very boring, lectures are very boring and hard to stay awak during, however Zengdao is a nice guy and is helpful and wants students to do well in his class",1
"Great professor. About 8-9 homeworks. You get 3 tries, though. Takes attendance. One midterm and one group project. DON'T CHEAT, YOU WILL GET 0. Ask questions in classes, he will answer!",1
Amazing teacher. Made learning fun and very helpful,1
"Honestly Hill wasn't as bad as I thought he would be. He's a fine lecturer for the course, and as with any bio exam, gotta work for the grade but they're fair and still not as bad as the exams you'll get for genetics. His Q&A sessions are extremely helpful too. I did get a C though, but that's only because of my disinterest in ecology in general.",1
"At first was very interested in the topic at hand, Feminist Anthropology. But my interests quickly dropped due to the lack of direction and off topic rants. Horrible at returning assignments on time! I do not recommend this prof. Gave her two chances and that was more than enough. Not worth the money.",0
Very poor communication. He doesn't even seem to care about what you learn or that your learn.  Web based learning is bad enough in Accounting but to have a teacher that doesn't communicate and help you out before the tests - makes things even worse.  I feel I have self taught what little I am taking away from this particular class.,0
"Dr. Knight is the most fantastic professor, he's passionate about his students and his work and it's so visible through how he teaches. He wants everyone to understand what he's teaching so he makes sure to keep things simple. His teaching method is effective though, I've left every class I've taken with him with such greater understandings.",1
"This teacher is very passionate about his class. However, he is extremely unorganized and does a poor job at keeping your attention during class. He goes off about things that are irrelevant of the lecture. I would NOT recommend taking him for government",0
"She rambles on for way too long about nothing, barely relates it to a topic to write about. EGUMPP is stupidly long and tedious and you do it again in 111 which she teaches. She also pats herself on the back often, she says ""I'm a great editor"" about 5 times a class, and hands out papers saying to bring them back for next class but we don't use it.",0
Dr. Crawley is a great guy and professor but at times goes off topic during lectures which makes them hard to follow. You are expected to read the assigned pages from the textbook prior to class and will have a quiz on the readings every class. This does help retain the material and assure that you are keeping up to pace. Don't miss class!,1
Worst teacher ever. I do not recommend.,0
"Class is very disorganized so you might as well just throw your syllabus out now.  I really felt like I was in high school and I think my Spanish got worse.  Prof. Sanchez is a nice person, but I'm not sure she knows how to teach or really knows what she's doing.  She's tough on grading the online tests.  I would take someone else.",1
"A huge wieny. She made my life miserable. Her class policies suck and she is not understanding at all. I hated attending class and she barely even taught anything. She was rude, ignorant and did not even offer to help when my grade was failing. Never take her. It will be the worst decision you have ever made",0
"She is a good teacher overall, but when it comes to asking for help she's useless. She tells the class not to bother coming to her for help over the weekend if something is due later in the week. Also, she thinks if you say that you cant understand a TA, that you're discriminitory and refuse to answer your question",1
For someone who always taught online you would think she would be good but this was ridiculous,0
"I don't recommend this teacher to anyone,  and most of the readings and assignments didn't pertain to English.  She grades harshly on essays and doesn't except late work.",0
"Not the worst teacher in the world, at least compared to what I've heard about last semesters. But holy cow I don't understand the point of this class, everything he's gone over has already been taught in previous CS classes, so you just sit there while he over explains things that other teachers taught in four minutes that takes him an hour.",0
"If you get easily distracted don't take him, the class is extensive and it can be stressful, gives a test after completing 4 chapters. Makes things harder than what it seems. No participation is required at all. You just have to go to class and listen to him talk.",0
Horrible teacher! Don't know why csun hired this man! Gave us 2 midterms one we never got back to see our score! He then never graded our homework! His lectures he gets from another teacher and takes an 1:15 to do one problem! Sucks at calculus and screws up every problem he does! Your process may be right but he won't give you any partial credit,0
Mr. P is a great teacher who made english fun and was extremely helpful. He used blackboard for weekly discussions & an online program to assist with writing. You only write 4 or 5 papers which can be rewritten for better grade. Definitely take if you can!,1
Lisa was a delight! Be prepared to write lots of papers and or speeches.,1
"class is boring, but if you do the work and study you should get an A",1
She is extremely unclear with what she wants for assignments and papers. She is all over the place! She likes to shut down student's ideas. She is easy but not the type of quality teacher I prefer.,0
"Maureen occasionally just won't show up to class, because  she over slept or wasn't feeling well. She is also often late. She took over a month to mark our first essays , giving us only less than a week to write and second and third final essay. She failed over half the class on the first essay. Her weekly quizzes are almost impossible & take 2hrs",0
"Professor Zaitsev is the best! I really enjoyed lectures and lab with him on Sunday mornings, the lessons were never dreary and he was very interesting and engaging. He truly knows his stuff. He gives 4 exams(including the final) and drops the lowest grade.  And his book on Amazon makes it extremely easy to follow his lectures.",1
"Nice guy, wants to do examples but gets sidetracked and forgets to finish example. His test are dialed down from material covered.  Overall, class is bs and shouldn't be required to graduate!!",0
"Class was very boring for me, but Mrs. Krafcik is very helpful and knows what she is talking about. Reading quizzes are EXTREMELY easy! You have to do an oral presentation with a powerpoint with it's very easy. Paper assignments are very easy and leave you a lot of room to work with. Just make sure you go to class everyday (she takes roll).",1
Worse professor EVER! He expects you to know everything & can be rude & sarcastic to students. He was also barely ever willing to explain things. His tests are 80-100 questions & spent class talking about Connecticut & all the trainings he attends,0
"She has been by far the greatest english professors I've ever had. She so kind and helpful. You'll learn really cool things in her class. I was very disappointed when I found out she wasn't teaching 93. If she taught a higher level of English like 96,1a, or 1b, I would take her in a heartbeat.",1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! She has a complete disregard for students that have questions, or do not understand what she is saying. She jumps all over the board without explanation. If this is your Major you might be okay. My favorite comment from her ""You already know this."" Everyone has done this before. When we tell we haven't she skips it.",0
Awesome teacher! I used to struggle a lot in math and in his class right now I have an A+. I would definitely take his class if you struggle in math he is so nice and won't hesitate to go over something you don't understand.,1
Gets a bit off task sometimes but the class was still enjoyable. Class conversations were always interesting.,0
"she knows what she is doing, one of the best. she is too good to teach there.",1
Mrs.Schultz is very hard core about making sure you do what she assigned you. Hard to understand at times. But overall good teacher.,0
"He barely knows what he is doing, he jumps all over the place. He has this ridiculous essay with three different stages.",0
great Instructor I got the opportunity to work for a non- profit organization. He is awesome.,1
Amazing professor. Would take his class again.,1
Strictest teacher I've ever met. Her rules are insane for lab she will kick students out of lab for wearing ankle socks! She also never posts grades so it makes it hard to tell how well your doing in lab. She also doesn't teach how to do any of the calculations or go over parts of the lab before you do it so your left to your own devices.,0
Great teacher. Interesting. Very nice person. Made class easy to attend because it was not boring.,1
"If you want to get an F take his class, Prof. Dhan makes you read a lot if you want to pass. If it's your first time taking physics at college you won't pass. IF YOU DONT SHOW UP YOU WONT PASS. I tried so hard to pass but I couldn't.",0
"Unless you really know java REALLY well I suggest you stay away from his data structures class. Hard to understand also, when you ask for help most of the time he just repeats himself and talks in circles.",0
Good teacher. Be ready to read BEFORE going into class or you might be awaken with a surprise that you will not like. He gives extra credit and will help you along the way in this class.,1
"He is a complete waste of space what you learn in class does not pertain to the tests, which are based completely off the book. He spends most of his time rambling about nothing and I would have been better off taking a REAL programming class.",0
"Brace seems nice at first look, but she's not as cute as she appears. Her lectures are VERY boring, and she never comes to class prepared. She wings half the things she says most of the time. Grading wise, it's confusing. One paper she could be an easy marker, the next it seems like she didn't even read it.",0
"Class has proctored pre and post-class quizzes. The exams are next to impossible. These exams are a majority of your grade, the final is worth 30%. A little bit of the information is in the book or in his powerpoints. Studied for a week and still barely passed an exam. Knowledgeable guy but awful professor. Take a different science to fill a prereq",0
"Sara is AMAZING!!  Her Intro to Social Work Class is extremely interesting and she asks review out of the exam, itself!  Brought us breakfast a couple of times, too.  She is a sweetheart.  You have to TRY to fail the course or get a bad grade.  I got an A+.  Make sure you get your volunteer hours in, though.",1
Hes mean makes you feel dumb if you answer questions wrong or if you ask a question. Do nit take his class,0
"Worst professor ever. Doesnt give good direction and even when the whole class doesnt understand instruction, she does nothing to help. If she is unsatisfied with your work, you are only able to receive half credit because it wasnt revised by the due date. So its not even worth it. Would not recommend.",0
Today was my first class with him and he very passionate on what he is teaching to students. He is a Sergeant after all! Already I can tell he truly cares about his students and will be there for you if you have any questions or concerns. Excited to be taking this class I know it'll be great! And no the textbook isn't required!!!!,0
"Brian is awesome! He really makes you feel comfortable in the class, so your never have a problem asking him about anything. Great guy who really knows his stuff.",1
"Professor Alemayhu is fair, but sometimes you mostly have to ask him to explain assignments clearly. He does care and wants everyone to pass his class, just do the lab exercises and you will do well.",1
"Yonn is not only a lovely guy, but also a scholar and an intellectual. The subject matter is always interesting, and his entertaining lectures and fun personality make it all the better. You'll likely have a couple research-oriented papers and a couple quizzes/exams, and that's it. So be sure to do the work and study for tests, and you'll do well.",1
"If math isnt your strongest subject, please avoid taking her. She is very inpatient, impolite, and very short worded. She also gives lots of homework most of it is hand written homework. She teaches very fast and goes off of the book. Makes you feel very unintelligent when you ask a question. I ended up dropping the class because of it.",0
Be ready to watch a lot of Youtube Accounting videos.,0
Easy is the word.,0
"This professor is an absolute trip. If you have a question regarding anything and you e-mail her one week in advance, she will say I never saw the e-mail. The weekly homework were mostly essays that had to be cited in APA . She is easily the toughest grader in the dept. If you have the option, please save yourself and your GPA to not take the class",0
"Took his online class, a lot of work get ready to work and be committed to this class. A lot of reading, discussions and quizzes. He is a tough grader and I highly recommend you do not take him. The online class was very heavy and sometimes mis leading.",0
"Let me preface this by saying I majored in Math and have gotten A's on all previously math classes. I took his Calculus III online math class in 8 weeks, and it is downright impossible. His ""notes"" is just copy/paste from the textbook, and that's it. It really seems he has no idea about Calc III, and conversely, his students have no idea either.",0
"His lectures were based on the book but he also did many problems from outside sources that were relevant to the lecture. I had to put in a lot of work as the class was mostly proof writing and I had never done proofs before. On the plus side, he is a very easy grader. There were times I got problems wrong and he would take off maybe a point.",1
Literally the worst professor I have ever encountered. Answers no questions and is beyond rude. Would recommend anyone other than her.,0
SHE DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AT ALL. REFUSES TO HELP STRUGGLING STUDENTS. AVOID AT ALL COSTS,0
"Professor Condray is amazing! She is clear about the notes, she is always there for you when you need her and she gives you the notes all you have to do is study!  ",1
"Great professor, very helpful and gives very clear assignments, with due dates always posted at the beginning of the week, so you always know when something is due. Textbook is NEEDED! Only con is he takes forever to grade papers so it takes 2-3 weeks till you get your results.... However he replies really fast to emails, and very helpful!",1
His lectures are slow but they are easy to understand. The tests are also not very difficult as long as you remembered what you did for the homework assignments and memorized every single definition taught in class. People typically struggle on the first test but it only counts as 15%. He also lets people do homework in groups which is very useful.,1
"Lots and lots of reading. You have a quiz, DB with 1 response and a web assignment for each chapter and then a final quiz at the end. The assignments were not hard. Only downside is it takes forever for DB and Web assignments to be graded. Link to book is included so don't purchase one!",1
Prof. Ulrich is the best professor I have ever had. She shows such a sincere interest in student progress and it is clear she is extremely knowledgeable. She is a great person who makes students want to be better and strive for excellence. If you are willing to put in the work you will be rewarded with an amazing knowledge of human physiology 10/10,1
"Thompson is easily one of the worst professors I’ve had during my time at LCC. Her lectures are pointless. I ended up having to teach myself. The class itself isn’t hard, but it is not worth it having to put up with her for an entire semester. If you need a social science credit, I recommend you take anything else but this.",0
"I'm not sure why Prof Farris has such negative reviews! Although I am taking this course online this semester, he has been working well with the students during the transition. This class is not an easy subject, so of course it is going to be more difficult. I think he explains things well and provides additional materials for studying if necessary",1
"I honestly hope you don't get this professor. She's very unclear with her instructions and will assume you're not ready for this class if you're not a strong writer. She grades very harshly, and won't grade your work if she thinks it looks incomplete. If you get her spend time at the writing center and do what ever you can to be on her good side:)",0
"Assignments were marked unfairly, the midterms and finals are extremely hard. The prof is overall a nice guy but the class is definitely not something anyone at york should ever take.",0
Great teacher! Fun labs! Tough exams though but he gave grades generously. Pay attention to what he says you will be fine!,1
"Needs to get a grip, he can deride his students when they don't understand a subject immediately. Goes off on irrelevant tangents, wasting our time. Needs to use better short forms for words he writes on the board.",0
"You feel like you are in elementary school (color coded groups...etc.) bad first impression, yet she expects high quailty work! Lots of HW online. (time consuming)!!! I studied all the time and would do terrible on tests.  She did offer EC towards the end of sem though.  If you like to teach yourself take this class!!",0
"Wasn't as easy as I expected. The most challenging thing about his course is that he has been recycling material for over a decade now. The lectures, homework's, and projects are vague. At times he can be very rude, and at times he can be helpful. Be sure not to put off the projects until finals week. No late penalty for submitting late homework.",0
"The majority of the class is taught from PowerPoint slides and she basically just underlines the information, so you're forced to teach yourself. Her tests are unreasonable, because she kills you with multiple choice and T/F questions that are worth about 40% of the test grade and are very tricky. Avoid Her!",0
Great teacher. The work is a little difficult as there are many essays to write but colleen is fair and easy to communicate with,1
EXCELLENT!,1
"Easy class, but he is rude to students. Doesn't answer questions well, and is very short with students. If you are confused, good luck.",0
"Fantastic professor, really enjoyed showing up to lectures every day because he was very excited about what he had to say and his enthusiasm was very infectious. Felt that I became more interested in the subject following his class. Very heartfelt, personable guy.",1
"Ins. Warden was very irrational when it came to grading. If you make a single mistake on one of your sources, you instantly drop to a 60 and then she grades it from there. Her assignments are very vague and she is very close minded to things she does not understand. Still made an A, but would not wish this class on anyone.",0
"Stan can be very rude to his students at times (calling some of his sections idiots) and can be very discouraging. I have taken his class in person and online and I don't recommend either. He doesn't believe in review classes or showing how he got an answer, he just tells you if you are wrong (which isn't helpful at all)",0
Do not take his class. Avoid it at all costs. The MLSC actually has their own sections just for students in his class because of how hard he is. He's different from every other professor at OSU in terms of homework and tests. Homework is very tough and grades it hard. Also tons of pop quizzes and a quiz in the first week worth 9% of the class.,0
"I'm a good student and her test are hard. If u know how to take a test then take her, cause she does not test if you know the material or not. You have in class group assignments every day and you have to go to her class. She also has a thing about being tardy.",0
I took this class online during the pandemic and she made the process so easy! She made all assignments due at the end of the semester and gave multiple attempts for assignments. She also squeezed me into her class last minute so she was definitely super caring and always willing to help. Just get your work done and its an easy A mostly.,1
"He was confused, I was confused, everyone's confused.",0
"DO NOT TAKE HIM! I am warning you!!! He is the worst... seriously... save yourself, your GPA, your money, and your time!!!!!!!",0
Professor Fowler is a great math teacher and the best for MA132 at Clarkson.  She knows her material and presents it in an easy to learn manner.  Her class sizes are small so sign up early.,1
He is the best! Taken him for multiple classes and I would highly recommend him. He listens to the needs of the class and is really accommodating if you have issues with course content or deadlines. He's highly approachable and very knowledgable in what he teaches. ,1
"He does not know how to teach. His classes consist of reading off power points with minimal information. He will ask if you have questions, but will provide a sarcastic answer if you are not right. Constantly belittles people. Avoid at all costs.",0
"If you're not an accounting major, this class likely won't be very fun. It's a lot of work, sometimes pretty straightforward sometimes not. If you don't put in the time you won't do very well. Mr. Mac's cryptic comments in class don't really help. My only beef is that while he claimed not to have trick questions on tests, they appeared frequently.",0
"Dr. Shively is such a knowledgeable professor. She is experienced in her field so she knows what she's talking about. Lecture will either be very interesting or very boring, depends on the topic. 3 exams make up 75% of the grade and a collection of small assignments make up 25%. Shows videos in class and gives extra credit. I'd take her again.",1
"it is a show up and get an A- type of class, her grading is so superficial. You can skip class and she won't notice. Don't buy the textbook! you will never use it once.",0
"JJ is a classic geology nerd with a good sense of humor. Geology 220 was very all encompassing, and you could tell he didn't enjoy teaching a lower level course. He likes talking to students and will help if you ask, but every assessment was open note and open book (super easy!). He loves to go off topic during lectures! ",1
"His lectures are often hard to follow as he goes off on tangents that seem to be unrelated to what is on the powerpoint. Everything he says is referred back to HIS BOOK, felt like the class was just him promoting his books. Gave us a map quiz for 10% of our grade with a different map than was given to study with.",0
I took his course online and thought he was an excellent instructor.  His emails were personal and not generic.  He was willing to give plenty of positive feedback to good performance and his writing guidelines were easy to understand.,1
"Mr. Lloyd is a very tough grader who unfortunately isn't very clear on assignments. He has no problem humiliating students by showing their papers to the class as an example of what no to do. He also pulls up previous students Facebook's to make fun of them.  If you want a teacher to be supportive or helpful, Lloyd isn't the guy.",0
He is a very nice teacher. He respect his students  and I wouldn't doubt to take him again. He helps you a lot if you don't understand a problem he will explain it to you 100 time till you get It. ,1
"She is very passionate and knowledgeable about all things mental health. As a content instructor, the lectures are long and boring and she WILL test you on the smallest of things from her powerpoint and assigned readings. As an clinical instructor, I respect her advice and experience with mental health patients.",1
"Professor Kathleen is an awesome artist and instructor. She cares about her students, very understanding, and takes every chance to give better instruction or clarification. She not only teaches how to draw, but also the thought process as you draw. Highly recommended.",1
"This is the hardest English class I have ever had. I had another professor go over a paper with me, critiquing every sentence, and when I turned it in Mrs. Linder gave me a 70. I am normally a straight A student, especially in English. This professor has caused me to change majors.",0
"I personally think that this class is interesting. BUT, he is really is a tough grader. It is like you will never be able to get good grades after all. To those assignments that he gave I think should not be graded harshly like that!",0
"Goes over lessons way too fast, does not go over stuff that is on tests. Not very good at explaining things. Makes the lesson very difficult to understand when it shouldn't be.",0
"Wildly interesting! He explains things in a wacky way that is extremely clear. Embraces any idea or concept and helps refine it. Keep you independent, yet help is there when you ask. So far, best teacher i'v had here.",1
Grading scale seems really inconsistent and he is not at all accommodating of students issues; class is super hard and the only support is super crowded TA hours.,0
"Bad online course.  I've taken several at RCCC, and this was by far the most unorganized - poor page layout and LOTS of broken links.  Doesn't participate on the discussion forum.  Lecture ""notes"" and powerpoints are useless.  Tests are simply fact-finding missions out of the book - but not always from the chapter your studying.  Poor online course",0
"Professor Kiesow is a master of his craftboth in teaching and journalism. But more importantly, his commitment to mentoring his students is unwavering, constantly nurturing everyone to hone their schools, enhance their skill sets, and achieve success.",1
Class was online because of the pandemic. Read the book. Lectures cover basics of exams but the textbook helps solidify the information. She cares about her students and genuinely wants you to do well. Always willing to answer questions. Lots of homework but directly relates to exams. Lectures are long but she shows how to work out problems.,1
"If you are not a poli-sci major do not take this class unless you have nothing to do but read and write papers every week. Assigns papers as if his class is the only thing I have to worry about, took time away from classes that matter for my major. He's a nice guy and clearly passionate about what he teaches, but this class made me miserable.",0
Great teacher. interesting lectures. the text book goes along with the course perfectly,1
"Professor Wang is one of the best Professors at the University of Massachusetts Boston. You will learn, enjoy, and will get good grade. I strongly recommend taking this class with Professor Wang. She is the best!",1
hard to pass. not a good teacher.,0
"Jill Miller is a wonderful evolutionary biologist who studies Lycium species and their distribution around the world. She has a great sense of humor and will poke fun at experimental techniques in science, e.g. poking a salamander repeatedly with a stick. She includes great model organisms in slides and pushes you to understand evolution fully.",1
THE MOST BORING CLASS I'VE EVER TAKE LE COURS LE PLUS ENNUYANT QUE J'AI JAMAIS EU,0
Very unclear and unorganized. Couldn't understand what he was saying half the time. When you ask for help his explanations were even more confusing than the problem.  He is a smart man but doesn't know how to teach. AVOID at all costs if you need to move to a higher chemistry class. ,0
"She teaches fast but class is not hard. Attendance is mandatory because there is an in class quiz almost every class but they are easy. Gives three mini-tests, get to drop lowest score. Lots of opportunities to boost your grade up. Take this class!",1
"If you can dodge this class and take it with another professor, please do so. The exams are the worst, you literally have to read the entire textbook. He will throw in random questions just to see if you read the text. Oh! And you better be an English major/minor for this course because they will ding you if you do not write to their standards.",0
"A lot of work!  He is not hot, the girls like him b/c he is mad flaming.",0
Pretty unorganized lecture. He doesnt listen much. I did not like his style of teaching very much either. I usually enjoy taking classes but not his...I wish I had taken another professor.,0
"His class was pretty harsh. However, I was very luck when I was taking his class. He gave us the online exams with a lot of technology problems. So he gave us two attempts. Sometime, the questions will pop up in your blackboard before you take the exam. That makes the class much easier.",1
Great Professor,1
"The semester was a nightmare. video links and assignments on D2L didn't work, causing me to spend extra time I didn't have on getting Mr. Harmon to resolve these issues. Instructor did not respond to emails in a timely manner, and also didn't give us a general discussion board for our questions.",0
Professor Love makes you work for your grade but it very helpful and supportive. This class is not supposed to be easy but its okay because you are learning useful info for the future.,1
This class is definitely a GPA booster. There are weekly assignments but it is only 1-2 pages doubled spaced. One group poster presentation which is easy. One final philosophy paper that has to be 5-7 pages. This class is not hard. No exams.,1
"Probably the best teacher I could've had coming back to school she really made me want to be a better version of me. Her class can be easy if you take notes and participate, her lectures are always great and she is really sassy and funny .she cares a lot about her students. the sweetest and most hard working women youll ever meet.",1
"DRAGS DRAGS DRAGS the class! If you have people in your class that come to class to just listen or to sit there and be present, you'll get no where. She'll wait for them to participate and look away from those who constantly raise their hand. Sgro will wait on to the very last minute of class to dismiss. ",0
"Professor Killough was okay. She gives the most amount of work at the worst possible times, like during the every first week and during finals week she piles on the assignments, quizzes and homework. Her black board is very unorganized and made the class go on a wide goose chase to find the material they needed to do the assignments.",0
"I absolutely love Professor Stevenson. She made learning anatomy and physiology extremely interesting, which is hard to do. She is always accessible outside of class and dedicates as much time as she can to helping her students achieve. She does reviews before the exams and if you go, she gives extra details about questions she will ask. Take her!",1
"This class is easy! There is not a lot of work to do in this class besides the workbook activity, interview, and some quizzes. You can work ahead if you take it online and finish way before the semester ends.",1
"Hes not a good lecturer at all. Nothing he says makes sense and when it does he makes it needlessly confusing. I didnt even bother attending lectures after the first two months and I still got an A, showing how useless it actually is. Do the readings and youll be fine. Hes just so BORING and pompous",0
"Sarcastic and rude.  Does not care about her students and loves to kick people out of lab for any reason she can find.  Wrote up 25 students for academic dishonesty in one semester. Many of which claim was a false accusation and had to get appealed.  Doesn't grade anything on time, doesn't give good directions, and takes off points any chance given",0
"Great Professor. She's fair, keeps class interesting, and always willing to help students.",1
"she is nice, she would like to explain everything you dont understand, but she DO NOT explain a lot on grammar and new stuff, because she think the student can read book and do the questions by themselves. moreover, if you would like to practice more oral , you can go to her class, because there is a presentation in each class, sometimes each week.",0
The course goals outlined in the syllabus weren't achieved. He went on an unprofessional rant against his colleagues and can be rude to students. I wouldn't have taken this class if it weren't required for my degree. I'd avoid his classes at all costs. Required to buy a textbook that wasn't even used.,0
"Run far away! Although Dr. Simerka is incredibly intelligent, she's very impersonal and her manner can seem very snobbish. This class was really not a great choice. The material is dry and class discussion can also be dry. Incredibly harsh grader, but also good because she expects you to work to your utmost potential.",0
"I think he is a really good teacher, interesting assignments, you learn a ton, and he's so knowledgeable. I'd reccomend the Revolution in China class, great topic and his specialty.",1
"Honestly the most boring class i've ever taken, it may not necessarily have been all her fault as the materials are bland, however she doesn't make it interesting at all and it's very hard to pay attention to her.",0
"Dylan Shields was totally cool.  If you're serious about becoming successful in the movie business, this is a great professor for you.  He brought in a lot of guests from studios and the real world of filmmaking.  VERY COOL.",1
"He obviously knows what hes talking about, the lectures were just really hard to pay attention to/boring. The quizzes after every class were really really difficult as well, even though i read every chapter and went to class. It was a lot harder than I expected and i normally love religion classes. wouldnt recommend",0
"Super easy class, I missed a couple of quizzes/assignments and still got an A because of all the extra credit offered. Discussions are interesting most of the time. Book used for weekly quizzes.",1
"DO NOT TAKE WITH BROWN. The worst professor I have ever had. Lectures are all over the place and have nothing to do with the tests. A monkey could probably teach better than him. He doesnt give two craps about you or your grade, and although he may be smart, I dont know how he still has his job. Good luck getting a passing grade.",0
"Was really excited to take Leverson as a professor because I had heard that she was great. Was really disappointed because I genuinely didn't learn that much from her, all she did was read off of powerpoints and the study guides that she claimed would be helpful did nothing for the test. Will not take another class of hers.",0
Dr. Meade is probably the  least caring professor I have ever had here at Appalachian State. I took his English2060-Great Books course and was very dissatisfied. He will send VERY rude and passive aggressive emails when asking simple questions about simple assignments. He will assign your midterm three days prior with no review. STAY AWAY FROM HIM,0
"Majority of your grade is made of quizzes. She is very sweet, sometimes all over the place but knows what material to cover for class. She changed the dates of the quiz many times, which was a bit annoying. Go to class to learn what will be quizzed. Some quizzes where not reflective of what she said the style would be for the quiz.",1
"Terrible course structure, so disorganized, still shaping the course so prepare for challenges. Nice guy but poor lecturer, EXTREMELY UNCLEAR, treats students like we're writing our PhD thesis, tons of work for small 2-5% grades, 5 blog posts/3 papers/2 presentations/2 reports, the list goes on.... lectures are a waste of time'",0
"Be ready to put effort in. Dr. Burghart is very old school, so make sure you know what you're getting into before signing up. He is from the North so many southerners don't take his tone in the right way, but he means not harm by it. Lots of reading quizzes and lecture heavy, but overall a great class if its what you're passionate about!",1
"If you don't have previous chem experience, Bushey is not a good prof for beginners. He's willing to help if you ask questions or put in effort to see him outside of class, but in class he goes too fast. Disorganized thoughts and switches often back and forth between powerpoint, writing on paper, and writing on the board.",1
class a waste of time. Didn't use textbooks or discuss readings. Allowed some students to monopolize class w/inane diatribe. Did not give constructive criticism on assisnments. Wasted too much class time for group project instead of teaching. I learned nothing from sitting in her class....would recc a different professor.,0
"Professor Mason is honestly the best. Hilarious, well-educated, respected, fun to listen to. You will never fall asleep in his lectures. He works hard, grades fairly quickly, gives extra credit and makeup opportunities, and learns everyone's names. I have had him twice now and I love him. He is everything good about the English department.",1
"Mr Wildman is the best. Take him if you can, you won't regret it.",1
"I had him as my prof; when he loses his temper, he will become a wild aggressive attacker. why is he teaching us?",0
Professor Cardelus is very intimidating and self-righteous. She often belittles her students and likes to threaten their sense of well-being. Very confrontational and very dry personality. Her interests are the only ones that matter and she will make your life miserable if you don't feign the same level of interest. ,0
He was horrible.  One of the worst teachers I have ever had in my life.  I would never ever recommend this man to anyone.  Take Dr. Sun instead.,0
"If you go to him with a question, prepare to feel insulted, belittled, and still not have a clue whats going on.",0
"For the love of God, do not take him! If you didn't know, he is a world-renowned physicist (not exaggerating), and he is forced to teach so that he can keep his research money flowing in. So please, DO NOT take him! He only cares about his research. His tests are 3 questions (9 parts), and he doesn't curve, even if the class average is a 40. AVOID!",0
"The class is three hours long, but you'll do between 30-60 minutes of work the whole class period, the rest is spent sitting around while works on his laptop or wanders in and out of the room at random points, often disappearing for 15-30 minutes. This class should seriously be online, this was  a terrible experience, take it only if required.",0
"HORRIBLE! I could not wait to take Spanish but after her class, there is NO WAY that I am taking Spanish 2. This woman cannot teach. Talks a lot yet says nothing. If you aren't willing to eat,breathe and sleep spanish 24 hrs a day,then don't take Fletcher's class. This is THE ONLY CLASS you will have time for.Don't do it.Take Sign Language instead.",0
Gotta love it! WHOO!!!!,1
This guy is awesome.. Hes very funny and is extremely knowledgeable and keeps class interesting.. I strongly recommend Betzag.. hes the man,1
"He is an easy grader and offers extra credit for participation. At times he is difficult to understand because of his accent, however, he goes by the book. So if you have the book and read it,  you can easily follow along. The tests are easy and straightforward. He is very helpful and truly wants everyone to pass.  I would definitely recommend him.",1
"Mr. Tyson is late to class everyday. He only gives tests, no homework. The information from his lectures are what you need for the test but hes late everyday so you miss out on time for info. He doesnt help you out what so ever. I ended the class with an 89.2% and I emailed him twice about something I could do to get an A & he just didnt answer",0
Prof Zubin is one of the best teachers I've ever had.  Wish he could teach everything here!  The guy is a stand-up comedian but really knows his stuff.  You spend the whole class laughing at this jokes then the rest of the week thinking about what he's said.,1
Taking this class in the summer is no easy undertaking. Xandy is awesome! I would recommend her!,1
She is a very lazy teacher. Did not respond to questions in a timely manner. Takes forever to grade her papers. Makes you write an 8 page research paper (APA Style).,0
"You're back in high school with Rankin. Does not help you at all, just says it's test material and she can't comment on it, even though it's in class and not an exam day. The Lab skill training taught me way more than she did, it's pretty easy if you just do the lab assignments a couple of times. Would NEVER recommend Rankin to anyone.",0
"The class was not terrible, but after a month most of the class dropped out. She was difficult to talk to. She makes you feel dumb. It was the hardest class I've ever taken and it made me so stressed out all the time about all my work.",0
"Extremely rude,Breaks her own rules by being habitually late and constantly contradicts herself. You will NEVER have the correct answer for her. Her lectures are Long and Boring and at the end of them you still haven't learned much. English is my best subject and she has ruined the class for me;with her poor teaching style.",0
"She isn't a bad professor, but for an intro course we were assigned a 5-6 page research page, and a 6-7 page final essay, in addition to the (long!) readings and exams. It's not hard material, but it is way more work than necessary. Unless you are going to take higher CP courses or really love essays, I would chose a different teacher.",0
"Lisa Jo combines excellent teaching skills with years of experience in the field. Really makes you think about how the reading, videos, and assignments relate to real-world situations. Assignments can be writing-intensive but she is fair and her expectations are clearly expressed. I would take a class of hers again in a heartbeat!",1
She is so funny. She has reflection papers almost every other week. I took her Saturday class. Midterm is a paper final is a paper and group presentation! All great with times like these she stuck through!,1
Amazing professor. Yue Lao shi cares about all of her students. You can tell just by being around her that she wants every student to succeed. The workload is what you make of it. If you don't understand something she will gladly go back and review. She takes a lot of time to go beyond the textbook but the quizzes/tests are based on the textbook.,1
Dr. Tour frequently inserts his personal political beliefs into the course. He is unforgiving and does not like most students.,0
Worst Professor. Her teaching is only for those she favors. She is really mean and has a very bad attitude. She acts really tough and bossy mainly because she is the director of the theater program.,0
"The tests are hard and really test your complete knowledge on the readings and class. But, Dr. Britton is always there to help and also are the GTAs. So, if you don't like your grade, there is a place to go to help you with study strategies, answer questions, and clarify content!",1
Didn't include in-text citation for a few sources and was given 35% off final paper. Gives very little leeway and grades poorly for minor things.,0
If you really want to learn calculus and are willing to give your time  Mrs. Liu will meet with you and help you understand.  She provides an awesome final review for the online course. Highly recommend her.,1
"You will never fall asleep in Graham's lectures. He keeps them very interesting and rarely goes on tangents. The course work was difficult as expected, but whatever you do, do not get behind on homework. All in all a great professor who loves what he does, answering questions, and has a deep understanding of math.",1
"This class is completely awful. Three papers assigned for a history class is absolutely ridiculous. It's not even about history as much as it is him trying to teach us how to write in useless styles such as Chicago and Turabian, like why?? He always goes back and changes what he wants and there is no real structure. You'll regret taking this class",0
"He is very narcissistic and the way he oriented his class made no sense. The quizzes were absurd and asked verbatim definitions and half the class would fail every one and assignments like his resumes were all about his way. Even when i went home his ""right"" resumes were not right at all and i got bad feedback from companies about his style.",0
"We did small assignments some classes for a grade- just simple worksheets. Prof gave us the textbook as a series of PDF's, 10 question reading quizzes on each chapter, but very easy, and questions in order of appearance in book. She explains all the material in the lectures, 3 tests and optional final. Won't make you feel dumb for asking a question",1
Dr. Montes-Jordan was the most difficult professor to understand. He has a very thick Latin accent of some kind. There is a ton of material covered and you have to know it well to ace a test. Thankfully theres EC for tests. His lectures are long and painful. Perhaps he's a great teacher for aspiring med students but not for A.A degree students.,0
DO NOT take Nicastro unless you absolutely have to. He knows his stuff but is horrible in actually iterating it to his students. And don't get me started on his tests. They are a significant step up in difficulty from the homework. His finals are worse. Not to mention he reprimand us ons a daily basis for not understanding concepts (it's that bad),0
"Sylvester is an adjunct instructor, and as far as I know, he only teaches labs at the REEF. He provides lots of supplementary material for labs, grades reasonably, schedules lab sessions for confused students, and is definitely the coolest lab instructor in the EE program. Looks like an engineering version of Bo Jackson, if that's even possible.",1
"Great chemistry background, applies to chemical engineers.",1
"IDK why she's a professor to start off. She Can Not Teach!! If you ask her a question she is unable to answer because she doesn't know herself. Take my advice and avoid her at all cost or you will regret it. She also teaches Auditing, do yourself a favor and do not take her!",0
Whatever you do...DO NOT TAKE HER.,0
"Just kinda average honestly. Lectures are boring but manageable, you can get away with not paying attention because it's literally all in the textbook. Tests were alright for me because I retain information, but other people struggled.  You can't skip lectures  all the time bc of iClickers, but you're not missing too much. He's alright I guess....",1
"Dr. Keeling is one of my favorite professors at CNU. Children's Lit was so much fun with her, and you can really tell she loves what she is teaching. She cares about her students - just be sure to participate in discussions! Class consisted of journals/outlines, 2 papers, and the final. Be prepared to read, but I promise you'll love every second.",1
"This professor has real life career experience in journalism, public relations, etc and was incredibly helpful in guiding me toward the right career path for me after graduation! So inspirational. A must-take professor,  if you are interested in a specific career in this field or unsure what you want to do in the field!",1
"Dr. Rodrigues is caring and accessible outside of class. He also draws heavily on his immigrant experience making lectures interesting.  Group projects are a large part of the class including the final, and there are no individual grades on these projects. He tries to address tough social issues (racism) but clearly leans politically liberal.",0
"Sam is really a nice and friendly professor!!! P.S. One important thing to keep in mind is: don't be absent minded during lectures otherwise you will find yourself completely lost, as there is nothing called ""slides"" in Sam's lecture. But even without slides Sam is a great professor! (as long as you are a good student and go to lectures, lol) :)",1
"Definitely not worth the hype. The professor was hella dry and I did not find this class interesting at all. His lectures and extremely boring. I found his essay topics unclear, and some of the readings were just so tedious and inconvenient. The class is graded on very little things so your grade is very dependent on each test.",0
"Great class, great professor. Class was interesting and easy to sit through. He's easy going and gives great feedback on papers. I would definitely recommend him to anyone taking an English class.  ",1
"I took online 280 this quarter and I loved it! Everything's so clear and I never missed any assignments because everything's so clear, from week to week. I don't think we have long research paper due. I am getting an A.",1
"Chris is the nicest guy you'll meet. Problem is, he has no idea how to teach and no idea how to get the right words across to you. You can't just sit and listen to him. If you want to get anything from his lectures, you have to pay extra close attention, think a little bit, and ask lots and lots of questions.",0
One of the nicest men ive ever met. If you ask him a question he probably wont hear you. You dont need the textbook if you show up to class. I rarely went to class and walked out with a B. Make sure you show up when he gives you the Unit test to study and you'll be fine.,1
"knows her content but is not good at making sure students do. Prepare to teach yourself because she definitely won't be teaching you anything herself. extremely slow talker so unless you care about how words sound its hard to pay attention. In terms of content, unless you're going to be a linguist, you will never use irl",0
"Technically I suppose she is a professor. However, not a very good one. Techinically",0
I took this professor twice (2 classes). I learned the material and became very proficient in it. He is a nice man who is a little shy but very helpful. He spent a long time to explain to me missed concepts (as I tend to phase out a lot) during his office hours. Be ready to study/read a lot if you want to learn from him.,1
"Although he was respectable and responsive, most of his assignments were vague. For example, one had to think outside of the box yet if you answer to your own accord, he doesn't explain what you did wrong. His lectures were useless and this class was pretty much asynchronous. The class is passable, but it can be difficult because of his directions.",0
"class is straight forward and direct.  he gives you everything you need to do well on the exams, reading isn't too crazy, and there are no surprises.  come to class and it's a breeze",1
"Matt is the best professor to take for anatomy. Your entire grade is 4 online homeworks, one dissection plan, and 4 exams. Lecture and lab exams are taken on the same day and are equal in points. There is no ""fluff"" in this class. He is very specific on what you need to study and you won't find anything on the exams that weren't in his lectures/lab",1
Great class and great professor. She is always willing to listen and help you with any problems or questions you may have. One of my favorite teachers here at UHM by far!,1
Almost all of the grading is based on the exams which can contain very obscurely-formatted questions a lot of the time. All of the lectures are pre-recorded so you can watch them when you like but you must watch them if you want to pass the exams. You're gonna be talked at for 2.5 hours every week and you need to scribble down notes. Very boring.,1
amazing teacher. take his class. hes def done some crazy sh*t in his life. goes off topic but it is usually entertaining. very easy class .. highly recommend him,1
"Dr. Watson is an amazing professor. Classes were always fun and interesting, an all around great experience. She's very warm and welcoming, and always there to help if needed. Be prepared to work for your grade, this isn't a course you can slack off in and still expect to pass.",1
"Super nice, funny guy, but not good at lecturing. Examples given in class and in Sapling are WAY easier than exams. However, study the practice exams for a good idea of what to expect. WARNING! A lot of unseen problems pop up in every exam so there's a limit-unless you're really smart.",0
"Dr. Philip is an awesome man of God! I enjoyed taking his class for Systems Mgmt. If you participate in class and do your homework, the class is enjoyable. He's a realist and I respect him for that. He incorporates scripture with the material in such a smoothly. This guy is absolutely genius. I can't believe all the negative reviews, such a shame!",1
"Professor Bowlin is the laziest teacher ive ever had. She hasnt taught us anything in class, she just has the students continually present powerpoints to do her job for her. In the other class i have with her, she just sits on the podium and reads from the book the whole class while she told us to buy it cause we ""need it"" I would avoid her",0
I have taken his math classes three times now and I learn the material so well from him. His courses are difficult and although attendance isn't mandatory you have to go to class to do well and for random in class quizzes. He is great at explaining concepts and only teaches you what you need to know for exams which is helpful as well.,1
Avoid.,0
"AVOID THIS MAN AT ALL COSTS. He is the meanest, most arrogant professor I've ever had. He is not approachable. When you do talk to him, you will walk away feeling like the dumbest person alive. He is incredibly condescending and rude. His criticism is often unnecessarily CRUEL and unhelpful. He should be teaching grad students, NOT undergraduates.",0
"Accelerated 2 mo. course. Very hard class. Wasn't much instructions throughout the course. More of a go do it, better be great at it or you're getting a bad grade. The amount of material you are expected to learn throughout this course is ridiculous! Quizzes are EXTREMELY hard! & do not try google. 4 Quizzes. 1 Research Paper. 5 Discussion Boards. ",0
"Christy is extremely smart, but that makes it hard to learn from her. She tends to put assignments on moodle and never tell you about them until they are due. ",0
"Dr. Bottomley is so nice and her class is really easy. Their is a weekly homework, a midterm, a final, and a group project.",1
"Dr. Sobhi is the best for Gen Chem, he is genius, and want his student to succeed, he always willing to help you , if you show interest in doing well, it was a great experience. I highly suggest him, for both 131 and 132 .",1
Professor Mingo was such an amazing instructor. I felt that she really cared about us and she was very understanding. I took the course online and it was well organized. It's an easy class.,1
"Felt like he has a hard time with the online format. Confusing and not updated due dates for assignments. Responsive to questions. Very little feedback on exams, but this seems almost epidemic in online courses. Pleasant instructor I got the impression he cared. He should work harder on the online class preparation I think it would help him out.",0
her grading is overly hard and harsh even if she gives you the answers! never really explain anything after grading or offers really valuable help!,0
"Overall, not impressed by his teaching style (online). Be prepared to teach yourself everything, because he provides no lessons and little help even if you ask for it!",0
Good professor. Helpful where it counts.,1
"Way too much work for a 2 credit class. 2 midterm essays, as well as a final project and other assignments. He is a very tough grader on essays, which I wouldn't expect from a 2 credit class. He doesn't give helpful feedback. I wouldn't recommend this class or the professor. Lots of reading and work, too much for a 2 credit",0
"Although people rate him 2.0 and I am not native American student but guess what!? He is an amazing teacher who has a deep knowledge in calculus and know how to combine lectures with real situation (YOU WILL LEARN A LOT). It's true that he gives tons of HW but as long as you finished all of them, you will get an easy A (or A minus like me lol).",1
"I have taken all of Professor Deluna's classes that are provided at SAC. He is organized and clear about the criteria required in class. Pay attention to his lectures and final review - that's the key to passing his class. He's not strict, but he has expectations from his students and holds them to a higher standard. He's one of my fave Prof's!",1
Show up for class and do the lab assignments.  Pay attention to the lecture not just the slides.  Getting an A is possible but the tests are hard.  There was extra credit throughout the course.  Getting a B is pretty easy if you just show up and put some effort into stuff. He wants to get you ready for nursing classes.,1
"Overly mediocre (if not downright poor) lecturing. Seems to be fairly knowledgeable with the course material, but makes concepts more confusing rather than elaborating upon them well. Avoid if possible.",0
"He's a very nice guy, but I like him better as a person than a professor. He jokes around a lot, sometimes way too much. Isn't really helpful, because he's very opinionated. He'll tell you how he feels,so be prepared for his criticism. Barely any work in class, no work out of class. I would take him again just because it was an easy A.",0
"Sean is THE BEST. Sean is an industry professional and has endless knowledge about the production and mixing matters, but all he does comes from a place of good taste and extremely musical ears, which set him aside from 90% of the mpne professors, who don't really know music but only technology. Inspirational, caring and extremely funny. Take him!",1
"Dr. Hoffman is such as nice, eccentric professor. He clearly loves teaching, and his lectures break down complex topics into clear, manageable chunks. He is very helpful during office hours after class. His course was one of the best courses I have ever taken.",1
"Dr. A is a great guy. He is very smart, but his lectures are HARD. Spatial Analysis is impossible. BUT there is a HUGE curve if you actually try hard. Taking notes in class makes no difference. Just don't get behind on studying. Takes attendance 10x at random so go to class. DO problem sets and go on extra credit labs.",0
He's awesome.  Tough class but great teacher,1
"I took him for contracts and then went to law school. Turns out if you actually want to learn contracts this isn't the place to do it. Bizarrely he teaches torts. I don't even know how he got through law school. If you want an easy A, take him. All you have to do is read his power points. If you want to actually learn contracts run far, far away.",0
If you love photography you will love it even more once you take the B&W photography classes and James Spence is my all time favorite teacher.I just graduated this spring and I miss that class more than anything and James. I recommend you take his classes! Great teacher he knows his stuff and hes honest and you just have a great time in class.,1
"I took this class using my math lab so it was essentially a hybrid class. He cared about you learning anything and he would always ask if we had questions. The tests were easy if you did the work. But, his grading technique is super confusing... I would definitely take this professor again. He is really nice.",1
"Professor Bauman is such a sweet and caring person. Her materials and assignments are indeed kind of challenging, but they are thought-provoking. If you really want to learn stuff and actively engage with the materials, definitely take her. I would say it shouldn't be hard to get an A-",1
He is an amazing prof.  He uses silly humor to help you remember concepts and it works.  He really knows his stuff and does a great job of explaining difficult concepts to someone who has never had bio before. He is such a nice guy.,1
"Decided to take a summer class forChem. Honestly was so hard I wanted to cry. Knows what he's talking about but his accent is so heavy its impossible to understand him. Chemistry uses big words so this was even worst. The whole class was failing so he curved GENEROUSLY, I mean I got a B and failed most exams I thought I was getting a D possible C.",0
"Dude is cool enough, but his tests are insanely difficult and not at all like his study guide. Took during Summer A, so granted could be easier if taken during a full semester. Lab is boring and pointless but easy.",0
"James is an awesome guy and he knows his ""stuff."" He does lack a little bit of quality feedback on assignments but overall is a good instructor. You CANNOT slack off!!! 10-page paper that lasts the entire quarter. Do NOT procrastinate or else you WILL REGRET!! You can do it!",1
Professor Marylee Marra is the best. Cares about the students and help students to acchieve their academic goals,1
"Hard marker, unclear.",0
She is pretty sweet:)  I wish I had found out about her in my earlier years of college.  She is worth taking and you will learn a lot not just from her but the class itself,1
"Whatever he teaches, will be on the exam; word for word. He is a very good teacher. Can be scary and ignorant at times but not a bad person. Likes to make jokes no matter how insulting that is. Classes aren't boring at all and you will learn a lot about real world economy.",1
"Arka is a great Professor. The tests are pretty much the same as the sample tests he gives with slightly different problems. The final is 40% of the final grade, otherwise a great professor with a pretty easy class.",1
"An amazing person, I dont know of any professor who cares about their students as much as Walker. With that being said, if you are looking to be prepared for a major in Business, I would not take her. It was an extremely easy A but I cant tell you I learned that much about business.",1
"Ho, is literally the one of my worst profs. I had him for Micro Economics, and all I have to say is get ready to work. Even though I never went to class because he does heavy lectures and goes to fast. I decided to self teach. One good thing about Ho, he uses the study guide and literally uses the study guide as the exam. So memorize it.",0
"I wish he taught other classes.  The professor is smart, funny and an excellent lecturer.  He also is a sharp dresser and cute!!",1
"I dont think I hated a professor more then I hate him. He was the worst math professor I have ever taken in my life. Dont take him, take cutler instead. Or you can take him if you enjoy hell",0
"She has amazing stories! It's a joy just to listen to her. I was worried for the first half of the class because she talks SO MUCH about absolutely everything, but we weren't quizzed on it, so I learned to relax and just enjoy the class. I definitely learned and was inspired a lot here.",1
"great teacher and guy, engages the students well... pretty easy and hilarious personality. I would definitely take his class again",1
Terrible professor doesn't teach anything during lectures and definitely do not need to show up to class. She expects us to learn from the 200+pages of reading she assigns per week as if we do not have any other classes to worry about. I would not take her course again.,0
"He's a good solid teacher, but sometimes very monotone and has a hard time keeping the class interesting. He tries hard to make it better though, he's a young teacher (like 26), so give him time and he may be great. ",1
"if you get an option of a thursday or tuesday lab take thursday because the tuesday lab can tell you everything on the lab exams, don't take the quizzes lightly, they add up and are a huge factor. Don't rely on her as a teacher, she simply goes off the ch in her class time. She does her best to be there but in the end its just a job. good outlines",0
"He has been the most passionate, inspiring, &, genuine profesor I have ever had. Each day was memorable in class discussion having us use different perspectives to analyze literature. This class is no cake walk, but he truly shows you how much you are capable of and opens you up to Chicago&Illinois history which has an incredibly unique timeline!!!",1
"I really enjoyed this class to start with, but I found that Martin made the content more confusing than it should have been. You can learn the same amount from going to two weeks of his lectures as you can from watching a 12 minute YouTube video on the subject. He gives no application type questions, everything is theoretical, and only grades tests",0
"The WORST TEACHER EVER... Her PP are outdated. She does not like when you ask questions or to go back on the slides. She is so monotone, boring and rude. No manners at all. She gets a satisfaction when she fails students. She teaches irrelevant information. I do not understand why IVC has not solved this this problem.",0
I'm not sure why professor Louis has bad reviews. I took Govt 2305 and 2306 with her! She makes everything clear since the start of class and uses connect. The connect homework is lengthy but you will always get a 100%. The exams are easy if you do homework! The only thing that you have to work extra hard for is the 2 discussion posts. Take her!,1
Makes the subject harder than it needs to be. Gleans clicker questions from another Biology text book (& does not cite on PP slides). Will put challenging & convoluted questions on tests not covered in class or explained by the book. Definitely do the review sheets & homework (marginally helps for test;more about extra points) Take Prabhu instead!,0
"He's a nice guy but his lectures are just not interesting. He doesn't make much of an effort as a teacher to keep the class interested. He gives online quizzes spontaneously and they're sometimes assigned at the last minute when they do take a bit of time to do because they are difficult. He does give a little bit of extra credit, nothing too big.",0
"Power point reading in a monotone voice in an early am class  zzz!! Expect to make use of the tutors in order to get your questions answered. She is very unclear, only uses simple problems as examples, does not really seem to know the material well herself. She acts as if questions should not be expected and are an inconvenience to her. ",0
Extremely easy! He gives you the EXACT questions and ANSWERS that will be on your midterm and your final. All you have to do is memorize them. Speeches are easy. Class is enjoyable.,1
"Mrs. Moseley is a great teacher! As long as you come to class and put some work into it, you'll come out with a good grade. She gives short quizzes everyday that are easy as long as you read the night before and she gives out bonus points. Make sure on essays to go to tutors, that will help save your grade!!!",1
"honestly the class wasn't very hard. the main problem with him is that he does not even bother to respond to his students, he had a 'discussion page' up since the beginning of the year and RARELY answered it. When the exam came around there was a page to ask questions about the exam and he didn't respond to a single one. he was barely a teacher",0
She was a great teacher! There are assignements in class to bring up grades. She gives extra credit opportunity for every test that you do at home. She gives a study guide for every test and the test is exactly from the guide! A very good teacher who will help you in any way possible!,1
"I took this class my freshman year and still rather frequently think of St. Augustine. 1/3 of the class would show up and most would not do the readings(a book from 1600 years ago). Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed this class and still wish I had taken more humanities courses. Avoid if your main worry is grades and tests. Curiosity/thinking req.",1
"Power points are provided but not very helpful. Thick accent, late to class even on exam days, doesn't explain content clearly, doesn't give clear answers to any questions, makes a lot of mistakes grading exams then refuses to change them. Mostly just reads from his power points.",0
"Easy A. The guy does not go over anything that isn't on his tests. If you do bad in his class its because you failed to take any notes, which he usually instructs you to do so anyway. Meaning its not optional. Being a lazy student myself, this actually means he's pretty easy.",1
If you're looking to make money shooting weddings...then he knows what he's talking about. Anything else...I'd go to someone else for advice.,1
Well organized!  Easy to understand and follow.,1
"This professor is excellent and very easy to talk to!  She goes over the material thoroughly and doesn't hold your hand.  She expects students do their work.  She's strict with deadlines and expectations.  Projects are self-explanatory and kinda fun! Tests are ""open notes"" on 3x5"" cards only - double-sided. Very fair grading scheme! Enjoyed it!!",1
Went over everything in class. Had many homework assignments and each were 5 problems. Gave study guides.,1
"Sincerely hope no-one ever has to get this prof ever again. He is quite possibly the worst I have ever encountered.  Refuses to actually help students, belittles students, and is very sarcastic.  He should, without question, be fired.",0
"I absolutely hated this class and the professor.  His tests are horrible and super hard.  The fact that he does not give detailed study guides doesn't help study for his tests.  If you are the type of person who does not test well, but makes up for your grade by extra credit and homework, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.  Hated this class.",0
"This class was difficult to take in a regular setting but even MORE difficult to take online after the COVID crisis. This professor made it extremely difficult to access his recorded lectures to a point where I had to drop. I understand COVID was an unforeseeable event; however, professors should be more accommodating and ease stress off students.",0
"Easy A if you complete the assignments. Easy grader. Loved his ""religious amnesia"" concept. Final exam completely based on lesson quizzes. Easy it was!",1
She''s rude. You have to beg for assistance which she will cut you off for asking. She is scatterbrained and never organized. I dread this class every day because she is just not a good teacher and she drives me insane. ,0
Very easy class,1
"This class is a mess... He had no idea how to teach Unity and also was confused every class, his TA even more. He was also late to every class, cutting class time by 20 mins on average. If you actually wish to learn game dev, skip ASU & learn it from another school or online. CPI111 was already bad, but CPI211 isn't even a class, but it is an ez A.",0
She really helps her students regarding certain topics. There are extra credits if you come to SI sessions (the only extra credit she gives) You can also ask questions during the test and she will go through it with you. Just study for tests and go to SI sessions for help and hints for the upcoming tests and undoubtedly you will pass this subject.,1
Dr. V is fair but tough. If you do the work and ask questions there is no reason you should fail. He asks a lot but overall and fairly enjoyable person to learn and work with.,1
"I was previously obsessed with Anthropology and took this class as a refresher. Unfortunately, Sullivan caused me to stray away from it from further on. Although he is a charming and interesting person, he is an extremely disorganized professor. Very unclear. Very off-topic. I would not recommend him as a teacher. Chat with him for fun",0
"shes so nice, loves to talk, and is awesome! she isnt very clear on assignments sometimes though.  but shes ALWAYs there to be helpfull. i didnt go to class that much, all you had to do was show up for 15 minutes, and take a quiz, but if you missed class that week, you could make it up the next class. you have to write 4 papers.. thats all !!",1
Im conflicted about professor Allen. The class itself isnt hard but he makes it harder than it should be. He gives TONS of worksheets that you basically figure out how to do yourself. I felt like I taught myself the entire semester. He hardly ever gives a straight answer to questions and isnt clear on instructions. He can be condescending too.,0
She doesnt give you too many explanations.I had so hard time and she likes to keep you very busy.,0
Exam is based on a set of questions handed out in the beginning. Material is very difficult and his style of teaching makes it more complicated. Case study presentations must be very detailed.,0
"Took the Hybrid course fall 2019 and really enjoyed his class. It started out a little rough, but that was due to the book having missprints. If you pay attention to his lectures he gives you the answers to your lab word for word. He truly tries to help his students but you have to pay attention. Would take his class again in a heartbeat.",1
This class really is NOT hard. There is a lot of homework and a lot of reading. The chapters for homework assignments were to be turned in before we learned about that chapter. This meant that you needed to read before class. The tests were easy as long as you went to class and did the review slides online! Don't miss class bc lectures matter more!,1
"Qumsiya was... a LITTLE better than okay. He's nice if you pay attention and communicate with him (a.k.a. respect him like any other human being). Beware, though: RIDICULOUS amounts of homework, quizzes even tutors can't figure out, and take-home assignments that literally take HOURS and are extremely difficult, even if you do well in math.",1
"Dr. Russell is by far the most popular professor in the PSCI department, and for good reason. She is passionate in class and really works hard to make sure her students are not only learning the material but appreciating it as well. Overall, Dr. Russell is amazing and I would certainly take her classes again. (Beware: lots of reading though.)",1
"Charles ""Chuck"" Warner is a communications god!!! Ive taken at least 7 classes with him in my tenure here at ESU and each was extremely enjoyable. He actually makes people care about the things hes trying to get across and truly believes that there are no such things as stupid questions...I know i asked a bunch!!",1
"Online Class While I've had harder classes, I've never had a more useless teacher. He does nothing to contribute to the class and gives zero feedback on the assignments. If you state your opinion in the discussion board, you get an F for that week. If you feel like self teaching, go for it. Otherwise avoid this teacher at all costs.",0
"I could never recommend this professor.  His lectures are uninspired and quite frankly a waste of time, his homework assignments are extremely inflexible (especially to those who have work hours), and he gives quizzes on material irrelevant to anything we've done in class.  He rarely answers class questions and also curves downward.",0
"Do not take her ONLINE class. I was expecting her to be teaching the class. It turns out she uses lecture videos from Prof. Crandall, so in reality Prof. Crandall is teach you the class not her! Furthermore she uses the Lockdown Browser for the main exams for integrity. Give credit where credit is due!",0
"Very helpful, she wrote the book, literally.",1
"give low really grade on lab report although u have 20 pages, barely can hear him, never ever c/p someone's work on ur report even though u only use  5% out of ur entire work, he considers it's cheating, and report to university. over all he is easy but mean.",0
"Paul is SUPER! Really understands the busy work schedules of his students and allows for flexibility. Involves everyone in the learning, keeps class fun and informative.  I'd do the whole program with him if  I could.",1
"I loved this class, but the workload was far too much.",1
"Lectures are interesting and he can be pretty funny, so if you need to fulfill the STS requirement, this is definitely a good class for it.  Just don't use your phone during class, he gets really irritated by that.",1
"Don't write him off right away. He comes across as very serious but, if you go to office hours and talk to him you'll realize he is a lot more relaxed than he seems. He truly wants everyone to do well and if you have any questions he will answer them very thoroughly.",1
Took Western Civilizations. Didn't reference the book too much. Gets off topic easily. Hard to understand accent. Pay attention to the review! Alright guy but not a good teacher.,0
Wish I would have taken her for all English related classes. ,1
Lecture is long monotone and straight from the power points. everyone falls asleep everyday. I dread this class. While a very kind and friendly woman I would not recommend her for any subject or class. Everyone failed her tests only one A and 3 B's out of 50+ students in my section. No one knows where her test questions come from,0
Many students in our class opted to not attend lectures and study the textbook on their own. Dr. Sander reads directly off of her slides which can be difficult to follow. She offers bonus assignments and group quizzes to augment your grade. 2 midterms - the last 10 minutes of which were spent in a group setting. She is helpful during office hours.,0
"This professor was okay, the 2 worksheets due every week was pretty bad especially during the middle of the semester. Her lectures are interesting and participation counts more than the final paper, which I found a little confusing. Overall I think this class was okay at best!",1
"Dr. Anitori is a pretty good teacher. I did learn a lot. Lectures were pretty boring, but I think microbiology can be difficult to make interesting. He's very nice, but is kind of condescending when students ask questions. He gives massive amounts of extra credit. Probably enough to boost your grade 10-15 percent. I would recommend.",1
Insanely demanding. Miss Pillai is really strict and she will call you out if you're not doing the activities or look distracted. She has very helpful Powerpoint and her knowledge of French culture is impressive but she could be friendlier to make class less stressful.,1
"If you've taken ENG 308, here it is again...I think Pam tried to switch things up a little bit, but it was hard to see over the sarcasm and fake smiles.  Good luck!",0
Prof. Steinitz is great. She knows her stuff from real world experience. She helps you relate to the subject matter through practical exercises. She really wants her students to succeed. Highly recommended class and prof.,1
"You're mostly on your own b/c his lectures vaguely reflect what's on his lengthy exams. He's extremely condenscending and won't even tell you how to prepare for his very tough exams. Harsh, unfair grader and moody. Avoid!",0
"Really enjoyed the content of the course, the readings, the movies, and the discussions were pretty engaging. However she doesnt give good expectations for assignments. If theres no clear instructions for the midterm/final make sure u ask her or it probably wont be up to her standard. Do the readings and answer the weekly assignments thoughtfully",1
"The only grade's that you will get for this class are test grades, so make sure you're a good test taker. Also, she often goes off-topic and expects you to remember things that she has said only once.",0
"I took this class for fun and I feel like it wasted my time. I got good grades but the load is ridiculous . This class is introductory, but does not go into enough detail. The assignment expectation seemed to change throughout the semester and feedback was incredibly vague. I could have gotten more information from a hefty google search.",0
Professor Paul Kirz gives it how it is. Awesome class and his work is the best work ever. Gives some homework and will take you far in the music industry. In his class you will learn not the material but also how the industry works and will give you gigs as well!!! make sure to bring him food too! when you do he will give you your fist pro-gig!,1
"Take David!  I have had terrible science teacher but David makes things easy to understand and easy to follow.  He reviews everything you need to know.  All you have to do is pay attention.  His teaching style is laid back yet serious.  He loves his roses, ask about them and google them.  You can even order the seeds.  David is a great person.",1
"He wanted to be funny, but he doesn't really make people laugh. He makes genetics jokes. He occasionally will have extra credit pop quizzes, so attend class daily and on time( if you are in class you get one point). Really takes the time to make sure everyone knows the material.",1
The worst professor I have ever had. She does nothing but read word for word off a PowerPoint than grades your papers on layout not content. I haven't learned anything from her other than they let anyone teach.,0
"Willa has so much PR experience. He is a great tool, so utilize it. He truly loves his job, so he will love you if you act interested. His lectures are boring. He makes you do outside reading from two text books each week (just skim). Not a heavy workload all semester, but he gives all his work-load the last month of school which is annoying.",1
"Professor Aguilar is terrible. She gives so much homework, her lectures are ramblings, she does not ever speak about the assignments. She is a rough grader but if you feel you deserve a higher grade she does listen and if you make a good argument she will bump it up. Be ready to read and to do A LOT of writing. She does not make directions clear.",0
The levels of papers was ridiculous and the time given to work on said papers was never enough. I broke my ankle and was given one night to work on a 4-5 page paper for a class I missed (which I had a doctors note for). He clearly knows what hes talking about on the subject but is terrible at getting it across to his students.,0
in all honestly she is a good professor but omg she gives out way too many assignments. they are never ending and totally unfair!!! if it wasnt for her excessive assignments she would be a GREAT professor. its like she thinks we have nothing better to do. humanities is BORING!,1
"Cool Professor, he's fair and helpful. Has an accent but he's still clear and easy to understand. Group projects, Lots of HW, and 2 exams (mid term and final) which are somewhat difficult. Only annoying this is his grading scale. ex. 93% is an A- rather than the standard 90% being an A-.",1
"Excellent professor with a lot of energy and many jokes to keep you awake. Thus far my favorite professor in Hofstra, do not be intimidated by his demeanor the first few weeks of school, he's just trying to crack you. He will make a song out of important concepts and is very very inspirational for someone his age. ",1
"Horrible! I was in Ms. Hegners class to begin and she was awesome, she got sick and asked Skelly to finish our semester for her. Half the class droped the first day he was there. Doesn't make any sence. I had an A and now I'm scared to take our final because he hasn't taught us anything. Completly political and makes rude jokes. Don't take him.",0
"As a professor Mukamel is ok, the material she covers is interesting, but her tests ruined the class for me. Her questions are beyond vague, Ex: ""Write what you know about the RAND"" Really? Worst tests I have ever taken. She does not post her notes online, she lectures using the whiteboard, no power points. Gives extra credit for evaluation.",1
"Kelsey is a new instructor in the Comm Department. She's a graduate of the undergrad & grad program at ECU, so she understands & knows what it's like being a student. All is clearly stated in the syllabus  no surprises. She genuinely cares about students & makes class fun to come to. She's a younger instructor but doesn't take any mess. Recommend!",1
"Hill is the most stubborn professor I have ever met. He will make mistakes during his lectures but never admits them when someone points it out. He will grade on grammar. Like it's a bio class, not an English class. Exams were unnecessarily hard.",0
"Excellent teacher.He knows Chemistry and he really cares about the students;he even has students over at his house for lunch EVERY Sunday.A difficult but worthwhile class.He's opinionated,but it's clear that he's not trying to force his opinions on to others but comically inform them of his own.",1
"If you are looking to get out of your comfort zone and work for your grades, take her class. She sets high standards for her students and will call names out if nobody is participating. Follow her guidelines I would suggest going above and beyond to meet with her. She is never on time with anything, but her classes are genuinely interesting.",0
"Mistakes were common in her lectures. There were a handful of times where she asked the students if her own slides were correct . Be ready to see her read her slides word for word. When she does explain things in detail, she lacks conceptual explanations, she goes straight to finger pointing and tells you how to do the calculations.",0
Avoid at all costs. Asks for work far beyond what is listed in the syllabus.  Very vague in directions and then grades you on things you could not have known. Requires 2-3 copies of all lab reports.,0
"I wouldn't recommend taking this class with her if you have little background in stats. She assumes the class knows more than they actually do, so she tends to skip many steps when doing problems. She won't take responsibility for the class doing poorly (My class had a 62 average for exam 1 and said ""it wasn't her fault"")",0
"If you want an instructor that will communicate with you, don't take her classes. I e-mailed her a few times and never heard back from her. In the online class there are group discussions once a week. Even when you meet her criteria for acceptable participation, she still deducts points. Tried to ask what I did wrong. No response.",0
I absolutely loved her and loved this math class. She was absolutely an amazing math teacher. She was my first math professor at college and I ended  up taking her again another semester best decision ever. If u put in the work you will pass if you ask questions she will answer and she also extra help class available. Would take her again,1
I am not one to complain about a professor but this guy is AWFUL. Not only did I teach myself everything he is a nasty disrespectful guy. He would choose certain students and pick on them. During the year all the hours of packets and chapters in Lab Manual don't even count towards your grade. Your end grade it strictly tests. Try to avoid this man.,0
"She is a good researcher, but defintely not a good lecturer. My mind went blank soon after listening to her. Lecture slides are pointless and reading the textbook is a must to pass. Even if you do so you still miss points due to the unncessary details and confusion you will see the MC questions during the tests. Be warned.",0
Melissa is an excellent professor. She is a very nice person and is very good at explaining things. It was a pleasure taking her class in the Winter 2016 quarter. She inspired me to keep studying Spanish. I highly recommend this professor!,1
"Definitely an easy class to take if you're looking for an elective. She's quirky and keeps lecture interesting with a lot of group activities but attendance is definitely not mandatory since she puts all of the slides/assignments on D2L. As long as you put in a little effort, you'll pass.",1
"Jean is hands down one of the best teachers I've ever had. She is like a mother to the students and continues to look after them even after classes end. She was the one that inspired me to become a teacher. Thank you Jean, We love you!",1
"He was pretty awful! I have been a strait A student my entire life with only a couple B's in H.S. and none in college so far till this class. His expectations were confusing and made the student feel stupid if he did not like the work. I get A's on my English papers, but got a B- on what he called a ""quick and easy assignment."" Avoid if possible!",0
Dr. Ferguson was a good professor. Just watch the lectures and take detailed notes. His lectures were very heavy and took a while to watch. You were able to use your notes on the exams and they were not proctored. All his exams were straight from lectures. I did not even buy the textbook. Chill guy.,1
"He is nice professor but he really need to change his teach style. He is a kind of professor who hope students to go to his office hour. If you go to, he love talking with you and answer clearly. And his exam has many works. So, good luck on it.",1
This class is super straightforward and low maintenance. The tests are hard but if you read the book and/or pay attention in class they are fine. Westover is knowledgeable and respectful to students. Quick feedback on assignments and you can tell he actually reads what you wrote.,1
"This prof made me absolutely hate this class. She and our TA miscommunicate on everything. Get ready for the most unorganized class of your life. If you want to be spoken to like a toddler, take this class. Gets mad at people for being on zoom and not in class. Like sorry we're in a pandemic and I don't want to get corona? Extremely insensitive.",0
"Don't take a class with him. You learn nothing, because he knows nothing about the subject. Look elsewhere to fulfill your requirements.",0
Excellent professor!! Passionate about his teachings and willing to help any student :),1
"This guy is very sweet and he means well, but his tests are ridiculous.  Nothing in the book or in his lecture notes show up on the tests.  I have no idea where he got his questions from.  He had to scale the grades majorly for my class.",0
"""Fatbody"" If you pay attention you will do fine, but this guy is so unorganized and out to lunch it's unbeleivable. some of the stuff he says will just make you dumber, he likes to make up his own words too which is kind of funny.",0
Honestly one of the best professors I have ever had...was nominated for instructor of the year soon after I had him.  Take this professor whenever possible!,1
"She is the worst professor I have ever had. All her exam questions are trick questions; since her grammar is poor to begin with, this makes getting an A very hard. Put of a class of 60+, we averaged one or two A's per exam. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!",0
"Dude's a walking meme, love it.",1
If you think organic chemistry is hard you thought wrong. This class content is easy but the professor needs to work on his presentation and come up with his lecture instead of reading off the slides word for word. If that were the case might as well just take this class online.,0
The class was enjoyable. Professor Lawson cares for his students and wants them to succeed.,1
"He spends a lot of time on talking and explaining the concepts which is good; however, he doesnt give time to explain it and show how it applies to everything. His accent makes it even harder",0
Mrs. Adams is a great IRW teacher! If you are ever confused about something just ask her she's very clear about it. I took her both for 0970 & 0980 and she's very easy to understand. Just show up to class and do the work you'll pass!,1
Professor Bratcher conducts zoom meetings for any student that has questions about the course. He also gives an opportunity for his students to earn extra credit.,0
"Started on campus, was very lecture heavy, speaking almost entirely in French from day one. Transitioned to an online course (Covid) and the lectures/teaching stopped for the most part. Zoom sessions were mainly review for what you learned on your own with VHL/HW. Offers little to no help outside of the classroom. Don't recommend.",0
"Online class is dreadful. She has no concept of design and should not be labeled as such. Does not give you the freedom to make an up to date website. Instead, she insists that your site be straight from the 90's. Class is unorganized. Rude when helping. Thinks you should already know. First web class was ok. This one is not.",0
"She made class very interesting, especially the 20 point days. She was able to be serious and joke around. I recommend her over anyone else.",1
"She does not teach. She rambles on about irrelevant topics and really does not enjoy being there in class. She basically just wants to get through the material and receive her paycheck. If you want to learn accounting, take someone else. You are stuck fending for yourself in this class, and it is not enjoyable. Easy due to ex cred, but not helpful.",0
"took him for an online classes. Very easy and manageable for a fulltime student with work and other things. only had four quizzes and no exam each quiz was 50-75 questions, pretty long but very easy. would recommend taking him if you want a smooth professor.",1
"please do not take her course. even if you just want to finish up the English series and she's the only prof with an open seat.... do not do it. there's a reason her classes never fill up. and if they do, trust in 2 weeks half the class will drop. just finish up your other breadth classes or wait until a better TA opens up a seat in their class.",0
"Her online class was amazing, super organized and fair. You get one writing assignment a week followed with a quick summary quiz on the lesson thats never over 10 questions. She always gives positive and informative feedback on assignments very quickly. Definitely will be trying to get another class with her in the future.",1
"Prof. O'Gorman was more than helpful during the entire class.  I travel for leisure and missed a few classes and he understood that life happens and ensured that I did the work but I was able to understand the work and stay up with the information.  I would definitely take this professor again.  He is not tough, he expects you to do the work. Fact.",1
"10-week course! There are a total of 5 exams but the last one is optional (will drop the lowest exam score if the 5th exam is taken and it covers chapter 1-17). The course is very easy and self explanatory: read the textbook, take good notes, and you should receive an A for each exam! HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COURSE!",1
she is the wort. she is an old and ugly teacher who needs to go home. the worst class I ever had in my life,0
Unfortunately when it came to quizzes/exams I felt like there were many arbitrary questions in them. Many questions required specific answers and his lectures were not clear enough. There were several assignments I submitted that he didn't even grade. He will blow up your email. He is also the creator of this course so he may be a tad particular.,0
"Well I was interested in the class till attending it turned into a recruitment session for the armed forces. It's packed full of lies and personal opinion, Seals don't make over 100k a year Randy. The fact that you lied to the class shows how uneducated on the subject you are.Just reply Word FOR WORD! from textbooks  and you should do fine.",0
"I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt and guess that her summertime switch to Canvas screwed things up, but it doesn't account for all of the negligence. As an online teacher, it is paramount to be responsive to emails. She has been thoroughly unresponsive and inaccessible. +tomorrow is the final day, and she's graded one assignment.",0
"If you are terrible at math like me but still want an A, he would be the best professor to choose. Homework and quizzes due every week. Exams are exactly like the quizzes and he gives you two tries so you can get your best score.",1
Probably the easiest speech class you can take. I loved the course and found it extremely interesting and not difficult at all! Gentry is fabulous and a really forgiving grader. Totally recommend!,1
"He does not go over prelab, he leaves the stuff on the counter tells you to read the manual with no direction. We weren't provided with the materials the lab manual states to use. When asked for help he just says ""read it"" repeatedly. Lectures are insufficient and criteria for what he wants is unclear. He had to curve his class very hard. Be warned",0
He doesnt have a good online class system.,1
The class was so hard. He graded the paper so hard i withdrew his class right after midterms. i don't recommend him,0
"WORST CLASS. RUN.  He does not use clear lecture plans or visual aids. He is bias and does not allow for academic opinions outside his own. He does not teach this class as a 200 level, and comes off condescending during class time and private meetings.",0
"She's a fair professor in terms of teaching and grading. However, if you don't attend and look at your phone during the semester, you WILL FAIL even if you do all the other work flawlessly. This class does not only teach history, but it teaches discipline to be on time and focus on the lecture. Also, participate, its a big chunk of your grade.",1
"Hilarious professor. Always going on a tangent about something! Don't take his class if you're easily offended. He says crazy things sometimes. For Western Civ 1 and 2, the only thing you get graded on are essays. There are about 5 each semester and they're straight-forward. Easy class with a silly teacher. P.S. Don't ask him about climate change!",1
Pretty whack professor. Class is basically unrelated to the homework which is from the book and the book is easily as whack as the professor himself. Very unclear about everything and the exams are brutal.,0
Very caring and respectable teacher. She is easy to relate to and understand. She made me understand why public speaking is an important and useful class to take. One of my favorite classes that I have ever had. She is one of the best teachers ever. Would recommend her to anyone and everyone!,1
"The class wasn't hard, the material was just dry. Powell was a great prof and always made himself available after class and answered his emails. He doesn't post notes online but if you read the chapter you'll be guaranteed at least a B-. 1 midterm, 1 final, weekly mini quizzes worth less than 1%, and a reflection paper with 6 1/2- 1 page entries",1
One of the least caring professors I have ever encountered. He. Does. Not. Care. He is downright rude to students. I once mistakenly addressed him as Mr. instead of Dr. and he replied very rudely. AVOID!,0
"You NEED to KNOW and INSTALL: Wireshark,Subnetting,NMAP, VMWare, How packets send/rec. He assigns Group projects every few weeks. Gives a HUGE curve at the end BUT he WILL EMAIL you to tell you that you need to DROP the course based on your Quiz,Midterm,etc. Study HW problems - Quiz is based on it. Write all he writes on board.IF LOST GoToHisOFFICE",0
there are only 2 tests in this class. midterm and final. he is an incredible person and there are 3 book discussions but theyre easy,1
"He is my lab instructor. He is sweet, but he is not going over what you have to do during a lab session. He takes off too many points just on your lab reports. His grading is bad. He doesn't help with lab questions.",0
"Senora Maniero Mena is a really good teacher. She tries her best to make sure everyone understands what they need to be doing and how to do it. If the material is confusing, she will gladly go over it with you more, and has office hours where she will essentially act as a tutor.",1
"“Best prof” at Hamilton?  Werner is smug, self-absorbed, and aloof, except to a few of his favorites.  He shows little interest in student opinions.  He plays mind games.  He penalizes students for not meeting his hidden expectations.  That all adds up to one lousy professor.  I got a decent grade from him, but I found him distasteful.  Avoid him.",0
"I took his online class and loved it. He provides all of the reading materials online. We had reading requirements for the week, discussions, and two essays. He gives great feedback, is extremely helpful, and gives plenty of time for everything. This is an honors class so the final was a presentation, but it's fairly easy for a college course.",1
Is awful with technology especially computers! He tells you what will be on the exams but is not really on them. And DO NOT EMAIL HIM! he is a nice guy but shouldn't be able to handle a classroom and make sure he gives you the right office hours,0
"Probably one of the worst professors in Carlson. His lectures are pretty pointless, especially after the online transition. Dude taught for 10 mins/100 minute lectures before putting us in breakout rooms to do ICEs. He is comparable to Alex Wilson in how he would rephrase a sentence to fit his mold. Take 3202 with literally anyone else please",0
"I have had Dr. Vanderzalm more than once as a professor and she is great.  It is extremely important to attend all of her classes, but they keep you on your toes and her notes system is clear and keeps you engaged.  Make sure you ask questions because it is part of your grade and actually hurts it quite a bit if you don't ask anything.  Take her",1
"Hard not to pass! She gives 6 quizzes (provides an outline with all of the answers) and 4 essays, minimum 500 words, easy grader.",1
"Lovely human being and teacher. She is a teacher and a friend, which is rare  Always there for you and inspires you to do your best. This was my first ASL class and now I am a deaf studies major. Hope to have her in level 3",1
Mr Holt was an excellent teacher & the class was super easy.I'd recommend him to everyone!!!!,1
"Prof. Ams is among the worst teachers I have ever had. He has no idea how to teach. He just stands in front of the room and talks at the class. He draws rxn mechanisms, but I don't feel like he ever explains why things are happening the way they are. I would not recommend Ams to anyone. I am certainly going to avoid his classes from now on.",0
"She has the ability to be a decent teacher. When shes there... Shes ok at explaining things, nothing special. The problem is this. SHES NEVER THERE. shes missed 9+ days this semester, including on quiz days, and before them. Teaches it like a highschool course.",0
"This is a pretty easy class but Dr. Sullivan is really disorganized which can make it harder. Almost the entire grade is based on a project which although easy is very time consuming and feels like a bunch of busy work. He's a very cool professor though, definitely your stereotypical quirky professor.",0
Get him out of here. Trevecca would be a better place without him.,0
"SCOM123 was one of the hardest classes I've had this semester, and it's clear that most scom classes aren't hard at all. Dr. Barnes is a very tough grader and her teaching style is very confusing. If you're considering taking her online- DON'T. I'm not sure how she is in person, but being in her online class sucked. SCOM should not be this hard.",0
Prof Hurley is a great professor who makes Accounting a fun subject to learn! Comes up with little tricks to make sure you understand the content. Goes off topic a bit but tells funny stories. Midterm/Final and participation in class that make up the grade. Attendance not mandatory as long as you do the work! If you want to learn though show up!,1
Prof. Carter does a great job of using humor to make everyone relaxed and comfortable. By the end of the semester the entire class had improved as speakers and Prof. Carter is the reason why.,1
"WInslow was one of my favorite classes out of my two semesters at USC. He is very passionate about science fiction, and if you are not, the course material may be difficult to get into. If you are interested in sci-fi or ""what makes us human"" discussion, this class is AMAZING. He's also very personable and flexible when we had tough weeks",1
"Chances are, you are taking 282 with Benny because you have to. The class is difficult, and Benny does not make it easier. That being said, if you ask for help, advocate for yourself, Benny will make your life easier. The textbook is wonderful. Benny will teach you. He will not be your best professor, but he will not be your worst either.",1
"If you have little interest in math and are expecting an easy A from an online course, FORGET ABOUT IT! This class is by far the most challenging class. The quizzes are hard and the exams, well forget about that too because it's no material you've gone over. I would never recommend this class to anyone!",0
"If you like hard tests that aren't like the lectures, and thick accents, Singh is the man for you",0
"For a Business Communication class that teaches how to communicate to stakeholders, Ball was surprisingly awful at communicating  contradicting information between Blackboard announcements, emails, and written notes, and had projects that required so much effort for so little grade weight. He's a great speaker, lecturer, and person, but.... yikes.",0
"Professor Royce always made a point to understand and connect with his students, especially when Covid was mucking with everyone's life. His lectures were a little dull, but the course was easy enough that skimming through notes got you through. Beware that this course had a large portion of the grade on one semester long group project.",1
"The worst professor ever! Beyond unclear and choose favorites . she keeps you the full double period. When you ask her for help, you a have to harass her for it. Homework readings every week and well as a group project and big final assignment. DO NOT TAKE HER! She also has an attitude.",0
"She's a funny and kind professor. She curves exams, gives extra credit, very helpful when asking questions. This class is alot of work and studying time but it's doable if you have other heavy load classes. Its all about time management. I recommend a week before the exam to study. She's picky and detailed but overall, she's great w Anatomy!",1
"Goes over the material clearly before practical exams, and really wants you to do well. If you study, its easy to get a good grade",1
Emails long reading assignments/outlines an hour before class with many unused pages for you to print out. Doesn't go in depth more than social mobility of a specific time period. Avoid teacher at all costs.,0
"Maria is awesome. 224 was a class that I dreaded and really wanted to take it with a good professor. I am so happy I went with Hegbloom. Her class was fun and she made the work tolerable for such a dry subject. If you still have to take 224, I recommend Maria. She will push you to become a better researcher and a better writer.",1
"I had high hopes for this class, but Maria is a really strange professor. She assigns papers that she ""sort of hates,"" and we can't figure her out. I desperately want to like her, but her abrasive attitude and how she treats anyone with a question like they're stupid is quite off-putting. Easy A; not-so-great professor.",0
"Quinlan is an amazing professor to have. He WANTS you to get a good grade and he helps you do so. His classes are almost all note taking, but you don't need the book! Pay attention to the notes and understand them because it's exactly what the test is on. Overall he's a sweetheart professor that just wants to see you succeed. TAKE HIM!",1
Fantastic lecturing and quizzing!,1
Took him for the 12 week session over the summer. He is very transparent about what to know for quizzes and exams. Quizzes were usually once or twice a week. He knows what students might get tripped up on and takes his time to explain and show details. Uses course reserves and brings in printouts. He made an often dreaded class enjoyable.,1
"Alan is an amazing Teacher, as an alumni I can still reach out to him  for career advice .",1
"Pay attention to the questions he asks in class, and on field trips... understand the question as much as the answer",0
"Professor Morris was my lab professor for a 4 credit CSNP lecture/lab class. As far as lab assignments went, he was a very gracious and forgiving grader. Our lab classes were guided, so attendance wasn't required . Morris was still there every day, giving help to anyone who needed it. He always had all the right answers, great professor.",1
"Zinkevich doesn't write her own exams, follows a predetermined grading system, and doesn't cover material on those exams. She will not conduct lab during lab times, and is near impossible to understand with her heavy accent. Avoid this woman like the plague. ",0
Professor Luallen is fantastic. So clear and enthusiastic. One of my best professors. Tests are hard though.,1
"This was supposed to be about literary study and instead I got stuck with learning about love and hate and society which was weird. The books she chooses are dumb, she's a hard grader, she's very unorganized and I just didnt get what her point was.",0
Expects too much of undergrads in mixed-level classes.,1
"I honestly do not even know where to start. - Her teaching is all over the place. - She is very confused when she is teaching and therefore her exams are also confusing - Does not like when people go to the bathroom or are 1 minute late to class, even though she is late most of the time - I am an A student but got a very low grade with her.",0
Not too inspirational. Very by the book. Could stand to liven class up a bit since it's math and math is not that great to begin with! All in all he's a nice guy just not very riveting.,0
"Prof. Sgro is a great professor.  She is nice and very helpful.  LOTS OF GROUP WORK...Was not very responsive to emails at times, but if you show up and do the work, you'll pass.",1
Got A's on every exam yet got a B for the final grade because I missed numerous clicker quizzes and in-class activities.. material not hard but you HAVE to go to class to get an A...,0
Was not a fan of this class or professor. Very dry lectures that were essentially read from the textbook verbatim and not engaging whatsoever. I took this class during COVID and the entire course was just multiple choice tests... Try a different professor if you actually want to enjoy this class.,0
So many surprises in class. If you take your lab summary notes to Kennedy Space Center or MOSI you can get two backstage passes. Also he has a secret word of the day that if someone guesses it correctly he will record the voice mail in a Jar Jar Binks Voice who is doing an impression of Rodney Dangerfield.,1
"Jennie will make all of your dreams come true, one week it's a take home quiz, the next is a group quiz. Always there to help and tests are easy if you study! ",1
"Not terribly difficult, though her final exam was somewhat overdone. Her grading is in fact subjective, and her lectures are both boring and do a terrible job of actually communicating the information. Having her for 101 made 102 a real pain because we learned so little compared to the other 101 classes. Avoid her at all costs.",0
She wouldn't cut me some slack and bump my D+ to a C- just so I could pass during the coronavirus pandemic. Overall she's a good professor but I just wish she was a little more understanding.,0
"Not my favorite guy but if you just show up to class, take notes and pay attention you will be really well off.",1
"He is very nice and explains the material thoroughly (his diagrams are the best!). His quizzes are open book. Overall, excellent professor!",1
If you can I would recommend taking this course with another professor. She is extremely disorganized and doesn't follow the syllabus because she is always making a bunch of changes to it. Then she doesn't tell us directly what these changes are til the last minute. If you take her class be ready to always be confused by what's going on.,0
"If you want to be coddled, then go to your Mommy's School of Journalism. If you want to be a great TV journalist, take Prof. Brown's class. He will push you to be better than you thought you could be. He'll prepare you for real life, where people don't care about your excuses. He is also hilarious.",1
His lectures aren't that boring they can actually be pretty interesting even if you don't like science. You take 4 major tests and some quizzes. Quizzes are easy. Not too much hw. You have to actually study for the tests tho bc they can be hard but he gives you a study guide.,1
"Prof Yonker is a pretty good english teacher. She makes you work for it. Not too hard, but enough to challenge you and improve your writing skills. For the most part she is organized but sometimes she changes due dates. Overall easy, just work and accept her feedback. She gives extra credit opportunities. Take adv of them.",1
Professor Jones was one of the worst professors I have ever had! She gives awful feedback and gives awful in class instruction. She basically gave us a paper and expected us to do it without help. The help she did give was useless. I asked one question and she answered every question in the book besides the question that I asked.,0
"Dr. Provost is an incredible professor. His lectures are the best I've had in my four years of university. His courses are not easy, but they are truly interesting and worth the work. I would take this course again in a heartbeat. Go to class and participate in the discussion!",1
This class is not an easy 'A'. The work load is excessive. I believe she is posting her own reviews on this site.,0
"great lady, she really cares about the material she's teaching and whether or not the students understand.",1
It's hard to put a bad rating for this professor because he cares and could potentially bring so much to the class with life experiences. Although he didn't really teach and thinks all problems are trivial for a first time dynamics student. Multiple choice tests are lazy and unfair in my eyes for an engineering student. Don't expect it to change,0
Raja is a little difficult to understand in class. She is passionate about Finance but very quick teacher. She tries to please everyone and be helpful! She gives attendance points. At the end of the semester she bumps your grade up a bunch. Don't drop and she will pass you!!!,1
"I feel like I didn't learn anything in this course. Takes forever to respond to e-mails. She canceled class several times. Does not keep up with grading. Before the end of the semester I had a B, then when she started grading labs AFTER grades were due, I barely even passed. I worked so hard in this course for nothing!",0
"Best professor I've ever taken! I took him for Design 1 and I learned so much. He gives great feedback, you just have to put in the work. You have to participate in class, make sure to read the assigned readings. Out of the 15 weeks of class, two of them I didn't have an extreme amount of homework. His lectures were AMAZING and he's very caring.",1
"Mrs. McNiel is a very kind and sweet teacher, and really knows how to make you feel comforatble before giving a speech. She always has a smile on and is very easy and understanding to talk to. She was also very accomodating during the online switch and significantly reduced the number of assignments. I would love to have her again if I could!",1
Fabulous instructor! She was so understanding and even prayed for her students daily. Very encouraging and unbelievably accessible outside of class. She knew the information and was excited to share it with students.,1
She has a very Unfair grading structure. Your grade basically depends on her mood. I got an F for a course in which I put more effort / hours of studying than my 400 level computer science courses. Just awwwwfullll,0
"don't take class with him..he didn't give easy grade,and also he think you are teaching for parageraph,and i think this system for english teaching in palomar college is very bad..",0
"Words cannot describe how terrible this class was, take Mrs. Pickham if you want to have a chance at passing speech.  And if you do for some reason take this class, be ready to hate your life, dont come in 1 minute late, dont fidget while giving your speech and make sure to let her know i hate her guts, thanks.",0
"I failed his class, It was super hard and his exams was hard also. will not take again ",0
"Nice guy but horrible teaching method. I had to drop the class because I fell way behind. Hes alwars confused, and its hard to follow along because he is really boring. He does try to lighten up the class by going off topic here and there.",0
She was super helpful always and really cared that we learned. Really only had two big group projects and that's it.,1
I took her online for English 101. Professor Bailey was a great communicator and kept us all up to date on the upcoming assignments as well as reminders. She was responsive and gives full credit for the Journals and Discussions as long as you participate. 5 essays and 10 Journals on one novel. Great instructor!,1
she is passionate about sociology but it was difficult to share any opinion that wasn't what we were supposed to think. i got through it fine but wish we had the chance to be open in the classroom with different opinions.,0
"The class was online, you had to respond to a discussion once a week, and had 3 days to complete a 8 page papers. Take her if you don't mind all of your weekends disappearing.",0
The worst structure ever! she can't even speak in English fluently... she can't teach and she is awful for master level! Unfortunately she is teaching the most important course in Econ!!!!,0
Great teacher. Very organized. Everything is on the syllabus. As long as you do all your homework and your essays on time you will get a good grade.,1
"This professor was amazing this semester. She goes out her way to help you the best way she can for understanding the math problems. Clear and precise solutions, I would advice anyone to take her class, you will not regret it.",1
"Has an accent but it is not hard to understand. Homework is assigned every week & you have 1 week to do it. His test are similar to the review handouts he places on his website, but do not ONLY use those to study, refer back to the HW too. HW is all on the interweb. After the first exam, things get a lot harder. Try to take a different professor.",0
"Was not a fan at all of the class and material. R is hard and confusing, as with the other programs. Not a good class or really a good teacher.",0
"Prof V. is a really nice guy & he knows a TON about geology, but isn't always the best at presenting it. For an intro class it was assumed that we already knew more than we did. He talks fast & crams lots of slides into a lecture, you have to write fast. Tests are HARD but if you study you can do well. Nice guy, gets along with students. Lots of EC",1
"Assigns on average 8 hours of homework per week for a 2 credit course, and just rescheduled an exam to the day before it was supposed to happen, with 2 hours of notice.",0
"Stop her and ask her questions, she will help you. She allowed people who took her online class to visit the class and vice versa if you missed a day in class. She was telling me she did have exams emailed to her but it was more of a hassle then asking people to come in to class to take the exam. tho i agree online should stay online. Nice teacher.",1
"Very quiet teacher and it seemed like he didn't know what he was talking about half of the time. He just read off of slides. He mentioned class is pointless, but it's just a prerequisite. 60% of the grade is from exams; he gives study guides, but the exams are nothing like the study guides. He curves class average to a 75% on exams and final.",0
The courses I have taken with him are all poorly organized. He would spend one class deriving a formula on the board for you and thinks that he is doing a marvelous job helping you understand. Most of the time he is overcomplicating things making his lectures a waste of time. He has a major stuttering problem and would rather just write equations.,0
"This class is supposed to be an easy A because no one cares about classics, we only do it for requirements. Lectures are like watching paint dry, some of the TFs are hardos and dont let you go on your phone, youll get points docked on your assignments for arbitrary reasons. Theres a lot of extra credit though and and that can save you from an A-",0
"He knows absolutely everything about music.  His tests are impossible, although he does curve them.  Impossible to get an A, altho a B isn't too hard.  Very witty.",1
"DO NOT TAKE SENSATION AND PERCEPTION. YOU WILL REGRET!!! hes a cool dude, but theres only three tests and thats the only grades you receive. The tests are almost impossible to pass, so if you're willing to focus all your attentionwork on this ELECTIVE, take this class.",0
"This class was ABSOLUTELY awful. If you like not having curves, extra credit, or even being considered for partial credit, take this class.",0
"He talks down to his students; it feels like you're in elementary school. All of the assignments are busy-work. He tries to lead discussions, but they always fizzle. Very boring, poorly organized, and too many assignments you don't learn from.",0
"It's all been said already. He is very knowledgible, but doesn't know how to teach it to students.",0
"Pillai is a great professor who is very intelligent about French and French culture. I think if you understand the language she likes you, but she easily gets annoyed with her students and expects people to speak fluently. It seems she forgets we are students learning the language. Homework wasn't too bad, but she is a very critical grader.",1
"Nathan is the best professor I've ever taken at UR! He's super down to earth and really believes in the subject content of the course! He's super flexible as well. There are no hard deadlines, and he allows students to resubmit assignments. The course is reading heavy but it really adds to the discussion and content of the course! Simply Amazing!",1
Had him for summer ochem 1 and was blown away. Unlike every other stem professor Ive had he actually cares more about teaching students than his own research and is willing to go above and beyond to make sure you comprehend everything. Definitely take his class if you have the option,1
"She is a great teacher, her class is very interesting and there is a lot of customization to what you want. Asks and cares what you have to say. Lots of group work which is nice and she is very understanding",1
"This guy is a joke of a teacher. He took us on a mandatory field trip that was suppose to end at 5pm, but due to his own inability to schedule properly, forced us to stay until 9pm. Other things are his over sensitivity to being challenged. He is not understanding at all either. He's gone downhill in the last couple of years.",0
"The professor refuses to accept late work or absences, and yet expects others to under stand his. Very impatient and lacks the teaching ability to instruct lost students. He is extremely knowledgeable in his field of work, but should not teach.",0
"Old school teacher, monotone voice. Lectures are pretty long and boring but informative. Essays are easy to write about -- does a peer edits in class. Attendance is optional but recommended. Understanding about giving extensions. ",1
"I know its the pandemic, but he hasn't taught half of the year and moved the due dates or cancelled half of the work for this class. I was hoping to learn something in this class but feel this was a complete waste of my time. Take him if you want an easy A without having to work for it.",0
"Attendance is not graded but he only posts the slide from lecture, most of which have a few words on them. If you don't go to lecture you will never know what is going on. He does include pictures on all of his exams that you have to identify from the lecture slides as well.",1
Even though she talks really fast and her test are super hard. She is a awesome teacher i liked her alot. She would stay after and help me with anything i didnt understand. She gives out extra credit and curves her tests which help alot. I recommend her.....and she has a great personality !,1
"This professor, doesnt teach anything about English. He goes and explains History. Nothing to do with English!",0
Do not take this class... Professor was not good at telling students what they need and don't need to know. Wasted countless hours studying material that I would never need to know because she said we would.,0
"I had him for Organic Chemistry two semesters. I think I only looked at the book twice for both semesters. He outlines in the syllabus exactly what you need to do, the homework and powerpoints provide everything for the tests. Everyone told me Organic was going to be one of the hardest classes I faced, but he made it super easy.",1
"Worst I've ever had. She doesn't give any bullet points for the tests, the material is extremely long with tons of new scientific terms. She reviews the chapters AFTER the test is taken, which proves her lack of professionalism. Gives you Ds and Fs no matter how well you do the homework and refuses to give clear explanaitons. She will ruin your GPA",0
I'm currently taking her course online and it's literally the worst online class I've ever taken. I can't keep up with the readings or the assignments. There's no explanation on most work and the modules are hard to understand. I wouldn't recommend anyone to EVER take this class.,0
"UNclear grading criteria. Depends if he likes you or not, as a big component is participation. Never received a full grading breakdown. Class is unorganized at times. He has good connections though.",0
Homework is more of a suggestion since it isn't collected and is therefore worth 0% of your grade. Grade is determined by 2 midterms and a final exam. The exams pretty much cover what is in his lectures and lectures are very proof heavy. He often gets off topic talking about physics problems that are loosely related to lecture material.,0
"Professor is very knowledgeable about the history of Mexico and his lectures are engaging and informative. Class films were very interesting and easy to write about. He is such a great professor, easy/fair grader and overall such a sweetheart that cares about all students.",1
"Dr. Miller is a great professor. His lectures are straightforward and are as entertaining and interesting as they can be, given the material. He grades fairly, and if you follow his instructions, you will do just fine on the assignments. He legitimately cares about each of his students, and it shows in the way he talks and interacts with them.",1
Super tough grader. should have been a math teacher. He is a nice guy and his lectures are interesting but the tests and homework contain hard questions and he is strict when it comes to grading. Avoid,0
"Tests are difficult, make sure you review the slideshows and notes. Ask her for help in office hours, and communicate your situation to her actively. She will help you out if you put in the time and effort. She really enjoys learning about various sciences, it's definitely something she's personally invested in. She cares about her students.",1
"Professor Nyla Khan is amazing. She gives meaning to ""critical thinking"". If you are looking for an easy grade, she is not the prof for you. She will call on you in class, and expect you to have an answer. She WILL improve your ability to read, write, and comprehend. She is the hardest professor I have had, but her praise when earned is genuine.",1
Terrible terrible teacher,0
A top-notch professor! She was completely knowledgeable in the field and the clicker tool sharpened my listening skills beyond belief (and was fun too!)! I was totally interested and NEVER bored in this class! DO NOT believe any negative comments posted about her. Her teaching style is untouchable! Only regret: she only teaches one class at RIC!,1
"You won't find professors as caring as Professor Yaping Wang in the engineering department. Her #1 goal is to see students succeed in her class. It really bothers her when exam grades are bad, and does what she can to help students. I personally found the exams a little challenging, but not unreasonable. HW and quizzes about every 2 weeks. Take her",1
Ms Hutton talks in a monotone voice and makes you feel like falling asleep. She flies through the powerpoint and is unclear about assignments. If you miss a class or come in late she marks it down and drops a letter grade..that's what happened to me. If I had taken EDUC 101 with her I would have been turned off to teaching. Take Kimberly Bell!,0
"No clear grading criteria, extremely unclear and confusing. Not sure why she changed the syllabus last minute. Unfair.  3 presentations, weekly exams,  1 debate, tons of readings, take home work and 1 final.  try a different course if you are NOT a history major. Work load is unreasonable ",0
Great guy... just need to show up for class and put some time into the work.,1
"I took Historic Papermaking and Book Structure in Fall and I learned so much from Gail, and I ended up with so many amazing books and handmade paper! It's quite a bit of work, but nothing more than expected from a standard studio class. Would definitely take again! Gail is a great resource.",1
"Do NOT take this professor. He is very unaccommodating and goes back on his word, said he would accept an assignment, then didn't. He says he cares about his students but does nothing to show that. He even went out of his way to make class SIGNIFICANTLY harder on his students once we changed to all online in the Spring 2020 semester due to COVID-19",0
"Should not be a professor. He does not ramble on for 2 12 hours, he RANTS. Is not a fair grader at all when it comes to the case study that barely are a part of your grade. Have to do a ridiculous case study on Nucor that you need to site your sources for. Easy midterm. the BSG game isn't simple but doable. Would not recommend, take someone else.",0
"Professor Montero is great! You must know her ID's (vocabulary) it is a must. Tests are fairly easy, most of the test questions come from the PowerPoint she uses to lecture and the ID's. I never read the textbook even though she really encourages you to do so and I still did fine. You have to present 2 current event articles. ",1
"While he is very knowledgeable in the arts, his teaching style is very mundane, so much so that it makes you disengaged in the learning process. I wouldn't suggest his class unless you are an art major, as the lecture is pretty heavy and there is a fair amount of reading involved. I also found him to be a tough grader, more than he needs to be.",0
"Material was straight forward, doesn't assign much work and the work is fairly simple. Very lenient professor, would definitely take her again.",1
Professor Askren taught in a lecture hall of 50+ students as if it were a class of 15. Class was dedicated to aimless discussions which veered wildly from the topic of the day.  Attendance was checked irregularly but are very important. Just do all the assignments and some extra credit and you'll pass. Provided little feedback. I wouldn't recommend,0
"If you want to gain knowledge and are interested in Cultural Anthropology or another Anthropology in general amazing, passionate prof. and a class I'd to take again. Fast talker, but will repeat anything if you ask him too. Reading quizzes which you really have to read assigned articles to get a good grade :) ",1
The first and the best professor I have ever met,1
"I blame Margo, but I also blame the class. The theories she teaches are dated. If she's to teach them, it should be with a critical eye... she just explains them with these lengthy lists of examples. And, yes, her voice is really annoying.",0
The instructor was out of touch with how online students work and did not provide clear guidance as to what was required and when it was required. There was a lack of responsiveness to issues and a tendency to blame his insufficiency and lack of communication on the students.,0
"Honestly there were more than once that he was an outright ass to students. He had the attitude show up on time and stay all class or don't show up at all, even if the doctors appointment at that time was unavoidable. He teaches teaches to the fastest person in the room, and sometimes doesn't teach what's actually on D2Lquizes. Never again for me.",0
"Absolutely love this class. Do not underestimate the work for it, though, there's a lot. Incredible professor",1
"He's not great at lecturing. He has clicker questions, so attendance is mandatory. His tests are taken from the examples in the book, just with different numbers. If you get the right idea in tests, but the wrong numbers he'll give you most of the credit. Tests are typically 3-5 problems with about 3 parts to each. There's also homework on Pearson.",0
"Excellent professor. Wants her to students to understand the course topics. However, Cotes grading strategy is hard to come to terms with. Double check your work! Also, a friendly tip will be: dont email her about a question you received no credit for on your exam or quiz, she will review your whole exam and maybe deduct more points.",0
"I don't know what all these negative reviews are, this class was very simple. Read a chapter in the book, answer a few questions for homework that are basically directly quoted from the book. The teacher is really helpful and shows you everything. Probably one of my favorite classes and teachers out of all my time in school, no reason to fail.",1
Read straight from the powerpoints all semester and did nothing to make the class interesting. Attendance is mandatory so you actually have to sit through the class.,0
"Worst teacher I've ever had, homework is worth the most in her class and she grades it extremely hard, DO NOT SIGN UP FOR HER CLASS,  I showed up for every class, did every homework, and passed every test with a B- or higher. I'm a honor student and she failed me",0
Do not take her she teaches at an advance level  and goes way too fast in lecture . If you struggle in math I suggest you find another teacher.,0
"5 week online summer course. Read a few chapters/articles and maybe watch a video per week. Discussion board and responses due on Thursday, quiz on Friday. Do the reading and you'll pass. Independent course. Professor is responsive via email.",1
By far the best class I have ever taken at this institution. Professor was so excited and into teaching that it made it great to come to class.  I would HIGHLY recomend anybody to take any of his classes. Keep up on the reading and tests are a breeze.,1
Lecture notes are not very helpful. He is a very good guy but doesnt give very meaningful notes.,0
good teacher work load is insane but if your not taking alot of classes youll do fine,1
"Professor Liberatore is the best. Prior to taking her class, I was unfamiliar with how to form a strong and arguable thesis. However, she changed that by explaining in detail about the ""They Say, I Say"" format. This class consists of: the discipline analysis project, in class quizzes, homework assignments, and a 5-6 page paper about an issue.",1
"Kristi is very friendly but she sucks at replying to emails, she grades everything months later. Is confusing when explaining the papers she assigns. Exams are ridiculously difficult would not take again.",0
"If you want to take a class with a professor who is basically computer illiterate, gives tons of tests and has ambiguous grading criteria then this is the one! Also her office is located off campus and she is so busy with her psychology practice she does not have time for instructing the courses she teaches.",0
Great adjuster. He really helps students reach their adjusting goals. It is refreshing to have a genuinely nice person as a professor!,1
Fun teacher. Make sure you go to class (on time) and don't get on her bad side...,1
"His classes are a combination of ethology, human psychology, biopsychology, and research psychology.  If you are not serious about the subject then you are in the wrong class.  If you want to be a well rounded psychologist/ethologist/bio or neuro psychologist/research psychologist then you need to at least attend some of his lectures.",1
"If you are in a sorority, fraternity or want to have any other kind of a social life; do not take her. Her class is very test heavy and if you do not have a strong background in chemistry and biology you will not pass. You will be studying for this class every day. If you dont, you fail. Her test questions are tricky. 5 tests including the final.",0
"We do 2-3 sections, online and handwritten homework for those 2-3 sections, online forum posts, & have a test/ ""quiz""(1hr long, 2 pages) in class weekly. We meet for 1 class a week in which she answers 5-6 homework questions before we have the quiz/test. Have to study all material on your own, theres no lecture at all. Wouldn't recommend this class",0
"More than half of the class dropped her class and out of 12 of us that were left, about 4 of us had to email the dean about her behavior. On the final she said we have to show work even on multiple choice question b/c if we dont we wont receive credit. Takes points off labs for things such as commas and dots. Also has an envy towards girls",0
"Chemistry is a hard subject anyways, but some things he does make easy for you. I personally found his tests to be very difficult. He's a good lecture teacher though, tries to be funny and lightens the mood. I learned more from him than my high school teacher.",1
"She got rid of extra credit. She prepares you well for the exams, but the final is a huge curveball so expect tears",0
"heavy on the online work.appears easy until its too late to drop. very misleading. inconsistent and disorganized. she posted 2 online tests without enough notice and for such a small window that i was at work for entire duration of the quizzes. she didn't care at all. wiley pus had so many errors in ""correct answers"" that it was hard to pass",0
"Explains everything clearly. If homework is completed, the tests will be easy. Overall a great teacher that wants her students to succeed",1
Well organized; gives good constructive feedback; asks thoughful and probing questions; very supportive.,1
"She explained simple things in really confusing ways, genetics was easy, but she explained everything out of order with no good explanations of anything. She also gives two ten minute breaks in lecture then speeds through all the material to the point where you can barely write fast enough let alone understand the material.",0
ok,0
"Not thorough. I am a very rigorous studier and, after giving it my all, I still felt I didn't understand. He doesn't seem to understand his own class! Unfortunate that he is the only one teaching ochem2 @ OCCC. My advice - take it somewhere else.",0
"Worst class ever! She never puts grades in on time, or sometimes she doesn't even put your grades in. The grade you get on assignments is based on if she likes you. I did the same work as this other girl and i got a 60 while she got a 100. So basically, if you're not the kind to want to be a teacher's pet, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!",0
"One of the best professors at Rutgers that actually teaches. He is there to help his students through email, office hours, etc. He sends many emails. Make sure you read them because they are VERY helpful. His notes and practice problems are very detailed. Do his practice problems and you'll be guaranteed to pass chem.",1
"Bro, she makes everything sooo confusing. She's monotone making classes super boring & it makes you hate math. She's sort of nice sometimes but sometimes she's super rude if you don't understand something. You have mad homework and the only way you'll actually figure out how to do anything is by going to tutors or using the tutor button on hawkes.",0
She is a  tough grader. I  won't take any class with her in future . She really wants that student get low grades. Pre Calc is  easy but she made it too hard.,0
He's gonna weed you out at the beginning,1
I decide to take Stats with professor because she had really good rating.... her teaching skills are awful and always has typo in her lecture notes. Her homework is useless when it comes it studying so much work for nothing....,0
"Relatively easy professor, as long as you attend class everyday and do ALL the work (LONG reading assignments, 15pg single spaced papers, etc) Absolutely does not like people who skip class. Also expects students to do some outside research on reading assignments without being asked. Once you figure out what she wants, her course is fairly easy.",1
Emari DiGiorgio is by far one of the best professors at Stockton. She takes time with her students and really makes the classroom a positive enviornment. Emari is very understanding and always looks out for her students and what is in their best interest. The only professor/educator I've had that makes an effort and goes out of her way to help!,1
The best class to take for Art 1010. Take him and you wont fail. Hes understanding and very funny. He is a good person and we got to go to a museum because of him. Very peaceful and hes passionate about photography and cinematography. He was my favorite teacher this semester. This is your best choice.,1
"He sometimes responds to emails, I have one that's sitting 6 days not responded to at the moment. He missed two of our classes in a row with no forewarning. His lectures were very awkward, and not useful to the class. There was a required text book but it was online and free; Reading it is necessary for the Midterm and Final, but not the lectures.",0
Has a problem with running on and on and he can get confusing.,1
He's is a really nice guy but his class is way too hard. The quizzes are doable but his tests are impossible if you are not a naturally born history person. I was a 4.0 student in high school and ended up with a C in the class (my only C). Avoid his class if possible but if you must take his class DO ALL THE EXTRA CREDIT OPPORTUNITIES.,0
At first I was like OMG what did i get myself into. I thought he was a really nice guy. Gives work but he is really helpful if he sees you are trying. He tends to ramble off and loves to listen to himself talk.,1
I HATE public speaking but this class was amazing! You do have to find 12 people for your speeches! There's 3 speeches and she breaks them down to help. It did take a while for her to get grades in but she mentioned health problems at the beginning of the semester. She wants you to pass and her assignments show that. 10/10 recommend!,1
His tests are very very hard. His lectures are extremely long and difficult to follow. He does not use powerpoint or anything for his lectures. It is also very difficult to keep a good grade in his class. Would not take him again.,0
"I was excited coming into this class, but quickly realized it would be one of the worst classes I've taken at MSU. I don't feel the lectures accurately represent what he tests on. He is a touch grader and wants you to extrapolate your own answers from the little info he does give. Hard to get ahold of through email. All around a bit of a let down.",0
"Very enthusiastic and a helping teacher. If you're borderline passing, she'll tell you to meet her so she can redirect your method of studying. Cool teacher",1
Makes you earn your grades.,1
"Its very tough to do well here unless youre a native speaker. Favoritism is rampant & melanin seems to interfere with his hearing aids. The more you have, the less you are heard. The grading criteria varies without warning & you will not know how your grade will turn out until its already over. Take his overall rating literally.",0
"Dr. Morgan is so awesome and such a great teacher. He is super thorough and detailed too. He goes slow, and is willing to write out details on the board.",1
"Ive taken a few of her classes, if you do the work you pass but she is a very frustrating professor. Since she is an abstract artist, she wants every piece to be abstract (regardless of the prompt) and will change your idea herself to suit what she thinks is good. She also plays favorites and can be rude at times. Worst art teacher Ive ever had.",0
"She grades more on English than the content of the class. You write a paper including all of the information needed but she doesn't like your delivery you get a D automatically. She doesn't care if you have other classes, she gave 2 papers in a week, one over a move the other over a book. Her discussion board posts requirements are also ridiculous.",0
Great teacher. He has so many stories that help make an otherwise boring (but important) subject enjoyable. Make sure to get involved in his lectures as he grades you on participation (PLUS IT HELPS YOU LEARN!). He is very kind and open to helping you with questions or even just talking to you about life.,1
"Easy Bc all Homework, quizzes and tests are online. She's hard to understand and gets easily confused. At the end of the semester she opened every assignment back up to give students a chance to repair their grade.",0
He teaches you nothing but curves exams heavily. Expect to teach yourself chemistry (which is a hard subject),0
hard teacher and can be rude at times so watch out,0
"Professor Mason was an incredibly difficult professor, and he was totally worth it. He is hilarious, offers great lectures, and teaches to the individual. He's accessible outside of class and extremely helpful to students who seek him out.",1
"My favorite professor ever! his class is never boring, he knows his stuff, and he's considerate towards his students. If steve martin was an agronomist this would be him. I can't tell you enough how much I love being around this guy.",1
"Paper heavy class, only a couple of exams. You have to work with your group to run an experiment and write a manuscript on it. No attendance but a lot of in class assignments for a lot of points. miss one and your grade drops. Very nice and funny.",1
ABSOLUTELY UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS OF HER STUDENTS. GOD FORBID YOU HAVE A PROBLEM IF YOU DO KEEP IT TO YOURSELF. WAS GETTING AN A IN HER COURSE UNTIL I HAD AN ISSUE NOW SHE RIPS ALL MY WORK APART AND GIVES POOR GRADES FOR THE SAME WORK I WAS GETTING A's FOR PRIOR. IF YOU GET STUCK WITH HER CHANGE IT IMMEDIATELY!!!!!!!,0
"Dr. Vohs is great. He's a brilliant professor in my opinion. He's the best lecturer I've taken to date, he's clear and concise, he has good analogies to help students understand what he's teaching. He really dislikes swearing, so avoid swearing in front of him (I accidentally dropped a swear word and now he isn't particularly fond of me)",1
Professor Dunham assigns weekly homework on MyMathLab that tend to go beyond his lectures in class. 5 tests make or break your grade and if you miss one you must rely on your final test score to make it up. HW is over 150 (5pt) Mastery quizzes you must get 66% or above to get credit. Started with almost a full Class and only seven or eight remain.,0
Loved this professor. She had clear criteria of what she wanted. She deeply cares about and loves history and teaches like it. She tries to find cheaper textbooks to save money. She also will always listen to you and try to work with you if something is going on. She's a great professor and would take again.,1
"The workload felt like a six credit course and I was not prepared for all the reading. You have to read the very difficult textbook to do the weekly quizzes but don't need it for the final, which is annoying. Studied an hour every day for the whole summer while working full-time and got an A so it's not impossible, it just won't be easy.",0
Her class is the best in my opinion she makes all the classes interesting and she cracks a few jokes here and there. Makes sure you attend all the classes or else you miss the concept for the next class meeting.,1
"I absolutely loved Mrs. Jimmerson. I'm taking her next quarter for Advanced Grammar and cannot wait. She is fun, tells interesting stories that relate to the topic and is the most brilliant English professor I've had. I could talk sports with her for hours, even though she is a Yankees fan.",1
Prof. Parsons was a pretty cool teacher. I took his arts and crafts course and it is mostly drawing and painting. One of the biggest assignment of the class is a book that you draw/paint and then bind it yourself.  It's a cool class because you work with lots of new mediums. but be ready to spend around 80$ on supplies. but there is no textbook,1
"Professor Thomas-Reid is by far one of my favorite professors. He makes sure to make a safe space for everyone. He is one of the most caring and genuine professors I have ever had. He truly cares about his students and is very understanding and approachable. His class is based a lot on lectures, and discussions but you will never get bored. 10/10",1
"Very cool guy, a little odd but in a good way! Like's to start class with some music. Very funny and honest. He will make you do some work, but not to much. Great professor all around.",1
"Dr. Bailey is hands down the best professor in the CBE department at CSU. He is compassionate, brilliant, and funny. Makes you think really hard about stuff, but is always there to help you clear things up and help you excel! I've had him for 2 courses now and he is consistent in all aspects regardless of the level of the course. Great professor.",1
I thought Professor Arrizon was a great teacher. She brought her own perspectives to class and was interested in that of others. Participation matters in her class. Readings weren't too bad compared to other classes. Advice for the quizzes: write up a summary of each reading and use it on the quiz. Made it very easy and passed every quiz w/ an A.,1
Dr. Holt is extremely easy.  All you have to do is 15 assignments all year and take open book exams.  The assignments consist of you typing some numbers straight from the book and sending them to him over the internet.  Extremely easy.,1
"Horrible professor. Makes it seem like he's available outside of class but, doesn't even come to meetings schedule by email. Grades very hard on exams!!! The homework is worth 25% of the final grade. Lecture is boring and awful. Prepare to teach yourself. If your reading this, DONT TAKE HIM!!!!!!!",0
She was unhelpful and confusing. Her grading was nit picky. Her review of the papers of how you got the grade made no sense at all. AVOID THIS CLASS. She does not work with you and is very rude. Talks down to you alot. Not flexible at all. I could go on and on but just dont take her class!,0
"Dr. McAlpine is awesome. He may get a little monotone every once in a while (maybe more often than I like to remember), but he's a great teach nonetheless. Easy.",1
"Professor Robertson was great.  She is very positive and encouraging.  Her class was really interesting and I learned a lot.  I studied, but this class was easy.  Tests are online/open book with multiple attempts. 1 short (easy) paper due. Mid-term and final are open book but timed. I would recommend her. If you don't get an A, it's your fault.",1
"This professor is a total jerk who is only interested in his own opinion. If you type a paper and he doesn't like your view then your grade will definitely suffer. If possible, take anyone else. He is the absolute worst prof. I went to him for clarification on a grade, and he gave no assistance. I am an A student who received a D!",0
I took this course online with weaver. It's a good online course to take. The material on the test comes straight from the book and power points. If you have question e-mail him and he will respond very quickly. There are weekly homework assignments but they are easy and he is not to picky. I would recommend him to anyone.,1
"Could not stress how much of a pleasure it was to be in this class. John Shon is the absolute man and taught accounting in such a unique and interesting way. Dont get me wrong, you will NOT pass if you dont put in the work, but he made me feel like I wanted to do as well as possible. Funniest professor at Fordham. 10/10",1
"Friendly lady, not a great teacher. Don't get me wrong, if we were out of the classroom I would be her friend. She does not say what she means when it comes to the assignments. Make sure you are thorough on your on account. She will act like it's all good, but when it comes down to grading she will say something like...well want I wanted was this..",0
"I used at least 30% of my phone battery every class to look online for all of the answers to the packets she gives you. Yeah... packets. This is not elementary school. I think she really only ""lectured"" once and it was in the first month of class. If you like learning on your own and learning from YouTube videos, then this is the one for you.",1
I really enjoyed this class and I think she is very knowledgeable and excited to teach. ,1
She is GREAT GREAT GREAT!!!!!!!!!,1
There is 1 test (the midterm) and 1 project for the entire yearbut its a group project. The project turned out to be a 50+ page document between 4 people. He said that he was expecting around 100 pages. I did a majority of the project and made sure he knew that. I walked away with a B- and my group members who did nothing all got C+'s. DO NOT TAKE,0
"It's the exact same course as GOV 2301. This guy has a really awful voice and likes to yell at his captive audience. You will be forced to hear about his neighbor's noisy pool pump, Ugg the Thug, and how stupid Sarah Palin/Charlie Sheen/Tea Party/anyone who disagrees with prof. is. Quizzes are easy, answers are online.",0
"Never explains his notes, reply to your email with at most 20 words, arrogant and funny(in a bad way), I think this is the worst prof I have ever seen.",0
Lectures are disorganized and are often missing information or contain incorrect information. Assignments are posted late. She doesn't seem to have the time or skill to teach,0
"Not the best, not the worst. Some of the assignments were interesting, but there was a huge amount of reading per week. Weekly written assignments and readings in addition to midterm and final projects. She randomly grades very harshly and then flips and is an easy grader. If you argue for your grade she dismisses you.",1
"He has many in class assignments that go towards your attendance and final grade. In addition to in class assignments, you have quizzes once a week, which are fairly easy if you skim the textbook. Exams are easy in the beginning but become more lecture heavy with the last 2. In general, his lectures aren't helpful.",1
"Lectures will seem long because there's a lot of information. Tests are multiple choice, but they are tough. For me, the class average was a C every test. There are weekly writing assignments that you have to be in class for and will give you an easy A along with the tests.",1
Even though the class is a little hard she does given plenty of extra credit and is very nice if you talk to her one on one. She makes the tests very easy too. ,1
"She's a terrible teacher. She's a tough grader, very vague in directions and isn't very helpful when asking for help. Secondly, this is just an assumption, but she's been picking on certain students for harder samples during the labs.",0
"McMillen is a great guy. You can tell he likes to relate to students and cares about teaching. His lectures can be long and boring sometimes but he sometimes adds in a funny story, whether it's about the material or not. Tests were not hard but I also took it online because of the China virus so that made it easier.",1
"LITERALLY talked about randomness for each class for a whole hour, almost like he was adding on to everything as he went through the class he didn't even relate it to anything or the assignments. Nothing he said was of significance and i was bored out of my mind, I'd skip every class and just do the essays online except attendance was a grade.",0
"She's funny, absolutely approachable, and very helpful. I really look forward to her classes. Definitely take her if you can.",1
Worst math professor/strictest grader that I've ever had. He is distracted by everything and he bunny trails every single class period. Takes an hour to teach a topic that should take 10 mins. Google taught me more in two hours than he has taught me this entire term. Homework feedback is degrading VERY unhelpful.,0
"Respect when others are giving their speech. Have your speech ready and just try your best. I was terrified to take this class, but overall it was a great experience. He truly is a great proffesor.",1
"Terrible Terrible Terrible. I strongly suggest you do not take her. She marks unfairly, she takes forever to give papers back, she always plays the victim, says she wants to help but offers no help when it comes to your exam. Terrible!",0
"She was a very energetic, helpful, and fair teacher.  Some students on here complain about too many surprise quizzes, but they weren't surprises. They are really easy and are every week and there is a lot of extra credit.  Are you gonna believe me or the person who meant ""can not even pronounce certain spanish words incorrectly."" as an insult",1
"Professor Abara is hilarious! He makes class interesting, however, a lot of what he says in class doesn't pertain to what's on the test. He seems to get carried away with certain topics. However, he tells you exactly what to study for your tests; the homework is easy and helps A LOT. Go to class, do the homework, and look over his ppts to get an A.",1
"Even if you do the weekly 3x D2L postings, they have to be perfect or you won't get the mark. Group project is actually worse than you could imagine with no support from the prof. Impossible grader - midterm was a disaster. He's a good person, very nice, but it's almost like he wants people to regret taking an online course.",0
LOVE DR BROWN SO CHILL,1
Wouldnt have passed w/o my smart boyfriend. Lectures are just him making something complicated when it is simple & he only lectured once or twice a week. I hardly attended class. Only days of quizzes/exams. Gives many assignments that are tedious & not helpful. You are better off getting tutored at the learning center than going to his class.,0
He is a nice person but he is a harsh grader and the majority of his classes is a waste of time. He goes completely off topic with different stories that have nothing to do with what he is teaching and by the time he is done the class is already over. Don't take him if you actually want to learn something during class.,0
"Cailtin Burke means well and is very sweet, but if you have no prior knowledge in calculus I don't recommend that you take her class. All you do in the class is very heavy note taking to the point where it is impossible to read what you just wrote and it made the weekly quizzes hard to study for. I barely passed even though I put in so much effort.",0
"Dave is one of the funniest professor I have ever had, but still has a handle on the class and on the subject. I look for his name every class I take to see if I can have him again. A must take professor!",1
"He got off topic way too much,which lead our class to get behind on lectures. He then tried to cram the lectures in before our test and we had to race to get through all of the information. He does put his powerpoints online, so that is nice! He will round up your grade a few points if needed,but only if you attend class regularly. Tests are hard.",1
Misses Persaud's Spanish class was too accelerated for me :( Don't take the class if Spanish isn't your first language.,0
"Her class is wicked hard and the lectures outlines are all online. However, you do need to attend class as she takes attendance often.  Her voice is very soft at times and it will lose you. You will have three tests one paper and a final. The tests and finals are easy to fake, the paper is tougher to fake. Spelling counts on everything that you do!",0
I HIGHLY DONT RECOMMEND him!!! DONT LISTEN TO THESE THEY ARE WRITTEN BY HIM,0
"Great instructor, very knowledgeable and cares about his students. Acts tough but is really a softy if you get to know him. The Law & Security program was challenging, have to put the work in and show up for class this is defiantly not one of those programs where you just show up and not bother doing the readings or studying and pass.",1
He sucks a a professor and when you ask him a question pertaining to the subject he does answer it. He will tell you to go to office hours. My overall opinion in this is that if I could give him a zero I would.,0
"A nice prof who obviously cares, but extremely disorganized. Never prints enough copies of midterms, and once made 30 students leave and come take the exam a week later because of this. Changes his office hours without warning and regularly skips or reteaches material because he forgets what we've done. Easy class but stressful and frustrating.",0
"I loved Dr. Grave's energy and enthusiasm, but was not a fan of her teaching style. The class has no real lectures/powerpoints so you basically go to class to do practice questions out of the book with a partner, and have to teach yourself from the book on your own time. If you're taking the class pass/fail its manageable but if not then good luck",0
"Professor Kumari's online class is extremely easy. I didn't do any of the 3 discussion boards (4 discussion boards in 1) and I missed 1 of 3 tests (not proctored, aced 1 and failed the other) and ended the class with a B. Read the material, do all of the homework, practice homework, and quizzes and you are golden :D",1
Marchetti is awesome - really made me work but I was ready for the next class.  Could watch her lectures over and over because she posts them online.  Lots of problem solving in class which is what really helped me.  Take her class!,1
"He is a really fun, easy-going, all-around great teacher.  He is pretty easy grade wise but is there if you actually want the help.  Highly recommended",1
"UGHHHH! she thinks she is funny. she is not. she goes on tangents, and doesn't teach! the class goes super slow. it's like a middle-school level class. overall it's very annoying and I feel my brain is dying from lack of use when i sit in her class.",0
"He talks at you, his questions to the class are 99% rhetorical.Gives take home multiple choice tests with multiple right answers per question, but he decides what the ""most right"" answer is. The class is not interactive, it's just his monologues. End of the class multiple difficult essays are due, with no homework before then that would help you.",1
"Possibly one of the most unprepared, detached teachers i have had to date, yet, in all of my years of school. He never emails you back, nor, does he care about you as a student. He seems totally burdened to teach, and it reflects in his students learning.",0
"Don't even get me started on this dude. Went into the class with 6 years of studying French and after it, I dropped my french minor. Took him on Tues, and Thurs and don't expect anything less then 2-3 hours of homework per class period. Tests are ea breeze but good luck getting ANYTHING above a B on each homework. don't take. Seriously...",0
"This is my second semester with this professor - great as always. This was his first semester teaching this particular course (E-Tailing and Retailing), and his lectures were built to reflect the most up-to-date topics.    My advice: participate in discussions (you'll get more from the course), re-read articles for the test, and pick a good group!",1
"Tests did not reflect anything that was taught in lecture, you are better off learning all the material off of YouTube. He hardly responds to emails and when he does he answers vaguely. He also emails you in the middle of tests to correct his own errors in the creation of the test. He Is not willing to work with students with questions.",0
very strict with turning things in and grades hard...,0
"Nora is probably the nicest professor you'll ever have. She genuinely enjoys what she does and is always there to lend a hand and assist. She really gets to know her students and makes it a fun experience. All you really need to do is show up and pay attention, do the group work, and use the workbook!",1
"She has an accent, it is fairly easy to understand, but if you do not have an ear for accents you may struggle. Lectures are pretty straightforward, and I was able to understand the content. If you are bad at math, I do not recommend taking her because she at times is not clear and can move a bit quickly. Pay attention, and ask questions!",1
"This professor likes to show off how much she knows about everything. Be prepared to hear a lot of stories about herself. Be prepared to teach yourself, this woman is a joke.",0
"Smart but tough. I'm not a bad/lazy student but I do struggle in this class. Midterm & final assignment are worth a huge chunk of your grade. If you don't do well on one or both, it is unlikely you will be able to pass. He can seem arrogant but will sometimes clarify. Very tough. Take notes/pay attn. Not super awful but I wouldn't take him again.",0
"I don't why there is no option for choosing 185A as his class. I took 185A this quarter, which is complex analysis. He was a funny guy that alway talked about off topic material. He wrote down ever follow his previous notes during the class meetings, which is very useless unless you really understand it. Two midterms and 1 final paper. Aviod him.",0
"This guy is awful.  He was bad for EE 312, and he's even worse for this class.  He now uses quizzes to see if anyone is paying attention, or at least, showing up to class.  My biggest peeve: he issues a final for the last day of class instead of during the scheduled exam date.  It's unfair, because you can't finish a final in 1:15.  What a jerk!",0
"He's a very harsh grader, we have to do a lot of homework. one page of homework about the book you read due every class. There are only four essays which I thought couldn't be that bad but because he grades harshly I hated that class.",0
"He's 'flamboyant'  so be prepared for that. His lectures are useless, the papers are vague and difficult and he grades very strangely. I've never had an issue with writing, and in fact enjoy it, but he seems to find an issue with everything I submit, and gives nonsensical reasons for the deductions. If you're an engineer, not a poet- stay away.",0
"Make sure you read, study all your notes even the book notes, and prepare to write essays for exams. She is a difficult grader and is very specific of what she wants. Make sure you go to class you may miss out on important information and the attendance points are great at the end to have. Ask many questions. She can be confusing at times.",0
I really enjoyed this class. She is always more than willing to help you. She says you have to buy the book but I did not and was fine. Unless Computer Science is your major and you just need an easy class take her. Really sweet though!,1
This prof is funny and sets up lectures that are interactive and don't put you to sleep. He cares about his students and that they learn the content. His course helped me learn skills that I am using in my business placement and in other courses as well. Thanks for the great semester.,1
"tough grader, I tired really hard in this class but she kept on giving me a low grade",1
"This class is not hard at all as long as you pay attention in class and look at the PowerPoints before exams. I hardly read the textbook but I got a full mark on my last exam. The professor is great too, her explanation is super clear and easy to understand. Though she takes attendance so u should go to class:)",1
"You wont regret taking him, you will learn a lot and he makes classes very enjoyable.",1
You will pretty much have to teach this course to yourself. He only goes over the examples from the textbook in class and is unclear. Nice guy but horrible lecturer.,0
"She's a great lady. Not that good of a prof though. I had prior music experience, and I still had to teach myself everything before each test. You really need to have prior music experience before taking her classes, and a lot of patience. Maybe even a tutor. Tests were not easy, but still got a B. Good luck, you'll need it!",0
He is a great guy tons of enthusiasm. between him and his appointed people there is a ton of help and study groups. take part in them. the classes are hard but it is organic chemistry expect it. clarity is rough there is a lot to know. takes a lot of your own effort but overall i wouldn't ask for a different teacher!attendance not required but go!,1
"Unable to answer basic questions, and refuses to answer homework questions. Tests on things that weren't taught and encourages students to drop the course. Doesn't hand tests back and gives no feedback. Threatens to send anyone who questions him to the Dean. Literally told the class ""it's the professor's job to make you feel bad.""",0
Only needed the mymathlab code. Don't buy the book!!,1
Said she would correct the team project before the exam but didn't. We therefore had no clue how to write the solutions adequatly in the exam.,0
Great professor. Knows her stuff. Makes you want to learn French. Recommend.,1
Pretty good prof.,1
You try so hard to do well but she just never fully explains the material. You have to write 2 papers in her class the first one is 10 pages and if you don't do it she says to drop her class because you won't pass. The second paper is min.5 pgs long and its on an interview. You HAVE to read the readings or else don't to class.,0
Not helpful at all. Will tell you to rewrite everything! But the narrative books are interesting.,0
"I suggest other instructors. It is almost impossible to get a decent mark on a report from her. Takes off marks for anything she can find. I could have easily finished with a grade 15-20% higher if I had another instructor.  Very nice lady, but is much too harsh with her marking.",1
"Thornton is awesome. He codes alongside his lectures and explains his process in a way that makes sense. His notes are kinda dense, but they're helpful and align with his lectures in a way that helps reinforce stuff that may not have made sense upon first reading them. He gives a reasonable amount of work too. I really can't complain about him.",1
"Overall, an okay FSE 100 professor. He is difficult to understand due to an accent (and very unclear on expectations even when coherent) but is lenient on grading. My biggest issues are with the class itself, not the instructor (e.g. one person ends up doing all the work in a group).",1
"Brilliant Professor who brings a ton of real-world experiences with him. Hard to find other professors like him in the college. He makes the topic interesting and always shares relevant personal experiences. Also, he cares about his students and clearly loves teaching.",1
"Dr. Wood is an amazing professor. She is very knowledgable and is willing to help anybody that is willing to help themselves. She is also somebody that you can talk to about personal issues. Her classes are weighted very test heavy, 70% to 75%. However, if you pay attention and put in the time and effort an A in the class is definitely achievable.",1
"Dr. Buck is very helpful, though his teaching style is very confusing. His lectures are boring. The class is fairly easy you could pass without having to show up to class. Also his study guides for his exams are not helpful at all just the essay questions. I would never take another class from him.",0
"I had to take her online because of COVID-19. I thoroughly enjoy writing but her class made want to despise the entire subject. She seriously takes forever to grade assignments and marks points down for small mistakes. I feel like the experience would be different in a face-to-face class, but overall do not recommend.",0
"Absolutely useless online course.  Most of the online resource links don't work, the assignments are posted late but still expected to be on time, and there is no organization.  We went from saying ""Hello, my name is..."" in Week 3 to being expected to introduce ourselves and someone else in a paragraph of French with no lead-in.  Just terrible.",0
"Spends each class reading the powerpoints, nothing else happens in his class. Sometimes he shows us movie trailers that have no relevance to the topic of Oracle, PLSQL, or even databases instead of teaching. Takes forever to hand back assignments and tests and only gives the marks back if he likes you as a student.",0
"While activities programming itself is a fun idea (I mean really, playing games for an hour and a half? awesome!), Christine somehow found a way to make it feel extremely boring. The class was easy though. Don't waste your $100 on the textbook, I never touched mine. ",1
He dropped me without any notice that I was failing. Didnt try to send me a email or tell me to come to office hours so we could talk about me increasing my grade.,0
"I enjoyed her lectures mostly because she has a sense of humor. There are two group projects (one audio and one live presentation), once a week hybrid assignments, and five exams (fairly easy). There are a lot of extra credit opportunities. Her class is an easy A if you do the work which is really easy. I would definitely take her again.",1
"Very smart guy, but not good at teaching. If you took Calc in high school, you'll get to really appreciate how much he makes relatively simple concepts sound like rocket science. He embarrasses students for asking questions and for some reason he really has something against community college. Hes funny sometimes, but thats about the only positive.",0
"She's a nice person, but an awful teacher. She talks waayyy too fast and goes into too much detail about the chapters. The homework/studying is brutal. If you're not a genius, don't bother wasting your time and money on her classes.",0
"Sigal's exams are very tough, don't take her class. Her husband (math prof David Earn) is really hot :)",0
Farzin Irani is a great professor. We did our quizzes and case studies online on mindtap. The quizzes are based directly from the book so you cant go wrong. You will get an A if you put the time into the class. She knows a lot about psychology. ,1
"Dr. Ortega is extremely passionate about teaching and making sure his students find a genuine interest in his lectures. Class was enjoyable and I recommend taking notes and showing up, especially for iClicker!! Study your notes and his powerpoints and the exam shouldnt be a problem. Highly recommend taking the course, and Dr. Ortega!!",1
"Gives So much work and isn't considerate of other work you have outside of class. Reads off all the slides, this professor made me reconsider my major and take any more News classes.",0
"Shes the worst prof I have ever had at bsu. She doesnt care youre a college student, she doesnt care if you have to wait until pay day to buy her mandatory expensive textbook ( which she only wants you to buy bc her weak writing is included. Certainly she did not publish anything decent) shes no willing to help. She always thinks shes right",0
"Taken in summer I, basically a self-taught class since it was online. There were only 6 assignments and you only get 1 chance to do them. No extra credit. You must have textbook to pass. Very easy but I wish there were more assignments so it wouldn't be as stressful. I would take again.",1
"If you want to learn more about Engineering, don't take him. If you want to get an easy A, don't take him either.",0
... ... Boring ... ... A+ ... ... That is it ... ...,0
Mr. Martin grades your papers and gives you the opportunity to correct them. He definitely made me grow as a writer.,1
"So awful. Worst professor you will have at UCONN. Her class should be for philosophy majors only, and philosophy IV or something. She grades everything so tough and if you complain to her via email she basically doesnt do anything to fix it. Take this class and youll want to die! If you have this class in your cart delete it before it is too late",0
"Shapiro is  super knowledgeable about the Chinese history and environmental politics, and she  shares fascinating stories from her past and work. She is deeply connected to the fields and often brought in guest speakers. She is strongly opinionated, which is good, but it can color her teaching. Other 2016 SIS140 students exaggerate the difficulty.",1
"Arabshian was honestly my favorite professor my first semester of college;  she was inspirational, fair, and always willing to offer a helping hand (GO TO HER OFFICE HOURS!). She uses examples straight from the textbook, and sets up her quizzes and tests off of those-- if you study the textbook carefully, the tests and quizzes should be fairly easy",1
"I had him for American People II, he is a little boring but he knows his stuff and I did learn a lot. It's not a hard class and should be an easy A if you do the work.",1
"Professor Boyles is awesome! He's super progressive and doesn't believe in the five paragraph standard format nor the lettered grading system. Basically, if you put forth a good effort on each essay, you will get solid feedback to become a better writer and an A+. Seriously, take his classes. 3 essays total with weekly discussion posts.",1
"Intelligent and cares about the subject matter, but dull and not very class-aware--doesn't give the students enough time to take notes on his slides. He also made a comment about Africa creating more waste than the USA because it's 'underdeveloped', a fact that is both false and ignorant.",0
People say all you have to do is read from the notes and you will do fine on the homework and tests. You do realize his notes are excessively long and tedious to read? He also assigns some huge project which takes forever to do.,0
I absolutely love Her as my professor! I would take this class 10x over if she was teaching it! ,1
"If you can, take Professor Ibrahim! He was very nice and his exams were very fair. Also, all pop quizzes were extra credit. If you do all the book problems you should be very well prepared for the exam.",1
"Class was so great, I am actually taking him again for 1302.  Being present for the class is key, he prefers to tell the information as a story.  You will not due the typical read and regurgitate process here - he will actually have you consider what you've learned. Study Guides provided on pretty much spot on.",1
"NEVER take ecology with her unless you can get the tests from previous years. She'll talk about something in class for maybe 5 seconds and put an entire page of questions on the test. She literally can't teach and makes the class based off of group quizzes. Really difficult time passing this class and I'm usually an A student, good luck w yang.",0
"Horrible man in general. If you're trying to go to gradmedical school, this guy will ruin your GPA. 4.0 at CSUSM for a year and a half, and this guy gave me a C. Mean, condescending, rude, makes you feel stupid, and absolutely unapproachable in office hours. Won't tell you how to succeed. Do this at Palomar or Mira Costa, seriously, NOT MUSTARD.",0
"Show up and do your homework and you'll pass. Daily in class assignments are part of the grade. In class assig. & reviews applied to tests/quizzes. He puts in the extra time to answer all questions and give 1 on 1 time as needed. Showed work for in class practice problems, give clear step by step instructions, and set us up to be successful.",1
"Dr. Harris is extremely knowledgable about her subject and you can tell she is passionate about it. Her lectures are easy to understand, however she may power through a bit fast so be sure to take pictures of lengthy slides in particular (she does not post them online.) Overall this class was super interesting and you learn so much by the end.",1
Teacher was really leniant and helpful in certain situations.,1
"This is the worst teacher anyone can take, she does not teach the class. Her exams are super difficult and if the work you solved are not her way she marks it wrong. Do not take this class with this professor she is rhe worst. She is very rude and disrespectful. Will make you feel like you dont know anything. Rudest professor I met.",0
Shes very reasonable! Do your reading though!! You can tell she really cares about her students and the subject. Made me enjoy history even though Im a science person,1
"DROP. I was a 4.0 student with background in A&P when I took his class, and I still STRUGGLED for a B. When the class went from 50+ students down to around 15, he forced everyone to attend the same lab, regardless if it was the day they signed up for. I told him it wasn't convenient for my work, and he penalized me for it resulting in lower grade.",0
"He frequently uses profanity when talking to the class. If he feels the class is not ""alive enough"" he will give a pop quiz on a random topic that might not even deal with the class. He often does not stick to his course syllabus either, he makes up assignments and rules as he goes. I will make my best effort to not take one of his classes again.",0
"Was a very difficult professor, but massively beneficial in that respect. Gives the toughest critiques, but also the best. Can be confusing; often changed grading criteria and requirements as projects went on, often at the tip of a hat or at the end of a project. Very experienced. Extremely hard, but extremely informative and educating.",1
"Professor Meade has some good reads, and I did get a few things out of his class but overall completely not worth it. We just now got the final exam study guide two days before the final exam. He also has only graded our first exam so far so I have no idea what my grade is in the class and it's exams week. My recommendation is to not take him.",0
"I took 240 online with Dodson. I do NOT agree it was an easy A, but participating in discussion boards helps A LOT. Course material as it progresses gets tougher, but Dodson is a great resource. She's available by Email or discussion boards to help. Would take her class again. I was nervous after being out of school 10+ years but she was great!",1
"Terrific professor.She grades hard, but fairly.Very interested in her students doing well.The added benefit to taking her class is that if you learn the material,it can help you get a better grade in future classes that require any sort of essay writing.TOP RATE professor and I would definitely take her again.",1
"She's a sweet lady but she's an awful teacher. You basically have to teach yourself. She teaches super fast and is confusing. She doesn't care if you get it or you don't, she just keeps on going. Sooooooo much homework! The class is basically just doing homework. She quizzes you on what you haven't learned yet called pre-quizzes? Do not recommend.",0
Good!,1
"Best ASL teacher at Mesa hands down! Comments about being too tough are totally invalid, It's ASL 4 and everyone taking it SHOULD be expected to actually know ASL. Over all the classes teaches a lot about how to actually use the language instead of using meaningless words. Very helpfull!",1
"i can see how this would be a great class in person but online wasn't great. It's read from the textbook then do the quiz, no notes, no lectures, no pre-recorded lectures. not impressed by this course delivery for online because of covid.",0
"Doctor Polanco wants her students to do well in the class; however, she gives SO much work to do out of class. Your grade for your speech does not come from just the speech; you have to do reviews & many other requirements. She is lecture heavy and quizzes/tests are very hard. She gives you 30 points on your final if you have perfect attendance.",0
would not take a class of hers again,0
Dr. Birx is a prolific author and an exceptional teacher. He pushed me to look beyond and challenged me on my suppositions. He was also able to shed illumination on a whole area of Anthropology that I overlooked. He was also available for questions and gave great advice!,1
He likes to be called Bob and he is hands down one of the best professors at Keene! He is very knowledgeable about Management and has great examples. He makes this 'dry' subject interesting and you'll actually want to go to class. His exams aren't bad you just have to make sure you study from his power points and you'll do great!,1
"Dr. Cutler cares about her students like her kids. Chem II is a very hard course no matter who teaches it, but Dr. Cutler teaches all she can to help students understand and apply concepts. Class is hard, and requires lots of out of class work, but can be done. Work hard and pay attention, and Dr. Cutler will help you",1
Sister Kirkham is easily the best professor I have had so far. She is so kind and caring and allows you to feel safe in her classroom. She has taught me so much through our text book and also through her own personal experience. She is so inspiring and I would love to take another one of her classes if I could.,1
"if you have to take a bio class, MAKE SURE you take Vanderzalm. shes an extremely clear explainer, and is very understanding when you are struggling. she is a very caring professor that actually wants all her students to do well. love her!",1
"Awful teacher, gives way too vague prompts for essays and doesn't hand back graded ones until way after the next one is due, It could be months past the first essay and you still will not have it back, also assigns homeowork late at night due he next day in the morning",0
"Frank is the best. Plain and simple. One of the best professors at SUNY Potsdam. He's my advisor and he is one of the most helpful, funny, and honest people. He's a wonderful professor.",1
"Course is easy! Professor is absolutely terrible, and for the final makes you hand write out the problems and copy scan to her.",0
"She is a hard grader. Her tests are too picky, you gotta know the whole book to be able to pass. It is hard to get an A on anything. Only few things to grade you on. DO NOT TAKE HER IF YOU HAVE OTHER OPTIONS!",0
"Dr. Krell is a very inconsistent instructor, and not much of a mentor, or a leader. His directions are extremely unclear and his grading is all over the place, with little or very confusing feedback. He doesn't lead or teach by example either.",0
"Took him for orgo 1 online for COVID. He put the class onto a strict bell curve based solely on scores on two tests and a final that did not have feedback or regrades. His lectures, which were all made before class started, were extremely confusing. I learned mostly from the book as no other course materials is given. Avoid at all costs.",0
"boring class, but its an easy A",1
Professor Graziano is one of the nicest Professors at Seton Hall. As long as you do the case write ups and study for the tests you'll do great. He has a ton of business experience and gives great feedback. Definitely recommend Graz.,1
"You learn alot, I can't deny. However, the structure of this course is ridiculous. MT and final are each worth 35%, both are 50 MC Qs, and you get an hour for each exam. I've seen level 400 courses that are more forgiving than this. Also, alot of the stuff he tests you on is stuff he never talked about and isn't in the book. Take another professor.",0
"Rebecca Thomas is an absolute godsend. Loved her class. She is very helpful and easy to talk to. She will go out of her way to help you succeed, all you have to do is put in the work.",1
"very rude teacher, i would never taker again. He was rude and mean to students if they didn't understand the material. There is A LOT of math work involved so be prepared.  There quizzes and the study guides he makes do not at all help one bit.",0
"UI100 is a blow off class, everyone knows it, except for her. She thinks this class is the most important thing in the world. You have at least 6 pages of homework from her workbook every period. She talks about how great of a teacher she is and how the students are stupid for not preparing for other classes. She thinks she's funny, she's not.",0
"Dr. Vohs gives great notes, like a high school teacher.  However, he is hard to reach and offers little help outside of class.",0
Study and you will do fine,1
"She is really nice and really cares. Her lectures were pretty good, but there weren't many of them. I hate public speaking so this class was really hard from me, but there was also a ton of homework. The homework was a lot of work and seemed unnecessary.",1
"This class turned out to be pretty interesting. It puts the biological and social aspects of race together and gives you a whole new perspective.  John is a relaxed and down to earth professor, who made the class interesting even if it was 6-9.  Great class :)",1
"he's a nice guy, work oriented. i'm just a fanatic of the field. i just wish he would take interest in all aspects of teaching both inside and outside the cassroom. i've cried i've laughed and i'm still breathing for the moment. take care sir. opportunity knocks at the door, but my knocking seems futile. this sample has too many associated errors.",0
there are weekly labs that are a MUST. Very confusing and terribly structured course. She teaches things that you do not need tot know and is very difficult to talk to.,0
"I took him for group comm and if you aren't working on the group projects in class he is lecturing reading STRAIGHT from a powerpoint presentation. WE AS STUDENTS CAN READ TOO. I felt like I was back in kindergarten... Easy class with some homework, but boring!!! Most of the class (lectures) other than group work is common sense... A drag, beware.",0
"If you want to learn something, do not take him. There is definitely something mentally not right with him, he is constantly off topic. I went to every class, did every assignment like an idiot and got an A. Meanwhile people who never showed got an A- because it was 'easier' for him to deal with. Worst English class and experience ever.",0
"She is really great. Well organized with notes and power points. As long as you take the notes, the test and essays are easy. Highly recommend her.",1
"I've just got B for HIS 1111 with other instructor, and i have to withdraw this course when i had Mr. Crew. I wish, i'd found this website earlier. No instruction or comment during class at all. The worst of all when you have to take the test without resource allow for proctor. All exams are multiple with 6 points each, so don't miss any.  ",0
"Prof. Olzman is an amazing professor. She is passionate about teaching and it shows. Also, go see her during office hours. She appreciates out -of-class participation. She's great one-on-one too. I got so much help on my speeches and helped with my grade.",1
she an amazing lady. she knows what she is talking about and takes the time to help you understand.,1
"Ive had Mrs. Randle a few times and I really enjoyed her classes. Shes definitely not going to just hand you the grade; you will have to actually learn the material *gasp*. But shes extremely helpful and loves when you ask questions. She does care about your success and shes very passionate about the material, especially in DE.",1
"Professor Aizura was very nice, and you could tell he had a lot of passion for the subject of gender studies. Overall, the class was definitely not for everyone. Intriguing, but a lot of talk of different opinions you may not agree with. The structure of the class also was confusing at times, specifically the grading.",1
"Son cours est divisé en trois: la premiere moitié du cours il parle d'écologie, la deuxième de comptabilité et la troisième c'est un exercices qui vaut 1% à chaque cours. En gros 10% de participation, TP correct mais long. Il divague toujours, il connait super bien la matiere mais l'explique mal, il enseigne au MBA. Parfois pertinent, souvent non.",0
"Dr. Corrigan is super nice, but his class is easy to the point of boredom. He goes of on amusing tangents but you really don't have to pay attention in class or do the readings at all. Take if you want a really easy A.",1
"Prof. Conta is absolutely the best, informative, entertaining, caring teacher in the administrative dept at LACC. He is a true gem. He is so human, humble, and yet, so spectacular....one of a kind.",1
Lisa is great! She works so hard to make sure that every activity in class runs smoothly. She is really easy to get a hold of and she is so passionate when she lecturers. Participation is critical to the class though but she lectures are great. Its a great class!,1
"Mirabai is an incredible person and an inspirational teacher. She is deeply caring, wise, interesting, and a radical & courageous leader. Taking a class with Mirabai is an opportunity not to be missed.",1
Mike is an awesome professor! Take his classes!,1
"He's very easy-going and approachable, however, he wasn't well organized with the material and didn't really stick to the syllabus. If you pay attention and jot down what he says during and the songs he plays, you'll get an A.",1
"I hated this class, I hate programming, Dawn won't let you not do well.",1
He is so rude. He yells and slams his hands on the table if you don't understand the material. His test suck and his study guides are horrible. Do not take his class.,0
Total disaster couldn't get a hold of him. Don't take if you want surprises when it comes to your grade after the class is over and you see what your grade is. Grades in blackboard are different from the actual grade given.,0
"For a beginning recreation class, there are some things to read and some creativity is needed for discussion board topics nut they are related to recreation. Stay on top of response posts when you post your initial topic post. The instructor is good and if you like him then take his rec 4011 class. Great for communicatng!",1
"I would strongly recommend going with any other professor for this class. Extremely random and heavy lectures, notes will be all over the place. Most of the tests and quizzes have questions either never covered, strongly opinionated, or way more specific than emphasized. No assisting material to study, expected to research unknown topics.",0
"She is smart, kind, and caring. However, the workload is insane and completely unreasonable. The material is boring and you are expected to treat this class as a full time job... double shifted with overtime. Also, Dr. Weston puts mor emphasis on APA formatting than actual content. As stated she's a nice lady but I will definitely not take again",1
"Ummm. He is a really nice guy, but not a good teacher at all. He never writes anything down or explains anything to you. He reads the book in class and expects you to attain information just by reading. Never responds to emails, and he lost my homework (he eventually found it but it was still frustrating). All in all: good person, bad teacher.",0
"Professor Carty is the best professor I have ever had. His passion for what he does is infectious and he is the perfect balance of approachable and tough - he encourages you to do well for your own sake. I wholeheartedly recommend taking ANYTHING with him, he can make the most boring books interesting!",1
Essentials of Lifespan Development online course is poorly structured and disorganized (you have to wait much longer for homework assignments to become available on Canvas Instructure and faster due dated deadlines exist); via e-mail communications are much slower in terms of waiting longer for follow up on Canvas; AND DIFFICULT DISCUSSION ENTRIES.,0
"First things first, Marc's class is DIFFICULT.  You must participate,and make sure to ask questions. He is very understanding , and offers plenty of resources to help you, staying after class , going over tests to help you understand the material etc. if you ask for it! I Hated the subject, but loved Marc! Take him. The work passes off.",1
"Great Professor, there are no exams, just weekly quizzes that you can re-take as many times as needed until the due date. We had 3 ""projects"", they were time consuming, but very easy.",1
"This guy is the man! I've had him for a few classes already, and plan to have him for some more. He lectures a lot, but is willing to stop and explain everytime a hand is raised. Likes to show hollywood movies to get the point of his class across. Great teacher! Highly recommend taking all of his classes!",1
"STOP CRYING PEOPLE. GREAT Professor, A well of knowledge. LOVE the lecture, He will definitely WORK WITH YOU. His door is always OPEN. He stays AFTER Lab and HELPS,  he's there BEFORE lecture to HELP. He is not an Easy ""A"", his tests are HARD and be PREPARED for homework. (REMEMBER THIS IS COLLEGE!) I took Six classes with this and achieved a ""C""",1
"Best Spanish teacher of my life... class was interesting and fun. I learned a lot, and things I was confused about from high school were all cleared up! Sign up for her class... asap!",1
He assigns too much reading  which is too difficult anyway. Trys to talk to students on a high conceptual level when they haven't read the material.,0
Professor Jon Dunham cares for his students. If he sees that the class is struggling he will address the issue and help the class out the best he can. He sticks to the syllabus when it comes to essays and the portfolio but not with in-class assignments. Come to class and do the assignments and you will do perfectly fine.,1
Great class.  Professor really knows the materials and is very inspiring.  Helped me get a job after graduating.  Best professor I have had in the advertising program at the UW.,1
"Gives ok notes and examples are mostly from the book. If you can learn by yourself, then you don't need to go to lecture. exams are like homework/in class examples but are still different. did a little below averages for midterms not sure about the final and ended up with a C with the curve.",1
"hes terrible, miserable, and rude. he always gets mad when no one answers his questions in class and when people do answer them but are wrong, he calls you out and makes you feel dumb!!! no wonder no one answers your questions! tests are like they're in a different language, not on anything you actually learn. would not recommend to even an enemy",0
"He is a really fun teacher to have. Also one of the smartest teachers at the school, and in his field of teaching  ",1
"she rocks! show up, take notes, she tells you what is on the tests, do the 3 papers and do the final, EASY PASS AND UNITS!!!!!!",1
He likes to talk a lot. You don't have to show up unless its a review day. He does classes and tells you exactly what to write on the test. Like exactly. I recorded his lectures and took notes from there. He gets a little boring and rambles so be prepared for that. Nice guy and easy to talk to.,1
Best math professor so far,1
"She requires you to read around 30+ pages from the book, and sometimes you also have to read online articles along the book reading, for a 5 question quiz that has very specific questions and answer. Lectures are pointless because we have no exams just one essay due at the end of the semester.",0
"Loved this class, from beginning to end! Professor Wilson sure is one of the greatest professors at UHD! Take him! Easy class and you learn everything you need to know!",1
"He is the worst professor I have ever had.  He is not helpful, I learn absolutely nothing in that class, and I just highly suggest not taking his class.",0
he was the worst. he would not bump me up 1 point to pass the class,0
"Her class has very long boring lectures. She just reads everything off the board. She is a tough grader. She makes you feel stupid for asking a question in class.  I finished the class with an  89 and I regularly attended class, did every assignment  and did EVERY extra credit assignment and she still didn't bump me up.",0
Professor Yue did a fantastic job ensuring that all students were familiar with a given topic and set of words before moving on. She doesn't just teach content but the reasoning and understanding behind the content. She is always trying to find ways to improve the classroom experience.,1
"Professor Zimmer is a pretty laid back person. But it can be really hard to get an A if you are not good at drawing. When I entered his drawing 100 class I had no experience, therefore, I struggled to get A's on projects. Although Prof. Zimmer gives good feedback, when you ask for help he may draw on your paper and is not very clear.",0
"This was a super easy class. He is a monotone teacher, but has a dry sense of humor that keeps you awake. Super lenient with assignments and papers. Easy grader. Made an A on each paper with minimal work put into them. Take this class if you need an easy A, but be prepared to be bored at times.",1
"Professor Deluna is the kind of teacher you wanna take again because one semester with the guy just isn't enough. He makes what snoozy old history teachers make boring, pretty darn interesting! Funny guy, wish I needed more history classes to fulfill because I'd take them all with this guy!",1
"So great. I loved watching her train of thought and went out of my way to take another class with her this semester. Youtube her, if you really want to know. She's on there.",1
"HIGHLY recommend her, very easy, fair grading! open to dialogue,very helpful,very understanding. I wish I could take her again.",1
This professor is not good! She wants everyone to rate her the best on here. Like who does that she just isn't good at all. I wouldn't take her if I were you.,0
I am a student who always ends up listening to his lectures when I start studying for my class quiz or when I have to do my assignment. Amazing lectures. Always awed by the way he drives the class.,1
"I loved this prof!!  He took his time explaining every concept thoroughly. The questions on his midterm were very similar to the assignment questions there are no surprises on the quizzes, midterm or final. If you're good at math attendance is optional, if not his lectures will definitely help you.",1
Professor Tulsian knows the material himself but has a very difficult time relating it to the class. He often will just work out a problem without give much explanation of how he got his answers. His test are all scantron; they are extremely challenging to complete in the time allotted. I have not felt as comfortable learning the info as usual.,1
"Took a month to return our first paper, when he finally did he was grading them as he handed them back. He's incredibly arrogant, would go off on 15 minute tangents about how he met Denzel Washington one time, told us that our dreams are proof of parallel universes (how does this relate to Chicano Literature...?) Worst teacher I've ever had.",0
"Best teacher I have had in college. I hate history and I LOVED this class.  There are no surprises, there is no reason you cannot get an A in his class, and not because it's a stupidly easy class, you will get an A because you will actually know the material.  Pantsov gets an A++ from me-- I wish I could take this class all over again.",1
"The clicker questions make it impossible to pass the class when skipping, therefore always read the book and start strong. Understand the first units otherwise you will be lost in the last.",1
"Ms. Nuneville is truly one of the most amazing people I've ever met. I'm so glad I got the opportunity to take her class this semester. If you want a teacher that cares about you, take her class. I never opened my book, so don't buy one. She provides all the information you'll need for the tests in her lectures, which she provides on blackboard.",1
"Absoultely hated this teacher. She does nothing for her students, all she talks about is her dog. She does not care if you pass or fail her class. She does not give any points for anything besides quizzes and tests. DO NOT take this teacher if you want to succeed.",0
"Excellent advisor, knowledgeable in the field of social work. slow on grading but will answer e-mails. Expect lots of homework and papers. he is courteous and respectul, patient and willing to advise you sincerely about the field.",1
I took Dr. Makover's Calc I class a long time ago. Years have passed and I still see reviews that mirror the horror of my Calculus class. Avoid him at all costs. I dropped his class and retook it with another professor... took that professor for most of my other math courses.. Got A's in all of them.,0
"Cool guy, great teacher, but he looks like a veggietale character.",1
"I took her Child Development class over the summer. The 40 question chapter homeworks seemed so easy until you really got into them. There is always more than one right answer (all taken right out of the book) and you just have to guess which one she says is ""most correct"" what a joke! She never replies to emails, tests arent like homework. ugh.",0
"Bring caffeine to class or you'll fall asleep pretty quick.  Dr. Self is ok, he'd probably be a cool guy out of this boring class.  You might spend every class wondering what is going on but it's do-able.",0
"GODWIN IS THE BEST. He is hysterically funny, first, and on top of that, this class will change the way you think. In the first half, the reading can be a bit dry, but the second half is probably my favorite class this semester. The midterm was next to impossible, though the curve was extremely favorable. I could not have had a better experience.",1
She expects entirely too much for a 101 level class. Is not very helpful and makes the learning environment stressful as she constantly puts people on the spot.,0
Another winning prof. Class was a circus.,0
"Hard, hard, hard...she doesn't care what you think at all!  She expects you to say what she wants you to say...its pathetic",0
"Arevalo is a sweet person but shes not great at teaching. She runs through the slides and crams things in at the last second. Her thick accent makes it hard to understand her too. There arent many options for bio 104 , but if you can, avoid her. You can pass this class but you WILL have to teach yourself. Tests have little to do with taught info.",0
"An amazing human being. Empathetic, caring, knowledgeable, and unbelievably nice. Ask any psych student how great he is - Matt is beloved by all. He's one of the most supportive teachers you'll ever meet and is always there for you if you need help understanding content. Just a gem. A conversation with him boosts my mood and brightens my day.",1
"Worst Experience at TCU yet. Reading and Quizzes every night and she takes forever to grade anything, so you won't know that you're failing the class until it's too late. But really my problem is that she is incredibly biased. She teaches opinion as if its fact and expects everyone to agree with her and then tests you on her opinions. DO NOT TAKE!!",0
If you are quiet in class you will be forced to an online class with mandatory C grades for all in class assignments. Ever heard of the saying the customer is always right? Cool in this case the teacher is God and youd do best to follow his commandments or else...,0
this class was difficult for me. The instructor is not very clear when he gives lectures in class plus he gives a lot of quizzes of what he talked earlier in class. Not an enjoyable class.,0
"He's pretty redundant. Not much of a help, pretty much just a burned out bum.",0
"Lesley is, by far, one of the best professors I've ever had. She has an adorable, quirky disposition, is very passionate about photography, and is SO helpful to everyone. She is very well educated in her department and has inspired me to be a better photographer. I DEFINITELY recommend taking her. You'll learn a lot and have a blast!",1
Outrageous expectations for students in an INTRO(!!!!!) to ASL course. Will not slow down to help students who have trouble. Syllabus full of threats...serious attitude problem.,0
"Absolutely awful. She grades Aplia by average so you get lower grades than what you deserve. She also won't even bother clarifying questions through emails (because it's ""too difficult to explain"" through email) and keeps pushing phone meetings when I clearly stated I don't have the time. Would not recommend!!",0
Holly is extremely knowledgeable but not very approachable. I found her rubrics hard to follow and very nit picky.  IDK if graphic design is just like that but she should keep in mind that this is a required foundation class for all majors.,0
"She makes deal out of everything. she say she'll help but takes forever to reply her e-mail.when class  is done she only worries about leaving the class, and when you ask for personal attention she only assumes that you werent paying attention in class and denies to help. avoid being related with this person in any causes",0
"he's a very interesting and capable teacher, but can at times be intimidating. if you don't show willingness to learn or improve you won't get anywhere. if you have a true interest, he's a wonderful teacher. take the class into your own hands.. talk, attend class, and know your stuff. tough grader but a great teacher. good accent, and a cutie too",1
He was a great professor. Easy class although you do have to write a few papers and you can't skimp on work.,1
Easiest class I've ever taken. 3 test and weekly assignment that could be done under 20 minutes ,1
"a nice person (even tho she may come off rude) she's a really hard grader and gives a lot of work during the last month of the semester, it's overwhelming Get out if you can, the other professors are easy",0
"She is always willing to help and gives in class activities to apply the lectures to your life, making understanding the concepts easier, and fun!",1
"Overly critical & a tough grader. She gives an extreme amount of assignments and is very strict. She gives no leeway at all, so plan to be there for every class, on-time & constantly busy. The way she conducted lab group experiments was awful. If students had the same answers as members of your group, she'd accuse students of cheating. Terrible.",0
Never seemed to respond to my emails so that was tough when an assignment was confusing. Overall the class was pretty easy but it is definitely a lot of tedious work. Same thing every week.,0
This class will take over your work-life. Way too tough of a grader.,0
"I dont understand people on here saying he responds to questions rudely or insufficiently. I probably annoyed the hell out of him from sending long emails asking questions about math, and he always gave me long and thorough answers. He made me actually like math, too. I didn't do great in his class but thats my own fault. His notes are bomb, too.",1
Professor Dattolo not only inspired me to to well in Spanish he inspired me to pursue teaching as a career. He went out of his way to help me and many other students to do our best. He is a true professor in every sense of the word and I highly recommend taking him!,1
"If you appreciate being talked down to, being disrespected constantly, and not having your questions answered. This class is for you.",0
Tons of busy work for homework. Not very understanding about late work. Boring class activities,0
"Expect an easy A. She gives study guides a few days before the test, and then gives you the answers. The questions  on the study guide are EXACTLY the same as the test questions. Her lectures consist of a lot of videos in which another professor is teaching. She also assigned homework that asks questions about the video, and questions from textbook",1
"This class was awful. I hoped to learn more about forensics, since I'm in the field, but all he did was make us read stuff about the 'corrupt' forensic scientists. I learned nothing about forensics at all, just how some scientists have done poor work. Do not recommend AT ALL.",0
"Knows his stuff but doesn't know how to teach. Humiliates students who don't immediately understand the material, talks poorly about other previous students, lectures are all over the place so you have to learn everything on your own, intentionally is unhelpful outside of class to embarrass you. Slog through it if you have no option.",0
"Logan is a very understanding instructor,I took his math 27 class because I had already taken one the previous semester but didn't pass. Attendance is not mandatory.I highly recommend him if you already are familiar with this material or else you wont learn  much and will struggle in the future. ",1
"Unless you're someone who likes to regurgitate the class discussion in your assignments, don't take Camp. He doesn't allow research or information learned outside of his class; if he didn't say it, he won't grade it fairly. Nice enough guy, but god-awful teacher.",0
This class was a class that started halfway through the spring semester . It started the week the covid-19 pandemic started so we never met in person. She was NOT clear on due dates in emails she sent and whenever I emailed questions there was a rude tone behind the response I got. She seems pleasant but its all an act. Dont take her class.,0
"the guy just goes too fast. i took it over summer and got D, but this guy is teaching at a summer's pace. a section per day. homework everyday except maybe the weekend.",0
"Really seems interested in the material he teaches. Incredibly helpful if you talk to him and willing to answer questions in lecture. Makes heavy use of the text, but will answer any questions you have about. Really laid back and awesome. I would recommend him any day, as long as you are willing to due the readings. Awesome professor!",1
"I really enjoyed her class. She printed out all the notes for you, but you had to fill some of it in. She had 6 test but you could miss one. She offered a lot of extra credit. I would definitely take this class again. It was really easy if you filled out the notes and looked over the study guys she handed out.",1
Don't take this class if you don't have to. You have a quiz at the beginning of every class on the chapter read in the book. The exams are difficult and hard to study for. The professor doesn't help much with teaching the material you basically have to learn it yourself.,0
"This class is so cool and interesting! You start by learning about the history of outer space in connection to music but then it progresses to really cool lectures about David Bowie, Pink Floyd, etc.! Jay is a super kind and cool teacher who is extremely understanding and helpful!",1
"Talbert is awesome. He is very entertaining in lecture, his British accent helps, and knows what he is talking about. He is clearly quite knowledgeable about Rome, and is quite enthusiastic. This class isn't terribly difficult, 5 short papers and 2 tests, but it is difficult to get an A. I highly recommend Talbert!",1
"Her class is not very hard, however,do not miss class and homework. do well in the research paper.",1
"I completed all of the discussion posts and followed the rubric and even cited the sources and used direct quotes from videos provided by the professor only to still receive failing grades on each discussion posts. Her direct responses for one of my discussion posts were ""clearly you know how to read and write"" but then gives me a bad grade",0
"The 2-5 pg journal entries each week will keep you up very late if you put them off! Research paper is intense, but can really help your grade if you're lacking in other areas. Attendance is graded, as is participation, so don't expect to coast through! Very rewarding class, you learn a TON!",1
"if you really want an easy A without really learning anything then take his class. If you really want to learn the material to prepare yourself for a University then please avoid him. He doesn't even know his own material, make several mistake during with his own code, which he ask student for help. Sometime lecture is not even related to the class",0
I love her.,1
"I have always loved History Theory but Rob ruined the class for me and many others. He puts down students publicly, wastes our time when we have group assignments that need to be finished within 2 hours, and grades unfairly. He gives the same grades to students in group assignments that do nothing or do everything. He needs to fix this class.",0
She doesn't like you to ask questions. She seems annoyed most of the time. Lots of work in this class! Not hard but lots of a busy work. The lab is an online program that is irritating to work with. She can't get her info correct because she's a set it and forget it professor. She forgets to make course/term updates in canvas. Hard to contact her.,0
"One of the best professors I have had, he is very credible and always willing to help and clarify material.  David knows his stuff and keeps each lecture interesting. Make sure you do the moodle assignments and keep up to date with the online readings and links. ",1
"Dr. Picault is extremely helpful and posts his lecture slides. If you attend lectures and ask for help outside of class when you need it, his classes are manageable and interesting.",1
Lectures are really dry but you're forced to sit through them bc of the daily quiz. And there's no room for partial credit on the quizzes or tests so it's an all or nothing situation. Expect to put in a lot of hours if you're not good at probability concepts. Don't skimp on the hws and actually learn from them since they're super helpful for tests.,0
"Very good at lectures. Makes jokes, engages students. Lots of assigned reading, though most of them are not necessary. Focus on ID terms. If you know those, you should do just fine.",1
"Honestly didn't learn much out of the class, but he's a really funny guy to listen to.  He expects a lot of basic/trivial details in his test answers that you wouldn't think you'd need to provide; so be very very very thorough.",1
"David was one of the best college professors I have ever had. The work can be a bit tough, but you wont regret taking this course. He drops the lowest tests scores you have which is very generous and helpful makes a study guide for test. He is very helpful and wants to see his students succeed.",1
"This class was really easy and I didn't mind having Professor Cornish. The main thing that I didn't like is that she wasn't active with her online students. I never really heard from her throughout the entire semester, just announcements when something would go wrong. It feels like she just forgets about her online students.",1
I have absolutely nothing but great things to say. Professor Dietrich is extremely helpful and wants you to do well. She teaches great and does practice problems until its clear. I would recommend taking her class 110%!,1
Loved this class. It was on dystopias and survival and we read all kinds of great books like the walking dead comics and handmaids tale. Catherine was down to earth and really nice (AND a cool english accent)! I dont like english or writing but I feel like I really know stuff about the books and society that I didnt before. Would def take again.,1
First off if you don't pass this class... you really didn't do anything. He's a good professor that makes it very clear on what he wants while not really asking for much. Do all the assignments and study for the test and your guaranteed a B minimum.,1
He can be a very easy teacher to pass but there are moments where you cant clearly understand what hes saying or what hes trying to say. The way he works out some problems can also be a bit confusing at times.,0
SO RUDE. DOES NOT HELP. TESTS ARE HARD AND QUIZZES DO NOT MAKE SENSE.,0
"She's a really organized professor. Everything's neat, grades are quickly and orderly posted. Class is extremely easy to get an A in. Somehow ended up with an 99... She drops one exam, homework, and lab which gives so many chances. Only complaint are her jokes, they're so terrible that I enjoy them.",1
Cutest 80 year old man ever. He is really nice too and cares about you. His class is really pointless though.. he kind of just reads through the slides or book and no one listens. Pretty easy but boring.,1
Professional and will help out with all of your work before you even turn it in if you want.,1
"3 individual papers, 3 group papers/presentations, 2 memorization tests, group and individual online business simulation.  Professor creates an uncomfortable learning environment.  Half of the class didn't say a word the whole course.",0
"Pof. Connelly is actually a very good professor. He does Federalist/Anti-Federlist ad nauseum, and you'd better not disagree with him, ever, but he's a good lecturer and he makes you know your stuff.  Granted, he is unapproachable, but he can be helpful once you get past the initial response.",1
This professor frustrates me. Even with extra credit work it wont make up for all of the daily assignments that have been put in... the daily quizzes can be hard and confusing. Do not recommend this teacher.,0
"Excellent Teacher! Knowledgable, easily approachable with a awesome sense of humor. Gives you every possible opportunity to pass. Honestly, you'd have to be a lazy dolt to fail.",1
great with explaining difficult theories.  makes class fun and enjoyable especially when people are willing to participate in class.,1
:(,0
"Selph was by far my favorite professor of my two years at Lane. His teaching style is clear, straightforward, and never rushed. Although calculus is a challenging subject at times, he made the concepts easy to understand. You could tell that he truly enjoyed and got excited about teaching, and I adored his gentle and kind personality.",1
Ethan is a great professor! ENES 100 is designed to be a very challenging course for students early in their engineering journey. Don't be too disappointed if you don't actually understand what is happening. Be sure to go to office hours. He's super accessible outside of class. He truly wants every one of his students to succeed. You'll learn a lot,1
"Professor is extremly knowledgeable. However, it is difficult to ignore his arrogance/attitude. Calls on you to share your opinion, then proceeds to cut you off and not finish your thought while telling you your opinion is wrong. Learned alot in the course but couldn't stand the professor.",0
"Although I would not take his class again because the homework was too heavy when taking five other classes... I will say that he knows his stuff. I do feel like I learned a lot in his old testament class - but I think he struggles with being personable. If you show effort in your work and show up to class, you will do well.",1
"If you want to simply pass the course without hard work and don't care about good grades, this class is for you. It is easy to pass but getting a A is hard. The professor takes forever to respond to emails and the reply is short and rude. The power points and other materials covered in class are outdated. Horrible class.",0
"Miriam Lowi is a brilliant woman. She is very knowledgeable in her field of study and is widely respected. Be warned tho, she assigns extremely rigorous reading material, and will not have mercy on you in class if you fail to read or participate. She wants her students to be involved.",1
"TIME CONSUMING! Great class, love the teacher but you must pay attention and actually read to survive.",1
He is not tough grading speeches. The only thing that will bring down your grade is TIME! Your final speech is worth the most so make sure you work on it before the week of.,1
"Does not respond to emails.  Takes an excessive amount of time to grade and return assignments and papers (some assignments she didn't return at all). Returned papers do not have any comments on them. Strict attendance policy. Provided EC, but graded it using requirements that weren't stipulated. Does not update D2L. But, it is an easy class.",0
shes very boring and often goes on tangents when she is lecturing. i find it easier to take notes straight from the book she provides us with. she also makes us do breakout rooms often. easy a though.,1
I've studied at 4 colleges in 3 countries and Kata is one of the best professors I've had. She is fun and dynamic with her lectures and reading materials. She is clear about what is expected and if she sees you putting in the time and effort you will do well in her class. Make sure to participate in class because that will help a lot. Great Profe!,1
Great guy whos knowledgeable and cares about the subject. The class is a lot of work though about 12+ readings and 2 short papers per week. DO NOT TAKE IF YOU DONT WRITE WELL YOU WONT PASS THERE ARE NO GRADES OTHER THAN PAPERS/DISCUSSION POST.,1
1 He's a hottie! 2 His class is super easy. Tells you to read but if you pay attention in lecture you don't need to I got an A on every test NEVER read the text book. So easy to pay attention to him because he's hot and smart. Lovely! Must take especially for 100.,1
"out of 100 students starting off, after the second test there are about 40 people left...he does not teach, he reads off of a power point, the only kids who pass are the ones who are stong in physics from highschool...if you can avoid dr. dick",0
"Awesome professor, she cares for her students. Her lectures are easy to follow, and her exams are easy if you paid attention. Strongly recommend taking her class!",1
Pennell is great once you get to know her! Class can be very boring and difficult at times but she is very understanding with attendance if you email her. There is a lot to do in this class and she will not wait for you to catch up.,1
needs help with online classes,0
"This is a really interesting class if you are interested in the material. Jamie is VERY knowledgeable and wants to help you do well. There is no reason not to do well, extra credit opportunities, etc. If you are interested in how animals learn and training techniques this is an excellent class. All assignments are interesting.",1
"While I really want to say I liked this professor, his material was incredibly difficult to understand and he did not seem to understand that we were full time students with a full load and jobs. During finals week he still held a meeting to learn material or present, and wile he did his final the week before, he had two tests due during finals.",0
"I would not be able to survive math without the help of this amazing gem. I took her last semester and passed with flying colors due to her excellent teaching, and this semester she continued to help me for free because she cared about my success. Absolute angel, and would 1000% recommend for anyone looking for the perfect math teacher.",1
I loved her class. It's not easy but it's not impossible. She is strict when it comes to grading but I found her class really helped me and now every time I write an essay I keep in mind her tips. There are lots of reading and class discussions but she is very kind and open if you need her help. I would take her class again because she is very good,1
"I had her a semester ago and loved her so much I took another class with her. However, this time is completely different. I don't feel like she's teaching me anything herself, I'm ""learning"" through the 60+ pages of nightly reading. Very very heavy on reading - a little disappointed",1
Best professor i've had throughout all my time at USC! Not an easy class at all but he explains things very well during lecture and emphasizes what we do and dont need to know for our exams. My biggest advice: attend lecture every class & go to his office hours! He is extremely kind to all his students and wants them all to succeed.,1
"Worst class ever, respect yourself and choose a different professor",0
"This is the most arrogant, conceited, awful prof I have ever had. I only attended class because participation matters, always dreaded going. Make sure you are paying attention, because the second he notices you look away - he will put you on the spot. Don't even think about disagreeing with him. If you are shy and don't like talking in class AVOID!",0
super easy but super boring. There were 2 open book open notes tests and one paper that everyone got an A on. If you're looking for an easy a take this class but if you plan to take more CJ id recommend taking a class with someone you can actually learn from.,1
"Trina is a very bright and loving teacher. She prepared me unbelievably well for Chem 151/152. That being said, her 130 class was still no joke. There are at least 100 assignments and she is quite nit picky. I had a 95% average on her exams and did every assignment, but finished with like a 90.9%. She is still phenomenal though, the best for 130.",1
"It was difficult for me to understand his lectures. He has some resources that may help his students on blackboard, but his study guides did not help me at all. I would study early for upcoming exams and I would barely pass it. What saved my grade was the lab assignments, lab tests, and the homework.",0
"Horrible prof, would not recommend to anyone, doesn't know what he's talking about, lectures sometimes go beyond class time (10:20pm no break too)",0
"Embarrassed me in front of my whole class by using a piece of my essay (not before completely editing it to make it unclear and confusing) and then promptly told the whole class that I make her job hard. Stuck in her older generational ways and thinks young people are pessimistic. $130+ text book, no time to write drafts/essays",0
"Mike is my favorite prof so far at the UW. His grading is very lenient with re-submissions, which saved me in some instances. He is very helpful during office hours and on slack as well. This course content is difficult especially if you are new to coding, but with hard work a high score is possible.",1
"He's a great professor.  He makes the material easy to understand.  He wrote the book so you do have to spend $ on that in the bookstore, but its easy to follow and homework questions are easy.  Quizzes are based off those. Discussion boards are typical and he stays on top of them.  Gives you months to do the paper.  He really is a good professor!",1
"Course went smoothly. Try to pay attention to participation during the weeks - that will help on exams questions that involve using decryption methods.  Grading based on participation - easy, two short papers (5pg) - easy, PGP project - easy, Midterm & final exams - hard. But I woule take him again. Ask questions - he will help!",1
"As long as you follow the reviews for the test, this class should be an easy one to pass.",1
"She is very politically biased; also made a lot of rude, sarcastic comments to me about my grades when handing back tests, in front of other students no less, without my having said a word to her. Very unprofessional and her tests have nothing to do with the reading or lecture, which is baffling.",0
"The content she teaches is interesting, but she has ideas about intersectionality and all the problems with that way of thinking (if you know what I mean). Go into her class with skepticism and do not allow yourself to be swayed. People are individuals, not their cultural identity. Just because she is a professor doesn't mean she absolute.",0
"First teaching assignment ever... She was not versed with the textbook and was unwilling to help struggling students understand. Quote: I am not responsible for your learning, I am resposible for your grading",0
Many things werent graded until after you took your final so you never knew how you were truly doing in the class. Emails took days to get a response.,0
"Professor Richmond is so sweet and a very genuine person who only wants the best for her students. Attendance wasn't mandatory and every quiz/exam was on Blackboard. Don't purchase the textbook, its not worth paying for as her power points sum up each chapter very well.",1
"Not helpful what so ever, doesn't post grades until around the last week of class. Waste of my time.",0
She's a pleasant lady but she expects you to remember waaaaay too specific of material that isn't relevant to archaeology. It's more just memorization.,1
I'm not sure what the issue was with the other rating since we were in the same ethics class with this instructor. The instructor challenged us to think critically since it was an ethics class. I never heard and agenda being pushed by anyone in the class. My major is EET but I found the instructor's real life examples relavent. ,1
Don't take her class! was super excited to learn HTML but was slowly ruined by this prof. She signaled me out to always answer questions I didn't know and wouldn't take that as an answer. She's not helpful and I just learned HTML on my own time because it was easier than learning from her. This course would be good if there was a different prof...,0
TONS of homework. I felt like I couldn't really approach her because she seems kind of tough. Never took any quizzes but the tests were super long. Very detailed syllabus and she expects nothing less than the best. I believe she helped me out in the end to pass the class but I would not take again. I struggled in this class,0
"she is giving us a test on thursday and a final on tuesday. pshh. what the crap is that. ha, i guyess it doesn't matter but i will cry anyways.",0
"Not a difficult class, just lots of work. Reading, bi-weekly essays and quizzes, one midterm and a final. Midterm is easy and essays are not difficult to get As on. The TAs pretty much do everything in the class). Espo is such a terrible professor. He spends 80% of class just reading the book and doesn't say anything relevant. Will fall asleep.",0
"While Professor Schlortt is very knowledgeable in his subject, this is by far the worst teacher I have ever had. He fails to communicate clearly outside of class. He fails to provide tools to help you succeed on quizzes and tests in a timely manner. He is antagonistic with his feedback. The list could go on forever, avoid this excuse of a teacher.",0
GREAT professor! Really cares about his student! His class and tests are hard! If you are not willing to put in multiple hours worth of studying or want an easy A do NOT take this class - 3 essay questioned test make up ur grade and 1 extra credit paper worth 10 points which is added lowest test grade- I learned so much! would take again!,1
"She will hate you if you are ever tardy, just skip, trust me. She doesn't understand american customs very well and is probably not the best person to be teaching 101. Understanding under certain circumstances. This class is about equivalent to a spanish 201",0
"Be prepared if you are gonna take this class with this professor. If you had any prior japanese knowledge from high school than you will be fine, BUT IF NOT, you have to do SO much extra studying and work. She is very unclear and moves way too fast, she does not go into detail with anything and gets very side track of lessons.",0
"Overall this is an easy online course no deadlines but there is tons of reading easy midterm and final, I would take this class again. But if you like multiple choose exams and no papers this is not the  online class for you. You will be required to write papers in this class. The text book is cheap and he provides the rest of the readings.",1
"Inconsistent grading, poor communication with students, no examples of expected work, too many projects not enough time",0
She's great. The class is really easy. Midterms and final were taken from in-class pop quizzes. Only best 6 quizzes were kept (out of 9). I learned a lot. Never really used the book. I really liked her lecture style. Most annoying thing was that you had to go to office hours to get quizzes/tests back - office hours were like 3 hours after class.,1
Overall not a good class. Basically you have to teach your self as there is no class and everything is online. I would not recommend her online class.,0
"If you do the work, you'll pass. Watch the videos, do every single homework assignment, and study for the final. You will pass! Plus, he is a great guy who loves Math and cares about his students.",1
Give's great feedback to each paper. Customizes your homework based upon your individual learning needs.,1
"This class was VERY HARD. I got a D on every test. I am typically an A student and was at risk of failing. He does curve the class but it is still hard. For someone who is not a science major, I would not recommend this class. I feel he lectured on unnecessary information and test questions were random. Extra credit given at end if needed.",0
Online quizzes are not as easy as the other posts make it out to be. Withdrew from class because of low quiz scores. The additional program you have to buy is also pretty pricy.,0
"Saralina is the real life Leslie Knope. This is a professor that knows speech isnt loved by everyone and makes you as comfortable as possible while still guiding you out of your comfort zone. She supplements speech assignments with Ted Talks and readings about writing, and journaling is a part of class.",1
The best Professor ever,1
"Don't pay attention to the previous post. For some reason there is a weird following that the biology department has with its students.  There is an ton of home work and very difficult test. Do not take for an elective.  Lectures were okay, grading scale was fair. subject very specific and probably will never use. Do not take him online.",0
"Queen! Shes so amazing and really cares about the student and their learning. Those who dont like her are 100% lazy. She offers extra credit and review packets for tests. Even the tests have 9 possible extra credit points built in. She has long lectures, but theyre just to break down every detail of a concept. She has a great personality too",1
"This semester was different from the pandemic (DUH), but it really gave us a chance to see professor's true colors. Professor Draper was terrible. She didn't support us in this internship class. She added more work than she should have, given how stressful this semester was. She left me feel unsupported in this class and I would not recommend it",0
"Consider yourself lucky if you get her for 250. Very knowledgeable and passionate about OB. Makes you want to come to class and makes it fun!  Her lectures prep you for exams and she genuinely cares about your experience (lecture and clinical). To sum it up, she rocks!",1
"This is one of those professors that says there's a ""method to their madness"" because they know they're too disorganized to teach properly",0
"He is very good at explaining, but sometimes explains too much which can get confusing.  Expect a quiz weekly.  The questions are usually based off an example he did in class.  Homework isn't mandatory; he goes over the problems in class. Exams have similar questions to the quizzes. Highly recommended!",1
TAKE HIS CLASS!!! He is an amazing professor that makes class interesting and fun. He uses a lot of video clips and humor to keep you awake. Plus he's British!!,1
"When I first arrived here I took her class and did not pass. She expects a lot of reading and a lot of participating. Although I got a NP, her class was very interesting to me because it had to do a lot with the Latin culture! Honestly don't take her class if you have the chance.   ",0
Great professor. I highly recommend him for any class he teaches,1
Professor Ruiz is a good teacher. You will learn in her class. I took Intensive Span for Heritage Learners and get ready to work! She gives a lot of online homework as well as quizzes apart from your tests and group projects. If you do no make time for this class you will not pass. She does have patience and is willing to break it down for you.,1
Tremendously nice man.  Class environment fair and engaging.,1
"Terrible. Does not show you how to do anything. One of those teachers who tries to be your friend. Homework is all online. Makes you do packets in class while she walks around ""helping"". If you are in a MWF short class you will be lucky to get one question in. Overall a terrible teacher for physics and you are better off teaching it to yourself",0
"This lady does not know how to cut any slack. She wants things done precisely with no room for error every time, and she tends to set unrealistic and frustrating deadlines.",0
"She is horrible. 90% of the classes are spent in unrelated discussions. She waits until the last minute of class to tell us important info, so we end up staying late. She tells you to learn about how to write your paper by reading about it. She is extremely difficult about grammar. She marks off for every tiny thing she can find wrong.",0
Excellent teacher and class. I learned a lot and highly recommend.,1
"Terrell is a great guy and not just a professor, but a friend as well. He is young and thus, has a young soul, and is very collaborative with the other classmates and I, as we participate in discussions. He is aware he can be tough with some assignments, which is why he offers himself up as help so much, because he wants everyone to succeed!",1
"My favorite professer thus far.  His teaching style is very informative and engaging.  He is very friendly, and will give you plenty of opportunities to get a good grade in his class.  Def. try to get Felker",1
"This professor was ok. He was extremely boring. He's a nice guy and all but I honestly would never take him again. I became miserable and ended up hating the class because the only thing he ever did was talk. He makes you sign up and pay for ""subscriptions"" just for attendance. He starts off the course easy. Gives WAY too much homework.",0
I suggest switching out of his class ASAP if you're not a quick learner. Mr. Bannow will expect you to know things he vaguely goes over (like the math portions of chapters). Be ready to teach yourself or hire a semester long tutor or you WILL be lost. He will get angry/frustrated if you have any questions. Most impatient teacher I've ever met.,0
Hardest class I have ever taken. Watch the student graders!,0
"Prof. Waldner is very funny. She knows how to tie the subject to things that are going on today. She puts her notes on blackboard before class. She's very friendly and open. She gives quizzes on each chapter but they are easy if you pay attention in class, a midterm and a final. There are also journals due at the end of the semester.",1
"Ms. Avila was a decent professor. The class is slower paced, but she goes over everything, so everything good. She stuck to the powerpoint a little too much, though. As long as you participate and do the practice problems, her class is a fool-proof pass. Good for those who are not a Chemistry major and just need to pass the course",1
"I have a good basic understanding of Spanish so I didn't have a hard time with the class. But, she is not good at explaining things and is very very confusing with what it's expected from you in the class. The textbook is required because of the access code for the homework, but also so you can teach yourself because you won't learn much from her.",0
one of the most laid back teachers i've ever had and makes ast intresting,1
He spent the first six weeks culling the class with nearly impossible exams and grading the weekly homework with an iron fist. Things got easier the second half but by no means easy. He offers extra credit which meant me spending $70 to see a live performance so I could do even more work in this work heavy class. Extremely serious and passionate.,0
She does not explain things very well at all. I was so confused on every single paper we wrote and when she is demonstrating how to do something in SPSS she goes fast through all of it and takes up all your work time. Very unclear on her instructions and tests are very difficult. Papers took her forever to grade and we almost never got out on time.,0
"Professor Hesford encourages students to look very critically at course texts, and does not encourage any particular line of thinking. Assignment descriptions were often unclear, but she was a surprisingly generous grader, despite being very critical when giving feedback on assignment drafts.",0
"His class covered the most basic grammar, and then he grades ridiculously hard on papers. Lots of threats at students, not a likable person at all. I learned absolutely nothing, and I went to every class. I wish I had skipped them all or not taken the class. His only advice is to use Grammarly or the writing center instead of actually helping.",0
"Seems like he is a great engineer but lectures are not clear. He's trying to teach us that listening goes far in the music field, but if you are learning something for the first time, it takes a real professor to teach it to you and he isn't it, he's an engineer talking engineer lingo.  He has a very cool personality though.",0
I work hard and have always done well in all my classes- especially English.  she does not give good clear feedback & grades very unfairly. would NOT reccommend.,0
"Anne is a great professor and I enjoyed taking Geophysics with her a lot. She is down to earth, explains the material well, and is more than willing to help you out. The class itself is very interesting and problem solving based. Not immensely difficult and I felt like  got a lot out of the course.",1
"Fantastic lecturer as someone who is a visual learner, his use of videos for many topics made me remember the material. He has funny stories in class to tie things together and answers questions as well as he can after class. He does truly care but you gotta show up to class. FYI the first exam is the hardest but it gets better, promise!",1
"Doesn't let students form their own opinions and forces his upon everybody. This environment does not facilitate learning, rather, it tires to force a way of thinking upon you. I am dissapointed that the UC system would hire someone like this",0
Mr. Clark was a great professor. His tests were directly from the material taught and I would definitely recommend you take his class.,1
Best professor I think I have had my entire college career. If you listen to his lectures you know what he expects. The review sheets set you up perfectly for the exams.,1
"Her online class is literally to just read the textbook and fill in the reading modules. Textbook and Tophat are mandatory - expensive! Her lectures are useless, don't have anything to do with whats on the quiz No interaction with prof - just read the book and take good notes and you'll be fine Marked on 4 quizzes and a final, all multiple choice",1
"Knows alot, however very unorganized, textbooks are not used, limited to no email responses and doesn't update or post grades. Missed deadline for final grades. Overall this course is easy however it gets boring, tests are harder than lecture, pop quizes and online tests.",0
She is the best math teacher I have ever had. Her lectures are really clear and concise. She doesn't assign homework but does have a weekly quiz. She is more concerned about you understanding the material instead of getting the right answer. The tests are sometimes tricky but she gives a ton of partial credit. She is really funny and truly cares.,1
"I have had the opportunity to take two classes with Dr. Buhler.  He has high expectations and often teaches classes that would be demanding despite those, but if you put in the effort you will leave the class impressed with what you managed to learn in a semester.  If you're expecting to coast through 584 or 541, I must urge caution.",1
Great class! It is a little work but it was worth it. I am going to take as many classes with him as possible. The accent is great as well its make class interesting.,1
Just take notes during the lecture. Easiest gen ed for Fine Arts.,1
"This professor expects so much and he puts out very little. Makes crazy sounds and tells pointless stories. He is extremely judgemental. Favors students who kiss up to him. Also isn't clear when homework instructions and harsh when giving his critiques, especially if he isn't a fan of your work. Not encouraging at all. Do not take his class!!",0
It is time that other Professor teaches something good in this Campus. I had him twice and I have not learned that much. He will do a very basic work. If you are trying to learn something you need to take another one.,0
"Being a psychology major, I had taken her previously last year (first class on campus) and have noticed a significant difference in her demeanor and teaching rapport. Communication with her is rare at best and instructions on assignments are susceptible to changing weekly. Only recommend to those with lots of open time for studying.",0
"Ehh.. how should I say this. Weird teacher... She is a joke, too easy for teaching a science course and she is not that good at teaching. She writes almost the same examples on the board 24/7 and asks you to solve. She doesn't really care if you get the materials or not while she sounds like she cares... Oh well.. take her for a mickey mouse class.",0
Did not learn much,0
"I would highly recommend not taking this class unless you have too. She is honestly one of the worst teachers I have ever had. She is a tough grader and doesn't specify exactly what she wants for each assignment. Then she takes off so many points because it is not the way she wanted, not that she would even tell you. She's also rude. don't take it.",0
"This class was helpful to learning the writing concepts for PR, but the course was not clearly laid out. You will never know your grade to the very end.",1
"She is an amazing professor, and she gives good feedback. She replies to emails so fast like a robot. She gives opportunities to improve grade quizzes, exams, and essays. Finally, This is a super easy class because of her caring character. I would extremely recommend her class. You won't regret it.",1
"Test are difficult, sometime quite different from homeowrk.",0
"People like Fulsom for Astronomy, but I really enjoyed Nelson's class. I admittedly fell asleep often in the dark room during long lectures, but the subject matter is really interesting. Has experience in field. Very passionate about astronomy, clear about what will be on tests, good review sessions. I learned a lot.",1
Zaech is extremely critical and unclear in her expectations. I am currently taking her class online and every time I submit an assignment she has dumb critiques for it. I do exactly what she's looking for and it is absolutely never enough. There is a discussion due almost everyday and its basically and essay. She is a tough grader for no reason.,0
"Greta works alongside you to help you earn the grade you deserve. She is a very fair grader, but is always willing to help you succeed.",1
"Mrs. Holmes is an amazing teacher. Yes, she gives lots of homework, but its worth it because she is outgoing,funny,caring, and really nice. If you want a fun teacher that actually cares about you passing math Mrs. Holmes is the one for you!",1
"Teacher covers all the assignments in class. She challenges you with extra work in class and gives extra credit for it. Test are open book, doing several programs. You have to know your stuff!! But if you like programming this is the way to go.She uses an online package to submit all the work we do in class. I recommend this teacher.",0
"He doesn't really teach during the lectures, more so just tells stories. The tests are very long and detailed. Tests are 20% each so make sure you study. He has online quizzes which aren't horrible and activities online.",0
"Very intense class. The content is not very easy to understand, and it doesn't help that the lecture examples are way easier than homework questions or midterms/exams. I cannot believe the amount of homework required to be submitted every week, so much paper used in this class. Each question takes up a page. Starts simple, then becomes very hard.",0
LOVE HER!! She is definitely one of the best at TCC. Super fun and easy going. Her tests are superrrr eassyyy!!! And she is really understanding! Take her. Dont take anybody else but her.,1
A lot of material needed to remember for tests. Quite specific and a lot of weird names of sites and types of people and time periods you have to remember. Was a difficult course for me.,0
"Would often make you stay hours after class for a critique that wasn't very useful, or wouldn't have time to give one at all.  Provided lots of examples and books that were helpful to look at. Her instructions on assignments weren't clear half of the time, and she docks points if you don't participate in class discussions/critiques everyday.",0
He is a great teacher that is very interactive and funny! He does a good job of explaining difficult concepts and for all those people who don't usually like math - he makes it enjoyable. Would definitely recommend him!,1
"Avoid if possible. Although he's a nice guy and very funny, I found the lectures to be very unclear. I had to teach myself everything in this class and mechanics is not an easy thing to self teach. Studying hard and often is the key to doing well. He gives a quiz every class but helps in the end. Tests are hard but he curves the average to a 75.",0
Professor Licato is probably one of the best professors I have taken here at Farmingdale. I would definitely recommend him to anyone that needs to take any computer classes. I had to take a computer class for my major and he was so helpful every step of the way. He even helped me do extra credit to get my grade from a B+ to a A- Great professor!!!,1
"Its a difficult fast paced class. His explanations are good but he does have a little bit of an accent. If you understand basic algebra and trigonometry well, you can do good in this class",1
"Nice person, not a good teacher. Forgetful, unorganized & hard to follow. Textbook is useless. Study guides are just a bunch of vocab words. I dont even have enough space to tell everything thats wrong. Just avoid if you can. This should be an EASY A but i settled for a B+ with WAYYY more effort than need be for a friggin history class.",0
"Professor Tanoukhi is clearly knowledgeable in her field, and a very intelligent woman. However, her teaching style is confusing and often muddled. Does not highlight concepts, but attempts to derive them from quoted text, and does so rather poorly. Rely on the TAs for this class-- they will save you!",0
Soh is my favorite professor. She is intense. You need to work really hard to meet her standards. I am still getting an A. I am proud of myself.,1
"great teacher, definitely will have to put some effort into your grade. Had 6 quizes, he dropped 2, a mid term and a final which you get to use a piece of paper, and a paper which wasnt that bad. Overrall good class and cool teacher",1
"I don't even have this guy as my professor but I hate him already from all the reviews I have been reading, I genuinely despise these kinds of people.",0
"shimko is a pretty well organized and easy to follow in lectures. He is quite competant overall. However, beware his tests/essays. The essay part isnt that bad if you study beforehand, but i consider the fill in blanks hard - some simple questions you didnt think needed studying for and get wrong thus getting only an average grade. Good overall :)",1
"Very time restricted exams online, has habit of not unlocking assignments on time",0
The best professor I have ever had the experience of  learning from. I highly endorse any topic he teaches. MT should clone this guy.,1
"Mrs. Fox is tough, but diamonds are the hardest rock, and this one's a real gem. Stick it out and work your ass off and you'll learn so much.",1
"I loved the class! She is so sweet and she definitely knows how to give a class, she likes to interact and ask for the students opinions on everything. there is no homework. there is only 4 grades and two of them is midterm and the final, the other two are projects that you'll have fun with. Take Her!!!",1
Easy class if you put forth a small bit of effort.,1
"Professor Willmore is fine at teaching, but the amount of assignments we have online (during Covid-19) is ridiculous. She cares more about the specificities than if youre actually learning the material. You can definitely tell she cares, but I took her class in an extremely difficult time of my life and she was less than understanding. Id skip.",0
"Professor AJ is an incredible teacher and her lectures are interesting and, she keeps you evolved . Her syllabus is easy to follow and she sometimes seemed to adjust her lectures to meet current events which allowed us to be able to discuss our opions in real time which I think is great. I would definitely recommend taking her class!!",1
"I would not take her again. Her ""lectures"" were just typed out(not formatted) on D2L. They were hard to read and practically useless. She had a discussion post required every wk, but she never commented on any. You did it, you got graded. If you want an easy A, this class is for you. If you want to learn something, take a diff. teacher.",0
"This was by far my favorite class. I took this class as a Freshman and I loved it. He is super nice guy and definitely knows what he is doing. He is always willing to stop what he is doing and help someone.  He goes over problems EXACTLY like they appear on the tests. Pay attention, take notes, ask questions.",1
"OK professor. This class was very easy, but his attempt to teach/help was never sufficient enough. My classmates always seemed frustrated to follow and he'll mock you if you didn't understand. I didn't need to attend his class to pass his tests b/c I felt like the textbook was much more helpful! I'd say it's only mandatory to turn in hw/for tests.",0
"Hmmm... Annette....well very intelligent woman, CPA! Uhh..the words sometimes don't flow like they should...she gets caught up in what she saying a lot! haha VERY Nice though!",1
"Professor Killough absolutely makes you work for the grade, but it is doable! She actually cares a lot about the success of her students and is preparing you for what is to come with your career choice. If education is not for you, this class will be the deciding factor. I loved this class and all the work better prepared me for a teaching career",1
"Best professor in marketing. The test is multiple choices ranging from 40-50 questions. Test is mainly come from examples/scenarios during the lecture. Make sure to attend class, do all small hw and ask any questions. His teaching is amazing because he works in an Airline before. You will learn a lot and receive an A+ if you do your thing.",1
She gave good lecture and was easy to ask questions. This class is one of the hardest at Pierce. This semester was tough online and knowing that she still wouldnt round anyones grade who had a 79 or 89. The mental stress from this class is exhausting and having so many assignments doesnt help you study. She only gave us 4 days to study for final,0
"THE WORST CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN, ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. DO NOT TAKE IT. Exams and quizzes are based on text book, (AND THE WRONG ONE, TOO), BORING, and he doesn't help WHATSOEVER. I knew everything in the class prior to this course, and I cannot even believe how terrible the experience was. HORRIBLE. He takes too long to respond too. STAY AWAY",0
"Professor D'sa's relaxed and calm teaching style is extremely effective in teaching material as dense and comprehensive as corporate Finance. He gives no surprises on the tests and says that he tests how well you understand the concepts, not how good you are at memorizing. If you want to learn Finance, take this professor.",1
Her enormous ego keeps her from teaching. Her class averages are the lowest on department wide tests. Disrespectful to students. Make friends with other classes; you will need their notes to pass. Almost her entire class is failing. Get adifferent prof. She is the failure!,0
"Hardest class I've ever taken, but she knows her stuff. Her class took over my laugh. ",0
Park is the worst math teacher I have had a TCU. Made me feel discouraged and was arrogant when asking for help. Also forget about partial credit because you will get none.,0
He is a great teacher and class was always fun. I was in his developmental psych class for the first time he taught it and yes he is Hot!,1
Dr. Schauer pushed us to learn more while making French feel fun. Reading and writing short stories was a challenge but improved my ability to use the language. Pay attention and shout out answers here and there and you'll do fine.,1
"Professor Benitt spends more time discussing UFO's and Big Foot, than he does teaching Astronomy.  He is obsessed with neatness and completely irrational.  His teaching style is haphazard and confusing.  He is all over the board, which makes it hard to copy down notes. My notebook looked like a treasure with all of the arrows I had to draw.",0
"Lots of homework, lots of class participation. YOU NEED TO SHOW UP FOR CLASS",1
"I did every homework, spent so much time on this class, followed her rules and never got an A. I don't recommend her",0
"Neglects to tell students about huge concepts until the review classes before the test.  Doesn't do anything but read from the slides. NO time in-class for students to do example problems and discuss, which is NECESSARY to understand math. Acts surprised and condescending when students aren't getting it.  DO NOT TAKE FINANCE WITH HIM.",0
"I thought that this class would've been a breeze going into it. Little did I know, Nelson likes the tiny details in things. All of his tests are short/long answer. You have to know your stuff for this class. You don't need to go to ever class, notes are  online, tells you all of the important dates first day. Good at memorizing?  Take this class.",1
"Awesome coding hw, but very time consuming and pretty hard. Class is a waste, he explains code in his own word and does not reference his lecture slides he made. His midterm & final will not be anywhere close to the lectures. Horrible coding examples. Its 20 mins of silence while he codes and shows it works and moves on. Does not elaborate the code",0
Dave's biggest flaw is that he speaks in monotone and can speak too quietly at times. I have no other complaints. He is the one of the best professors I've ever had in terms of willingness to answer questions and let class digress into relevant discussions. He uses current events and modern examples to help put the class into context.,1
"Seems like she is scared to be up in front of the class teaching, sometimes stutters or doesnt know when you ask her a question.  Overall pretty boring and irrelevant class.",0
"Ervin is ridiculous! He might be nice in class and seem helpful but his tests are the hardest I have ever had. I'm an A student and got a C in the class after doing all the homework, going to EVERY class, and studying a ton. Studied forever for the final and still failed! Cheat sheets don't help. Good luck.",0
"Well, this is week one of her class... i have not spent about 16 hours over this weekend writing her chapter summarizes and have another whole chapter to go. I am a graduate of a nursing program and currently quit my job to accommodate classes for a higher degree in nursing. Yes i am taking biology again due to credits not transferring.........",0
"Had her when she was at UIC. Yes, she is beautiful. I hope she reads this. But, she is a wonderful teacher. Brilliant. Loves sour skittles, and i think martinis or cosmos. And cheese. Ask her about the kid who wrote about Ovaltine. :) Highly reccomend. This chik can really teach!",1
she just hands out A's,0
"She talks for ever in class about the most abstract stuff. Approximately 5 minutes of what she goes over in lecture is on the exams. Inconsistent af, late all the time, exam is 100% based off the book, and you only get a study guide if you're lucky. Never grades things on time. Comes off as super nice, funny, etc. but a bad professor.",0
"EXTREMELY HARD GRADER. Considering your grade is dependant on passing exams, it is a very precarious position to be in. Lectures are monotonous and boring, the lack of engagement makes it difficult to determine what is expected of you and what you are expected to know and gain from the class. Would honestly recommend any other prof in the dept.",0
"His lectures are really boring because he just reads straight from the slides, but the class is extremely easy!! don't listen to bad reviews on here. theres 3 quizzes that are straight from the textbook and 1 take home test. this class is an easy A!!",1
just say no.,0
"If you are not fluent in Spanish, you will struggle a lot. He depends on you to ask, and when you ask he might not explain it well. ",0
great teacher notes are really helpful gives a study guide for every test,1
professor logue is the best ever,1
He cares about his students and is helpful in every sense.,1
"Even if you read the free textbook, he will ask you things you can't find anywhere else besides HIS lectures. 2 lecture quizzes per week, 1 chap reading quiz + discussion prompts per week, 3 exams: 60 mult choice, final exam: 120 mult choice, & once a week time-consuming Problem Sets that you will hate. Hard grader w extra credit opportunities.",0
Nice lady but her demands for the class are overwhelming. I'm a science major and her class took up more than half my life and was more unnecessarily demanding than my other classes. Work isnt tough but extremely time consuming and tedious. shes a tough grader so get ready to rewrite everything all the time and never feel sufficient,1
She is very helpful and will email you back in a timely manner. Fun essays and will help you understand your grade. Best teacher at CSU!,1
This class is very difficult. If you are not interested in science please do not take this class. I wouldnt recommend even it even if its your last option. He makes the class harder than it should be and the study guides do not help. Hes a nice guy .,0
"Heavy course load!  Great teacher, instant help in most cases, assignments are clearly worded, very helpful.",1
"Robert Mustard is without a doubt a terrible teacher. He tries to throw everything at students, confuses them on tests and puts unexpected questions. He purposely wants his students to fail. Please do not take him. he always puts on a fake smile in front of everyone. He throws curveballs on tests. Please avoid this man, I just want to help everyone",0
"Completely all over the place, she doesn't even know what's going on. Super boring but SO easy, you could hand in a paper 3 weeks late and she probably wouldn't even notice. Doesn't really make lesson plans, you just hang out til the class is over. Attendance doesn't matter. If you want to actually learn, take someone else. ",0
"Attendance is not required you have test and sometimes they're difficult. Easy class, Would recommend her.",1
"never take this class, we learned things in class, and BAM they were not on the exam. very one sided and did not care to hear her opinions.",0
"Prof. Maojoudi will lecture quickly & he does have a rich accent so my TOP 3 TIPS are sit at the very front, take detailed notes & write quickly.  It was a pleasure to take a professor who is so  passionate about his craft & although he seems like a tough guy on the outside he really does want to see ALL of his students succeed! Maojoudi rocks!!",1
"Horrible planner and doesn't know how to use online tools and basic technology. The pacing of homework was irregular often assigned entire chapter readings the night before a class. On top of this, he is extremely slow and has no humor.",0
"I learned a lot about people and myself. I liked the relaxation sessions as I have anxiety from an accident,it help me to relax in other classes as well. I learned how to counsel people with problems. Great man respectable too.",1
"Dr. Hough has obviously worked hard to develop good pedagogical practices. I didn't go to office hours, but friends say he's super accessible. During lecture he always made an active effort to talk with students during clickers. Awesome explanations. Would definitely recommend sitting in front! Also, he is very kind about pronouns & accessibility.",1
"First semester at Mjc, let me tell you, I hate waking up early for school but he made me excited for class. I would look forward to his funny stories. I promise you having him as a professor is something you won't regret. His tests are super simple he literally explains to you the material. All you have to do is listen & you're good b",1
"One of the smartest, most engaging guys I've ever met. Quite a bit of reading, but it's worth it because the discussions he leads are so dense and informative. Fair grader. Responsive to what the class finds interesting and brings out the most in your ideas. You'll come out of his class smarter, and it's a genuine honor to have worked with him.",1
"Wingender has a strong opinion and it could scare some people. His class is easy if you go to lectures and take notes. If you take good enough notes you'll never need the book. 4 tests are your only grades, and some credit for showing up and participating. If econ interests you it's not a bad choice to take him.",1
"Professor Finley was hands down the greatest professor I've ever had. He is fair, grading criteria is clear and his class was very enjoyable. I highly recommend him and I would without a doubt, take this class again.",1
Ana is my favorite prof at Chapman!! She assigns the necessary homework and really cares about her students. She is so sweet and has a happy disposition every day. I learned quite a bit from her class. Make sure to take her class because she is an absolute gem. It's a great class to take over interterm.,1
"Mr. Hayes is a wonderful professor and human being! I always liked psychology, but now I love it. He does not just teach a class, he introduces you to the world of human behavior. He works for the good of his fellow man and not just a paycheck. SVCC is blessed(and should feel honored) to have a staff member of this caliber!",1
"He is awesome. Took his class at ACM, and he was relaxed, fun, and clear. He spent most of the time talking things out with us, instead of lecturing like crazy. I was even gonna take another one of his classes, if it hadn't screwed with my schedule.",1
Awesome prof and person. His exams are always really fair and you know what to expect. He always brings in examples from his industry experience and it really helps relate engineering to the real word.,1
"He really likes to talk (and swear), and sometimes he make his own theories about psychology. He doesn't care about your attendance, but don't skip his class because in just an hour he could make a book with his words. boring",0
I have been lifting for years now and Ayland taught me so much that I never knew. I could not recommend taking his class more.,1
"Dr. Ayers is one of the best professors UAB has.  Great sense of humor, and has loads of practical experience.  He's likes fast cars, and anything BBQ or beer.  Oh and he's really great at breaking down how marketing works.  Fantastic class!",1
"Mrs. Warden is every freshman's nightmare. She manages to make ENGL 1010/ 1020 so unnecessarily difficult by her impossible ""grading"" rubric. You can do everything she tells you and she'll still take off points with no explanation. If you aren't clear about what to do, she'll simply say ""I already told you"". Her emails are unprofessional and rude.",0
Very bad professor. Very unclear. Bad english skills. Very bad people.Is better when he doesn't attend.,0
Professor Smith is an exceptional instructor. I really enjoyed his class completing the communication assignments.,1
"One of the hardest professors I've taken for bio, he doesn't respond to emails, he doesn't help when you ask questions, he shows a lot of attitude if you ask him something, he's a harsh grader, picks on certain students and he gives pop quizzes, he gets mad when you struggle to pronounce a certain word instead of helping you.",0
"Scribbles vague notes on board, and cannot read handwriting whatsoever. Tests are way too hard- covers too many chapters in one exam, and are not permitted to use any notes, and entails excessive essay questions. Each individual test is worth 20% of your final grade. 70% of the final grade is based solely on these test scores.",0
"BEWARE !! FOR NON SPANISH SPEAKERS, AVOID HER LIKE THE PLAGUE",1
"Stay FAR away from this teacher/class unless you are 200% dedicated. 40+ pages to read, 3 tests, 3 quizzes, a 30 minute video & discussion board EVERY WEEK. This was the hardest class I have ever taken and ended up having to drop it. May have been easier if this was the ONLY class I was taking that semester.",0
Way to tough on the grading of papers. You are graded by TA's and not the teacher. Lots of papers to do. No book is needed for the course. If you sign up for this course come prepared to work and be graded very hard on papers you write. The only benefit is it's an online class and you get due dates and plenty of time to finish each paper.,0
"Very fair course. Yes, I won't lie, his lectures are quite unclear, but if you follow along in the book and do all the homework you will do fine in this class. The tests were difficult and there's a quiz almost every class but just put in the work. very nice and he will help you if you seek it. Take him over sepinsky.",0
"I struggled w/ Math my entire life until I took Prof. Ball. He's accessible & cares that you understand - allows you to ask all the questions you need answered. Absolutely the BEST math teacher I've taken in my life! He breaks it down until you comprehend the material & is patient with you but most importantly, will not judge you for not knowing.",1
"MA is the best professor at Clemson, their should be no question! She is great and actually prepares you, but by no means is it easy, you have to do your part! This isn't a good class if you are the type person that its always the teachers fault and never yours. A lot of the negative replies are these type people!",1
Does not fully answer questions and has a very thick accent that is super hard to understand at times. Asked questions multiple times that received no answer because he didn't know how to answer and often diverted away from the question. I would definitely NOT recommend please take someone else if you can. ,0
"great teacher, that is strong in teaching and wish more were like her because she cares ,but boy she can be tough at times",1
"Great Instructor! Awesome feedback. Not too much homework or quizzes. If you have questions, he is there for you. Prompt in answering emails. ",1
"A tough subject to teach in any case, but he really tried to break the concepts down and explain things thoroughly and concisely. Couldn't think of a better prof for this material!",1
"He provides good feedback to each student helping them improve. The assignments help a lot & could be applied to real life situations. The classes are very engaging and he posts videos available to class before the lecture, which helps students more with their learning process. The online textbook was helpful. Very fun and informative course.",1
Hoffman is really hard for biochem. I know students here are saying good things about him which I agree with. He's not a bad guy just rushes through lecture and his exams are only thing that your grade will be based on. Whole class wants extra credit but Hoffman don't care.,0
"She's a nice lady and is overall very intelligent when it comes to the language. However she gives you so much work, she must think it's the only class that matters. Don't be late or miss class or you'll fail. Four in class presentations and one is done with group. Oral presentations as well each week. She's nice but she'll kill your GPA.",0
"He talks very loud and fast, and for me personally is hard to take lecture notes. If you don't take notes be prepared to read and do some research. ",0
She gives you freedom to choose each speech topic so that you can talk about something you are passionate about. This makes the class a lot more interesting because you can take time to learn more about what you care about as well as hear a lot of interesting information from other students. ,1
"Professor Udezeh's class was tough, well i guess the course was tough as a whole. If you are planning on writing the CGBP exams, you most definitely need to take this course. Overall she is a decent teacher, but dont expect her grades to come cheap.  Oh yeah! Loads of group assignments. Dont sign up for her class if you dont like working in groups.",1
Interesting course. She is there to help you. Attendance is a plus since she gives you the answers to her test. She tells you exactly whats going to be in the test. MUST BE AN IDIOT NOT TO PASS [with at least a B]. Gave 100 points of extra credit. Overall a kick bak class.,1
This class was a survey of British lit.  Dr. Mason did a fantastic job of providing both breadth and depth in the material.  He also did a great job contextualizing the literature so that we understood its importance in the historical time period.  DO NOT MISS THIS PROF!,1
"Easy class, good teacher.  Pay attention in class and you will have absolutely no troubles with anything.",1
Was really strict on grading and assigns too much reading. Also get ready to take lots of quizzes and write plenty of papers (750+ words each). With all that she has a dry sense of humor and doesnt keep her grades online. You have to do the math yourself so keep all your papers. Wouldn't take again. ,1
Jamie is very supportive of her students. She is always willing to meet with students that want extra help. She is extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic about Canine behavior and understanding and speaking dog. She challenges you  to think out side the box.,1
"Never take this class as an elective. Forget about the online component, It's way too much work (readings, assignments). You are supposed to read the whole, 300 page textbook, as well as watch hours of lectures. Every now and then you are supposed to buy the newest version of the textbook (which she was an author of) that costs $100+. Ridiculous.",0
"Mr. Prey is one of the best teachers I have ever had. His lectures are interactive, thoughtful, and detailed. Mr. Prey uses cool analogies to explain more difficult concepts and cares A LOT about student success. I was a senior, didn't need to take another class, but I took Anatomy only because Mr. Prey taught it. Totally recommend taking his class",1
Excellent instructor explain if you don't understand!,1
She is nice person but her exam very hard especially multiple chooses you have to study hard and you have to cover her power point and the book. Her lap very easy and too much fun.,1
"Taking this class made me rethink my minor in Spanish. Not sure what it was about Professor Wilmore, but I was not engaged in class, felt little desire to attend, which is an issue for language learning. Instructions for certain assignments were unclear, and assignment schedule was weird. Calls exams projects which misled me about how to prepare.",0
"I had her in JAP 101-103 and LSFY 203 as well. She is possibly one of the easiest teachers I've ever had in college. She's extremely understanding when you turn your homework in late, and her classes are always fun! Last year was her 1st LSFY class and she's never taught something like it before, so She did an excellent job for her 1st time.",1
"I feel like this class is rigorous, but Miller makes it easier than others do: he is a solid choice. Only 3 students can get a solid A since it's a class of about 25 so that blows chunks. However, he is willing to work with you if it's during his office hours. That is the key to getting a decent grade in the class;meet with him and ask for feedback",1
"If you have a choice, I'd take this class with someone else. Professor Kuo is a monotone speaker with dense slides that number upwards of 100. The tests are worded in ways that make every question seem like a ""gotcha."" The type where he'll put in a little detail at the end of a question that makes it false but you'll want to answer true. Good luck.",0
"One of the best professors you will ever have. Not only will she be there for you for this class but she will mentor and help with any other areas. SO nice! VERY sweet! Down to earth! Very fun class, easy A if you apply yourself and attend class. DON'T miss out on this professor, you'll regret it!",1
"I thought this dance class was going to be a lot of fun, but instead, it's a lot more work than I thought it would be and there are not many As.  If you're looking for a fun, relaxing dance class (as a beginner, I was), this is not the professor for you.",1
"He pauses in between sentences which adds up to half the class time Spends a month lecturing half a chapter. During reviews, he goes over questions that won't be on the exam . Takes off points if you don't solve it the way he wants it. I should have listened to the previous reviews on this man. Please read the other reviews and avoid this man.",0
"Dr. Sharp is really nice and a good professor, but sometimes unclear about her expectations. Unlike my peers, I enjoy the Theories textbook she chose (but I'm used to very dense theory books from many undergrad theory courses). She is fair and helpful if you experience an issue and talk to her about it.",1
"Professor Wolfe is an amazing professor! He is very nice and comforting if you are nervous. If you mess up your speech the first time he usually gives you a second try. He is also a very easy grader. The class is not just speeches, it is many different activities like acting out things, reading a children's books ,etc. We even had a party!",1
"she good at teaching in math 099 the hardest chapter is chapter 10 radical but if u study u will be fine math 099 overall is easy for the chapter 3,4,11 if u pass those tests u will be fine for the course",1
"He really is a nice guy, he's just not the best teacher. He always gets a befuddled expression when a student asks a question- and half the time he doesn't know what the answer is. There's no rhythm or flow to the progression of material he teaches and nothing is bolded on his slides so it's really difficult to know what he's wanting us to learn.",0
"Dr Rogers is my favourite professor at Concordia. She is a brilliant prof whom not only gives you a solid understanding of Chemistry topics, but makes them land in a way that pertains to real life; not just a calculation on some exam. She is legendary!",1
"Dr. Yamazaki is hands down one of the best professors at CSULA. She makes sure everyone understands everything. She does go through each lecture fairly quickly, recording each lecture will be helpful. Not an easy class if you've never taken a physio class. You must put in the extra effort to get an A. In class group assignments, 3 midterms&1 final.",1
Dr. Che really knows his stuff. He can help in everything related to hacking and is even willing to help students with projects outside of class. His midterm and final can be tough but he usually gives easy labs and gives good grades on them. he does pop quizez as well. his lectures are fun and likes people to engage.,1
If you show up and pay attention you'll do just fine.,1
Her Teaching ability is very pathetic,0
"She is very enthusiastic when it comes to giving her lectures. The problem is that she doesn't put ANY of her lectures online in colour, but has them in colour when presenting. It is very confusing when she mentions a colour slide and I am unable to see it. She doesn't finish her thoughts, and her slides are sometimes incomplete thoughts as well. ",0
"I thought he was boring and sometimes difficult to understand, but his class wasn't unbearable.  I took Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, so he only taught for a few weeks.  I wouldn't take another class with him.",0
Dr. Harris explains things well and makes class enjoyable. You can tell that he truly cares about what he's teaching.,1
"The course itself was easy and interesting, but the prof made it difficult as some of the material discussed would be completely different from the quizzes.  I enjoyed the class but not the prof who taught it.",0
"8 absences, get dropped. Weekly written homework. Advise to switch if possible.",0
"Extremely difficult. Way too much material. Students expected to know every little detail mentioned. Tests have complexly worded questions and are unfair since they don't accurately show whether you have comprehended the material. TA and discussion section felt like a waste of time. After years of complaints, I am shocked nothing's changed. Awful.",0
"Not a good lecturer at all. He mostly faces the board, and goes really fast. Homework is worth a lot and graded for accuracy, so make sure you're getting all of those problems right. The tests are based off old exams and the homeworks, but are generally still really difficult.",0
She does not grade fairly. Very poor teaching skills. I would not take her class again. Most people dropped the course.,0
"If you care about cognitive psych, take this class with someone else. If you don't care about cognitive psych, find another class--don't suffer through this one. He tends to spend 5-10 on slides with less than 15 words on them. Know the studies, or better yet, just don't take this class with him.",0
I think this was only her second year teaching ECO100Y1. Her lectures dragged on and her powerpoint slides are directly from the textbook. Her tests are extremely difficult as the tutorial exercises and in-class examples do not prepare you. It also takes forever to get marks back and after 1 month she releases them on New Years Eve.,0
"While extremely intelligent, she expects too much and rewards too few. Her class is completely discussion based, so its critical to read all 150+ pages of journals for each class. Papers are graded harshly with horrible feedback. She clearly cares less about student progression and more about an immediate correct answer. Save yourself the trouble!!",0
"Worst class I have taken at MCC. Lots of homework, impossible lectures, no study guide (you are on your own between book info, online homework info, lecture info and info she assumes you know from previous classes. SAVE YOUR GPA AND DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! She is rude to students during class. After having to deal with her I am changing my major.",0
"Its a Math class, so theres lots of homework. thats just part of the deal. But she teaches in a very clear, easy to understand way, and gets things graded fairly quickly. I really enjoyed the class and i would love to take more of her courses.",1
"Prof. Dynes is a great teacher and I really enjoyed taking his Poli110 class. The class is very lecture heavy and the only assignments you'll have is 3 essays and a lot of textbook readings w/reading quizzes. By attending class, taking good notes, and with some studying, then you'll get a desirable grade. He wants you to pass the class.",1
"Adam Gerritsen is hands down the best professor I have ever taken at SUNY Cortland. As a senior, trust me, if you have to take a biology course, and this man's name pops up, TAKE HIM!!!",1
Dr. Holgado is an incredible professor. If you show up to every class and you do the work and out in effort she will not let you fail. She genuinely cares about all of her students. She offers TONS of bonus points. She is also always available to help you outside of class if you need it.,1
"His lecture is absolute garbage. Not relevant to hw or exams. He is a hard grader as well. In other words, he is smart but teaching is not his thing.",0
The class is pretty easy if you go. He puts all the slides online. Doesn't require the most recent edition of the text. Uses the same textbook for all his classes. Will throw a hissy fit if he sees you on your phone. Never assigns homework.,1
"Hilarious! Great at grabbing your interest. Text was great for first 2/3 of instruction, but last 1/3 is fluency. Text isn't needed if you're trying to save money but was helpful for additional info and some assignments (but you could get that info online if you are good at researching). there's 4 exams and about 5 10pt assignments.",1
"Absolutely awful. Didn't get the feeling I could approach her at all, and any questions I would ask, she would end up beating around the bush and not answer them. She treated us like children, talking to us condescendingly and just all around gave us disrespect when some of us have done nothing wrong. Got an A somehow.",0
"Mrs. Elfring is an absolute Gem of a professor, who makes the subject fun and worth putting the time and effort into. Right from the start she created a comfortable work environment and this is actually one of the few classes I've been in where everyone talks and communicates with one another. Easily the best and or funnest class I've taken at ECC.",1
Very hard marker.Almost failed everyone in the final.Exam questions were easy but don't know what happens when it comes to grade.Lectures are boring.,0
Neely has an arrogant and condescending tone on the message board (it's an online class).His tone has an impatient edge much of the time. The description of the class states that you don't need knowledge of music but it's ridiculously advanced material and the tests illustrate that. It seems he teaches to elevate himself rather than his students.,0
"Not clear, unapproachable, isn't coherent. His tests aren't feasible. Tests are based off of his lecture notes if you can even call them lecture notes. Instead of being objective in the material he is teaching he likes to throw in how he sees the topic. This class isn't convenient for visual learners.",0
"Mrs. Romani was great! I had her for CPR. She doesn't waste time and gets right down to the skills. Plenty of time to practice. It was actually a fun course! Man, she knows her stuff too. Take her for the weekend CPR class.",1
"It's a very detailed subject with a lot of information covered in a relatively short time. Show up (most important!), read the text, do your homework and it's easy-peasy. Make sure to take notes because he gives a lot of extra explanation in class to help understand the text/labs.",1
"I really enjoyed her class, I got the feeling some people were missing her sense of humor, but if you like a little subtle wit with your learning, she's your Prof. Gave great examples, was easy to talk to and ask questions, and helping find answers. Projects are well defined before you start, she gives you a checklist of things to include.",1
Shes a really good and easy going teacher I really enjoyed her class,1
"The web site is disorganized. This instructor provides very harsh criticism to students on online forums. Assignment requirements are unclear, yet she often gives no credit if any of these directions are not followed exactly. All of the grading is subjective. The book is very poorly written, but her video and lecture materials are excellent.",0
You will learn nothing in the BIA-686,0
"Wasn't terrible but wasn't teaching much. Gave us a midterm, we never take notes or use a textbook so, where'd she get those questions from? Who knows. Nice, loves marine biology but isn't ready for a teaching position just yet. Project heavy but they're all about going outside exploring which was cool but not for people who have jobs AKA 98% of us",0
I think I learned more watching grass grow than being in this class. As an objective person I think his methods of teaching are a complete waste of students valuable time. All we would do is listen to other people's opinions on irrelevant topics. He is also a pretty lazy grader. Lacks constructive criticism and when he does it's a few sloppy words,0
"Professor Schap's lectures are fast-paced and pretty confusing. He assigns a lot of textbook reading and practice problems that are not graded. HOWEVER, this extra work is how I actually learned and did well in the class because the lectures were confusing. If you take this class, do the extra work because it will be to your benefit in the end.",0
"She's terrible with computers, assigns the most useless things, and expects us to memorize AP style rules. She's the worst professor I've had in the department. And she used to tell us that we're going to be terrible journalists because we don't do things her way. The only reason she gets away with it is because she's the internship coordinator.",0
"She lies : Says she'll drop the lowest test score & then throws you a curve ball w/ ""The final score is what replaces your worst score""  ""This you DON'T need to know""- shows up on the test She's constantly talking @ seminars instead of teaching Her teaching isn't helpful at all, get ready to teach yourself! (I recommend Khan Academy) She's Hurtful!",0
So bad I dont even know what to say. Exams were hard. We had 2 exams and one assignment. The midterm was worth 40% and the final exam was worth 50%. The questions on the exam were to specific. She gives favouritism and Only likes to help those that she likes.,0
"You will have pop quizzes everyday in this class, which are extremely difficult to pass because this professor lectures on one slide the whole class. It is very hard to pay attention in this class because the professor is not good at lecturing and is very very boring. Very hard to pass this class, I do not recommend taking this.",0
"Very confusing lectures, he is all over the place. He gives homework that is not mandatory but only uses class time to go over that homework. Exams are hard and total surprises. Spends a lot of time talking about himself. Students are not his first priority.  Overall his class is just uncomfortable, take a different professor. ",0
He is definitely quirky and I found him to be quite funny. As long as you study his lectures and the definitions from the book you should have no problem. I think he's a good professor. ,1
He has been an incredible Professor! His class is interesting and engaging and he has gone out of his way to offer extra credit opportunities throughout the course. I took Intro to Justice Studies with him and highly recommend trying to take his class. He's passionate about law and his roll of shaping the fields future and it really shows.,1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!! He lacks a lot of professionalism, a lot of material all at once he's not organized with a curriculum whatsoever. Test are over 125 questions Long, very hard on attendance he has you drop his class after the third absence. No communication with students, very high standards HE CANNOT TEACH! You will learn nothing!!!!!",0
I had Crawley for S&P.  The class is difficult due to the amount of reading and content but the concepts are interesting. I think Crawley made the class entertaining and he is funny which helped.  Quizzes and tests could be hard if you were not reading/studying the material.  I would recommend to get into study groups.,1
Dr. Montanari is amazing. Her lectures were online and were very clear & not too long. Clear on her assignments. Quizzes are on the PPT. Midterm & final all on the PPT. She literally holds your hand in the class. TAKE HER SHE IS GREAT,1
"I don't know what I was thinking taking his class. The class seem okay at first, but after a week it took a big turn. Essays back to back. Even going to his office hours plenty of times, there was NO improvement. He is a harsh grader and he makes it hard to pass. Don't take his class.",0
"She waits until the last minute to give grades and feedback. She tries to be understanding but doesn't really provide help that is well, helpful. Her essay prompts are too specific for an Eng 101 class and the grading criteria is vague hence why she has so much feedback to say. Overall terrible experience, wouldn't recommend. Would give her a zero",0
"He wants you to succeed but makes it very tough to. The weekly work is too much and we're left to rely on Google 95% of the time. The TAs even say that our assignments are as as hard as their 2nd year ones and some don't know how solve some of the problems, so how are we expected to? The TAs agree that this course is a LOT harder than it should be.",1
"This teacher physically couldn't be any more boring. She doesn't understand the basic concept of a gen-ed. The tests will feature random factoids, that don't show up in the textbook nor the lecture slides. You are punished for studying the review sheet that she issues. This is stealing.",0
Sorry that I only could take Professor Russo for one class.  Great class. ,1
Professor Freed is easily the worst professor I've ever had. She teaches like a kindergarten teacher but grades like a grad school professor. She's useless at getting information across but she will grade your papers impossible hard. I'm an english major and I've never had a professor who grades like Freed. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASSES.,0
"I don't recommend taking this professor. Doesn't grade fairly (makes mistakes in grading and gets mad when we ask for points back), very defensive, condescending to students, no one wants to ask questions because she always answers rudely. We leave feeling discouraged. We had a full class and everyone dropped out except maybe 8 of us. Lucky them.",0
Dr. Buchoff is one of the best professors I have ever had at UCF. She is very caring of all of her students and as long as you put the effort into her class you will pass. There is a huge book project where you have to read and make 33 book reports. Don't put that off to the last minute because it is time consuming. All in All she is great!,1
"Dr. Talbert is extremely intelligent and has so much passion for his area of expertise.  His lectures are packed with information, so if you want to do well, definitely pay attention and come to class.  Being all new to Roman history, it was challenging to grasp the names and events.  But Talbert's accent and sense of humor helped get me through!",1
"Terrible Professor and extremely unreasonable. Gives long and useless talks that do not fit the syllabus, and thinks that her class is the only class you are are taking . She constantly makes you late for other classes and is generally very unclear about what she wants in her essays. DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR IF YOU VALUE YOUR SANITY.",0
Dr. Kellman is a very fair professor. She is very knowledgeable and presents interesting topics in lecture.,1
"A Professor's Religious beliefs should never entangle their abilities as a fair and objective Teacher. Pynn fails this and presents his own religious beliefs as absolute fact, and anyone who wants to debate him will pay the price. Instead of sticking to the parameters of the course, he instead pushes opinion pieces of mystics as verifiable fact.",0
Man is awful at teaching i dont even want to rant. believe me or not but get ready to read the book,0
"Sister Gallini does not believe in giving out full credit for assignments. She adds requirements like needing quotes from textbook that are not part of grading rubric. Avoid. Also, in order to understand most of the material in the course you will need to seek outside sources besides the provided textbook. ",0
He is very inspirational but expects a lot from his students. He shows great films and opens up many viewpoints. He expects participation from the class and lots of papers.,1
"He's a nice guy, but he's not an effective teacher. He is very excited about his subject & is fun to listen to, but his lectures don't reflect his tests well. I think he has way too much info to teach in a short span of time. His tests are way too long. He said he does this on purpose b/c in an emergency you won't have time to think about answers.",0
real-world examples used throughout; lots of experience in the field  buy a good calculator cause youll need it,1
"Daily clickers that make up a large portion of your grade so you have to go to class. Englund is very unhelpful outside the classroom and also hard to get a hold of. His tests are hard, get ahold of someone with his tests from last semester and study those and you should do fine. Very strict about cell phones and will kick people out.",0
"She never clarifies what exactly to study and the whole class is her ranting about her life. She's very outspoken and kind of funny at times, but she's bitter. She does NOT take any excuse for hw or test make-up, even if you were in the hospital or in a car accident, she DOESN'T CARE! would NOT EVER!Take her class again, i like my teachers to care.",0
Loved this class. Best teacher I have had by far. Would reccomend him 110%. I wish he taught more than just acc and dpr,1
"Monotone, non-existent, Tough grader,shows zero effort towards class and teaching. Sometimes uses his phone in class.",0
"It is difficult for professors to switch to teaching online, but he was simply a terrible professor. No clear expectations for exams and assignments. Questions on tests were full of mistakes. Homework randomly ranges from 1-4 hours. He rarely stuck to the schedule on the syllabus. He was extremely disrespectful to students on multiple occasions.",0
"He's a good guy. Not too tough on grading, and goes veryyyy in detail on his explanations. Disorganized and messy handwriting on board, but he's smart and we talk a lot in class. Resting tough guy face but he's a nice guy! Enjoyed his class. One time I wrote the wrong essay and he only penalized me with w B+.",1
"Terrible professor.  Lazy, doesn't care about her class at all, lucky if she shows.  Doesn't know subject matter or business well.  Professors like this make UT look bad.  Up side, it's easy to get a good grade.",0
Mooney is a great professor. She's very nice and approachable and she tries to make sure everyone understands what's going on in class. The class wasn't that challenging at all - as long as you study and keep up to date with concepts you'll be more than fine. She also gives you formula sheets for the tests so you don't have to memorize anything.,1
One of the Toughest professor at ccny.,0
"I am astounded by these comments. Patti is LU's finest English professor. She is consistently intelligent in lectures, and helpful in her feedback. She actively engages with students' writing on even the most mundane papers. And the comments that imply she is unduly harsh to male students are simply untrue.",1
"She makes it easy to study. She gives you videos to watch on youtube and the website she grades hw on, helps you solve problems when you need it. She helps you if you have questions. She drops your lowest score. Downside is she gives a bit too much of hw. if she tests you on pearson she only gives you an hour to finish but 2 hours if its by hand.",1
"She's such a great teacher so helpful in General Bio lectures, gives plenty of extra credit sometimes the work can get difficult, you really do need to pay attention in class but if you do then not much studying outside class is needed, just the homework. i don't know about lab though. .",1
pretty good. simple work. teacher is helpful. teaches you have to use window programs. sometimes kinda difficulty if you don't know how to use a computer very well.,1
"He is a good teacher and an entertaining lecturer, but he gives you a list of problems and does not assign graded home work. the only things that count towards your grade are tests and quizzes. You have to really put in the effort and take it upon yourself to practice the material.",1
"This class will consume your life when you're in it. I've never done so much reading or studied so much for a test. But you have to trust the process, you'll come out having learned more than you thought possible from an intro class. Creed is a must if you're a poli sci major.",1
"You don't have to read if you take notes in class and underline the specific references he makes to the texts during lecture. Take good notes and you'll do well on the midterm/final. Gives a 7-8 page paper. Gave an extra credit assignment worth 20 points for the midterm. Overall, very little work if you take EXCELLENT notes and skip readings.",1
Kaur is a very interesting professor.  She knows her stuff.  She is very friendly and always wants you to participate in class.  I think a lot of her final grade went into class participation.  Lots of reading.  Not a lot of writing.  Lots of talking and in-class discussion.  Don't miss class!,1
This was my first class with this professor and he was a really cool guy. Personable and easygoing. The class is informational if you want to learn the material but if you don't- don't show up and you'll still get an A. He gives you the answers for the tests before taking them and gives you 100% on the practical if you meet the easy requirements. ,1
He definetly used to be a stoner! Class is wicked..if your into music definetly take it. He really knows what he is talking about. I would highly recommend him. And he's to hottie to boot! =P,1
"Had Lim for 4 classes, he was my only option for each. I consider him to be the worst professor I had at any point in my college career. I did not receive good feedback on questions I asked. Graded homework did not give feedback. Only benefit seemed to be that many students quit trying, while I did try, leading to me having decent grades. Terrible!",0
"By far my favorite professor! She's very patient, kind, and understanding. Weekly quizzes are done online, no time limit. Mid-term and final exam are cake when studied. 3 papers due throughout the semester and easy if the content is understood! She wants to see students succeed! Planning on taking another class of hers in the future!",1
Great prof,1
She will fail assignments for the littlest errors and she is super tough. I had a border line B/C and there was no way I would be able to keep that up. I ended up dropping her class. The quotes and blogs don't really help or hurt your grade. She has a big project at the end.,0
Very nice guy honestly but he's a horrible teacher. Tests are only 25 questions for two and they both really hard. If you're a freshmen like me who got him just take actice notes and maybe you'll get a B but this is a really hard class considering it's only a 1500 course. If you're not a freshmen than please dont take him please dont ever,0
Heyborne is great. Loves the subject he teaches so he teaches it clearly. Always willing to answer questions and help students out. Class requires some work and study but not bad as long as you go to class everyday.,1
"Georgi was an unmotivational, unclear and dreadful instructor. He often got frustrated with the class when they did not understand lecture content. Practice Midterms are provided however, the level of difficulty is no where near the difficulty of the actual midterm. Therefore, students are blindsided as to what they need to prepare for. Avoid.",0
"I was completely lost.  Tests did not accurately reflect the homework.  You had to really understand the concepts (and I did not).  Tests were open notes/book, but it really didn't do much good.  I got a B because I randomly did well on one test, but I didn't learn anything.  My grade was pure luck.  Most of the dept. sucks so I guess he's alright.",0
This is the one class that literally helps me relax. I thought I'd hate it since it has nothing to do with my major but he completely changed my view. His lectures are simple but keeps your attention and his tests are easy as long as you pay attention. I loved everything about this class. The professor is always ready to help and he's very sweet.,1
Bad at communicating!!,0
"His focus is on critical thinking more than writing. But that's what made it fun! Lectures can get boring but its ok for the most part. All you have to do is write 4 short essays, that you can write in a couple hours. Defintly recommend his class!",1
"Others here have said that Dr. Marni is a professor who cares and wants you to do well, which is absolutely true. Unfortunately she is not a skilled lecturer/teacher and she lacks the ability to convey topics to students in an understandable way. Do not take unless you're confident in your ability to self-teach the course through outside reading.",0
"Don't really like the way he teaches -- in fact I don't think I would call it teaching.  He's not clear and he doesn't teach you the stuff he tests you on; he expects you to learn it by reading it on the web.  If I wanted to do distance learning, I wouldn't be going to class every week.",0
"littlejohn sucks, she is not helpful at all, her lectures go by very quickly and are not related at all to the textbook, yet we get tested on the textbook, as well as the web design labs, its like 3 courses in one! with a crappy prof!",0
"Don't even need the book. 1 group assignment and 1 individual short one pg writing assignment. Two exams: Mid-term & Final, which are easy. You can bring ur laptop to search the exam questions online. No note taking required for class. Just sit back, relax, & enjoy the class. Easy A & great prof.",1
Very very vague assignment instructions. I had no idea what I was doing the entire time in this course. It was mandatory for me but his classes are not mandatory don't take them! He is also really quiet and zones out a lot. He does not explain anything in class or on paper.,0
I agree with the few previous responses. There is absolutely no learning of Nutrition in this class. It's actually Advanced Biochemistry. A is possible with memorization word for word of his little book.,0
Dr. Barnes is an ok teacher. She told us at the beginning that she has RBF in person and over email and let me tell you she really does. I never read the book and found everything online. She was extremely rude to me whenever I asked any question - one of the rudest professors I've ever had. I would really not take her if you can find someone else.,0
"He is a brilliant man, but is not clear in his directions when assigning papers. You MUST work with him and go to his office hours for help with every assignment and for getting materials or you WILL NOT get an A!",0
"Excellent course, excellent professor. The professor is very helpful and responds to all e-mails. Would absolutely take a class with Dr. Fredrickson again!",1
"If you can understand his accent, this professor is excellent! After being completely lost in ECON 301 material, I took ECON 302 with him and it all started to make perfect sense. He is strongly recommended.",1
rude,0
I loved her! Amazing teacher. She gives great feedback on essays and is not too difficult on grading. ,1
"Must come to class as she doesnt post notes. Must read textbook in addition to notes from lectures or you wont do well. Took forever to mark, never answered emails, and cancelled class/had substitutes often. Gave little to no information about what to expect on the midterm or the final. Would not take a class with her again.",0
"Val in one word is amazing. The class is quite easy as long as you volunteer for the exercises and make an effort. Show that you care and you'll do great. She gives great criticism in a positive way. Best THR class i've taken so far. I would highly recommend this class for a DEC D. Class requires 2 shows, 1 essay & memorization of a short script.",1
"Class was super easy, he really challenged you to think how a business owners thinks which is very interesting as well as fun.",1
"This guy sucks. Pop quizzes every few classes, sometimes 2 in one day so you never know the information to look over. Sometimes, the info isn't on the pop quizzes you learn in class. Not a good personality, if you can take another prof or class, take it. No connection with students, barely even knew our names. Overall, not a good time, hated it.",0
"One of the most terrible lecturers in MIS department. I was forced to take two of his classes, and none of them turn to be a good experience. Extremely unorganized lectures, a lot of workshops and homework. Silly attendance counting method. 100% unrecocommended",0
"Real police officer so he shares a lot of real life stories. Attendance is not mandatory but, if you don't do the readings you should not miss any classes!",1
"He is Hot !!! His class is easy if you read the book on your own accord. I would say you have to have some devotion to pass the class.. ""its elementary"" ... Ask him about the zygotes",1
One of the best professors I have ever had. His lectures are inspiring and very interesting. He gives extra credit. Just make sure you study for exams and do the homework assignments.,1
"THIS TEACHER IS RIDCULOUS. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IT IS HORRIBLE. Mr. Weiner is a horrible professor and very self conceited that he makes you read HIS OWN BOOKS. The work is managable but only if you have a lot of spare time. He does not give constructive feedback, and his grading is very harsh and confsuing. He also cusses alot so be prepared.",0
"The class was a little difficult, but Professor Zein is very good at what she teaches. She's usually free for extra help when needed but she's pretty clear in class. Really tough grader, but great class.",1
"He has three projects that you work on all semester to turn in at the end. He doesn't grade anything until the very end so you don't know how you are doing in the class. I thought it was a pretty straight forward class, but I came out with a much lower grade than expected in the end so don't be hopeful. Getting an A will be nearly impossible.",0
"Lecture heavy, but with NO power points! does not use BB, he is very old school and does not use much technology. NO extra credit, the tests are mainly his opinions and if you read sometimes you still may be confused by the exams. only 4 grades for the class in total, attendance is not a grade :( I am not saying this because of my grade btw.",0
"Dr. Hays made this class interesting and fun. He helped us understand the basics of developmental psychology with interesting discussions. He does not post grades, which can be stressful.",1
Very supportive and inspires the student to give one's own opinion. Very understandable and pleasant.,1
She is awesome! :],1
Have to buy textbook but online access code is not necessary. Lots of reading but assignments are easy. Lots of extra credit opportunities. There is a final paper and first draft has to be peer edited so stay on top of timelines but paper is fairly easy. Typically responds to emails in 24-48 hrs and lets you know if she'll be away for a while.,1
This is my mayate. He was entertainingly smart where it was interesting to just listen. As long as we did all his homework we would pass because thats what his essays lead too. However we did focus to much on globalization but as my first class it was the best. Dont call him anything else but Dr or he will beat your unintelligent culo up.,1
"The guy is nice and all, but holy moly, his grading is ridiculous; I feel like he always marks you down on the quizzes and the test for no reason. Good luck studying for the tests because the lecture material and the practice material aren't anywhere the same. The HW and quizzes will barely help you to raise your grade if you bombed the midterm. :/",0
My high school teachers were more organized and able to communicate the information clearly. This was suppose to be a bridge/orientation class. All we did was listen to people talk and fill out worksheets. No campus tour so you know where everything is. Stay away from this professor and class if you don't need to take it.,0
Can an accreditor please sit through this course and give me my money back? At least look at the homework assignments he gave us. He never taught us Verilog but all of the homework assignments were poorly worded (if worded at all) copies of homework from more advanced courses at other universities. Most people failed but still got grades...,0
"One of the worst professors at DSC. He is rude and gets upset when students ask questions in class, not helpful during office hours either. The lectures are useless since he just reads off slides from powerpoints. Got an A in this class, learned nothing. I would like to say avoid him but unfortunately he's the only professor teaching physics.",0
Dr. Thomas is a wonderful professor!! I had her during her first semester at Tech. She makes anatomy easy and interesting. She also enjoys helping her students in any way she can.,1
"Dr. Hug is the BEST professor I have ever had. She is friendly, helpful and really interests you in the subject. She is always willing to help students when they need it. Her grading is fair, and while she is not an easy teacher, she is more than willing to help you succeed. I highly recommend.",1
Ms. Zink is knowledgeable and subject material. She knows what she wants from her students' papers.  She can be rather challenging at times. She's always willing to help with any questions or comments one might have with her critiques of an individual student's paper. Ms. Zink has high standards and wants her students to do well period.,1
"Dr. Liu is an AMAZING professor. If you're taking COMM3353 with her, you won't regret it. Each assignment has step-by-step video instructions. She gives you feedback and if you correct, you get FULL credit. Assignments are lengthy in time so you do need to set aside time for them. Overall, love this class and appreciate Dr. Liu a lot.",1
Awesome teacher!!! I took her during the summer (6 weeks fast track class-2401) It is intense & fast. B able to keep up with reading. DO THE ONLINE HOLES PRE/POST TESTS those really do help and basically read every word on the powerpoint slides! Gives Extra Credit-usually quizzes be on time for class for that!!!DEFINATELY RECOMMEND HER =),1
"The course pack was abysmal, it had incomplete texts and pages that were incomplete as a sticky-note was left on the page. The majority of the semester was spent listening to presentations of a high school level on artists and art movement or a philosophy. Where was the teaching?! Oh that's right, we watched movies on the Greek & Romans & a church.",0
Extra credit at start and during quarter. Do it! This is 30 points if you get full credit. Test weekly on previous lecture (some have extra credit). Clear questions. Group project is graded as group. Want an A? Put in the effort. Ride the slackers. The other project is the unknowns. Like a CSI game. Stick to logic when run tests. Great class  &prof,1
"This was the second semester I've had this professor, and I'm very pleased with my experience. I recommend her to anyone taking a Spanish class.  I like her teaching style and I feel I actually improve my Spanish while in her class. She is very a sweet woman and I look forward to possibly taking her again.",1
"I got an A. His class is mad boring though. I almost fell asleep every time. Doesn't really teach anything, just shows videos. He talks a lot about the books he wrote and music. He's really strict on attendance too. Latest and absences.",1
Great professor very open minded and realizes students have lives outside of city college. Interesting topics and overall very engaging class!,1
"Good teacher, enjoyed his class.",1
"wastes a lot of time letting students rewrite the syllabus until there's one week left before a test & he has 8 different topics to cover. Tests often include random & generally useless facts from articles he assigns. You don't do much in class which a is nice break, but come project time it sucks. Vote against the business game if given the choice",0
one of the hardest classes ive ever taken in my life. he is no help at all and will rip you apart if you make a mistake. he may be a very smart man but just dont take him,0
This class was online due to COVID and did not have any zoom meetings. Very few assignments besides unit quizzes and tests. I personally did not enjoy this class as it was all self-teaching and I did not receive much feedback. Had a 'B' the entire semester. Honestly felt lost and like I didn't learn anything the entire semester.,0
"Great Professor, Wants to see you succeed and improve. The class was easy and helpful. It is an easy A as long as you try to learn how to play piano a bit.",1
"Do NOT take Milligan. Her lectures are super boring with no clear examples or visuals. Her midterms are extremely difficult and she does not curve any of the tests. By far the worse professor i have ever had. Also, makes you read a ton of unnecessary articles. ",0
shes ... interesting ... you better know your chem. go to class do your work participate. get on her good side ( dont talk back be loud etc ) tests vary depending on her mood and boy is she moody. you have a better chance reading the book but since theyre changing the book now i have no idea what will be better. she only teaches at night. good luck,0
"I work a full time job, and couldn't attend his surprise weekly video-discussions. He said it was a ""shame"" I couldn't skip two hours of work to join and get help. Discussions not recorded. COVID-work related issues caused me to miss a test. No exceptions allowed. Couldn't get help on homework problems unless I knew answers. Tutors were clueless.",0
"The class was very easy. It honestly isn't necessary to attend the class. His notes and the homework are online. He does a study guide in class (which is also available online) before exams, and provides extra credit oppurtunities to add points to your tests as well.",1
I love Professor Tompson! She was really funny which helped me stay awake at 8 am. Read the chapters in the book and study her lecture slides and you're set. Discussion was pointless unless you have questions about the information....,1
Je déteste son cours et le prof est assez spécial merci... Cependant il nous donne beaucoup d'informations utiles.,1
"I don't even know what's going on in the class 95% of the time. He supposedly teaching us data structures but yet he never writes a single line of code in the class. What's going on? He has this code which is all from the textbook, and he ""teaches"" us with that. Assigmts/exams are difficult, and don't get me started on the vids he makes us watch...",0
"Very hard professor. He wants you to learn and will help you by answering questions in class. Labs are very hard and he will not give strieght forward answers during lab. Exams are super hard, and grading of them is harsher. Power points put you to sleep unless you take notes whole class.",1
This instructor is a joke. E-mailing for help is pointless as she is very rude in her responses and unprofessional in comments on grades. I dropped her class and re-registered submitting the same quality of work I did in her class and getting a full letter grade higher. I am an A student and very careful to read instructions which she doesn't.,0
"Brian is really cool and approachable. He gives very helpful, relevant lectures to teach technique and photoshop tools and is willing to support you and help you with your unique direction. Take him for any digital classes you can!",1
"OMG. He is a wonderful teacher. Yes, you do have to do your speech and test, which are all take home. Don't be disrespected and you will get along just fine. I was one of those students, who went to class and didn't talk much. You need the textbook to do the test. ",1
"Very fun class. The materials she made us read were interesting. Teaches the material towards the papers, so all you have to do is reguritate that information into a 3-4 page paper. I actually don't mind English now. Easy to look at, too. ;)",1
"Professor Dillon is a wonderful person. She's really caring, and passionate about her subject. The only problem is she is the most unorganized person ever. All her directions are very abstract, thrown-together sentences that hardly make sense. Her syllabus is painful to read, and essay prompts are a headache. She also is not very open minded.",0
"Hard grader, hard as heck, very stubborn.",0
"Dr. Luttrell is a nice, Christian man, and is willing to help students out by giving them publication and research opportunities.  Teaching isn't his strong point, however.  Combine the PowerPoint slides with studying the book to succeed, fairly easily.  Make a template for lab reports to save you time.",0
"Gamble's best kind. I say, if you can't take the heat, stay out of the kitchen!",1
"Mook is one of the worse professors I ever had in UB. He had failed to provide bare minimum requirement of the contents for the course (ie competent notes, and lecture recording). Avoid this guy at any cost.",0
She really likes class involvement but is extremely unwilling to work with you if you have something come up and can't make it to class. I had surgery over spring break and missed a few classes for appointments and she was very rude and unwilling to help me when I was asking to receive homework prior to classes so they weren't late.,0
"He seems like a very nice guy, but that truly does not outweigh the insane amount of classwork he gives each week. He is also completely inaccessible outside the classroom, and will take off 1% point from your final grade if you email him something that could be discussed at office hours. PSU offers a variety of ECON courses, TAKE ANOTHER ONE.",0
You really should take lab with this guy! One of the funniest professors I've ever had. Half the time you don't even do the lab and he grades you on TAKE HOME tests! You rarely stay over an hour and a half!,1
****er droped me from his class becasue he had a retarted senior who needed it,0
she was a good teacher but she went way to fast even before sandy hit n it just kept get worst n worst that i gave up on the whole class soo she needs to slow things down because my class was 2 hrs she had plenty of time to teach us,0
"Dr. Vutha is a professor that genuinely cares about each and every one of his students, and wants everyone to succeed. His lectures are very easy to understand, and he is a very clever and witty person. I would absolutely recommend him for this class.",1
He was a new teacher so I will give him that. He made his tests way too long and still did not curve. Maybe next semester will be better. Labs are very difficult but if you put a lot of effort into them and get help from the TA you will do well on them. He is a very good lecturer regardless of how hard the class is. ,1
"Three papers, but he is unhelpful when you ask for advice. He will grade lower on papers written on subjects he doesn't like, so write about the assigned books if you want to get an A. He is unclear with his instructions and he mumbles a lot during class. His lectures are irrelevant and unhelpful in class. Hard class/grader, not recommended.",0
"got a good grade, but bad teacher. kind of an air head. kinda nice. I worked pretty hard for my A, but you could prolly get a decent grade w/out much effort, but lectures can be annoying.",0
"Professor Krutz is a good lecturer and throws some spice into lectures. The lectures aren't too important for SWEN101, but you will be working with a group to complete assignments. Due to the content and its introductory nature, a bad group is not the death of your grade as you are able to carry your team if absolutely necessary.",1
"Had a really bad experience with the first essays in recitation, where everyone got a fifty percent or below because the grads and undergrads were saying different things about the grading criteria. Niemiec's response to this was saying that our grades don't matter as much compared to the material we learn in class.",0
"Well, I'm probably going to get a C in what SHOULD be the easiest class of the English Dept. I think my soul is slowly being killed",0
"She is a great professor and she taught me so much about wine. Her class is low stress and if you have any questions she is more than happy to help you. Attendance, two midterms, three short online quizzes, a short paper, a presentation, and a final - that's the entire class. Take Enology 15!",1
She's one of the most helpful teachers I've ever had at Saddleback. Her lectures are sometimes dry but her humor really makes this class fun and entertaining.,1
Very little knowledge of economics.  VERY unclear about information in the course.  He has no clue what he is talking about.  His lectures and the class are extremely boring.  Tests are difficult to study for.  It always seemed that the information on the tests was not covered.,0
This has been the worst class ever. Spent countless hours studying and doing his homework. Do not do not take this class if you are not a music major! He loads you with sooooooooo much homework its just busy work and so hard to understand. I usually get As in all my course work and have never struggled in a class so bad.,0
Matt is amazing,1
"Easy to understand, but he is a bit lazy... haha",1
"There's a lot of readings to do, but if you read them all and attend all lectures and sections, it's not that hard to get an A. Beware of bad TAs though, because it's an asian-american class the TAs might seem a little anti-white, just take section with a grain of salt",1
Very rude to her students and does not respect them. She does not care about the success of her students.,0
"Well.. BIO 1082 literally gives you headaches. First, the lab is the most unnecessary lab ever created. It has absolutely NO correlation with the class. Regarding the class, Dr. Thompson lectured and 95% of the time you have no idea what to study for on the test and she is not much help either.",0
This guy thinks he is teaching at Harvard and it is almost impossible to go against his opinion. He is always right and makes students feel uncomfortable during class.,0
professor Gulli is very understanding and makes very helpful videos for our classes. And gives comments that are helpful.,1
"Grades distributed to be 50% from 2 midterms and 50% from a final. Medians for both midterms in the 50s, and curves the final median grade to a C+. Every lecture was on multiple or one huge proof, and hopefully you're lucky and study the right ones that are on the midterm/final. No practice tests or hints of what would be on the tests. Confusing.",0
"Dr. Bucher was easily one of my favorite professors I've taken at Xavier. If you want a professor who's hilarious and also a genius, Dr. Bucher is your guy. Free outside of class and also tries to make his lectures understandable/enjoyable for everyone.",1
"4 people in our class of 32 passed Professor Konya's Calculus 1 class. I understand that this is not an easy subject, but when 8% of the class receives passing grades it is no longer about how the students are failing to understand the concepts, but rather about how the teacher is failing to teach.",0
"Professor Wheeler makes lecture enjoyable and interesting. I believe the class is way too hard for a 100 level so if you are looking for an easy GenEd, this isn't the one for you. A ton of reading outside of class. Befriend your TA for sure.",0
By far the one of the best professors out there. You will leave wishing you could take more classes with her. Really strives to help her students to succeed. Helps you out with difficult concepts that are hard to grasp.,1
"This class is relatively easy, but it is frustrating and annoying. The program used and format of the class is completely inefficient and not at all user-friendly.  Rankin is not helpful and cannot even do the activities herself many times. Her teaching is immature and ineffective. I would suggest finding a better professor for this class.",0
"be ready to do a lot to pass his class , tough grader",0
Great Teacher!!,1
"THIS CLASS IS NOT AN EASY A. He makes terrible jokes and the class is not interactive. He never explains a specific topic but gives out long random examples that are not really helpful or explanatory. Operations Mgmt is an interesting subject, said everyone but I hate it because of him. You'll need a textbook that he wrote and is available for $90 ",0
"Course content was interesting, but she constantly told us she was ""spoon feeding"" us, that we were lazy, not genuine and would wouldnt go anywhere in life with our work ethic. Also compared us to chinese students all the time. Would have preferred she stuck to the course material instead of constant lectures about how much we suck.",0
"Terrible, you learn more from the book than you do attending the lectures. I do not recommend this course to anyone. Get someone who cares about your education.",0
"He would give a list of terms to know which took about an hour to look up, but then none of them would be on the test.  A lot of tricky questions on quiz and upon asking, he would give a BS answer and then knuckle under and give me the points like he was doing me a favor.  Death by power point lecture. I had a 89.6% and he gave me a B anyway. ",0
"Honestly shes a really great teacher. The only thing is that mid semester she will pile on so many assignments and takes forever to grade them, but if you ask questions she'll help you so much! My best advice is get help she'll tell you exactly what she wants and you're set. she'll thrown in extra credit here and there as well.",1
IF YOU LIKE YOUR LIFE AND VALUE YOUR TIME DO NOT EVEN LOOK AT THE NAME JOANNE HOUSTON.... THE SMALLEST MOST MICROSCOPIC THOUGHT OR CONSIDERATION OF TAKIN A CLASS WILL DESTROY THE LEFT SIDE OF YOUR BRAIN SHE FAILED 28 OUT OF 30 PPL IN MY CLASS...SHE IS ILLOGICAL AND CONFUSED WITH HER OWN LIFE MUCH LESS TO HAV TIME TO CATER TO YOURS..DON'T DO IT!!!!!,0
Best Professor at BYU! He really cares about each individual student. Non-judgmental and willing to help whenever needed. Do the work and you'll be just fine in the class.,1
She is kind of hard to understand and doesnt really teach it just does examples she is confusing she even confuses herself but on the other hand the quizzes are online and if u miss less than 4 classes then u dont have to take the final,0
Great professor for ENG 102 highly recommend. Assignments are easy because she tells you exactly what to change to get a high grade.,1
"Professor Guzzone was overall a great professor. He was occasionally unclear about specific assignments or what was going to be on the test but if you ask questions to be clear, you should be fine.",1
"Attendance is mandatory. She'll take off points if you're tardy, miss class, or leave early. Her assignments are easy if you listen to her directions. She's strict, but it's only because she doesn't want students to take advantage/walk over her. If you want an A or a B in the class, you have to work for it. She wants you to be detail-oriented.",1
Doesnt explain things to where everyone can understand. Expects everyone to learn the same. Makes you feel like youre stupid if you dont understand something.,0
"CBE 350 was overall a very interesting and useful class, and I felt that Dr. Trinh explained concepts well. However, the tests and homework are ridiculously difficult (test averages in the 50s). He also doesnt give a grading scale in the syllabus so you wont know how well youre doing until the class is over.",0
"THE best proffessor I've ever had. Most of his classes are story telling, but they are all interesting and he has a great sense of humor. Tests are easy; he pretty much tells you exactly what you'll be tested over(short answer, T/F, mult. choice). You need to be in class to know what you'll be tested over but I always looked forward to showing up!",1
"If you are a favorite then you will be allowed to make your own rules, if you are not, then you better get it right! If you are not experianced in art...DO NOT TAKE HIM! b/c you are teaching yourself and then getting in trouble for what you did wrong",0
"Shes a great teacher WHO CARES. easy, & straight forward grading/assignments. Easy A as long as your doing your part.",1
"Her first test in bio 101 is just to make kids drop her class its extremely hard, her lab is insane and she makes the midterm harder than the other lab teachers, She is never in her office during office hours, get ready to study if you take her class, take maxwell instead..... Dr. Hinton is really nice and funny but her tests are insane.",0
"The final exam is based off the reading of one of his textbooks that I didn't buy, and I nearly failed it. Make sure to buy and read the textbooks. However, everything else in the class was relatively easy and fun. We watched a Netflix series which was awesome, and the other assignments required minimal work except for the research paper.",1
Shamane is an absolutely worthless professor.  Its interesting how an extremely picky writing teacher who is a lawyer still uses the word ain't.  And she calls us unprofessional.  What a joke.  Shamane is full of herself and not too much knowledge of how to teach or anything else good for that matter.,0
"Dr. Irani is a great professor of an awesome subject! She is actually a practicing psychologist, so when our class would meet, we would have great discussions rather than ""lectures"".  You are expected to read the chapter on your own.  You definitely need to have discipline to complete the online work on your own, and the tests can be difficult.",1
"Mr. Prey was an amazing teacher and I loved taking his class. It was one of the more challenging classes I've taken, but I did learn a lot. He is very good at telling stories and making lectures interesting and I would take his class again in a heart beat.",1
Prof Engelhardt is great! His office hours are extremely helpful.,1
WORST ACCT TEACHER AT CLEMSON!! DOESNT UNDERSTAND THAT ACCOUNTING IS DONE ON THE COMPUTER NOW...NOT BY HAND!! MAKE SURE YOU LOVE WRITING OUT YOUR ACCT PROBLEMS IN A BLUE BOOK BEFORE YOU TAKE THIS TEACHER.,0
He's the worse profesor.  I recommend not take him !,0
Definitely take Professor Robinson.  He's an awesome teacher and extremely knowledgeable with business law.  Def read and study from chapters as well as powerpoints.  I admired his humor too.,1
"I wouldnt recommend this teacher even to my worst enemy. She is completely inconsiderate, assigns work late at night that is due the very next morning, and called our class cry babies. Genuinely the most bitter, awful teacher. Do not take her class.",0
"Good teacher, but a tough grader. Only 3 tests all semester, so do well on all of them. It's a great class and she's a wonderful lady, but you need to stay on top of your stuff to get an A",1
"Good professor, very knowledgeable. Uses video clips a lot, but they are very useful for his teaching on history. We had about 4 papers due and some quizzes on a book. He grades a little hard. I would take another class with him, I can honestly say that I have learned a lot through his class.",1
"Assignments are easy points but not enough to keep grade up. You don't get any help on exams but a calculator, not even the normal note card for equations, & too many questions for the time given unless you're a math whiz. If you do bad on even 1 exam, your grade plummets. Extra credit wasn't very helpful. May be a cool guy, but grading is rough.",1
"Dr. Witelski is an awesome professor, and a great guy. He's always there to answer emails/questions in office hours. His class is extremely hard, but you can see the common thread of the class from beginning to end. The course is well designed and well kept, and I learned a ton in it.",1
Professor Rammaha is a great professor if you are willing to work hard. Would highly recommend attending all of his lectures if you want a good grade. Do the homework he assigns or be prepared to not do well on tests and quizzes. Review and homework were essential to the tests. Go in and ask for help. Overall an AMAZING professor.,1
His tests are based more on lecture than the textbook. For 255 make flashcards early with the equations on them and continuously look at them until you have them memorized and know which transistors they're used for. For 311 lecture is way more important than the book. Exams are similar to HW but mostly lecture examples. There are 5 test+final,0
I find that staring at paint drying is more interesting than Professor Hulsey's class. She gives nothing but dry lectures and hardly engages the class with anything useful. Most of what I learned came from using McGraw Hill Connect which will be essential if lectures aren't your thing. Content is tough to be fair but tests were online and fair,0
"Quite possibly the best professor I have ever had. Lectures were great, the work was manageable, and a lot of material was covered in an accessible way. Its a shame he is retiring, though.",1
"She is a good person, but I feel that she asks for too much as an undergrad who never plans on going to grad school for psyc. She always wants MORE. There is no way to avoid her. Put it this way, I would rather take Human Neuropsychology than take a class with her.",0
"Awesome teacher. Helpful, friendly, knowledgeable and kind.",1
"So overall I don't think she is a bad person. But it has been halfway through the semester and I have only had three grades entered and we submit multiple assignments a week. She also isn't exactly specific on what we are supposed to know, to the point of where I have gone up after class and asked about an upcoming exam and she said ""don't worry.""",0
"She talks a lot about her views on the ""youth"" and not enough about what we are doing in class. Doesn't teach at all. Code Academy will be your best friend.",0
"Get the Skooler's packet and you'll be golden. Skoolers is harder than what is on the actual exam so once you get to the exam you are more than prepared. There is a cheat sheet 3x5 flashcard for the 3 exams. Homework assignment due every Sunday and at the end of the semester gives extra credit. Cool guy, and Jon from skoolers is the BEST.",1
IAH 201:American Indians and the World was great! He allows you to retake ANYTHING as long as you go to class each week. He is a bit disorganzied but going to class clears that up. The quizzes are SUPER easy as well as the midterm. Take his class you learn a lot you'd never know otherwise!,1
"RJ is THE BEST! His Asian accent's not that thick & is so helpful. Beginning of the semester starts w/ weekly quizzes, then it becomes weekly lab reports. Spent about 10 hours on each b/c you literally construct it page by page. However, lenient grader! Non-cumulative final. RJ tells u what to pay attention to for midterm and final. TAKE HIM!!!",1
Class was out of 1000 points. She gives a lot of extra credit points on exams and quiz's to help boost your grade. She is very nice and willing to help. Some basic physiology concept will get you through the class. Just study off lecture power points and you'll be fine. got an A and did minimal studying. Make sure you study the models though.,1
"She is crazy, but a great person. Her tests are definitely hard, but gives A LOT OF EXTRA CREDIT!! Gives lots of assignments, but they are easy and the more points you get the better.  If you have an A, you don't have to take the final.  Very energetic and I had lots of fun going to class...she always made it interesting...Take her if you can!",1
Jaroff is a great teacher. Her class was amazingly fun and I learned a lot. Definately take a class with her if you can.,1
Very rude. Transferred out of her class after 1 session,0
"Dr. Li is difficult to understand at fIrst, he doesn't use necessary key words in his speech. Class requires alot of studying, and lots of patients when it comes to drawing the plant cells in lab. Hard class if you don't put in the time for it.",0
"The worst prof. I have ever experienced. How is it possible to be this bad at your job?He treated me with great disrespect every time I tried speaking with him and acted like he was the most important human being on earth and above everyone else. I never want to see him again since he is unfair, disrespectful to students, and arrogant.",0
"Good prof who knows her material and seems to teach thoroughly enough. Be sure to go to EVERY class and do EVERY reading; the exams are dependent on the readings much more than the lectures. Be sure to hand the paper in ON TIME because she doesn't accept anything at all past the due date, right down to the minute (i.e. don't make my mistakes).",1
"The most understanding teacher at PSC. Although, there was no lectures for this class, he would help in anyway he could. I would recommend him to anyone.",1
"Look, if you're going into chemistry, or want to learn, take Wendy Pell. For those 4 long months you will regret it, but coming out, trust me you'll appreciate the hell she put you through.  However, if you have a job don't take her. 60% of your time will be dedicated to this class.  Put the time in though, and you can get an A+ The Satisfaction...",1
I ddin't learn much.,0
Would not recommend taking him. Very difficult grader and does not help very much unless you completely understand the book. I attended every class and participated in almost every lecture and attended office hours and he would not round my 79 to an 80. He will call you out in class and ask you to speak randomly. Don't take this class.,0
"i took accounting in high school so the course is easy and understandable, but if i hadnt taken accounting prior, i would be so confused",0
"Such a bad TA, does not want her students to even pass. I have never received such horrible marks. AVOID",0
"He likes to have a lot of classroom participation and is very energetic, but does it in a wrong way. Tries to take feedback from students but lots of times gets lost in what the feedback actually is. Picks on people a lot, and attendance is taken every class, so if you sometimes skip, might not be the best choice.",0
HORRRIBLE.. NO NOTES IN HIS SLIDES JUST PICTURES.. USELESS TO THE MAXXX... GOOD LUCK LOOKING UP TERMS SINCE U HAVE TO GOOGLE ALL THE TERMS.. A COMPLETE FAILURE!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
She's very clear and makes the content easy to understand. The exams are a bit difficult.,1
"Had him for 267 and 268. Really liked him, always willing to bump up your test grades if you go and see him and show that you know the material. All homework is extra credit. Easy A",1
"This guy is the best teacher in PBU! His quizzes and papers are really easy, but his exams are MONSTERS! You will have to EARN your grade in this class, but its the most rewarding class in PBU, regardless of your major.",1
Solomon is one of the best math teachers at DSCC.,1
"I love Dr. Corsi, he always helped me on my journals and essays. If you participate in class that'll help you out a lot. By the way his final is the easiest I've taken at Loyola",1
"I absolutely love Professor Mason. His knowledge of British Literature is incredible and he teaches it in a way that is interesting and retainable. He's funny, witty, and will help you learn!",1
"DON'T TAKE HIM FOR ONLINE CLASS. It's an easy class, but he does a horrible job giving you the information to learn the material. Expects you to learn material from a poorly constructed powerpoint and videos that take 10 minutes to explain what could be said in 1 minute. Also he is very bad at communicating the basic guidelines of the class. plz no",0
"DONT TAKE HER CLASS! You'll never get full credit. Nothing meets her ""standards"" even if you've followed all instructions to the T. She's one of those profs who like to take points off for nothing, but when asked she'll have no negative things to say. Very frustrating! Put in SO much effort, only getting a B. I feel I deserve 5 A's at this point.",0
"Terrible Teacher, doesn't teach, has trouble staying on track.",0
"He completely killed any passion I had for Math. I went into this class excited to progress my Math learning, and he shriveled up my dreams like a raisin in the sun. I cant tell you enough DO NOT TAKE HIM, you WILL fail. This is not a challenge, please save yourself  He's got an alright sense of humor though BUT do not take him.",0
Buddy doesn't explain anything. He literally sends YouTube videos as lectures and he gets mad when you ask him something. His expectations aren't clear for work.,0
"With the workload you would think this was a 300+ level course. She is also always emphasizing her grading system (which is a harsh system) I personally would not take her again. Dont think its easy just because its online, that isnt true at all. Take a better Professor and get the grade you deserve",0
"I seriously reccoment taking any classes taught by mr brooks. He is a down to earth country boy and is very respectable. He requires work from you, but if you put in effort then you will get an A.",1
"I try to have a open mind, and there are very few teachers I dislike. I don't think this man likes his job, or at least not this coarse. The large amount of home work that count for barley any points. The test are worth so much. He goes really fast, just tells you what in the text book, and doesn't show all his work. He is condescending and rude.",0
She is a great teacher. She taught me a lot about English and writing. She makes class interesting and fun.,1
"he took 10 points off just because I attached files one the back of the report not in between, not clear of what he wants, take a lot of points for no reason. if you write a nice detailed report he will mark you off. he took 5 points off my lab because I wrote the results and explained why ! I wish I didn't take him TOUGH GRADER",0
Poor quality professor. He doesn't seem very interested in his material and the lectures are not organized. Would not take course again.,0
He does not explain topics well. his lectures are no help at all I had to learn everything from the textbook even though i attended every lecture. The examples he goes through in class he uses solutions for the textbook which is not helpful at all.,0
"Took this class last summer and it was not a pleasant experience. He hardly lectures and expects students to commit their time hours-on-end on difficult hw, online quizzes and in-class worksheets which barely reflected his simple lectures. He can get frustrated easily with struggling students too. The only upside about him is that he curves exams.",0
"Monica was difficult to contact, especially at the end of the term. She often cancelled class and when we did have class she finished early, sometimes this is good but in this case it was not. She only taught for about half of the semester and then it was group presentations for the remainder of the semester. I would not take a class from her again",0
She is not well suited for her job whatsoever. She assigns very long papers and I highly doubt she even reads all of them all the way. I had my paper given back to me with a grade of 95 (she also circles where the student makes mistakes) and when I was revising the paper I found a couple of errors that she didn't even circle. Did she even read it?,0
"Craig Meixsell was tough to deal with. He did not know the new department system, had poor time management, dreadful lectures, and graded very harshly in a ""his word is law"" manner.  If you know little about computers, take another professor.  That being said, you can pass with a high grade, but it is solely up to you to do it.",0
"Prof. Girgis is a sweet lady, but her lectures were quite boring and it seemed like the same type of busy work each week. I feel like I did not learn much from her, I was just going through the motions. On the bright side, this class was not very difficult, just a little boring.",1
"I have Mr. Kraft right now, and he is absolutely one of the best teachers I have ever had, especially for english. He is always willing to help with your essays and never makes you feel stupid. He is understanding if you are unable to make it to class and has a funny personality. He makes english fun and I would recommend him!",1
"He's a very strict grader and deducts any points as possible from the test and homework. He talks very low so make sure to sit in the front, if you have any questions he's willing to help. Besides that the class isn't as hard if you know what you learn in MATH 125.",1
"Terrible at teaching, he just stands there with his back to the class the whole time and flies through problems assuming you know how to do it. He gives out a lot of homework and doesn't give credit for it. Get a tutor and study HARD and you might end up with a B.",0
"While I didn't particularly care for the subject matter, I really enjoyed going to Dr. Curzon's classes because she is knowledgeable and kind. The tests are pretty easy if you pay attention in class, and the lowest test grade is dropped. She also has plenty of extra credit opportunities if you need it.",1
"She is a good person, very interactive. But whats the point if your grade will suffer. She is very strict and uses her old exams, she doesn't give it back. She is more concerned about her looks (flips hair a thousand times and is always playing with her hair) than the knowledge. Reads from power point, doesn't add on to what she reads.",0
I don't recommend this professor at all. In her class all she does is scan the book and read directly from it. I can do that in my room on my own time. I have learned nothing from her class. Now I have to find someone else to help me on my work. ,0
"Meyers is young, spirited, funny, and overall an inspirational professor. Her lectures are truly entertaining and they make you WANT to participate(even though you may not usually). EVERYONE should take this specific course by her as well, seriously changed the way I see things, which is rare to say about other courses.",1
"Dr. Xing was so helpful and patient in teaching us in Orgo 2. When everything had to be quickly switched to online, she did an amazing job. You can tell how passionate she is about organic chemistry. Also, she really cares about her students and wants them to do well. I was so lucky to have her.",1
"Prof. Durso is extremely knowledgeable and looks for details in your work - do not generalize. CITE YOUR SOURCES, no general opinions, and use .edu for sources outside of text books. Read the instructions for posting in the discussions -and follow them! Some people just weren't able to get it, and they withdrew. Overall he is an excellent professor",1
I hate every day of it.,0
"I had the Senior Seminar with him. He is one of the most difficult and demanding professors in the department, and his expectations seemed to be different for every student. I think he ruined history for me.",0
SUPER boring lectures. Probably the worst lectures I've ever attended.,0
Helpful,1
"Great at getting me to think differently. Though the projects were hard, and most time very open ended, the ideas were pretty interesting and my work got so much better.",1
"Ethan is a good professor who cares about how his students learn and change throughout the class. He is a very tough grader and there is a lot of outside work, but part of that is the nature of the course. He doesn't lecture which can make it challenging, but if you work hard and ask him questions, you can be successful and learn a lot.",1
"The course is dense but prepares you very well for medical school. Her lectures are fast-paced, but that's only because there is lots of material that needs to be covered. She's truly inspirational and is well respected. Study and use your resources.",1
"Seems to be a nice person and a decent prof. However the course is extremely disorganized. All lectures are prerecorded which automatically restricts access to the prof. Very little time in class to work with group members which limits the quality of your research project. For a 1st/2nd year research methods course, maybe. Capstone course? Please.",0
"I would not recommend anyone take this class online with this instructor, unless you are already fluent in Spanish. Does not teach,& does not provide feedback at all to students. DO NOT let the words ""Beginning Spanish 2"" fool you, as it is anything but beginning. All instructions are typed in Spanish. I am dropping before it ruins my 4.0 GPA.",0
"This professor is just fine. Not great, not amazing, but fine. She is nice and presents the slides in class but her exams are tricky and sometimes not well written as youre always self doubting. 5 in class assignments pop quizzes that count for your grade. Just do well on the exams and youre fine.",1
"This guy, wow, He is an utter failure of a teacher. My three 4000 lvl courses were easier than his 1000 lvl course. His opinions are the only ones that matter and your grade reflects. He will tell you that you are in the wrong major and just utterly decimate your grade if he doesn't like you. Grades based on his opinion, not on skill. Absolute jerk",0
"Thomas-Reid is an eye-opener. The man is fantastic and wants to see everyone do well. He does not care about your grade he just wants to learn, but he helps so you can get that A that you want. Take him and you will really enjoy it!",1
The best teacher Ive had all my time at HCC. Very helpful and excellent metrology.,1
"Her class is always interesting. There are no tests, only papers. She is very intelligent, and has a lot of field experience. Buy the book, and make sure you spend time on the papers. Going to class is important when you go to write the papers, as you can use lecture material.",1
"Statistics 6903 in Family Sciences Dept. If you don't understand Stats as they are applied practically before this class and you make an effort and listen to Dr. Jennings, you will! Extremely laid-back professor of the 'old school' type, he is a wealth of information. Pick him for your advisor!!!!",1
"i definitely recommend this class...nelson is a great teacher and knows the material.  he makes the lectures really fun, and has really corny jokes.  the material is kinda hard but he tells you exactly what he is looking for. make sure you attend lectures",1
"While Jeff Marks clearly has a love for Spanish, I had a difficult time learning from him. Nobody asks questions in class because he is intimidating. The way he grades and comments on assignments and papers is somewhat degrading. His tests are extremely hard even after staying up until 5am studying I found myself failing. I wouldn't recommend him.",0
"Awful class. You had to basically memorize every word said in lecture and every word in the textbook. A lot of material on tests were from the textbook and never talked about in class/discussion. Lectures were extremely boring. Tests were unfair and very hard. Her grading was slightly curved, the class average was a b- but scores were a 78-82.",0
"He is a really good teacher. Besides improving and getting comfortable speaking in public, he teachers life lessons! Ex: compassion and respect. Only had 2 take home tests, open book and notes. Sometimes the class requires a lot of work for the tests and researching for speeches. No work IN class and easy to make an A in. Awesome and fun class",1
"he may come across as mean in class, but get to know him and he's cool.",1
"DO NOT take this professor. He often confuses himself when he's lecturing, which of course confuses the class. He had to make corrections to his poppers several times because the right answer was not even an answer choice. He made something as simple as algebra extremely difficult. Wish i had better things to say...",0
Absolutely loathsome.  Boring. Self important.  Uber-conservative.  Hateful hateful man.,0
She is very helpful unlike other professors she wants you to pass.,1
"she's a lunatic, whatever you do, DONT take her class. She's more uptight than a high school teacher. Counts 2 tardies as an absence and 2 absences and she will drop you from the course. Also, she is the LEAST understanding professor I have ever met, she went over on class time every class and made multiple students late to their next class",0
"Students in the class get bored easily. She just talks and talks with no attempt to connect with the students. There is no real connection because Moore, herself, is not passionate about teaching, at least that is how it appears.",0
"She doesn't email back, the tests don't make sense most of the time, and the whole ""flip the classroom"" thing is super confusing and doesn't help with actually learning.",0
"Terrible teacher if u like feedback. We got our first exam back a month after taking it and never got our second one back. My final grade was not posted for 3 weeks after the semester. Never used the textbook. Reading assignments were ridiculous and always last minute. Avoid this professor at all costs, especially if u don't like history.",0
"I learned a lot in Dr. Robinson's class. He does give a lot of homework. However, it prepared me to transfer to a four-year university to pursue my BSW degree. He helped me reach my goal!",1
"Exams have a lot of ""trick questions"" for no reason. It is also a little troubling that this man can barely form coherent sentences/spell basic words correctly is critiquing writing. In my opinion it is ridiculous to pay thousands for an online class when it seems that your level of education is higher than the professor. Gross",0
"Listen, I'm not one to dislike many professors, but I honestly really dislike her. If you can avoid Yana Sandlers, please do at any and every cost. Not only did her lectures not make sense, if you asked her a question, she just reworded your question into an ""answer"". She does not know what she's doing.",0
"Group project that is worth nearly half of your grade and is semester long. Very intense, but he grades it fairly. Must show up to class. For a tough subject, he does an adequate job of making it somewhat interesting. Core class that you must take, I would recommend him, but just know that you will have to work hard.",1
She has a Phd in genetics but that doesn't translate well to AP. She is almost as confused by the material as the students. Test questions may be randomly plucked from the text. Only 8 students out of 24 left from all the course drops. Massive amount of material. I study every night for 2 hours or more for the A I currently have. You will struggle.,0
Very subjective grader.  Must Avoid!!!,0
"The WORST professor I have ever had the unfortunate chance of knowing. She is terrible with directions, does not thoroughly read through submitted assignments & then deducts points because of her terrible reading skills, and takes 5+ days to get back to you on any questions you may have. She also gives you 40 minutes to complete a 60 question exam.",0
"He is running capstone this year. He is terrible. Poor communication and organizational skills. We met maybe 4 times over both semesters, excluding our progress presentations, which went terribly. He told groups their projects weren't difficult enough, despite having already approved them. Just goes to show he didn't read the proposals.",0
"Ms. G is a nice person, and Im sure she is a great nurse, but she should not be teaching NSG 120. It's a horrible class to begin with (boring, dry, IDGAF about nursing history, sorryNOTsorry) but she honestly was not trying at all. Didn't really cover material throughly. I never felt well prepared for the tests. Rushed through lectures. ",0
"Professor royce is amazing , he teaches everything which i upto trend that will definitely be useful for a professional career.",1
Great professor. Easy assignments. Tests are challenging - but overall a really easy class! Take this class!!!,1
"Robert Smith is a smart guy and knows his stuff, but his teaching strategy is to beat you down and build you up. His syllabus is very confusing and so are his tests, he is very particular about the way you answer questions. He grades papers for length and grammar, not for content, and he doesnt like double spaced papers.",0
"Tests are very straight forward, almost identical to the practice exams he gives. ",1
"Professor never lectured, just posted videos. His exams were nothing like the homework, it was as if the professor was trying to trick the students rather than test their knowledge. Worst professor I've had at OU so far, he just didn't seem to care about his students at all.",0
"I highly suggest to not take Dr. Bush pre-calc online course! Unless you are okay to teach yourself about this course with ""0"" lecture. The only way I could learn something was by doing the homework. Nothing more than that was ever offered. Theres 2 exams and no extra credit! Actually there was 5 points* thanks Wendy! but srly, do not take her!!!",0
didn't learn a thing!,0
"He is such a smart guy. He is very well-spoken. A lot of ppl in my class didn't like the class because his teaching style are power points and pictures, and he just talks. But i thought it was such an interesting class! You analyze advertising, logos, signs, architecture. Very interesting. I took him again fro Art and History. same teaching style.",1
I love this man with all my heart,1
"If you can avoid her, do it. The worst professor I have ever had. If you have her I recommend dropping the class if you can. I have no understanding why she is still teaching.",0
"Not a great teacher, not much learning due to her reading straight from the power points (which were sometimes WRONG). Graded off four tests , lab and a case study. ,but only because most of the class failed. Talked too much about personal life and crocheting. was not patient with students and expressed it.",0
He's was an outstanding teacher!,1
"He's (more than) a little crazy, but definitely knows what he is talking about. If you put in any effort, the class is pretty straightforward. Midterms pulled straight from the homeworks with different numbers.",1
This professor does a horrible job at teaching. He starts on a lesson and goes off on all these unrelated examples that he thinks explain what he is trying to teach. His examples are completely useless and a waste of time. His accent made him hard to understand sometimes. Doesn't go over homework or quizzes. You fend for yourself or fail.,0
favorite professor in the econ department. absolutely impossible to fail. also really engaging professor- she makes econ interesting.,1
"HORRIBLE ,  doesn't explain anything",0
"Throughout my 4 years at SJSU, this class with Professor Pearce wins the award for teaching me the most amount of useless crap. SWE majors, there are much better technical electives you can take that will actually help you land a job in the real world- unlike the useless crap taught here.",0
"Don't buy the text book. You will not use it. His grading is ridiculous. He was absurd with grading, he would do one on one sessions for your essays, make corrections, then mark you down on your final draft once completed. Even though he made those changes. Hes absolutely hysterical. Just make sure you're a unicorn in your writing to get just a C",0
"She makes this class really hard, but if you ask for help outside of class it will help. She moves too quickly through material, her accent makes her hard to understand, and she doesn't answer questions in class well. There are graded clicker questions each class. There is a semester long group project. Definitely suggest going to office hours.",0
"She is phenomenal; she definately helped me grow as a writer. Her lectures are really interesting and she is very flexible with due dates. She is very sweet and can help you a lot. So, please engage in class conversation, do your readings, and let her help you become a better writer.",1
"Yes, this teacher was very funny. But he was more concerned with quickly cramming   information than going over problems to help the class understand. Answering questions was either hit or miss depending on the amount of topic he had left to cover that day. Maybe not the teaching style that works best for me but I didn't feel like I learned a thing",0
"Do not take his class. It is literally the worst. You can try as hard as you can to make your work look good, and he will still find something completely wrong with it.",0
"She's great for students that have some underdstanding of the material beforehand, but she's horribly confusing to those who don't.",0
"There were worksheets in discussion to go with the concepts in class. The problems on there were basically what the test was so if you knew them, you would do well. It wasn't a very hard class and the grading was very straightforward. The discussions are important though because it's where you learn the most stuff.",0
"I did not enjoy his class at all. The lectures are extremely boring and vague. He doesn't give many assignments but when he does, he grades them toughly. So if you do take this class, I recommend putting lots of detail into your papers. Also the mid term and final are 50 min and difficult and out of 54 people, 2 got an A on the midterm. Good luck!",0
"She is very fair, very easy grader. She gets a bad rap because of her accent, but it is nothing that you can't understand as long as you pay attention.",1
"Regret missing one class because I was totally behind after. She is so organized, stays on schedule, syllabus helps, SO ORGANIZED, I cannot stress this enough. Nice, smart, challenges argumentative thinking. Like 2 homework mostly worked on 3 main debates/speeches. If you enjoy Coms you'll love it.",1
"Ms. Laughlin is as helpful as an online instructor need be. I did this class in a short session and there were plenty of assignments each week to keep you busy (typically 2 or 3 worksheets from the textbook and a discussion board assignment). As long as you take the assignments seriously, you should have no problem earning an ""A"" in this course.",1
"The class was mainly lecture and discussion based. very little assignments given in class. All exams were papers that were about 1-2 pages. For final, there was only a project which you need to present in class. He very critical with grading his paper. He is a good professor and passionate about what he teaches. The textbook is needed!",1
"Plenty of hmw but it is pretty easy stuff, 10 pts each. 3 test 100 pts, know your notes. Final paper is easy, 4-5 pages about any topic you choose. Great class to take online. He responded to my emails quickly and graded fairly. Definitely recommend him!",1
"She is a great teacher but is very set in her ways.  If you do not agree with her, drop the course.  She expects a lot from you so be aware it is not a fluff course.  Jamie is an amazing resource and connection.",1
Attend or you fail. Participate or you fail. Ever heard of the saying the customer is always right? Cool in this case the teacher is God and youd do best to follow his commandments or else...,0
"She seems nice enough, but her classes are amongst the most boring I've attended. I never leave with the feeling of having learned anything. She spends most of her lectures asking students to talk between themselves before she writes their answers on the board and her voice can be distracting as it sometimes cracks and comes out squeaky.",0
"She's a super nice professor and the content is somewhat interesting. The only problem I had was that she treats an intro class like it is the only class you have and gives you a crazy amount of work. If you like philosophy and want a lot of readings and assignments, then this is the class for you.",0
"Ms. Short is a good teacher, but she does not explain every little step in problems. Quizzes are easy, they come from the homework problems. The test are ridiculously hard. I would not suggest taking her. In my class hardly anyone passed the test. She does not curve anything.",1
"Worst english professor I have ever taken. Never goes over her expectations in the course, or what she is looking for. Weird deadlines, and just unrealistic expectations. Then at the end there is a wonderful essay during your final that she never even brings up. Don't worry about it though, it's not like it's your entire final grade or anything.",0
"This class prompted me to watch a lot of really good films that I wouldn't have watched otherwise. However, there's a good amount of writing involved and the instructions are not always clear. My biggest gripe is when he took points off my assignment because he didn't think I actually watched the assigned films.",0
Young professor so he's really excited about teaching.  He tries to make it easy by having homework from connect online and the rest of your grade is tests.  Yu have to study for the test unless you know the material really well.  He's a very generous grader when it comes to essay questions but the tests are 90% made up of multiple choice.,1
Dr. Neupane really wants you to understand the material. Was available and willing to help before and after class. He does have an accent but is easy to understand. Hopefully I can take him for physics II!,1
"He is rude. I asked him to answer symble questions that I was not understanding. So I asked a symple question about an exam that is coming up. I asked ""what can I study for this quiz specifically, so that I do not study the wrong thing"". Simple enough. He said ""I am not answering any other questions"" which I thought was rude.",0
"This class was easy until we got to resumes. She told me to take off all my non-history related job experiences on mine. When it came to the mock interview, she said I didnt have enough on my resume. Her criticism was not helpful in any way. I could get into detail but there arent enough characters. Not accommodating at all given COVID going on.",0
"Dr. Johnson is a very kind and caring professor. Johnson's lectures are very easy to comprehend. The readings are sometimes confusing, but she stops and tries to explain them. I strongly recommend taking her if you can!",1
"she is a very good professor, she loves nature so get ready to be all about nature. not to much work. you will have to buy a text book for her class ""the blue book"" - $20 dollars.",1
"Dr. Miles is a genuine person, amazing lecturer, and makes time for her students. As one of her students, I felt respected and heard.",1
Talk about needing to get out of the past,0
"She's ridiculous, we spend every day hearing Dr. Smith telling us we need to work harder. We have AT LEAST 4 pages of homework every day. Our mid term was three, three page papers, an interview, a 8 semester course diagram, and 6 pages of the workbook. UI100 is supposed to be a blow off class, and it is in every other UI100. Not this one.",0
"Professor Carson is a really good man. He is very kind and understanding. All work is done in class, so no homework with the exception of 2 essays. Very easy A and he made the class enjoyable!",1
"Did a great job. Take him over any Econ 302 teacher. He can be a little dry and boring, but he's very fair, generous and won't make you feel dumb if you have question.",1
"She took over my math class after our previous teacher stopped coming. She was very nice and helpful, taught better then previous teacher.",1
We only meet once a week because this class is mixed mode and we often cut class short. I haven't learned anything that I couldn't just read out of the textbook and he makes the class way too easy. He will do anything to not give you 100% on an assignment even if he contradicts himself. I'm pretty sure he doesnt know anyones name and class is small,0
THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST TEACHERS AT ASU. Things to know hes a fair grader and his class is simple its all about veteran advocating. You get your assignment once a week a quiz and a writing assignment of 300 words. Participation in class matters remember everything in yellowdig for that. Its honest a great class.,1
Such a sweetheart!! Super approachable and good in lecture. I studied for maybe 1 hour for each exam.,1
Honestly the most unorganized class I've ever had. I feel I could confidently say that about 75% of the class didn't know what was expected of them. A whole bunch of stuff was shown in lecture that would never be brought up again so you didn't know how to filter out what was important at all. Plus there are the readings which are pointless.,0
"Okay she is hard (like Exams, labs, her grading) For any small mistake she will take points off She curves and gives extra points for sec (little bit helpful) Make sure you pay attention to what she does in class and writes on the board similar prob on exams) oh she flys throughout slides yet u need to know everything for exam cracks same jk #x GL",0
"Not helpful, not responsive",0
"This felt less like a management course and more of a spiritual self-help class. The reading isn't too challenging, but it's more touchy-feely and preachy than I'd expect from a business course. The instructors are fair with their feedback and grading, but quizzes are poorly for multiple choice format. Use the virtual classroom!!",1
"She is allot of fun! but! don't let that fool you, make sure you read and understand the information. double check your quiz answers and do not take them for granted.",1
"I lost all respect for him towards the end of the semester when he kept showing us pictures of the effects of war. They were tasteless and vulgar and lowered his professionalism as a teacher. Also, he made a paper due a couple days after our final which is not ethical. I spoke to other professors & they all encouraged me to talk to the dean.",0
"Professor Reyes, is amazing, she's clear on what she expects and wants. I took her my first semester of college and I'm honestly thankful I did. She has office hours if you need the extra help and is always open to answering questions.",1
"I was so excited to take this class but the professor destroyed the passion I had for the subject. The material is choppy and there are no class discussions. The provided materials are stale, outdated, and unconnected. The test questions are confusing and conflicting information is in the materials provided. Do yourself a favor, pick another class.",0
This class has potential to be super boring but Pete tries to bring in outside situations that are relatable to make It interesting. If you use his office hours he is very helpful and willing to do whatever it takes to get you to pass his class because he sees the effort you put into it. Gives out extra credit. I did not use my text book oncnu,1
"Pretty good prof, is very clear about how grades work and gives study guides for exams, she tries to crack jokes a lot that so once you get over that she's not that bad, offers bonus points on exams and lab quizzes, overall if you STUDY and PREPARE an A is easily attainable",1
Only 5 exams total. Lowest score dropped. There is reading that you have to do in order to pass the exams. Great Class!,1
I have taken 2 of his classes and he is hands down my  favorite professor I've had.,1
"She's a very nice woman, but she just isn't a good math teacher. I got A's in math until I had her for a teacher. I barely passed her class, even with the help of a tutor. But she will help you outside of class.  She just wasn't the math teacher for me.",1
Mi-Sook is a fantastic professor who gives great feedback and cares a great deal about her students. I have developed so many new skills in this class! Do not be late or turn in assignments late and you will succeed. I would definitely take a class with her again.,1
grad student. Cares about students' success in class. Quizzes every class. Lab is harder than lecture but lecture exams are very fair and only test important material.,1
"This guy is a great teacher.  he mostly went off power point slides, but his slides covered everything the book covered, and in a much simpler form.  He does move a little fast, but if you actually stop to ask questions, he's more then willing to explain it until you get it!  This is a great teacher. :)  Choose this guy!",1
"This class got to annoy me by the end of the semester. Its easy and the lectures are interesting. But, I really didn't like this professor. He curses way too much to the point where its just kind of annoying. However, you don't have to go to class. Tests are MC, half lecture and half textbook.",1
I would take a chance on another teacher. She doesnt respond to emails in a timely manner and rarely gives any positive feedback. She does not give clear explanations and sometimes rude to students on the discussion boards. She offered no insights or tips during her weekly videos and read word for word the assignments for the upcoming week.,0
He is a nice guy but the class is hard and the only way to do well is listening to his lecture,0
"Terrible professor, avoid at all costs. She's horribly disrespectful and the class is difficult only because she gives unclear grading criteria. She uses too many group projects to avoid having to lecture. Participation points are given arbitrarily and will bring down your grade. Worst professor I've ever had.",0
"Shamane is pretty intimidating but she really cares about her students. It took me a while to like her, because she is a very tough grader and again, intimidating. But I learned a lot from her class and I would take her again.",1
"There were many books that we had to read this semester, but homework was to post two questions on our discussion board every week, so very doable. It was a 3 hour class so of course it is hard to keep focus for long, but she did give breaks halfway through. Recommend this class because it is only once a week and she is a lenient grader.",1
"Professor Campbell is knowledgeable in her field and she does want her students to do their best work. I felt for a second-year class she was a tough grader and had too high expectations for the course and students. Overall, I enjoyed the course and her teaching style, but it is not an easy course or an easy grade.",1
"Great professor. More personal than most, and really gets to know you. Interactive and keeps the class moving. No need to watch the clock",1
"Jimmerson is a very caring and dedicated English professor. As a biology major, I hate English but I managed to get an A in the class. You have to try your hardest on everything you turn in to her because she takes off for every little error. With that being said, she does give a little bonus and is very willing to help outside of class.",1
"This professor was horrible as a professor, as a person he is rally great. He listens gives great advice and is there for you. However, in class all he does is goes over videos that he gets offline, It sounds like he doesn't know the material he teaches and his test are not what we discuss in class. Horrible class did not learn a thing.",0
"Very knowledgable, good conversationalist. Holds attention with ease. Not an easy A but you will pass if you try hard.",1
"This class was one of the easiest classes I have ever taken in my entire life, but the material was ridiculous. Professor is much more likely to give you an A if you agree with his stance on issues, even if your work is of much lower quality than those who disagree. Take him for the easiest A of your life, but don't expect to learn much.",0
The term paper is heavy for the grade.  The syllabus was clear.  Weekly writing assignments for the grade is critical.,1
"funny, kind, engaging teacher with a lot of interest in helping individual students with writing research papers and figuring out formatting/style guidelines for MLA. fair, generous grader, and super fun lectures!",1
Poor response to questions. Not very helpful and a very self taught class.,0
"Beba is the best.  she's very fair – do the reading and you’ll do just fine.  Slack off, and your grade will reflect it.  She’s my role model, she’s a stupendous designer, and a great teacher.  Don’t be afraid to ask questions, sometimes she forgets that the people around her don’t know everything she does!",1
Loved taking Professor Kinkel! She is truly amazing and cares so much about her students.... She gives great feedback on assignments and is super fast in responding to emails and is always there to make sure you understand assignments. She's so sweet and caring. You won't regret taking her!,1
"He is a great guy but he doesn't give very good instructions. He is very experienced, but I think age is beginning to affect his memory and processing.",0
Great Prof! He's very clear and classes are interesting! Fun class,1
"Just took his CHE seminar last semester and wanted to let anyone know taking it, he will try and scare you but don't fall for it. First day of class, he gave ridiculously hard ""quizzes"" and 17 people dropped that day. More dropped along the way. In the end, EVERYBODY got an A or a B. Bs for the ones who barely showed up. Just stick with it. Easy A.",0
all i can say is GPA booster :D,1
Awful awful professor.  The meanest person I have ever met in my whole life. AVOID!,0
"I really did not like this class. I use to love history, but after this class I dont know if i'll ever take another history class at oregon. She says if you know the answers to the questions in the beginning of her lecture slides you'll be fine but her questions are super broad and on the test they are very very specific.",0
"Prof. Barkley is great!  His lectures are long but the powerpoints cover EXACTLY what is on the test.  Labs are super easy. Uses models to learn all parts of the body. (I took pics on my phone to help study at home).  If  you are not getting the material and ask,he will do a group study session  to help but you MUST participate! EASY A if  youTRY!!",1
"If you want to have a challenge public speaking class, take her. She is not an easy A and if you mess up on your speech, she will not let you restart. Also, she is really picky on how you should perform your speech and she is an unorganized teacher .",0
"I hated this class. She talks about nothing! She is more interested in elephants and cheetahs then she is about anything else. She rambles and goes off topic so much its really hard to stay on track. She also likes to say, ""well we'll cover that in a later chapter."" instead of staying in the chapter we're on. Be prepared to study hard!",0
"He does make a 7:30 class easier, but lectures are still tedious. He hates whenever no one knows the translation, but he does not randomly call on people a lot. Tests are not difficult. He is wiling to help. He also takes attendance on a piece of paper so don't skip; he doesn't tell you that.",1
"Dr. Pentek was one of the toughest graders I've had, but he also was one of the only professors I've truly left the class grasping the concepts he taught. Make no mistake--you better take this class knowing you will work your butt off! Don't take physio if you don't have good study habits. Record lectures!! He really is a good professor.",1
"Professor Lulejian interacts with the class and is very helpful. There were a couple of things I didn't like about the class: First, the tests seemed like they are setup to confuse you. Second, you aren't able to see what you got wrong on the tests, so you can't fix your errors for the exams. Other than that, it was a good class.",1
oral presentations homework every week attendance is mandatory if you skip a class takes points off,0
"she does respond to your questions within a few hours, but beware she is pretty tough grader. There is sometimes a lot of work but its an online so just be ready and give yourself sometime.  Some of her work isnt complete which is very annoying. seems like she rushes and doesnt take her time.",1
"I have really struggled with math all my life. His course is very good to where I can easily understand what is going on before I leave class. He give homework and quizzes BUT not something that will take you 5 hours to do, he gives just enough to where I understand the material and I am not overwhelmed with work.  Uses study guides for tests.",1
super sweet and very easy-going. prepares you very well for the exams and tells you what will be on them. understands college students very well.,1
He one of the best teachers ever. You can listen to him clearly. Take notes. Mr. Furno is the reason I take notes to this day.,1
"Find someone else to take. He is not helpful at all. DO NOT buy the book you'll never use it, unless you read it. But thats what Khan Academy is for. So save yourself the money and buy the ebook",0
"took online class - Timed Tests and discussions w/only two days to take and answer.Tests are 60 qt's and you are given a minute for each on over 4 - 5 chapters.  If you question him, he will call you out(Chastise more like) in class and threaten to kick you out. SO NOT HOT! Unprofessional is more like it. Papers are easy but outline is very long.",0
"Seems really uptight but actually a super easygoing guy, lots of freedom in essay topic choices and a lot of the info overlaps with 207. Super long lectures so be prepared to take notes! Truly loves art history and sharing it with people, he also has an amazing fashion sense. Definitely recommend him!",1
This is my first semester with this Professor and thus far she hasn't given any effective feedback. I find that it's instead very critical with no ways of actually helping. Her homework assignments are high and the descriptions of what to do are incredibly low. I wouldn't recommend taking her class if you didn't have to.,0
Interesting class. A rational approach to religion. Not all are committed to reason. Be prepared to read and discuss the material.,1
"Dale is an awesome person and a wonderful interpreter. He knows his stuff, but his classes are terribly structured. He spends most of class completely off topic. Also, when finals week came around he had only gotten around to grading one of the assignments from the entire semester. Very frustrating to have him in charge of your grades.",0
"I think Prof. Darman is decent enough. However, my main concern is that he lectures on tangents FOREVER. Honestly, if you are taking SOC 110 with him, the book is more of a learning tool than he is just because it's a test to focus on his every word. Other than that, surprisingly interesting at times and the writing assignments and tests are fair.",1
If your don't show your work exactly like he likes he will not give you any credit. Do not ask questions in class unless you like getting belittled in front of the class. It was a struggle for everyone in my class throughout the course and the only reason most people passed is because he curved the course at the end.,0
wow honestly I thought this professor was the most passionate professor who enjoys what he does! He is SO GOOD with explaining! He loves answering questions! I was so terrified of  this class but he made it so easy. There was not a single time that I was bored in this class. I RECCOMEND!,1
"Always comes in late, always has an excuse",0
"He is entertaining. Went over a concept repeatedly in lectures so easy to remember but made it long.  He is a good spirited guy who will go out of his way to help you. Definitely taught me that being social is essential to business. I don't like group projects but if you want to get into business, it's best to get out of that comfort zone.",1
"Not helpful at all! Avoid this professor at all costs. When you ask her a question, she turns it around on you and then talks in circles and never really answers it. She's very rude and acts like she's better than everyone. She was not helpful with the research paper and offered hardly any feedback. The in class assignments were also useless.",0
"He tends to suck at times, but not always",0
"Terrible organization of the class. You have homework due online for chapters you won't cover until another 4 weeks in class and the tests are ridiculously hard. This class seems like it's designed to stroke the professors ego, given the material is fairly easy he just makes it ridiculously hard so he feels important.",0
"She is a very nice professor and easy to reach by email. I took this class online w/zoom due to COVID, wrote 2-3 papers including the final paper and decent amount of in class assignments and homework. Textbook is mandatory but rarely used. She also takes forever to grade things and takes 30 mins explaining assignments when it could be in 5 mins.",1
"He tries to be innovative in his teaching style, but it's a bad method. He thinks he's the smartest man on Earth and claims to care for his students, but I tried to reach out to him and he never emailed me back. Picks a few favorites and gives them the highest grades and attention most of the time. Unreasonable grading, idk if anyone will get an A.",0
"Professor Doughty is nice and really understanding and will let you make up any assignment. He lectures every class and its really boring. But just take good notes and youll be fine. He gives a study guide before each test and theres only 3-4 tests. Hes a good, easy choice.",1
"I will never take a class by this professor again, nor anyone associated with him. He entered grades once two weeks in and hasn't since, you have to guess your current grade. If you're sick and in the hospital doesn't matter, you have to turn in his weekly essay (approx 5 pages minimum) does the absolute bare minimum, he shouldn't be a teacher.",0
Ransom didn't meet the students half-way. He grades very harsh at first but loosens up a bit later. I didn't like the class because I felt like my privacy was invaded especially when we had to write 1-2 page journals every Friday.  I would not recommend Ransom!,1
"One of the absolute hardest, yet  absolute best classes I have ever taken at SF State. Dr. Guerra means business and this class will be your first real job in the broadcast industry. If you take your role and this class seriously, you'll end up with great experience to put on a resume and great work for your portfolio.",1
Good professor. Straightforward. Interesting topics. Gives good study guides. You have to go to class to get notes that aren't in the book. The book was helpful to combine info for study guides.,1
"Dennis was probably the only teacher that gave us knowledge of the actual business of art. Not only does he know a lot about the profession of illustration, he brings humor to the classroom and puts you at ease. He rocked!!!",1
"Dr. Weil is a great professor and assignments are very easy. With the exception of mid term and finals, its only a discussion post each week and module 3 and 6 there is a case study. Great professor and very caring!!! Responds to any questions within 24 hours and very helpful! TAKE HIM!!! EASY A!! ",1
"I don't understand how Prof Marks is receiving good ratings. He is the most intimidating, condescending teacher ever. I had planned on getting my Spanish minor before this, but this class completely turned me around 180 degrees. He looks at the ceiling when he talks, doesn't answer questions, and extensive homework is due daily. Just dreadful.",0
Be careful the rubric posted may not be the one she is using. Sometimes it felt like I was being graded and marked down because I didn't know what was in her head.,0
"Professor Cho talks very fast during her lectures, and if you miss one you will be lost. There are 3 exams and they're worth about 70% of your final grade. Her lectures are long and difficult to understand. I don't recommend this class to anyone.",0
"She is a lovely professor. She can be easily disappointed, so be appreciative and don't disappoint her; her standards are high, but reasonably high. Ask questions AFTER reading the material. If I had to give positive criticism about her it might be she could cover the basics of each chapter better. BUT THAT'S WHAT OFFICE HOURS/APPOINTMENTS ARE FOR.",1
"Definitely enjoyed the content of the class but she was not a good professor. She does know what she is talking about but a lot of the times, it seems as though she is talking to herself. VERY disorganized!!! She is all over the place and is not clear on what she wants on assignments. Very contradictive. Also takes a while to give grades back. ",0
"Mr. Jensen can seem a little kooky at first, but just take time to get to know him and you will learn to love him. He definitely makes you question things and get you out of your comfort zone so be prepared for that. He is very much about attendance and punctuality so be on time. Other than that he's a pretty laid back, funny guy. ",1
Branch is literally the best teacher I have ever had. He is so invested in the class and truly cares for his students. If you have any questions just email him and he'll respond within minutes with a very detailed response. The course is so much fun and the documentaries are so interesting and breakup the monotony of homework. Take this class!!!,1
"I agree that Dr. Childs does NOT know logic. If you have her for a logic course, I advise you switch, she makes it more difficult than necessary.",0
"Took it online, the most work I (and the rest of the class) have ever done. Weekly, about 150 pages to read and an average 7 pages SINGLE-SPACED responses, on top of 4 projects. HORRIBLE grader. Completely not worth your time, effort, or GPA. DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!",0
Workload is absurd. Was seemingly shocked that COVID19 affected students' abilities to complete assignments. Waited until April 12 to make course adjustments. Expects students to prioritize her class above all else but hasn't graded papers from week 3. Remember that English teacher in high school you couldn't stand? She's back and better than ever,0
Needs to retire,0
"This was an independent study physics simulation. I hope this doesn't look like a bad rating, cause Duba is awesome. It's just that he was the guy signing off on the project, no real teaching or direction required on his part. I'm really thankful he let me do my own thing.",1
"Prof Venema was amazing. He's the first TWC teacher to give me useful, detailed feedback instead of just throwing A's at me for half-baked work. There's a lot of group work in this class so choose your teammates wisely. This class is challenging, but worth taking if you truly want to improve as a writer. I can't say enough good things!",1
"This professor was by far the worst of my entire academic career. Lectures are irrelevant. If you are unfortunate and are taking this class, she posts all of her power points on Beach Board and attendance isn't mandatory. Take this time to read the book because this is what you will be tested on. Great personality. Terrible instructor.",0
"He definitely wants you to pass the class. He explains during the class the homework and prepares you well for the quizzes. If you do the discussions, assignments, and quizzes you will pass. He is always willing to help you if you have questions.",1
"The class is called avoding sexual harassment.  I think there are way too much reading considering it is only a one credit class.  Plus there is a final exam which I think is unnecessary.  If you need a one credit class, take something easier.",0
"Prof Laucella is the sweetest person I've ever met! She's so caring and wants you to do well. If you show up, you will most likely get an A if you do the assignments. So glad I got her for this class my first semester of college & I highly recommend her.",1
Guy does not teach at all. Simply assigns homework problems and gives out pop quizzes almost every class that are based on the homework problems.  Tests are extremely difficult and without reading the textbook and teaching yourself the entire course you will fail. Do not take if you want a good gpa. Attendance only necessary bc of the quizzes.,0
"Prof Humphrey is an excellent instructor! He is such an easy going person. His lectures can be long, but always interesting. I would def recommend.",1
"Dr. Anderson was the best professor or teacher I've ever had. He made 7:30am doable, and helped me relearn Latin after a rough semester. He does take attendance, so don't skip. The tests were easy and he gives many quizzes to help your grade. I would take him every semester if I could.",1
"302 is a hard class only if you haven't done circuits in your life. Practice a lot of problems, go to tutoring and you will be fine. Tutuc is a good professor. He takes the time to clear everyone's doubts. Would definitely recommend him",1
"If you have an option to take someone else for this course, I would strongly encourage you to. This class is generally hard and tense but she can and will make it harder. I think that she does not believe in giving full credit. Exams are difficult but not impossible. She does not care if you are sick or when it comes to deadlines.",0
Prof. Valvo is one of the nicest ladies every! it was her first year teaching so she didnt really know what she was doing. But she made Freshman sem. the easiest class. Attendance is mandatory but pretty much everyclass only last 15 mins. You only stay the whole class is there is a speaker! Really easy fun class. Take her for fresh Sem!!!!,1
"Horrible. Do not take period. One quiz had an insane hard problem. No way to study for it. Smart book takes way too much time. Double work, online and his. Doesn't grad anything. No idea where you are in the class. Doesn't explain the lab. Lecture heavy, but you are still lost. Had to withdrawal. Will take with Tang, he was much better for Chem 2.",0
"Mike is so nice and he really cares about his students! For the remote course, there are 4 mini projects and then a final group project that you work on throughout the quarter. Other than that, there are weekly reading quizzes! He is very accommodating in terms of due dates and even allows you to resubmit! An attainable 4.0 if you put in the work.",1
This class is very difficult.The work never ends. We never get out of class early.Think twice about taking this.,0
her grading system makes no sense and I have never had more panic attacks than I did this semester when taking her. do not take her. worst prof at westconn.,0
Best professor I've taken thus far. He is really motivated to teach and keeps things interesting in class. I would highly recommend taking Ams for O-chem.,1
"If you don't understand accounting DO NOT TAKE HIM. You will FAIL. He thinks we should all be accounting majors and when you don't understand it he doesn't help. 4 Quizzes, lowest dropped, and a project. Quizzes  impossible.",0
DJB is an absolute queen. She cares about her students and is flexible with scheduling. Any class with her is a good time,1
"So I took sherry's 221 class fall 2019; I have to be honest she, her teaching methods are stuck in the past. the only reason i did well was because of group study sessions with R Gottfried, they will save your life. also the wiley HW is graded for accuracy. i would have gotten an A if it was for completion. they are very hard be prepared good luck!",0
"Took this class last semester and hated it. I've always been good at Chemistry but prof ams makes very simple concepts hard to understand, and hard concepts impossible to understand by underexplaining. His labs are the same way. Hes really smart but cant teach. DO NOT TAKE ANY OF HIS CLASSES",0
"Few but important assignments. He goes over the homework in class very often, and would also often give away parts of the solution to the said homework. From the hints, one can often use it as a template and easily complete other parts of the homework. The final three assignments build on top of each other, would give excellent feedback if asked.",1
"I really have nothing nice to say about him. Its his way or no way. he is rude, cares nothing about his students, and really doesnt listen",0
"Unclear criteria in exams. Teaches his own developed tool that doesn't work half of the time and expects you to peform like you are a 10 years experienced developer. Just like any other professor, he is just sweet on the top but will not give you any marks. SKIP SKIP SKIP.",0
"Kubota is great. She expects that you do the work and come to class prepared, but that's a good thing. Her classes are hard, but so is learning to speak Japanese; if you want an easy class, take Spanish instead. I had her for 4 years and think she's great.",1
"Professor Gilmore was very clear and his lectures were extremely easy to comprehend. Took sociological theory over the summer, and there was only one class that i was completely bored in. Definitely recommend him! Very helpful and very nice.",1
Took this class online. Each week we had to read a chapter and answer a discussion board. Provided reviews for midterm and final exam. Had to write a paper as a project and it was based on the reading. Professor is quick to respond and gives helpful answers to your questions.,1
"Walker is amazing! He's a wise, knowledgeable old man. He has a story for just about everything you can think of. He's been there, done that. His way of teaching throughout the summer term was by YouTube videos. There was a speech every week, but were very doable in terms of length and criteria, you also learn a lot about your peers. Take Walker!",1
Exams are very difficult. Very hard grader. Not very understanding.,0
"Do not take him if you don't have to. As someone who doesn't enjoy math, I found going to other professors and math tutoring way more helpful than his style of teaching. When I went in to his open office hours for help he told me to read my notes again, even though I told him I already did. Not helpful at all! Only exam grades, no homework.",0
"This teacher is awesome. He's not boring. Tests are super easy, you read stories and take 5pt quizzes on them. Most importantly no essays. Got an A in this class and enjoyed every minute of it. Take him if you want to keep your GPA high and still learn something. Wish more teachers like him cared about what they were teaching.",1
He wasnt helpful at all. He teaches too fast and doesnt explain well and gets an attitude when you ask questions or dont know about the lesson. He drops you out of class with no notice if your grade is low. He doesnt tell you that your grade is low. He is just a person who isnt understanding at all and doesnt consider anything.,0
"Overall she is an alright teacher, my biggest problem with her is she will only give you credit for the factor label method. The way connect teaches makes much more sense to me but my grade struggles because I have to do it the factor label method, because that's what helped her in school. Other then that she is nit picky about grading.",1
"Literally made an account on RMP to say that Barry Thompson is the best professor I've ever had. Would recommend to anyone taking Ochem B - he's seriously the most caring, respectful, and ""on top of it"" person.",1
she makes differential equations harder than it needs to be. her grading is very strict with not a ton of partial credit. the tests are very difficult to finish in the 50 minutes she gives. when you ask her questions that arent in her notes she gets confused so it seems she doesnt fully understand the material,0
"Syllabus was unclear. When you asked questions for clarifications on assignments or just in class, she was extremely disrespectful. She looked at you like you were stupid. When I asked for feedback, she barely gave any and said you were doing fine, then you would get a bad grade on assignments. Overall, she is disrespectful. Do not take her class!",0
"She is a good teacher, but the course was bad.  Definitely take classes with her, just not German Humor.",1
"Don't even think about taking him for Differential Equations. The first day when he said this is the first time teaching this class in 20 years I should have dropped it. Not prepaired, completely oblivious his surroundings, doesn't know what he is doing half the time, and just a bad teacher in general. Don't make the same mistake I did...",0
She is the hardest grader I have ever encountered in my life. Based on this alone I would avoid her.,0
"I hate the lab from his TA, seems like they are going to fail all students",0
She is an awesome professor. She is very caring. I took several COAT Classes with her. She assigns a decent amount of homework. Most of the tests were hands on projects typing.,1
"She seemed cheerful and exciting the first day, then quickly became more arrogant. Especially if you didn't know exactly how she wanted problems worked, which she didn't explain at all. I'm a straight A student majoring in math, and i got a C in her course because she refused to help and only got smart when i asked her something. Avoid at all costs",0
"Great professor. Loves the subject. He is very helpful and you can tell he wants everyone to be able to pass. If you don't study for the tests you will not pass this class. It's not one you sleep through for an A. He takes attendance twice. Overall, great class. I would take him again.",1
"Easy online class for comp but very anti government, white people rule the world, everyone is racist, grades hard on the papers but all around easy work. One paper due each week and many discussions but they're simple.",0
"Do not take this professor if you really want to learn. Class was very chaotic, unorganized, waste of time. It is difficult to learn because the class was all over the place, but he does want people to pass.",1
"asked for help on 2 separate occasions in LL; both times she was excessively rude and clearly annoyed when i dared interrupt whatever she's (always) listening to with her headphones. no idea how she is still employed at ACC, let alone teaching. sour attitude with a superiority complex.",0
"Great teacher!! Super fun class! Notes were clear and understandable. Great at explaining concepts. Remember languages take work from the student side as well, do your part and it's easy.",1
Great teacher who really teaches on a basic level. Speaks to the class in a way they would understand. There is homework and a project but is not hard at all. If you have questions or need help he is there for you. He tells the class frequently about if it anyone is having trouble to see him. Really cares,1
I am TERRIBLE at math and Bella made sure I did not fall behind and that I passed. She is definitely one of the best teachers out there.,1
"Dr. Jacobson is the most energetic professor I've ever had, and that makes the class super interesting. Now I want to take every sociology class that there is, but only if Dr. Jacobson is teaching it.",1
"Really boring. The class is not that difficult, but she has like a million slides and makes you stay almost the entire time. Her accent is a little thick, and she's not that friendly. Overall, she's okay. We didn't use the textbook a lot, and she made us write both a paper and have a presentation.",0
"I took 4 years of spanish in high school, and his class is extremely easy. sometimes it is difficult to understand his accent, but he is very helpful with the material. prepares you for the exams very well(98% on midterm), grades more easily on tests the more you participate in class.",1
Amazing professor. Class is pretty interesting if you like psychology. He really tries to help. He has study guides and does reviews. Just make sure you show up and read over your notes the night before an exam and you'll do fine. Loved this class.,1
"Hard grader, but I've really improved in my writing. Go to the production meeting with a rough draft because she helps you so much in editing your paper to tell you what she wants too see for a decent grade. No tests and she posts the readings. Blog project at the end with 3 stories and a few quizzes & EC make your grade. Not a bad class",1
"He is an amazing professor. He is tough, but if you put in the effort and he sees that you are actually trying, he will go above and beyond to help you. Hes a really nice person and truly wants his students to understand what he is teaching. I highly recommend taking his class.",1
"Amazing. You NEED to take her, she's one of those few professors that truelly love what they do and want the best for their students. Don't procrastinate on the work, she gives you more than enough time to complete projects. It was a 7:30am class but she made it a pleasure to come to class. Take her class so you'll know just how great she is!",1
Do not take this class. You are paying to teach yourself. The professor does not teach and his LA's teach the course instead. Each LA will give you a different answer and you will end up confused and unsure. I regret having taken this course. The class is also extremely slow and not even the professor can give you a decent answer when you ask.,0
"Dr. Jones  was one of the best professors I had. She truly cares about her students, and wants you to succeed. But, she isn't an easy teacher. She really makes you work for the grades you receive. But, she lets you redo any assignments you want to. She's a very straightforward person. If you show up to class and do your work, you'll do great.",1
"A great professor! Really enjoys and knows what he teaches. Always willing to make sure his students grasp the material. Very tough but extremely fair test/papers. You must do the reading, go to class, and ask questions to do well. And you'll want to! Take at least one class with him for sure! One of the best profs I've ever had!",1
VERY VERY work heavy. I would recommend the class to start a group chat because the class gets confusing. VERY LECTURE heavy. He can talk the whole hour and a half. He grades the paper essays easy but just be prepared for lots of work. Hes a very cool guy and cares for his students. Just participate and talk or else he will get angry,1
"This professor does not give you a clear understanding of the assignments and she does not take the time to answer students questions, she is just worried about getting though the slides. You will end up figuring out each assignment on your own.",0
"Really boring and too talkative about himself. Bored me to death, pretty easy grader, just uninspiring. Learnt way too much about his personal life.",1
"You would expect a professor who teaches an online class to respond to her emails... Well at least that's what I expected. The course is designed poorly, but the exams aren't too hard. The labs didn't really make sense and were unorganized. Blackboard is copied and pasted from past years and there are a lot of spelling mistakes. Do not TAKE!!!!!!!!",0
Teaches very very fast... Skips simple steps assuming you already know so its easy to get lost.. look for another teacher!!!,0
"Erika is energetic, accessible, intelligent, and well spoken. She knows her materials and is the best at conveying it. She makes class more fun than any class I've ever had while still getting the materials through to you. She also creates a very, very friendly classroom environment making it very comfortable to present. Take her!!",1
Prof was okay. She's never at her office hrs though. Class was interesting but the TA who does the grading is an ass (will kaufman).  Who counts #of incorrect comma usages and deducts it from your grade?  It's not even an english class!  Isn't content more important than a few grammatical errors?,0
"You will enjoy taking her class. Her lectures are easy to understand and useful for your future career, working with children. As long as you attend to her class and take notes you'll be able to pass this class with A. The midterm and final was not hard at all.",1
"Subject matter is interesting, but unless you are an art major I would not recomend taking this class. I studied 5 days for our second exam and still ended up getting a low grade because he thought I wasn't ""specific enough"" even though I essentially described everything about the paintings in question.  Harsh grader + harsh subject  Not good.",0
"Amazing professor, he is very cut and straight to the point about what you need to learn. Very happy that I decided to take this course.",1
"Shine is a experienced and kind professor. I took two courses with him. Classical Literature which was an easy A, and Literary Analysis. Literary Analysis was a bit more difficult. His lectures can sometimes drag but he brings some humor and immense knowledge. He lets you re-do papers and exams until you are satisfied. He can be vague but he helps.",1
"This was a capstone class online. No test given as majority of your grade is based from the business simulation program. You will work in groups/teams for the simulation and had members that did absolutely nothing, and he will not hold them accountable for getting a free grade from the rest of the group participating which was extremely frustrating",0
"Fast talking, hard to keep up with, and gets off track a lot. I had his 3 hour class and I could not take sitting there listening to him speak! It was so boring and most of the time he did not let us out for a break. His tests are hard. You have to write two essays and he does not grade them generously. He knows what he's talking about, though.",0
Professor Quinlan is incredible. You can tell he really cares about how his students are going and he does his best to help you succeed. I had my first class with him during the semester that we first got a stay at home order for Covid and he made the transition to online so easy for us. I'm in his class again now.,1
"Hes an okay teacher. He picks on people in class alot. I am his main traget in class this semester. Hes a hard teacher, some of his assignments are difficult. The papers we write seem to be graded as if we are in the writing profession.",0
"She is so nice, but has NO common sense and will not answer questions in class.. that is for ""office hours"". She knows numbers, but her test are hard and she teaches the long and very very confusing ways of math. Definitely take another teacher!",0
"Terrible teacher! He made everyone in the class hate math. Worse teacher ever, if you have the chance to choose do NOT take him. He thinks he is funny, and his jokes suck.",0
"She does not explain text clearly so it is understandable. Doesn't finish explinations, examples, or sentances.  Luckily she doesn't grade too hard but be prepared to read the book and teach yourself.",0
"She is one of the best teachers. I wish more teachers were like her. She's nice, caring, very respectful and shows that she cares about everyone in the class. She explains the material perfectly and she is very understanding and reasonable. I would have her as a teacher again. She's the best and I enjoyed the class. Thanks Ms. Cambic. BEST TEACHER",1
"His class was easy and had a routine schedule. It was easy to keep track of assignments. Quizzes and discussions are due on Sunday nights, but you have all week to do them.",1
A legend in his own mind. Fun and involved. Hands on teacher.,1
"Professor Lunn, I really enjoy your Group exercises. Your preparation for the class is outstanding, and it shows in your lectures. You inspire me to want to be a professor one day, just by being in your class. I will be spreading the word to everyone I know, to take your class. They won't be disappointed. I definitely am not!",1
Dont take him for Pre Calculus! Stressful. He talks very fast and when you ask him to go over he will get an attitude. He doesnt allow formula sheets AT ALL. YOU ONLY HAVE 4 grades and thatss his tests. YOU ONLY USE YOUR PAST PAPERS AS STUDY GUIDES FOR THE FINAL EXAM. He gives out homework and practice problems but doesnt count them as a grade.,0
Dr. Maher is an phenomenal professor and scholar. He really cares about the material which makes the class interesting. He also really cares about his students; if you make the time to talk with him and put effort into the class he will respect you and give you as much help as you need. THE BEST professor I have EVER had. 10/10 would recommend!,1
Funny n nice person but never there. When we do have class its more like hanging out and not teaching much. Didnt learn any economics.,0
Nobody I knew got above 60% on their tests and we all went to every class and studied before each exam.,0
"Dont take this class. She expects too much. She wants you to do every week reflective journals and written assignments which are about 5-6 paragraphs long. Also we write in class for a grade. Attendance mandatory have to be on time, and 3 times you miss class she will drop you. Too much stress.",1
"She was awesome. You can tell that she truly cares about what she's teaching and wants her students to show interest and pass the class. She responds to emails quickly and is very accessible before or after class as well. She is an encouraging teacher, and if your do the work, the class  is easy. I would definitely recommend taking her class.",1
He gives us a 20 minutes presentation to do and 8 page research paper when the class is just elective. He should have given us a option to choose between presentation or writing the paper. Not do both. 12 people drop out of his class because of it.,0
"She doesn't know what she's teaching, and as a result, grades harshly (notthe same as in the book, not right). The projects didn't connect with the course material. Each project consisted of 4 parts that could be a project to themselves.",0
"I took her for my first year of college. She was honestly the best teacher I had. If you do good in her class, she can skip you into college level English. She gives you good feedback on essays and assignments. She is a very caring person and helps everyone. Overall, she didnt leave  too much hw. I definitely recommend taking her.",1
She never posts her slides online until after the mid term so you need to be in class to take notes. There a periodical assignments she gives you but I haven't gotten any of them back yet I am unsure if I'm doing them right. I've tried emailing her for guidance countless times but she doesn't answer emails. Frustrating prof. Try another for SOC111,0
Expects extra assignment but does not make clear what the expectations for said assignment are.  Punishes student when his expectations are not met even though they weren't communicated properly,0
He is incredibly disorganized. He shows up to class late 3-4 times a semester. He doesn't communicate with the people teaching recitations whatsoever. The exams are graded differently depending upon what section you're in ( F in one section  B in another section). At the end of the year no one respected him and he completely deserved it.,0
Very good professor. You can learn a lot and get a decent grade if you put in your work. but 1191 is a heavy course no matter who is the professor.,1
"Great teacher, kept the lectures interesting and had a clear passion for the subject. Only annoying thing is he had us buy a textbook that doesn't have a binding, meant to be put into a binder. Literally never used it, everything was on Mastering Geology (online). Can't be sold back.",1
"Dr. Moore is amazing.  He's very knowledgeable, engaging, and charming.  The class is pretty straight forward, he even gives you outlines for each class.  If you come to class, pay attention, and follow the outlines, you'll do fine.  Just don't be lazy.  Definitely my favorite professor at Eastern.",1
"Great teacher. Easy going and extremely approachable. Accounting is a boring topic, so do not expect flamethrowers and circus freaks to make the class more enjoyable. However, she makes the class interesting by inspiring us with her personal experiences (she is an accountant and business owner). Learned a lot from her.",1
Dr. Schreiber was very helpful if you asked. Reading in her classes are a must but they are usually interesting readings. She is a stickler for grammar so make sure you proofread ALL assignments. The class is interesting as long as you are interested in the subject. She is also very involved in writing herself so she is helpful when finding sources,1
"He lacks of the background in R and tableau, which made students confused about the class. and the grading criteria is very vague, but he is a ok grader. I got a B+ at the end, and paid ok effort into it. I won't recommend his class but sometimes there is no other choice since there are only a few instructors at MIS department.",0
"The best Prof at U of M-Dearborn, hands down. I took just about every class that was offered with him as the prof. Some classes were easy and some required a ton of research and writing, but you picked your own topic to research so it was interesting, not hard. For his enviro anthro class I turned in a roughly 60 page term paper. TAKE HIM!",1
"Dr. Kennedy is an ok prof.  He is often not clear with expectations on exams and gets angry if you leave class for your next one in ten minutes when he is not finished, even if class has technically ended 4 minutes ago. Sometimes can come off a bit sarcastic as well. Lab is good with him though.",0
"Not an easy A, but he's passionate about finance. Very approachable and willing to help any way he can. Pay attention in class. Put in the time and study for each exam and you can get a good grade. Failing one exam means failing the class so don't take exams lightly. 2 Midterms (25% ea), 1 project (10%), Quizzes (10%) and 1 final (30% of grade).",1
"This is not an easy class.  Having schellhorn as a teacher makes it even worse.  She is hard to understand, boring, and would rather go to prison than ever curve a test or your grade.",0
I don't appreciate the vague teaching style and often contradictory remarks made during critiques. This is time for an artist to learn about their work based off of objective observation. That's what this class needs more of: discussion of objective techniques and critiques with constructive criticism. Frequent rants against laziness and technology,0
"Dr. Wisner is cool so I took him twice. Very direct and responds to all emails. However, he often takes his time when it comes to grading assignments. ",1
"Very good teaching,I decide to take his MTH 208 too. Helpful and know how to teach MTH. You will study a lot if your attendence is ...",1
The professor is good at in explaining concepts but what was taught turned out to be not so helpful for graduate students.,0
"In adjusting to the online format, Prof Wiebe has continued to go with 1h 20 min lectures, which he uses to go off on side tangents frequently. Be prepared to work hard in his class, as most phil 140 classes I've heard to be among the easier side of classes, but unfortunately not this one.",0
"I absolutely loved Margarita's classes. I had no prior experience or knowledge of Spanish before taking her class. I definitely struggled with how fast paced it was, but that is how a lot of college classes are. She cares a lot about her students success and is just as happy as you are when you FINALLY get something you've been struggling with.",1
I had her for so many years-- I wish that I still did.,1
TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!!!! EASIEST A EVER professor Nelson is an amazing professor she teaches so well and its so fun and engaging and she makes the class interesting,1
She should not be a professor.  She is very confusing and nervous when teaching.  She jumps from topic to topic and literally makes the material confusing and does not even understand it herself.  If you want to learn chem do not take her.  Has no idea what she is doing and you will only learn from reading the book. she is nice but not a good prof.,0
Makes many mistakes and doesn't take questions. Would not recommend if not STRONGLY proficient already in math 122. Be prepared to be given hours of homework each night.,0
Jones has the potential to be a good teacher but lacks the passion for teaching  She expects people to learn quick and if u don't she shames you she is always just trying to beat the clock and jam as much information in each lecture as possible which I feel is not beneficial to the students quizzes every week and exams every 3 which are cumulative.,0
"Survey of British Literature 2 Interesting, especially for a survey type course. Gave us good sweep of the 19th and 20th centuries--starting with William Blake and the Romantics Poets--Waxler's favorites, I think. Rigorous reading and good discussions. Three essays and a lot of quizzes. Could also memorize poems for extra credit--cool!",1
took the online class. Lectures were LONG. I studied lectures thoroughly at first but didnt find the first study guide which killed me on the first test. then i stopped watching his lectures and just studied the final study guide and aced the final. could have gotten a B but didnt know there were listening assignments. Dropped me down two grades.,0
"One of the most helpful and practical classes I have ever taken.  Kate Manski is a real pro.  Truly a lady and a scholar.  The class requires a lot of work but her feedback and comments are very helpful.  The lack of pretense, combined with her professional and well-informed instruction really make this class a worthwhile investment of your time.",1
"He's a laid back guy with a lot of experience, which he is always willing to share. Don't be fooled though, the exams can be tough. Got a 99 on the first one, a 40 on the second. A reasonable class over all  - not an easy A, but it won't kill you either. He was very empathic about my second test grade and really encouraged me to work harder.",1
"Jeff Allen is probably the best professor you can get for IRT. He likes to teach, even though it's a dry class, and he will do what he can to help you; always. He's lenient with when things have to be handed in which is nice since you have to take IRT at the same time as BUS101 which consumes ALL of your free time. Take him, he'll be there for you!",1
"just close your eyes God knows. what a nightmare, lord have mercy on her future students and may she be forgiven for wasting students' time.",0
Avoid!!! I wish someone would've told me about her earlier. Slick throws the shade if you don't understand something.,0
Very easy teacher. Dont buy the book because she doesn't use it. She gives out material that can be offensive but your mind becomes open by the end of the semester. She lets you write about what you want instead of giving you a structured writing assignment. SHe made writing papers easy.,1
"I thought that this was a good class. Helps if you have some interest in child development. No extra assignments or papers, just three exams. Fantastic if you don't want to have to do much work throughout the semester, bad if you don't take tests well. Essays count for a lot on the test so if you can write clearly, you'll probably do well.",1
"Would not recommend taking this class summer quarter with him. Study by reading his notes. He covers what's needed during lectures but spends time talking about topics ""we don't need to know."" He talks a lot about A&P and what you need to know for that. Brings up politics a lot. The lab portion is very fun! Very kind man, not rude at all.",1
"She is very manipulative and plays the good intention card very well, but when it comes down to it, she is mainly concerned with getting people in honors college to meet her quota.  She puts her own personal goals before those of her students.  She also has the tendency to go to students professors with issues instead of the students themselves.",0
"Virtual class: follow her videos, slides, and ALEKS (most important). In-person class: go over her videos, slides, and worksheets. She doesn't teach well but attendance is necessary for iClicker. The textbook should be read for anyone pursuing Chemistry. She had a hard time adjusting to virtual learning hence the drop from a 4 to 2 in rating.",1
"The few zoom meetings we had were pointless. Passive aggressive. Sent negative, condescending emails out regularly. Lectures pointless, do not correlate to exams. Be prepared to teach yourself, will not go over any examples. Read the textbook and study the homework a lot. Does not stick to syllabus.",0
"This professor made things way too easy. His class wasn't challenging in the least. We hardly did labs and were dismissed early most of the time. Lectures were alright; he's good at simplifying complicated subjects. However, I didn't even spend one second studying for this class and I got an A. That's how easy it was!",0
"He's going to try to scare you like he's this tough professor in this not so easy to pass course but its all a front. He wants you to pass and as long as you put some sort of effort into the class and ask him questions from time to time, he WILL pass you. Talks about himself a lot but he's very caring and intelligent. You'll learn a lot.",1
"I took Chemistry Lab with Dr. Devoney and she made lab so much fun. She gives clear lectures and instructions, as well as hands on help. It is obvious that she is passionate about what she is teaching, and is very knowledgable. She was my favorite lab professor so far! I would definitely recommend her.",1
"Ted Phelps is a wonderful teacher. I took him for Art Appreciation Fall 2016. I never opened my book. If you take notes on what he says you will do just fine. After a section of power points you will test on them, which is about 20 questions. Super easy if you are there to hear his lectures. Professor Phelps is also a nice and funny guy.",1
"She really is a sweet lady, but not the best teacher. Honestly could not learn one thing during class. Frequently went to her office hours which was SOMETIMES helpful but still did so poorly on exams and will probably fail the final. She scales the course and wants her students to do well, but doesn't go about it the right way.",0
"This was Dr. Nelson's first year teaching this class. Although he has taught astronomy for several years at Drake & is an amazing teacher, this was most definitely the hardest class I have taken. Teaching styles did not match up to advantage students and made many mistakes that confused the class. He is super accommodating and cares about students",0
"This professor is one of the chillest, and really coolest to have, yeah of course there's work but I believe she's one of the best to have. you wont' need to even worry much if you listen to what she has to say. her work is  easy as long as you do them, and its only a challenge if you make it one. she's worth having, oh and her final is open ended.",1
The most enthusiastic professor I've ever have; and he really knows his subject.,1
"Really didnt communicate much since I took the class online. Her test are difficult being that she wont allow you to go back to a question once you open it and she oly gives you one chance to take her test, and she does'nt give a curve.",0
"Very passionate, but is NOT meant to teach online. Tests are IMPOSSIBLE, filled with arbitrary questions and poorly worded. Opens himself up to class criticism but does not take it well. Content was not difficult, but the format of his class made it hard to learn. Blackboard is poorly organized. Great guy, very knowledgable, just not a good teacher",0
If you do all the discussion posts and actually try you will do just fine in this class literally. Lisa is great and makes everything really clear with grades and deadlines. She keeps up with grading and posting new assignments.,1
She was a great fair professor I got received an A for the class. I would definitely take her class again. If you study and read the chapters you should do well.,1
"He is really nice, but not the best professor.  He is very unorganized and doesn't really ""teach"".  He assigns HW  then just expects you to know the material for next class.  You have no idea what to expect on his tests (he won't even tell you the form of it, ex. writing section? vocab section? multiple choice?)  Overall- nice guy, bad professor.",0
"As a person, Mark is a nice guy who genuinely wants to help. His class, though, is difficult. There are only three exams (each worth 20%) and a final exam with 6 homework assignments. So, if you don't do well on one exam - you're screwed. I heard he is much better in person but if you are taking this class through ZoomU...",1
"If you want to take this class, be ready to write seven pages for exams, which have no guidelines. This class was harder than my upper level college classes. She treats everybody that takes this class like an Art Major an expects you to know everything that an Art Major would. Also, she does not give any feedback. Worst class I have ever taken!!",0
"The most AMAZING professor I have ever had. Jenny and this class truly changed my life. She is so passionate and caring, and inspires students to want to be the same. She often gives life advice and talks about the stuff that really matters. This is by far one of my favorite classes I have ever taken at UW. The tests are extremely fair as well!",1
"i loved nadine sullivan as a teacher! She has super interesting topics about women. She plays a movie every single day and only a few of the days were boring. If you do the work, it is very easy and an easy A. She definatly taught me things I will always remember",1
"I was really disappointed after taking this class. Dr. Misruda makes this class unnecessarily difficult for no reason. There's absolutely no rubric for assignments. He talks the whole lecture time without any participation, so it's really hard to pay attention. He will cover a needed topic one or two days before an assignment is due.",0
"Instead of teaching in class she makes you watch videos at home (which is difficult when you work full time) and ""reviews"" in class. Does not give reviews for the test, online homework, quizlet is your best friend in this class.",1
Long and repetitive lectures. Also won't answer questions about final paper through writing and pushes phone conferences. Would not recommend.,0
She cares about the students and their success in this class! She is easy on the work during the Covid situation and even gave us mental health days. Helped with the public speaking nervousness. I would recommend taking her class!,1
"She doesn't teach us anything. Every weekly class session she talks about her personal life, berates us for not knowing the material she isn't teaching us, and then if we ask her to explain the topics we are supposed to be learning she says ""that isn't her teaching style"". I'm changing majors because of this professors incompetence. AVOID HER",0
I took this class in the morning and trust me it was a long class..,0
"To pass this class, you absolutely NEED the textbook. And you better be prepared to do all the exercises she assigns because she randomly collects homework. She can be pretty confusing in her directions which makes it difficult to understand what she wants a lot of the time. She's very sweet but not my favorite professor ever.",0
"She goes over anything that you don't understand in class, like she WILL take the time. She gave us 4 extra credit opportunities worth 10 points each which applies to the overall grade. Just listen to her lectures - they aren't mandatory, but are still helpful and study the lab book. Read the textbook for any needed clarification for the lec. tests",1
Go to class. Her exam was way different than what I studied. Had I gone t class I would have known. Overall her exams are tough. She doesn't curve which is unfair considering hw low the averages are.,0
"leave, leave, leave... unless you want to have the worse semester of your university career.",0
Tam is really chill. No midterms No final. Just some class quizzes. I hear she used to be really hard but she has calmed down a lot and I loved the class. It was fun.,1
Don't take any mathematical class with him he will let you hit the wall my recommendation take with anyone else but not with him .,0
AMAZINGGG!!! Take him.,1
"Very nice guy, but not a good professor. Hard to understand, little information in his lecture slides, and his tests required so much detail over a lot of information, which  made it difficult to succeed. Try to get a different professor if you can.",0
"THE worst. I took AP English in high school and passed it with flying colors as one of the top writers in my class. I get to Shamane's class and I'm told that my use of grammar is ""offensive"" and that I'm too ""flowery"" and wordy in my writing. Passed with a 4.0 overall and on the portfolio bc I am a strong writer despite her comments. AVOID HER!!!",0
"Chief Warn is one of the best Professors I've had at Plymouth so far. Do the readings and you'll be just fine. As a Police Chief for many years, he gives real life examples and has very funny stories. Sat down with me one day for 30 minutes to talk about possible careers and gave me great advice. I would definitely take his class again.",1
She is a nightmare. She is so vague and her lectures are extremely boring. She gives assignments at the last minute with very little explanation. She is very disorganized so you never know when things are due or what is expected of you. She is also very inaccessible and useless if you need help.,0
"Meh. Her lectures were very ambiguous. She made already difficult concepts very hard to understand. I do think she knows a lot about plants and fungus, but just does a horrible job explaining it to the class.",0
I was scared to take this professor at first because there had only been one good review and one bad. His class wasnt bad at all. As long as you do the review tests and memorize the functions youre golden. he also drops the lowest test score. I am definately taking again next semester!,1
"This is a difficult course as it is considering it covers a lot of material, but Maria Alonso doesn't make it any easier. She has a thick accent which is difficult to understand and her style of teaching is hard to comprehend. She uses questions from the review on the test, but she's a difficult grader since her tests are open. Don't take her!!!",0
"She's very helpful and caring but at the same time will go off tangent and spend a lot on proofs. Gives out a ton of homework that will take up a lot time. As with any class, if you put in the dedication and effort you will pass. There will be quizzes every week.",1
"Dont sign up for this class. RUN. Average exam grades are Ds. The only reason youll pass is because of the exam drop. If want to keep your 4.0, choose another class.",0
"Students discuss the subject, while she moderates. She never taught in the class, thus after paying 5K in uni fees you get opinions of ur peers & understanding from readings She is unable to keep her prejudices out of class & grading. If she dislikes you then it gets difficult Her approach is idealist & not policy based Take another professor",0
"Professor Deason is awesome! I always learn something in her lectures, and she is very knowledgeable about social psychology. Tests are easy if you do the study guide she provides and look back on her powerpoints. There are small assignments to keep you on track; not too difficult. Overall, take her. You won't regret it.",1
"I thought he was really funny at first but once we started getting into learning, there was no effort on this part. He used material from other profs (didn't even bother to change the name) and would only tell us to go home, read, and answer questions. whenever someone made a question he would say ""that was a stupid question"" and not answer. :(",0
He's a hard essay grader and he has kicked the entire class out of class because we didn't do the 100 pages of reading assigned for that day. Expects too much.,1
"She takes *forever* to grade assignments. It's incredibly frustrating.  You have to wait weeks. Also, her assignments have a lot of grammatical errors which is annoying. She made several mistakes with assignments and I would politely email her and get the credit added back. Frustrating but at least she was fair.",0
Her tone with the class is very awkward doesn't really connect well with her students. Quizzes are every class period. With the bad flood was forced to miss a class and wasn't allowed to make up work. Very poor teaching methods kinds jumps right in with out giving a strong foundation.,0
I really did not understand what was going on in class half of the time. She didn't really explain things well and when reviewing the notes I had a very hard time understanding her own power points. She's a lovely woman and she was around to help but even then it was a hard class to understand.,0
"The class content is not difficult.  The professor makes it difficult by setting her own criteria for grading that is not part of the assignment.  Elizabeth does not follow the rubric, does not answer questions, and makes up erroneous grading criteria.  She doesn't even understand the course she is teaching. Worst excuse for an instructor.",0
"Great prof, extremely smart and wants students to learn. Hard course, but interesting. Also, to the other commentator, cheating is ILLEGAL and immoral, so it would make sense a professor would be serious about it...also, your Mrs Doubtfire comment is tasteless and offensive.",1
Great teacher!!! You can def get an A! Be sure to go to every lab!!!,1
"I did not like his teaching style. He reads directly from slides, which he posts after class. His quizzes and tests are all multiple choice, and he offers extra credit. However, many of his questions are poorly worded and some confusing.",0
"He's awesome. He's very intelligent and down to earth. He has a passion for math and is great at teaching. He explains things so well and he makes sure everyone understands. He's very helpful, kind, and funny. Such a cool dude. One of the best professors I've ever had. Do the homework and bring questions to class. He gives practice exams too.",1
The. Worst. Teacher. Ever.,0
"He is a very tough grader but I can appreciate that because he actually prepared me for ""the real world"". Plus, it was a GRADUATE course, you have to work for it. I learned so much! I thought I was a great writer and I was HUMBLED real quick, thank you for that because now I AM a great writer and have progressed so much just within this course.",1
"The class isn't that bad but it'll put you to sleep. She speaks very slowly about very boring things. There are a ton of quizzes over really boring readings but she's a nice professor, if a bit long winded. ",1
"Take Harris!  He is so nice and tests are generally pretty easy--he always tells you exactly what is on them so if you don't study that is your fault.  Not an extremely easy A, you need to put some effort in but a little will go a long way.",1
"Final exam essay is worth 40%. Apparently, my fall class only had to write a 1000 word essay. Other class have to write 4-5 500 word short essays. A lot of material in 8 weeks, esp online. He personally called me to help though with the final essay. Made me feel more confident. Lined up pretty well with History 1301.",1
He's a great professor. Comes prepared to class and is passionate about what he teaches. Tough marker but if you try you'll get a good grade.,1
"Great guy.  He makes you work, but you learn a lot.",1
"I took intro to calc in high school, and good thing I did because his teaching style was so hard to understand. Gives you one to two examples depending on the topic in his lectures, but you don't even get tested on those kinds of examples? Talked like that sloth from zootopia I'd rather bang my head on the wall than listen to him.",0
Professor P is so so so good. Finance was one of the classes I was most scared of taking in undergrad but he really does an amazing job of explaining concepts and breaking them down. Gives study guides similar to exams. Extra credit. One project. Also is just plain nice and positive and encouraging. Take him if you're lucky!,1
"Students like him because he's an easy grader. His ""holier than thou"" attitude is unbearable, his humor is very dry. Funny how he thinks he understands what he is teaching when he ran for local office twice and didn't win either time lol. Take the class if you want an easy A but if you want to learn something, don't bother.",0
Chang does not teach.  His power points are unclear and do not explain the material.  Homework is no help in preparing you for the his impossible quizzes and tests.  Expect to spend a lot of time with a stat textbook if you want to pass the course.,0
"Unhelpful. Terrible teacher. Essays about politics will be ripped to shreds if you don't have the same opinion as her. Avoid this class. Only likes people that suck up. If you're willing to lose your dignity to get a decent grade, go for it. If you aren't willing to suck up, avoid this class. Not worth it. Maybe you'll get a C on your merit. Maybe.",0
"He is rather loud and intense during class, often making you feel uncomfortable during the lecture. His class is extremely boring but isn't hard to get through.",0
"He's sorta funny sometimes, the quizzes are alright. But dang does he suck as a teacher. You learn crap most of the time and he's super unclear about what he wants during the speeches. If you miss the smallest thing he'll drop you like 2 letter grades NO MATTER how good your speech was.",0
She is very unclear with tasks and gives a ridiculous amount of work. Not very responsive to emails and difficult tests.,0
"Honestly, I hated his class. He came off as a nice guy at first but was close minded and rude to people who had other ideas. If you disagreed with his ideas he hated you the rest of the term. He assigned way too much reading for a 244 class. He's a great teacher for suck ups but if you aren't a brown noser and think for yourself watch out.",0
"Falcon has a huge fan club, but he's simply not a good teacher. If you sign up for his class, read the syllabus and you will see what I mean. Frustratingly obtuse man with no problem being ""tough"" (but not really tough, just irrespobsible)",0
"Really disorganized, although he tries really hard.",0
"I honestly got enrolled into this Lifespan Development Online Course for first time through enhanced computerized version learning methodology skills, thus transitioning from D2L to eLearning Canvas Instructure System automatically dropped me from this program. Unfortunately, I requested HELP many times from CRC Counseling and Dean WITHOUT SUCCESS.",0
"The worst professor I've ever had in my life. There was probably close to 4 full books of reading for only a few questions on each test. He was really rude and immature during some times and was really unreasonable. Worst professor ever, do NOT take him",0
"Terrible teacher, mean, angry, does not care about his students; I don't know why he ever became a teacher. Have to study a lot and use the textbook.  DONT take him you will regret it",0
Plagiarizes all of her tests and handouts from online sources. Google a question and the whole handout will pop right up. Conveniently she passes these off as her own. Great show of ethics there. ,0
Very uninspired. Reads straight from his handwritten notes. Seems like he is just going through the motions. Unfortunately many students have to take at least one of his classes. Gives pop-quizzes? Seriously are we in grade school?,0
"If your not good with computers, I'd advice choosing another professor. Moved through material fast, assumes you know the basics, and spends most of the time cracking jokes (not that I'm opposed to jokes, just that I need a teacher not a comedian.) chi test are easy but had a hard time with the in-class computer exams, especially with being timed. ",0
Professor was super hilarious but you won't learn anything. I barely passed the class bc I dont learn anything from his lectures. He is the funniest but that doesn't help me pass the class. Maybe he should change his profession to a comedian and not a mathematician.,0
Professor Ronen is a pretty solid professor. His lectures are very structured as well. He did give three exams which covered a lot of material but he ended up dropping the lowest. Environmental Engineering is easy so this class was not too difficult.,1
"Many people give this teacher good reviews only because of her positive attitude and cool humor which i can agree on, but do not let her positive attitude fool you she is really tough when it comes to grading her tests are up to 50% and everything else is below 10. So trying to bring the grade up was extremely hard!!! Would not take again",0
"Professor Morris is a great professor! He definitely had to adjust the course for this past semester to allow for Learning from Anywhere, and there were a few hiccups, but overall great course. When he found that like 75% of students were failing by mid-semester, he adjusted the grading criteria so that most students had A's. He's super helpful!",1
Here is all you need to know. He is NOT a good teacher and will not respond to emails or calls. He WILL give you the TEST as a study guide the week before. You are dumb if you don't get an A in this class.,0
"Grade was based on weekly quizzes and written assignments. All you need is your book for the quizzes. Forget about the onlinein class lectures.  Warning: Class often turns into a group therapy session where students share awkward personal details that relate to topics in class Good teacher, seems bored with teaching, or just Psych 100. ",0
"I thought Aren was great at lecturing and keeping it interesting. That being said, gender studies don't always present ""interesting"" content (especially at 9 AM), so you have to actively focus to see the value in this course. If you're willing to pay attention, Aren and this course are both full of valuable insight to almost any given scenario.",1
"His feedback seemed copied and pasted for each student. He is completely impersonal. He left almost no weekly notes. The reading was good for the most part-- a few utterly boring reads, but more often than not interesting and useful information. The assignments were often very easy.",0
"Si vous pouvez, CHANGER de PROF, dans le top 3 des pires prof que j'ai eu de ma vie!",0
Grades are due in 5 days... she hasn't graded anything in over 3 months. You'll be expected to write huge summaries on topics that are barely a paragraph long (usually 3 huge summaries per chapter). She doesn't answer her emails either. She allows rewrites if you want a better grade... too bad she hasn't graded the original paper yet. 4/10,0
"She has very strong opinions and pretends to play devil's advocate. She challenges you to fight her opinion, and trust me-you won't win. She brought up current politics and made her opinions into facts. Would never take again and do not think she should be teaching history, or really anything at all.",0
Andre was a very thorough professor. He clearly explained the data and which steps to take for SPSS. Also held office hours to go over or explain sections of the paper one might not understand. The first assignment was extremely easy. You just need to make sure you go to class to follow the instructions precisely. Or you won't do well on it.,0
DO NOT PLAGIARIZE. Careful how you reply to the discussions. I would not take any of his classes.,0
"I wish I had better things to say. But the work is very tedious. He gives out weekly blackboard journals that require paying a lot of attention to the text and pushing it. He then requires heavy, abstract readings, he experiments a lot and often just does whatever he feels like in the course. You do what he does, or your grade suffers.",0
DROP THE CLASS IF YOU EVER GET HIM,0
"Yeah she's a great, easy teacher  and all. But she's the worst if you want to try and make up a test or anything like that.",0
Dr. Zhang is by far the best and easiest math professor I have ever had. He will amazing in lecture and his tests are super easy. All you need to do is study the worksheets he gives the day before the test and you will get a good grade. His lecture is fun since he jokes around and tells stories. Using a graphing calculator on tests makes them easy.,1
"Honestly the worst teacher I've ever had. Completely unclear on when things are due, or what. Instructions on canvas rarely make sense. Grades a basics class like we should all have a master's degree and 15 years experience in drafting. And just awkward and not enjoyable teacher. Would highly recommend not taking a class from him.",0
"The Prof creates an exam that is simple when you hear it. 10 Short answers questions. What we did not know was they all had to be essay answers filled with many things that was not accessible to us. A regular exam has a time frame of 3 hours, usually the hours you spent in class, however she gave us two. Would not recommend if you love yourself.",0
"Lectures became really dry and boring a few weeks in. He also is hard to hear sometimes because he doesnt like to use the mic in class. writing assignments can seem lengthy for those that dont like to write, ranging from 10-15 paragraphs",0
"This is like a whole other bio class. We have 4 exams worth 50pts each when the labs are only 8pts. There is also an essay that's mandatory for her class. She grades extremely tough. There are also assigned animals for the semester that she uses for every test, which is tough and all free responses. She is horrible and grades based on how she feels",0
"Professor O'Hanlon is a very educated professor, goes off topic from time to time but makes the class very interesting and I enjoyed her class! Comes off as a very tough woman however she truly cares about her students and is a softie..",1
If you value education do NOT take her. She is awful for an undergrad student who needs this to get into the Ed program. Her grading is horrendous and unnecessarily tough. Please if you listen to anyone just hear me out. Drop her if you get her!,0
"He doesnt teach at all. Goes over the homework and talks about how phones and technology is destroying our generation. Hes not hard to pass tho, just do the work and youll be fine. Id only take him for 304 tho, I wouldnt take him for 401 or 404 because I heard hes worse. Good luck if you take him",0
"Chemistry minors beware: this is not an easy A! Furthermore, if acid/base chemistry is your weakness do not enroll in this class! Otherwise Dean's a nice but ineffective professor. 2 exams and final are easy, hard, and comprehensive, respectively. Several group work activities make you wish he would go over problems on the overhead instead.",0
"I had her in 50 minute classes, and I clocked her in and 163 ""uhm"" and ""uh""s one day. It makes class almost annoying to sit through. The information was rather dry, but maybe that was just the way Terry taught.",1
Avoid unless you want the most fluff-filled and hardest online ENG 102 class.,0
"Professor Pearce is a nice guy, but he didn't do well transitioning online due to COVID-19. His lectures were long and boring, which was hard to deal with online. I feel like I didn't learn anything from his class. Do not take his class if you are not good at teaching yourself the lessons.",0
"Please save yourself the trouble of taking this teacher. He is very disorganized, lost my essay the last day of class, made me buy an online tutor program which we didn't use, and grades very harshly. He teaches only through powerpoint and is not very good at it. I learned nothing in this class.",0
"Her classes were interesting, but she grades so hard. She hardly ever gives full credit for anything. I would never take this professor again. She is very strange. I ended up with an 89.5 and she would not round me up to an A.",0
"Ever watch ""Scrubs?"", channel ""Dr. Cox."" Professor Brown thinks he is hilarious with his dripping sarcasm. I had rather watch TV for my entertainment and be taught for my tuition payment. His same flippant approach in his attempts to teach is what leaves students with no understanding of chemistry and their disdain for him. RUN AWAY, if assigned.",0
Open to feedback on how things can be improved while learning online. No trick questions on quizzes or exam.,1
"I had him for lab, and for someone who doesn't like science and took Geology to fulfill a distribution credit, this was a great class.  He gave us simple notes each class, let us leave early, and the quizzes were really simple.  Plus, he's such a sweet old man :)  ",1
"Absolutely the worst professor I've had at Allegheny thus far. Shame on the U of Pitt for awarding him a PhD. The chemistry tutors understand organic better than he does. He is incapable of answering chemistry questions on the spot, lectures are a waste of time,  class material is not the same as test and he's an unfair grader. Don't waste your $",0
"Coolest dude. The topics He chooses for the essays are very straightforward. In class, 90% of the time there are group/class discussions. Sometimes he lectures but even if you don't fully focus on what he lectures, you will still understand the topic (it's true). the amount of essays don't even matter, he's a real easy grader. 4 pg essays minimum.",1
"Not a horrible professor, but also not the best. The cons were that you needed to use the textbook because she gives unit quizzes on the textbook and if you don't take your own notes from the textbook, you won't pass these. The tests are hard and she doesn't really help in class so everything is up to you. She doesn't show she cares about you.",0
"Well, she's a smart individual and you can tell that she's a good chemist. However teaching is not for her, it doesn't mean if you're good at something that you're automatically good at teaching it, probably research is her play ground but NOT teaching. Get ready to be your own tutor!!",0
"2017: LECTURES WERE SOOOOOO DRY. i have never been so bored during a class, was a great time to catch up on other classes. She expects you to read a lot, but she gives you interesting novels. She is a very tough grader, extremely picky on exams and midterms. She can come across as sweet, but can also be very sassy (not in a fun way)",0
"I REALLY enjoyed her course ! It's clear from the beginning what she expects from you during the course. She provides excellent feedback. She responds almost immediately to emails and questions. She's very timely with grading, so you know where you stand academically in the course. If you are looking for a dedicated and caring professor, she's it.",1
"Pr. Higgins is awesome! She is by far the friendliest, most approachable professor I have ever met.  The lecture material is fascinating as well as the readings.  Tests are 90% from the lecture, so no tricks!  Best class I've ever taken by far.",1
"Really helpful, nice, learned a lot",1
She is an amazing and kind person who cares about her students and does her best to help them succeed; she always makes herself available to her students. She can be VERY disorganized so it's important to read everything before class and really know the material b/c in lectures she can be confusing but will help make connections once you understand,1
Rick is a nice guy and is super smart. He worked for the fed for a long time so he has a ton of experience in the field. His teaching is hard to follow though. He expects you to have the chapter read before you come to class but then talks about completely different material. Then he tests on material that we've never covered. Lectures are boring.,0
"She is more honest than most. She is smart and helpful, but can tell if you're not putting your best in and isn't going to let it slide that easily. She is helpful if you want the help. She is also hilarious. Always had us doing unconventional field trips and experiences.",1
I think I've learned more in IDE and in doing the NXP car project than any other class. He's definitely the best professor I've had so far. His lectures aren't boring in the slightest. The labs are a lot of work but it's worth the knowledge you gain.,1
"People learn in different ways and speeds, so Cote will be great for some students, but others not so much. She will not spoonfeed you nor will she dumb down the material for you. You are expected to keep up and understand her, despite how fast she may go. If you can grasp chem concepts fast & well, then shes good for you. Otherwise, AVOID.",0
"Dr. Jimmerson is a fantastic teacher.  She generates interest in English.  She grades hard, though.  Her tests can be pretty difficult as well. She provides Bonus opportunities to make up for any bad grades.  I recommend her, but expect to work for your grade.",1
"Honestly this class was unreasonably difficult for a 101 class. It's not that it was hard necessarily, just way too much work expected for such a low level course. Lectures were not good and she just read off the slides for the most part that had nothing to do with the tests. Too much outside work and event attendances required.",0
This class is interesting if you're an erudite because It's basically self-taught. Doesn't respond to emails or doesn't read them correctly. It's sad because it's a great topic but there was no passion for even showing people how awesome it is.,0
"I was interested in taking the class because I'm a non-science major, but she was TERRIBLE. Ended up dropping it actually, she was very disorganized, read from power points the whole class, and the tests were the oddest of questions, like what animals roam in her backyard. In addition, her accent didn't help, and she never answered questions.",0
"He assumed that we had learned more in previous courses than we actually had.  AP Style was expected to be used on his homeworks; however, many people in the class don't know AP Style because they haven't had JN 311. His grading scale was weird. Homework is worth more than the group project. Awkward silences were commonplace in his class.",0
"Dennis didn't teach anything and was extremely disorganized.  He was unavailable for help if you needed him with lots of other obligations and other students...plus he didn't even notice if you were in his office.  His grading was abstract, and he was totally confused himself.",0
"A lazy professor who came late, chatted with students about anything but the class for 20 minutes, and winged it the for the rest of the period. He also failed to get in recommendations for students applying for fellowships. Disappointment.",0
"She's really harsh and strict, and even though attendance isn't mandatory, she treats it as such. Goes too fast for most of my class to keep up, I kinda just stopped showing up because I missed ONE class and she wouldn't help me out, and I fell behind. I learnt a lot more at home from the textbook. Try a different lab professor!",0
"I hate to be rude because, to be honest: he seems nice. I can see why people like him. However, I had to drop this class; I was getting so much anxiety from this. Didn't answer my e-mails. Lectures go off-topic. Could barely understand the concepts but didn't want to fail. Maybe he's better when teaching easier classes, but 210 is not it. Sorry.",0
"Dr. Anderson is one of the best professors I have taken at VSU. He is very understanding if you have any issues. He makes a point to get to know everyone on a personal level. Although the class material is difficult, he makes sure everyone has an understanding. Make sure you go to lab, it really helps your grade.",1
"Spaced out is an understatement.  The woman did not know my name until the semester was over, plus I was able to correct her too many times.  In addition, I received the wrong grade at the end of the semester and had to have it changed.  A softie yes, but also out ot lunch.",0
"Terrible professor. Would not recommend taking her course. Goes on and on in class without making sure students are pertaining information. Never gets to know her students either. Makes you study for a specific topic, but then when the quiz comes, its about a whole different topic and expects you to know the answers.",0
Nan is an extremely tough grader. Do not expect higher than a B on your stories. I felt like I was writing stories for the New York Times! Don't take for an easy A. Definitely a heavy work load. ,1
"This teacher loved lecturing, the problem was she had such a thick accent I absolutely had to drop the class. I could understand maybe 20% of what was said on a good day.",0
"She is very difficult and very ambiguous in her direction and what she expects. I was always very confident in my public speaking abilities and she pretty much trashed my confidence. What my peers considered to be exceptional, she picked apart. I plan on takin this class again with a different professor an doing much better.",0
"very nice woman, tends to ramble about things we will learn later in the bio sequence instead of explaining what we are learning. If you use the web site that comes with the book it will be easy if not you will have to read every bit of every chapter. also she uses the 3rd edition we have the newest edition either 5 or 6",0
too much assignment and boring . I don't recommend ,0
amazing teacher. if you fail this class you did not try at all. not an easy A class but an A is possible,1
"He's alright. The tests are difficult, but he will sometimes drop questions afterwards which will improve your score. The online quizzes are open book and the topicals are mini-essays, both of which are very easy to get A's. Overall, very middle-of-the-road; not the best teacher I had but also not the worst.",1
"Amazing Professor, really cares about his students. Does anything he can to help.  The extra practice problems helps a lot, he even provides powerpoints  on how to use the calculator. Would take if again, if he thought any other math courses. Textbook not really needed but it helps, no homework.",1
Awesome teacher! Knows her stuff and has great memory techniques. I wish she taught other courses! would take another class with her for sure!,1
"pat is a pretty average cs prof. its as if hes a substitute teacher for his own class. TAs never know whats going on, never replies to emails, slow marker, doesnt answer questions clearly if at all, tests have mistakes in them. posts lectures to youtube and videos are equally useless as sitting in lecture, so just dont go to class. lmfao",0
Worst math teacher I've had to date. He wrote the problems on the board wrong or would just do the problem wrong in general. I had to basically teach myself this entire course. On the other hand he seemed like a nice guy just not very good at teaching. I made an 88 on the final but bombed the midterm. The homework is what saved me.  ,0
Definitely going to choose Prof. Looney's class again! Interesting class and easy A. You can bring notes to exams so you don't need to remember a lot. Lots of bonus points available and the observatory sessions are awesome!,1
Brown a really nice guy and he does a lot better at teaching Orgo 2 then 1. If you read the book before class you'll really understand his lectures. A 60 is a C in his class and he curves more then professor i've ever known (i've had 18pt curves before). He's an okay teacher and you can definitely do well if you try really hard.,1
He is a nice guy but the lectures are extremely boring and don't pertain to the material covered. He will get sidetracked and talk about something irrelevant for a half hour. The tests would have been really hard however he puts up previous tests on blackboard that end up being the exact questions on the exams. You just have to memorize the answers,0
One of the best lab professors so far. Very helpful and patient. Tests are straightforward and no trick questions.  Definitely recommended!,1
"I enjoyed the class, but his lectures are so long. Very monotone voice put me to sleep standing as he talks for 2 hours straight. Homework took a lot of effort and wasn't interesting enough to motivate me to make art. He does take time to help out students, whether or not you think you need it, he was very helpful and seemed to love what he does",1
Dr. Brown is great! He cares about his students and will help you.  His class is easy but I had this class 20 years ago and had to retake as I am back in college.  He is a very kind and gentle man.,1
"This man is so dry and doesn't explain concepts in class, please note that he tries to make his class harder semester by semester.",0
"WORST TEACHER EVER. He can not teach, his notes are horrible, he's always making mistakes, and his tests are unbelievably hard... not to mention that he doesn't curve. The average on the final was a 41%.",0
"He only assigns two tests and 4 essays, so you only have a few assignments all semester to make your grade. As long as you attend almost every class and put effort into your papers, you should pass. He also never cancels class and assigns a bunch of reading, but it isn't that bad. He is really helpful and a good professor though. I'd recommend him.",1
Five tests are basically your only grades. Says you need to attend class but only to turn in homework. He doesn't make sense a lot of the time. Tests are graded hard (one t/f question wrong was 7 points off in one case). Do not take him if you have to take 1301. He is not helpful and confusing in his lectures.,0
"Dr. Branch is phenomenal. He made such a huge difference in my first semester at UNR and I am so grateful. He's a tough grader, but your writing will most definitely improve. He knows his stuff and he cares about his students--what else could you ask for? Also, he made a typically boring topic (documentary) incredibly interesting. Would take again!",1
"He can be pretty interesting but he makes all forms of assignments very difficult. He phrases things weirdly and practically forces his opinion on the students which I don't think a professor should do. He doesn't teach clear material, all over the place with his notes. He also never answers his email.",0
"Great teacher, helps his students as much as possible, and if you put effort forth, it is not hard to receive an A.",1
Dr. Hansen is one of the best professors I've ever had. He does all of his exams in class because he is anti-testing center. His tests are straightforward as long as you do the study guide. You can tell he LOVES the environment and he makes boring things seem so interesting. His assignments are made to specifically get to know his students!,1
"Although she teaches a 3 credit hour fine arts course, I had the most homework assigned to me in this class than all of my others. She expects you to already know how to play an instrument and read music. She is rude. Avoid taking this class at all costs.",0
"He is an okay professor. He is very quiet. Good thing is he gives homework but not as a grade but instead as bonus and its based off effort. The class was hard to me , but then again I hate math. Lastly if you do all the homework you can raise you're grade by 2 letter grades. I should of had a D., but because I did all the homework I got a B.",0
"This professor is knowledgable and very smart but lacks teaching skills. Provided study guides for exam 1 and 2 and average class grades was in the 80s. For the final, he skipped chapters, did not offer a study guide, and the class average was 60%. Content from the chapters we skipped was in the final! 3 out of 13 lectures were useful.",0
He is a terrible teacher do not take class,0
"Great guy. Would totally recommend him, and want him for every class.",1
"PLEASE, when you see her name -SKIP IT. She will fail you even if you try hard. She will call you out on things and will make you feel uncomfortable in front of the class. She is a horrible proffesor, she does not know how to teach to treat her student. DO YOUR SELF A FAVOR AND DON'T TAKE HER",0
"Horrible lectures. Reads from slides provided by publisher, maybe 2 slides class. At least one assign per week, easy if you follow the textbook. His exams are horrible. Doesn't teach half the questions on exams and they are nowhere to be found in the textbook. I've taken 5 higher level econ classes; unnecessarily difficult",0
Hardly used the book really cool teacher essays are easy and hes funny to pretty boring class but hes really chill so have fun if your lazy like me and wait to the last min to do your homework he will be a god send and hes i can hardly spell and i passed his class,1
Stewart is a great professor! His humor and lecture style makes a dry subject enjoyable and he's happy to meet outside of his office hours. The exams are difficult but if you study you'll be fine.,1
Was terribly unhelpful. Never answers emails/questions. Assignments were on material we never learned. The rock kit required for the class was discontinued and she did not adapt any of our content to accommodate those who couldn't get the rock kit.,0
HIST 424 changed my life!  The genuine passion of Dr. Tone quickly connected our class creating a unique open space and honest space to approach carefully selected fascinating subjects. Dr. Tone is incredibly knowledgeable and conveys extraordinary compassion towards her students.  It was such a privilege to take this class!,1
"He was so bad I had to drop his class. Grades quizzes and exams only, assigns homework, but wont grade it so it cant help offset a bad exam. He is nice, but his lectures are confusing to the point it looks like he has never taught. I talked to ex-peers and they all told me he is pretty bad and were at major risk for not passing.",0
"Ridiculously hard for online classes. Be prepared to either know math beforehand, know someone who can tutor you intensely or teach yourself. I'm an A student and worked my rear off to barely get an A. I can't even say I learned a much so it wasn't helpful for future use... Would not recommend.",0
"You are graded with 25% online homework (difficult) , 10% written homework, 40% midterms (only 2 midterms, each having 2-3 qestions, hardest versions of problems), and 25% the final exam (difficult). The class average at the end of the semester is failing however he is scaling so the class MEDIAN is a B- but a class average should not be failing!",0
"Good instructor, but can be arrogant and definitely has his favorites.  Not good qualities for an instructor, especially at a Bible College.",1
Pretty straightforward guy but lectures a lot. Exams are pretty easy though and the class isn't too bad for online.,1
"Patrick McKean is stuck in his very old ways. It's always his way or the high way. If you ask him for help he won't help you, he'll simply say ""I've already given the instructions you've should have paid better attention"".  I felt like I had to teach myself since he spent his dragging lectures talking about his personal life instead of journalism.",0
"He is amazing professor, really chill and awesome. take him for any class and you will love it",1
"Professor Chooljian is one of the toughest professor I have ever taken. Be sure to use your time studying for the course since there is lot of material, which requires memorizing and understanding. Do not procastinate! The tests can be tricky sincec most of the questions requires understanding, and you only get 30 secs to answer on lab exams.",1
Do not understand his bad reviews. Online class is easy with discussion posts and midterm was easy as long as you studied. It is content heavy so be prepared but he does not deserve the bad rep. Study and keep up with content and you'll do great,1
"Very good professor, very good designer! Learned a bunch!!",1
"I think he's a good teacher, you are given the chance to do very well in his class, but he does the most with work and grading. He grades homework like its a final. Even if you get the right answer you can end up w a 70. He also has you take a final +quiz after + write a final paper. Also picks favorites with no jurisdiction- easier on favorites.",1
"Literally just go to class and pay attention. Very easy and interesting class. He puts up all his lecture powerpoints, jeopardy review games and test review sheets online to help you",1
"Best class I think I've ever taken.  Prof. Mehmeti loves what he does and that shows by the way he's able to teach and share his knowledge with his students.  His love of music made the class very interesting and enjoyable.  A lot of work for a summer course, yes, but you're there to learn, right? Great class, great professor!",1
"He does not take many grades but if you go to class, take notes, and go off of his study guide you can easily get an A if you put forth an effort. LOVED THIS CLASS!!!",1
Basically get ready to teach yourself from the book.,0
"I took the online summer course and I knew it would be challenging. But I didn't think it would feel impossible. There is an extreme amount of homework given. I'd say take this course from this professor only if math comes easily to you, and if you can devote 25-30 hours a week to work on it.",0
"she is one of the worst professors ever!! she explains well but her class is boring and the exams are hard and she likes to write essays on her exams questions to give you points She didnt post any grades, and we couldnt figure ourselves. you going to waste your time on artificials without know what is your grads DO NOT TAKE HER",0
Right now i just took het midterm which i know i failed and i have to find a way to drop this class. Guys im not saying shes a bad person or something shes nice as a person but shes very hard if u want A its not gonna be easy there are other professors who teach socy 240 very easy so i suggest dont take her ,0
There is a lot of homework in this class. I don't like that we learn most of this stuff on the computer then he teaches it afterwords. The thing I don't like is the test heavy part of the course.,0
"Really liked her class. She was super available to help and never made you wait long to get a response. Usually got a response the day of. The exams are pretty much identical the ""super quizzes"" which you can take an unlimited amount so just keep taking those until you start seeing a passable grade, and your exam will most likely be a similar grade",1
Ms. Champagne is a great teacher for OB. Her lectures are great. I feel well prepared for exams just from her lectures. I would highly recommend her!,1
"He made all lectures interesting, class enjoyed participating and working together.",1
Andrew is an excellent English professor. His approach to teaching places you in control because he doesn't ask you to search for outside sources. He is interested in what you have to say about the material which can be a transformative experience if you are willing to immerse yourself in the material and his lectures.,1
"She will even allow you to text her if you need help, but you probably won't need help.  She is very inspirational and helpful.",1
"I took her for Psychology of Gender in class. She is very unorganized, she can not keep up with lectures, does not keep up with assignments that are coming up. I understand it's our responsibility to look, but she doesn't instruct how she wants it done, until you do it and gets mad because its not the way she wants it. I do not recommend her!",0
Profe. Luna is an extremely caring and effective teacher. She cold calls in class so you need to make sure you're paying attention or at least know the material. Lots of breakout rooms for discussion. Not much homework at all. Just an hour-long worksheet every 2-3 weeks. Can't wait to take her next quarter!,1
"I love her! She is so helpful and so nice. The online program Aleks is annoying, so she is very helpful during her office hours and she gives extensions if needed. She is very good at explaining the course material and she is extremely nice and helpful. Attendance is mandatory, but it is worth it",1
Roberto was a nice teacher. The weekly quizzes were rough... and the TIME LIMITS!!! I've never been so rushed in a quiz before. Very understanding in terms of Covid related problems. Think it would have been a better class in person vs online. Overall very nice teacher and appreciated how accommodating he was to students.,1
"Worst professor I have ever had. It seems like she is never prepared for lecture. She mumbles, and if you pay attention to what she is saying she repeats the same idea several times in one sentence, just reworded. She does not know how to help students and when you ask her one question, you're left with many more after her answer.",0
"This class is graded basically solely on papers, so be ready for that. She gives great feedback though, and really cares about her students. The lectures and activities are pretty interesting and engaging. Be ready to read a lot of short stories and novels. The final is a 10 page research paper, but other than that it isn't anything too hard.",1
"cool dawg, 10/10 would take again",1
"Welcome to frustrating guess class, you will not understand about macro and he doesn't care, also he can not explain, however, he is a good person but not a good teacher. He should be working on his accent as well. As Economic major student I am not referring this class in any circumstances if you registered to thisbe prepared for suffering",0
"I want to be fair as much as I can, but she's a real tough grader she deducts a lot of marks for very simple mistakes, marks were flying out just like money on a shopping spree and she won't help you with any extra credit either. So, don't let your GPA suffer. She is a good teacher though but still Gen chem I doesn't have to be that hard.",0
"She does not explain how she wants our 2 projects to be well then expects everyone to do it perfectly. She isn't understanding and pretends that the class is so simple even though she doesn't know how to teach. Throughout the class she couldn't figure out how to present her power points, print things out, and didn't know when the final was.",0
"I liked Professor LaMothe as a person, but not really as a teacher. This was her first time teaching and I felt like the class was everywhere. She would lecture for two hours and 30 minutes straight and only leave like 20-30 minutes to do a group project that requires way more time than that. Also her TA grades papers and it's based on her opinion.",0
On line class stinks - if you need help you need to go to the center.  Timed quizes and exams.  I always felt so stressed.  Not instructor's fault.  If you are sick that is to bad - you still have to take the quiz and test on line by a certian date and time.  Math would be better in the classroom!,0
You'll learn a lot if you're focused. He is a no nonsense type of guy. The beginning is rough but if you do the homework and pay attention you'll pass easily. The margin for error is low but he switches the final exam grade with your worst exam if you take every test.,1
"Great professor ! Clear grader ! You must understand the readings before taking the exams ,this is a MUST . Do not simply Google the answers or you are sure to have a tough semester . I highly recommend this professor ! ",1
"This lady is a demon...I dreaded going to her class. She told the class do not ask her any questions, she is not a tutor. She gives directions, but sometimes there is notn clarity so u are lost on the assignment. She is a total nightmare!!!!",0
"Dr Mensah is the Professor Ojelade of the Poli Sci Department, but actually nice and respected. His classes are GOD easy, as you only have to do the test and he reuses the same test that he's created since he first made the class. However, as said, he is very kind and funny and that alone made me want to come to class as he doesn't check attendance",1
"I think he's impossible. After four years of honors highschool math and the honors program at college, I'm struggling terribly in his class. He moves fast. The quizzes are fair but the tests are incomprehensible and unrealistic. Students are dropping out rapidly in Calc II. Maybe he's easy in the other classes but not in this one.",0
"I struggled with understanding Dr. Stewart's teaching and he wasn't able to understand questions very well when asked. He also struggled with professionalism with students. Lecture was not very helpful, and the few times I tried to get help outside of class were not benificial. He did end up curving a lot on exams to make the grades more normal.",0
This class isn't that hard of a class. Professor Lovelace does tend to ramble on about everything. So if you dont like a rambler then don't take this class. He's a very cool person!,0
"Have to read about 30 pages per reading, does not answer emails, does not post grades, doesn't update things that she says she would. Honestly one of the worst English teachers I've ever had.",0
Meehan is a challenging professor. She expects you to know alot. Her tests are long but she does drop your lowest,1
"Great guy. Wants you to learn and comprehend the material, not just memorize. His lectures are pretty funny and entertaining. He made me like Chemistry!!",1
"If you have no prior physics background, this class will be impossible. I consider myself to be pretty smart and I was lost from day 1. Doesn't teach just tells you to do the example problems on your own. The tests are easy to fail because the multiple choice are 5 pts each and he barely gives partial credit on the open ended. Very tough class. ",0
"Great teacher and great person, but the only way you'll do well in this class is if you're a good student and go to class and pay attention. He lectures really well and often goes over things multiple times to make it clear, but the problem is that a lot of students (including me) don't like accounting and tune out. Final was pretty hard.",1
"There is no grace period for lateness. Once you miss your name when he calls attendance, you're late, end of discussion. Relies heavily on the text. Readings must be done. Tests can be easy if you study. Pop quizzes.",0
I learned a lot about networking in his data communications classes including Internet and higher-layer protocols. Great basis for research.,1
"In the beginning, Mr. Franks is intimidating and is a hard ass, but he warms up within the first few weeks. He is very funny and very understanding. There are only 3 tests, and 2 papers for grades. No quizzes or homework. But make sure you bring in an article for every class! He gives 5 bonus points to final grade for articles.",1
Not sure how this guy has such a high score. He did a terrible job explaining lectures online and they were short and uninformative. He included stuff that wasnt really covered on exams and homework. Maybe he does a better job in person :/,0
"This Professor is HORRIBLE! Please I am being honest, do not take her class. She talks and talks and talks about nothing. Gives a lot of pop quizzes on readings that are way too long, and is a harsh grader! She will never give you the benefit of the doubt. Save yourself and DO NOT TAKE HER!",0
Ms. Bekka Trapp Is my English 101 professor at MCCC and I do enjoy going to hear classes even though I feel like I am not a good paper writer she is gives us a chance to revise a bad paper to get a better grade. Her class load feels like a lot less than when I took English 101 and withdrew from it.,1
"Stewart is so hilarious, he has a really dry sense of humor that made an otherwise dull subject matter pretty engaging. I wouldn't advise skipping class, as you'd get behind quickly. I would say that he doesn't give that much feedback on essays, which can be frustrating if you want to improve between draft & final. Very sharp guy.",1
Nice guy but his papers are crazy. He wants it a certain way and no matter what it wont be perfect.,0
"Boring professor. He lectures really slowly and never finishes them. Also, his homework and tests are worded very weirdly and are hard to understand. The homework is graded based on accuracy and he takes points off for very minor mistakes.",0
The class itself is pretty tough if you don't enjoy science and descriptive ways of how to conduct research. My roommate would spend hours studying the textbook to ensure an A on the difficult quizzes every other week. LaBelle gives great feedback and is more than willing to help in her office hours. Although I didn't enjoy the class I love Labelle,1
Awful!........ 40+ slides per 50 min lecture twice a week + 20 page term paper + 1300 word midterm (40 min to write) = FAIL.,0
"Amazing professor, really nice guy who cares about his students future. Loved his course! Recommend to all.",1
I definitely should have picked a different professor for this course. He did not make the subjects very clear and so many of my classmates failed the class. I would recommend choosing a different professor if you plan on passing!,0
"10/10 would recommend, this class taught me so much about the human body and also who I want to become. Mr Prey cares about his students and challenges us to do our best and gives us opportunities of success. Theres never be a dull moment in his class. Make sure you study, it will pay off in the end!!",1
"She's very sweet.. But a horrible instruction-giver. My research partner and I felt our way around in the dark the entire semester. Attending class is mandatory, but pointless. You will learn nothing. That being said, she's a relatively easy grader. Possible to make a good grade, but I don't recommend her.",0
Doesn't prepare you well for the exams. Everything is graded by the TA. Attendance is a must if you want to get your iclicker points. This dude gets paid to have guests speakers come in to lecture.,0
You should definitely be interested in political science if you take a class with Baughman,1
"Professor Fan is a very good professor. She is an expert in her field and her passion for teaching is incredible. The course is a bit difficult, but she is always there to help. Class consists of 4 tests, 4 homework assignments, and 1 case paper. Overall a pretty easy class just need to put in the effort.",1
look man this is not the class to get an easy A. This teacher genuinely loves biology and will make you work for it don't take this class if you don't absolutely loves biology... coming from a finesser,0
"She is the worst prof I've ever had. If you ask her a question, all she ever replies with is ""read the textbook"" which is also written very poorly. The Mobius quizzes are the literal definition of torture. It is timed 1h and you won't know how many questions there are (involves a lot of calculations as well). I don't understand why she is a prof.",0
Taking this class was a huge mistake. Her tests are impossible and there were a bunch of them.,0
She teaches  like she thinks that history is your only class you are taking.  The readings for each class are at least 30 pages long and you have to know all about it. She gives you what is gonna be on the midterm but there are about 53 terms and 4 essays to define. She narrows it down but it is too difficult. Dont take her or you will regret it.,0
"He didn't give a study guide like everyone else said and his tests averaged about four questions each, making it very easy to fail. All other opinions seem accurate. I wouldn't take him, again.",0
"Class was interesting. A lots of reading. You do have to write one essay, but its easy. Its over your health and nutrition. So far good class.",1
"Very vague and very unhelpful. Does not bother to look at your essays, does not teach anything about writing, and if she does hold office hours to help you, they are once a week at most.",0
Did not give study guides for tests and makes you study everything. The final was incredibly hard along with every single other test because you have to study all of your notes since she gives no indication.,1
"Prof Lohrey leaves everything for you to figure out on your own. Class lectures consist of him flying through ppts, and writing out the solutions to a couple of problems. You should go to class since he goes over probs that are most likely on the test. Two midterms which are 1/2 in class and 1/2 take home, final is in class. Hw on Wiley is helpful.",0
BEST SCIENCE PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER HAD IN UOFM! I didn't take physics in high school and this is my first physics class in UOFM(so I was  scared in the beginning). I love going to his class because I know I am going to get out of class knowing everything I need to know. He is very helpful and clear no need to read the book I simply love him :) ,1
"Dr. Feagin was by far the best professor I have ever had at Georgia Highlands. She spelled out exactly what she wanted for each assignment given. She gave an opportunity for an extra 20 points over all, and the study guides for the midterm and final were exactly what was needed to study. I plan on taking another of her classes in the spring.",1
"McEvoy for Business Law, never again. 50% of your grade is a 12 page paper on a topic she picks and the other 50% is the final exam. Lectures are boring and she is rude. Out of touch with technology and makes you send the final exam through the mail, no electronic submissions. You fill in notes during class in a typewriter booklet from 2010",0
The bulk of the work in this course are papers and 1 test with long answer questions. This class was enjoyable and I learned a few things as well. The professor was nice. No complaints.,1
LONG exams! 150+ question exams. Yes he gives you the review a week before but the review itself is 200+ questions that you need to find the answers to and remember them. Unrealistic. Don't bother complaining he won't listen/care. Attendance is mandatory. You lose points for not coming to class. Jams 5 chapters in one test because he's unorganized.,0
-_- he never responds to my emails and get ready to read 40+ pages in a huge textbook with small print every week and doing a lot more bs a week DONT choose this guy,0
he is an awesome teacher I would recommend him to anyone. before his class I hated math now I actually enjoy going,1
Matt Anderson is one of the few professors that actually cares about his students as people.,1
"Angela is a wonderful caring human being who is always available to talk outside of class. She is soft spoken and tries to let the students speak as much as possible, so try to enter the conversation. As long as you do all the work on time you are guaranteed an a. She is one of my favorite teachers and people.",1
I can think of few people who can better teach firsthand about ecosystems and the positive impacts of environmental restoration than Lisa Jo. Taking a class with her (especially this one) doesn't feel like work even though you have to put in the hard work to show what you've learned. Don't worry: you'll want to learn with her. She's the best.,1
"Worst teacher in St.peters history...dont get her she will give you an ""F' on every paper",0
She is not a good teacher.  I would not recommend anyone to take her class.  She does not related well with her students.,0
Martin is an amazing prof. His lectures are very informative and the way he delivers them really helps you learn. He always ends class early and keeps it interesting throughout the entire lecture. There is 4 tests all worth 25% and each one is a unit test. This with the added bonus of no textbook made for a great class with an amazing prof,1
"She is kind. The way she grades is terribly forgiving of missed assignments (drops the lowest score of one quiz, one exam, one deliberative democracy, and the clicker question formatting is forgiving as well). Easy to pass, but an A is something you need to have dedicated study time for. She is easy to follow and sticks to the slides for grades.",1
Took Prof. Cygan for Music 101. TBH as a previous piano player I thought I would do good in this class because I know a little about music but this class was not all that easy. The class website is a little weird but I got the hang of it after a while. Prof Cygan gives great feedback but you never really know when things are due. Overall just okay.,1
"Paul Young is awesome. If you have any interest in learning the music industry, Paul's your man. While you must show up to understand the material, and the material can get a little heady, he acknowledges this and tries to make it accessible for everyone. Tests can be a little challenging but study and it's not too bad + the material is fun.",1
"There was a lot to read and complete each week, book was poor. Didnt grade half my work/exams/labs for most of class. Ended class with no idea of my final grade. She didnt know course material or have any ability to assist with homework or lab issues. Written work was easy A if APA formatted since she didnt understand it. Would NOT take again!",0
"Lectures lack organization and structure as shown with numerous breaks. Unprofessional behavior, hostility and contention towards students masked in humor. Fosters a toxic academic environment where students cant openly discuss /share clinical experiences with broader class without fear of reprisal. Lacks enthusiasm and patience for teaching.",0
"Very rude, very condescending, help was nonexistent. He did nothing to actually help his students. Threw a tantrum in the beginning of the semester and cancelled class because we werent asking enough questions. Very unprofessional. If I could give zeros, I would.",0
"He will overload you with information so be prepared to pick which one u can use and which one not. He confuses himself a lot so prepare to teach yourself. Go ahead of the class if you're able because sometimes he makes you turn in a lot of homework at once. If you want to get a B or an A, put a lot of effort into this class.",0
"He is an opinionated professor yet very educated sometimes goes on tangents during lectures, and lectures are long sometimes hard to follow since so much information is thrown at you. Do not miss the dinner study sessions with him he goes over the whole study guide step by step until you understand right before the exam so it is fresh in your mind.",1
"This class is tough. If you're going to pass, you absolutely have to read the chapters before class and figure things out and come up with questions. If you don't ask questions when he gives you the chance, he assumes that you've mastered it. Don't try to cram for exams. You need to take your time and really learn. Quizzes are a lot like exams.",1
She's a great professor. She really helped out the students and encouraged participation and creativitiy. She's got a great sense of humor and is very approachable. She cares that you understand material and apply it to what you read. Highly recommended!,1
I read on here thinking this class would be an easy A and somewhat enjoyable . No book is a plus  because it saves money but.. the handouts we have to print out are Boring! She is an older lady and goes off topic majority of the time. This is one of those classes you are basically teaching yourself.  She has a sweet personality but is very boring.,0
"Ibrahim was honestly THE worst experience I ever had at OU. Coming on here and seeing all these good reviews honestly makes me think they're completely fake and he wrote them himself (DONT BELIEVE EM). He teaches you nothing and his lectures are god awful, constantly all over the place, horrible at getting points across. Teach everything yourself.",0
"I've taken 2 online courses with this professor so far, and it feels like a burden has been lifted off my shoulders, and in addition, I learn so much more than what I already know or more. No joke, no BS, just do what he assigns, even if it's alittle late and you'll pass with flying colors.",1
Oh Steve.. Steve is that dude. He is one of the boys and was a great professor. Tests is based on 4 tests and he gives very good reviews. Also we has quizzes but were told about them in advance. Much love Steve.,1
She is awesome! She can be a lil tough but like a grandma u will love her. She is so much fun.,1
"Lectures are long and terrible. She gives no guidance, she just flies through them leaving little room for anyone to even comprehend what the heck she's doing.  She also gives NEW material for the test on ""review day"". Her tests are hard. Don't expect any kind of extra credit or help with your grades. FIND A DIFFERENT TEACHER. ",0
"He's actually not that bad, I think.  It's hard to tell whether he is mean, hateful and condescending or whether he's trying to be funny.  Whatever it is though he really needs to work on his personality.  He's a graduate student that isn't ready to be teaching yet.  I've had graduate students before who were amazing, he is not one of them.",0
"She enjoys teaching and makes class fun. I learned a lot from this class and I am grateful to her for it. She can be a harsh grader, but you can't learn from slacking off the whole time.",1
"He is a nice instructor and explains materials very well. His lectures and topics are interesting. The test are fair, but we need to read lot of articles. Three exams and you can drop the lowest exam.",1
"Chris is awesome, especially considering the online format because of COVID. Grade is based on a few 50 question multiple choice tests w/ explanation, open note. Tests are easy, if you watch the lectures. Also, you have attend some mini-courses taught by the TA. Overall a positive low-stress class to take with some interesting material.",1
"he is very good at lecturing and is clear with what he expects from his students. however, he does not give extra credit but is good at his job",1
"He is simply amazing! Attendance is mandatory because of participation but it is the best way to learn the language. It was not too hard material wise but it is still a new language so you do need to pay attention and ask questions. Albert makes the class environment so positive and comfortable, always there to help you if you are struggling",1
"Might as well take calculus online because that's what you will be doing. The course is set up in a way that you watch videos every night and you have to TEACH YOURSELF calculus! He says that you can ask questions the next day but only answers maybe 2 at most because he is very unclear and disorganized. Avoid avoid avoid, trust me.",0
Took Gene for a 3 hour course and it was hard to stay awake. His tests are straight from the lectures but very difficult. Hardest criminal justice teacher i've taken at UCF and i just completed my minor.,0
"He is an amazing person, very friendly and makes it a point to get to know you as a student and individual. But the lectures don't connect with the books, and neither of those connect with the tests. I payed close attention to what he was saying in class and did poor on the tests.",1
"I liked prof. Barron's class. She makes things clear, keeps the class into it, and is approachable. The only down side is the fact that she is sporadic about reading assignments. She will leave you in the dark about what you should know and be prepared to discuss for class. But, otherwise a good professor.",1
"Very nice teacher, willing to help if you have any questions. He created a class study guide for everyone before the final. The quizzes are easy if you read and take class notes.",1
"The course was pretty easy. It is self taught. You are required to read the chapters and create the files. Anytime I saw someone ask question on the forum, he gave snide answers. My polite emails for help obtained one word answers. But, do the work, you get the A. This was 8wk summer a course (same amt material), still didn't take up too much time.",0
"Dr. Maher really knows his stuff. During lectures, he never used any notes or books to go off of. However, he wasn't very much help when it came to tests. The essay tests were challenging but not impossible. He often times did not make clear what information would be on the exam. Attendance is taken but means nothing but I suggest going to class.",0
Not very nice to all students. Will disregard what your saying if she doesn't think it's important to finish what you're saying. Rushes through lectures with information overload. Doesn't allow laptops in discussion classes. Not flexible or lenient.,0
"My time in Professor Kanchi's course can be summed up through one thing she said to me when I asked her a question about the homework: ""Why are you using the lecture notes to answer these? Use the books instead, they give much better information than what we covered in class"".",0
"Very nice guy, trying to better this world one student at a time, but his tests were insane. When you have to curve exams 15 points every exam you should know there's an issue. At the end of the day if you put in the work in lab you'll do fine but the exams are very stressful even though you know there will be a curve.",1
"He talks 500 words per minute. He responds quickly to emails. You have 3 assignments a week. 1 is a short response that he said was suppose to be pass or fail and ""2 sentences"" yet he gave most everyone 50s claiming we didnt write enough. His tests were open book but still very hard. The only way to do good is if you take very detailed notes",0
"Walks around and disappears for periods during class. Need help? Try not to, she has a hard time focusing and giving advice on how to improve a project. Not much help when learning things on the wheel which happens at the end. Gives suggestions for how she would complete a project even if it isn't the best way.",0
This class was really easy. Attending class seemed really pointless. Read the book and stay on her good side=easy A.  Robi is often very negative and an extreme workaholic.,1
"A must for anyone with any interest in the music industry (artists, you too!). Thought I knew a bit about the business and turns out I had barely scratched the surface. There is so much to be taught and Dr. Young is so knowledgable. If you truly are interested in working with music, you will get over the heavy course load and take this class.",1
Professor Chang is a great professor. He is very well-prepared and well-organized. He teaches and explains the materials very well to make hard topics become easy to understand. He does an excellent job on review main points before the tests and final exam. That helps students a lot. Thank you! I am looking forward to take more classes with him.,1
"She is not helpful at all, write down everything she says in class. Only three exams(fair if you go to class, review the power points, and read the textbook), two papers(hard), and 2 easy online posts each week. DRONES on and on and laughs after everything she says. If you go to office hours, she just repeats what she said in class. Not caring.",0
Every professor should be just like him. An amazing professor. It helps students understand and to think outside of the box. No one ever missed a class because we all wanted to learn from him. He has truly inspired me.,1
"The worst prof I have ever had at Mal. He treats students as imbeciles; Duane is both rude and arrogant. He is very opinionated and I felt his lectures to be exceedingly bias.  He added labs and lectures not outlined on the schedule and made them mandatory, so beware, your class schedule will be much more than anticipated!",0
"Although you learn some cool technology uses, the environment in the classroom was awful. He'll constantly go off topic on things unrelated to class making the class feel longer than it already is. He constantly yells, get frustrated and impatient to any student wanting to ask questions or clarification and overall an unpleasant person. STAY AWAY!",0
"This class was a blast honestly. There were no lectures, just read the chapter, take an interactive test and then talk with classmates on a discussion board about the topic. Theres a couple papers that a pretty easy, he makes the subject very entertaining! He sends a lot of check-in messages and is easy to get a hold of if you have questions.",1
He is very nice and uses really good examples/explanations. Make sure you go to his review session before an exam.,1
"I have loved History my entire life. Taking this class made me doubt that love on multiple occasions. There is way too much reading for a gen ed. I had to spend more time on this class than I did on the rest, lowering my overall grade. He also seems to think we're all below average students. And I'm pretty sure History is more than Social Mobility.",0
"THE BEST professor within the nursing department. She strives to inspire and motivate students as well as teach them real-life scenarios. She is practical, personal, and approachable. She encourages all students to be the best they can be. You will find her class rewarding and her experiences memorable. - Class of 2015 Section 2 :)",1
The class is hard. Read the book and don't get behind. His tests require a lot of writing and understanding of the material. He is the only E350 prof so you might as well do well the first time.,0
I have mixed feelings about Orser. She's a sweet woman and all that and I have taken more than one class with her but she can be extremely unclear about what she wants from assignments and her lectures are very messy. Take her at your own discretion I guess.,0
More than half the class had Ds. That means theres something wrong with the way the instructor is teaching!,0
Don't take this class. I read these reviews prior to the class and decided to take it anyway. It was terrible. He doesn't appreciate others opinions or views about a reading. Also there is a ridiculous amount of readings for this class. Lastly his TA is terribly as well. A mixture of the 2 made this class miserable.,0
Professor Bonner has to by far be the best teacher or professor Ive had in my entire life. I took him for Calculus 1 and he really cares a lot about the student. He is extremely thorough and responds to emails within an hour (within reasonable work hours). If I were to stay at Cerro Coso I wouldve taken him without a doubt for following classes.,1
"Professor Lowi is an amazing professor. She really cares about her students and is very interested in their opinions. She is very learned about the Middle East and this is what makes her class so interesting. However, she assigns a LOT of readings and is a VERY hard grader.",1
Not the best professor to take. There are a lot of questions on the exams for a short period of time. She gives a lot of readings. The study guides are no help. She's a tough grader.,0
"The course is not terribly difficult and his teaching is not that bad (lots of examples) but the final exam is a horror, there wasn't enough time and it was extremely hard. Also, the Ferguson text is incomprehensible and reads like something from the dark ages.",0
"Three hours of her going over everything you learned in lecture. Not a lot of hand on stuff, mainly just listening to her talk and not understand any of it. Young more tech savvy version of Palitinus.",0
"Amazing professor. Lectures are very helpful for homework. He is always around to help out with homework, projects, labs, etc. He is pretty laid back which is nice and makes the learning environment much better.",1
"Tom is a very interesting person to say the least. When he lectures he gets very off topic, be aware of that and take notes. The class tests are structured in response essays that are given before hand. You are expected to write ""University Level Paragraphs"" and makes you feel bad about yourself for mistakes. My final grade is now two days late.",1
"Diana is one of the sweetest people on the planet, but I think she is just an okay teacher. She will often deviate from the syllabus and not post the new assignments on Canvas. Also, she will get confused at questions and will give you confusing answers. She teaches in all Spanish which is nice.",1
"Bring your ""PAF"" count; bring your ""Blessure narcissique"" count; bring your pillow",0
I studied with this professor 11 years ago but she was the most dynamic and stimulating professor I had in undergrad.She encouraged the students to come up with ideas instead of stating all content herself and moved the lecture on by getting the students to make the logical connections leading to the arguments she was presenting in class.,1
I had not known what to fully expect when I signed up for this class. I was glad I did. Interesting lectures. Very in-depth. Sometimes the material could be a little difficult but Dr. Lamas made time to explain. I now have a new perspective on how to approach religion and the way it is passed down from generation to generation. Cool class.,1
"Evan Carr is laid back and great at explaining complex material. He's very open to questions, so go ahead and ask. It will help you know how to answer test questions. He also provides opportunities for extra credit!",1
Terrible professor. Guarantee he will not help you at his office hours. Boring class. A shame to NC State's CHE department,0
Beware! Avoid her. Critical and harsh comments. Fails to provide guidance but holds learnes accountable for info. does not go over. Grades harshly. I got an A and a 4.0 GPA still. Never take her again. Beware!,0
"This class is amazing attendance is and isnt mandatory he takes attendance but you can skip a couple of times. You write a total of like 4 -5 papers but they will be the easiest papers youve ever done. We had one quiz and it was analyzing a video. The class is fun, I would 100% take again.",1
"I took his class for ENG100 and it was honestly extremely easy to pass. All that is expected of you is to show up, take basic notes for your own self reference, and write the four essays he gives you during the semester. Every essay is easy to write about. If you cant show up one day, he is easily able to help you get by. He lectures a lot though.",1
"Don't take her.  Waste of time class that ignores the entire ethics component in favor of the law component.  Takes forever to grade your final paper, and gives everyone a B regardless.  Ruined my 4.0.",0
"he is extremely nice & genuinely cares about you and wants you to learn the material. the only work he makes you do are ""study guides"" theres 14 of them usually 1 a week with open-ended questions about the chapter, very helpful, its used to study for final, he has 2 quizzes u def have to study but the final is 1/3 of your grade, so u have to study",1
"Funny helpful passionate. If you want an easy pass or need a study sheet with everything that will be on the exam, take another professor. Goes through chapters quickly, go to office hours if you need help. Ppl that didnt do well either didnt understand or were just trying to slide through. If u need ur hand held like a baby, Lamkin is not for u.",1
"I wish I had realized how easy her class was when i was in it.  If you do the review sheet, you will do well on the tests.  She loves acct and wants to help her student.  i would recommend taking her",1
Prof. Bonaccorsi is very gifted when it comes to chemistry. She explains everything in a way that someone who is just beginning will be able to grasp it. One thing is she is not great at keeping her lectures in check sometimes and it gets kind of loud so I would recommend sitting near the front. She also follows her syllabus exactly as written.,1
"You can barely pay attention in class and pass the 3 exams with Cs, but still pull out an A if you do the homework, a few of the extra credit assignments, and show up to recitation. The trip to the observatory was pretty fun and cool too.",1
"She is a very nice lady, but I do not enjoy her as a teacher. Sometimes it feels like the students asking her for more is a chore for her. She also feels somewhat judgmental over our abilities, even though everyone is struggling meaning that we need more help. She is a nice person but her teaching style isnt very universal for all learning styles.",0
There are 5 tests and 2 extra credit opportunities. I advice you to take part of the extra credit to have that as a boost for your grade bc if you flop on all the exams its a wrap for your grade. Knox isn't the worst but he isn't the best either. Assigned seating. The class was interesting as far as speakers & videos. Fairly recommend. Late course.,0
"(eye roll) this guy is the pits. I took accounting in high school, so I was able to teach  myself plus tutoring. There is no point in going to class, so I stopped going after a while and just did the online homework assignments every week. The tests are easy if you do and understand the homework. Teaches accounting through a terrible online book.",0
"""GOOD MORNING"" ""HAVE I LOST ANYONE"" *random music plays in the background* ""IT HELPS ME GET IN THE ZONE"" Okay Shawn, okay, we get it.",0
"If you're like me, PS is not your strong suit. I was nervous to take the class at first, but he made it interesting. He has a way of explaining things that doesn't leave you so confused after. There's not a lot of homework either, he's good at spacing it all out. Not a stressful class at all. He's been very accommodating with the online transition",1
He was a decent teacher but the homework is hard. Tests aren't even that bad unless you missed more than one class in that unit. He was funny but a little awkward.,0
"Tons of reading, power points, and research.",0
Very hard to understand. And moves very fast. She tries to cram a week worth in one class.,0
"Amazing professor, would highly recommend.",1
"Great teacher and motivator. Used textbook a lot, along with lecture notes for exams. Took during summer and enjoyed the class, not easy but interesting and he made it fun.",1
This is the most work out of any course I've ever taken and it's a basic elective humanities course. I highly recommend finding another professor for humanities because it's not worth stressing out over having to post 1100 words for every discussion when most other classes require a third of that.,1
Raquel is the most misleading professor i have ever had. She does not accept excused absences if you've missed class more than 3 times. there is a quiz almost every week and they are ridiculously hard. if you do not openly support her personal beliefs than you will not receive participation points even if you show up to class. DO NOT recommend,0
Good prof. Makes learning a second language very comfortable. Never makes anyone feel stupid about making a mistake. Good sense of humor. Excellent class.,1
"She is one of my favorite professors. Her class is interesting and well-structured. She provides you with grading rubrics and step by step directions on every assignment. You can always email her or meet her outside of class if you have questions. Do keep in mind, however, that your attendance and reading the textbook is going to be graded too.",1
really easy going,1
Most boring professor at the university.  Totally unsympathetic to student concerns.,0
"Attend his study sessions and ask questions. His classes are easy if you use his help, don't rely on the text book to learn especially in pchem, his lectures are more useful.",1
He can be quite rude and sarcastic at times.,0
She expects you to spend 10+ hours of extra work on the side weekly as she expects you to work as much as an engineering student. Grading is quite unjustified at times as well!,0
Terrible!! He doesn't give you near enough time on his quizzes or exams. If you don't know the information as he does you will run out of time. His study guides are ridiculously long and you have to write essays along with your 80 questions on exams. He does give extra credit was the only bonus but you have tons of other work too.,0
Do not take IE 332 with Wachs. Period. He's better in IE 474,0
"She's really nice if you get on her good side. The class is hard and she's very passionate about the subject, so be prepared to work really hard! Talks forever but if you start your work while she talks in lab you'll get out faster; take good notes in lecture and you'll be fine!",1
"He's a good guy, and a great teacher.  Even in an online class, you can tell he takes the material very seriously.  He offers bonus opportunities, take advantage of them, it could make the difference in a full letter grade if you do.",1
"her organizational skills are terrible. She is quick to change the schedule whenever it suits her, without warning the class. The teacher even goes over lessons in class, which have nothing to do with the chapter we have read. She never responds to emails, and is quick to deduct points based off grammar. She's also Always late when grading homeowr.",0
If you have the availability to take this class online I highly recommend it. This class was one of the most frustrating classes I have ever taken. The professors dosen't count attendance as a grade but takes points off if you aren't there. He has a really snappy attitude and expects you to lead the lecture along with him. Worst class ever.,0
"""Intructor First"". Never respond email. Not friendly. Not care about his student at all. Hard to get an A. Worst instuctor I ever seen. No practice exam. He only says,""the exam question is similar to your book's examples"" (I took CIS 20). Lecture is lack of organized. It is detailed but saying too much useless in class. HW are barely relate to exam",0
"Opera Workshop is an amazing class. You will get great musical theatre training and/or opera training. You have a showcase at the end of each term and you get to have fun, sing, dance, and act 24/7. Great for theatre majors interested in Musical theatre.",1
"Does not really teach anything, assigns lots of reading and then has the students discuss it among themselves in class (and it often seems like she does not know what the readings are actually about).  The research papers that each LSFY-103 class is required to do are not research papers in her course - they are literary analysis papers.",0
"I really liked this professor and recommend taking her. Her class isn't too hard but you have to show up to class., you will fail if you don't.",1
Professor Vernon is awesome. One of the best professors I've had. It's very easy to tell he loves philosophy and also loves all his students. His lectures we're never boring. You do have to show up and read the material to do good but nothing too difficult. I for sure would take him again if I needed to.,1
WORST TEACHER EVER. DO NOT TAKE HIM FOR ANY CLASS.,0
"She's my favorite professor ever. Ms. Scott is so understanding and gives awesome advice when it comes to papers. We had a book to buy for class, but we only used it for the first couple of weeks. So many papers. I'm not a fan of the prompts that we had, but they weren't horrible.",1
I learned a lot in this class.,1
"DO NOT take this class as an 8-week class. The class has way too many papers to be crammed in 8 weeks. Good class, and amazing professor, just not in 8-weeks.",1
"Overall a good guy.  He has some really good real world experience and it shows.  He tells you to always ""google"" it first and hates when you ask him something he already answered.  I guess that's how it works after college though.  I'd recommend his class.",1
I do not recommend taking this class unless you are exceptionally well at writing papers. You do need the book and he will want plenty of quotes from it. He is a hard grader and give vague feedback. I have received only Cs on my papers. Also the only grades we get are from the paper so if you dont do well on them you are SOL.,0
Jan is very knowledgeable about the subjects she teaches. She is willing to work with you and has a lot of office hours.,1
professor JACOBO  is the greatest professor that I have ever taken at valley  college.  we need more professors like her,1
Professor Harvey is always trying to help his students and give them a different perspective,1
"I've always dreaded making speeches or doing presentations so I delayed taking this course as long as possible. Big mistake!  Meaghan assigned fun topics for each of the six speeches assigned and provided a lot of encouraging feedback for each one. Besides gaining her feedback I enjoyed seeing how the class, as a group, improved over the 12 weeks.",1
"Took this online  in the fall14.I'm a very good student,and I was just very displeased with her teaching ability. She takes 1-2 wks to return phone calls and emails(when you ask her about this in person she says she never received them).We had nothing but trouble with the Mastering Biology,and she even had us re-do some due to her wrong doing.",0
"Difficult to understand.  Makes constant mistakes on the board that the students have to correct for him.  Wastes time doing arithmetic on the board like adding, multiply, dividing when he could just punch it in a calculator.  We didn't get through all the subject mattter.  Tough grader on tests.  Still got the A. Show up to class and he'll like u",1
"Worst teacher ever. Not clear on grading, online homework and tests are way harder than taught. Hes extremely rude, not just to students, but to older adult students. Will not listen or work with you. Changes grading rubric the last day of class. Im proficient in Spanish and I nearly got a C bc he cannot teach and expects you to know it on y own",0
"She is boring. Students talk while she is lecturing and she can't control her class. She is a great person, just not teacher material. She is not punctual. We don't get started until like 40 minutes into the class period. I really like her as a person and she is a great social worker!",0
He is very funny and extremely empathetic.,1
"He's so critical when it comes to marking. I got an A+ on my last marketing class, but now in his class I barely passed (this was everyone's problem with him). I will never take his class again. On the other hand, he's a good professor. He teaches really well.",0
"Mark is an awesome teacher. He grades pretty tough and u are expected to do every homework assignment and lab in order to even pass his class. Do not expect to just breeze through his class, because u will fail. He makes u work for ur grade but he is always there if u need his help and he really wants u to succeed. Would recommend for COM 408!",1
"Excellent teacher.  He runs an activity-based type of class, which really helps out when it comes to learning.  He is available almost all the time in his office to help out.  He keeps students awake with a lively manner of lecturing, and gets students involved.  Very easy going, but requires work to be done.  Not a bad teacher at all.",1
Thad makes a very difficult course a little easier. If you like to be organized not the class for you. No study guides for lecture or lab exams. Lectures are fun and entertaining. Labs can get long but are interesting. Takes awhile for graded tests to be returned but he's a soft grader. If he thinks you know it you'll get credit. Great instructor ,1
"some of the questions on the midterm are off the study guide. if you don't like history i wouldn't recommend it, boring class.",0
"Read previous notes; yeah she gives extra credit if the quizzes are on time but it doesn't really help. Did ALL the Quizzes & Homework w/ a 100% + Extra Crdt, didn't matter! Her test are TRICKY & the Final, TRICKER! 1 post stated she doesn't review test, SHE DOES NOT! Expects U 2 know what she's suppose 2 be teaching! U Will Teach Yourself!",0
"She's a wonderful person. I actually picked her to be my academic advisor, so I work pretty closely with her, she's really helped me figure out my future. Class wise, the other reviews are accurate. You do have to read your text book beforehand. There are weekly quizzes. She does grade hard. There is no makeup work. Do NOT let this scare you away!",1
"he can seem like he is kinda of jerk at first, but really a fair guy when it comes down to it. i missed 3 or 4 assignments just because i was lazy and he let me turn them in on the last day(even though he doesnt allow late work) and it raised my grade an entire letter. also extremely intellegent in his field.",1
Professor has a great sense of humor. Keeps the class very lively which was very helpful because of the late timing. His notes really helped me to navigate the course material and his test reviews were helpful and concise. I thoroughly enjoyed the class and would recommend his class to anyone who needs/wants to take BIO110,1
"Professor Nguyen is a very caring teacher! He really challenges his students and wants to see them succeed. Overall, philosophy is a very difficult subject but that's what you know signing up. I hate reading but you have to read because everything on the tests comes from the book and his extra notes. He's also funny which makes the class enjoyable.",1
"He is one of the worst teachers at the school to take math with. He is not helpful at all the way he grades is tough. If you don't do it his way then he marks it wrong, even if you have the right answer . This was the only class i didn't pass this semester I got all B's in my other classes.",0
"Incredibly boring lectures. I was able to teach myself out of the book and still do well in the class. The group project isn't too bad, but the directions are incredibly unclear and he had to be asked multiple times for things to become clear. Easy class if you read the slides and do practice problems. So boring though. ",0
Great class and super easy Ethnic Studies fulfillment. You don't have to do the readings if you don't want to (even though she might say otherwise). Interesting lectures. Monica is such an incredibly nice and understanding person - couldn't recommend her class more!,1
Extremly boring class. She is very unorganized. Tough Grader. Missed class quite a few times.,0
Awesome professor. Make class fun and easy to learn. Be on time to class as she like to give quizzes for extra credit; which you will need. Go over her slides and the book.,1
"She gives pop up quizzes, which can be so unfair. She get angry if you ask questions in class and insults students based on how they present in class. If you have presentation anxiety then you are finished! She gives F's  like freebies. I would never recommend her to even my enemies.",0
"Some of the material is dense but relevant to the discussion. This course builds up on early readings, so make sure to read. It becomes repetitive at some point, so I advice to have questions regarding the material, if not it is brutal. These theories touch on current events, politics, and pop culture, be sure to prepare on that for variety's sake",1
"He was the coolest professor I have had by far! Super nice and truly does want his students to succeed. Lab work was easy, just make sure you have the book because a lot of the labs require diagrams that are already in the book. If you don't have it, he'll print out some copies. Really just and overall good guy.",1
She is a terrible teacher and spends most of the class talking about her problems. Her attendance is mandatory so you have no choice but to spend hours listing to her talk about her mother-in-law for hours. She gives no clear guidelines for projects and just expects you to figure it out on your own.,0
"You learn a lot from class than any other high school or human sexuality courses. It's true he talks about his life A LOT so likely you won't get through the whole chapter. His exams are hard so study repeatedly. I had open book but I still ended up with a C so be prepared, attendance is key, read during lectures, and stay awake he watches everyone",0
Professor does not teach the course guideline.  Feels that arts and craft is too beneath him and only teaches fine arts.  This class is not for fine arts.,0
"Try to avoid him but, Dr No is inevitable.",0
"Be prepared to go to lectures and leave the same way you entered, without any new knowledge.",0
"Professor Myers is such a great math teacher. She is very helpful in class. If you are in class she will show you many ways to solve one problem, because we all look at it differently. She helps each individual student and wants you to pass. If you are willing to learn and be in class you will do great in this class.",1
Professor Chistensen is the best English Professor at Florida Memorial University. He is great. Upon leaving his class your writing skills will improve tremendously. Keeep doing what you are doing Professor Christensen,1
"His music 2300 class is my favorite class ever at Pulaski Tech. I was just checking to see if he has any other classes. I'm not sure I'd like French especially with the comments, but he sure knows music. The grading is always fair. No tests just  papers. It's hard to not do well if you just turn in something. The music discussions are the best.",1
"Dr. Houston is not a good choice. You have to write EXCELLENT papers to get good grades. I had papers critique by professors and adults and till received a ""C"" on it. She doesn't seem like she wants to help and majority of the class left after the 3 month of school!! DO NOT take her because she can make you life miserable and it is not worth it!",0
"He always starts off with 30 min life lesson before every class, tells u to read textbooks over n over and won't help you outside of the class. Many people failed first two tests and dropped out of the course right away. The only things that are going to save u from this class r take-home tests and the final test (which seems to be rather easy).",1
not helpful. lets computer teach you. never sure when stuff due because you expected extended deadlines but then find out one person got and you didn't. I'm lost and taking different teacher next term.,0
"Asks test questions like ""What kind of world can our children expect?""",0
"if you have to avoid one thing at UConn is this guy. yes you might try your best to understand the class but taking him will take the interest of math out of you. its a no no, never take him, you you will be clue less the all semester and get bad grade.",0
"Grades like an English prof. but he makes class interesting and keeps everyone engaged. Not a bad guy either, he will help you if you need help.",1
She gave out an excessive amount of homework and kept pushing a liberal agenda. Every paper was and even the homework assignments were graded tough. Would not recommend to any one.,0
"Antonetti is great. He teaches extremely well, and you will understand and pass as long as you pay attention and take notes. Exams are directly sourced from the things he writes on the board and explains. Excellent teacher, although if he does find a reason to call a student out, he will do so - so be prepared for that.",1
"This class with this professor was the absolute worst. She assigned so much busy work that was incredibly pointless, but you have to do it or you'll fail the class. She is such a tough grader, and I NEVER got As on any assignments despite being a good student.",0
"Lectures drag on forever, talks about the same thing for a while. Portrays his opinions as if they were facts, and occasionally even told the class something that was outright wrong. May or may not respond to e-mails. Test are written very confusingly. Got questions wrong despite knowing subject matter. Takes attendance. Book is not needed. Avoid.",0
"I withdrew  from the class, as well as many others! We started with maybe 15 or more, by the time I dropped there were 6.  She did not teach the subject where the student could understand and retain the information! If you ask for help during class, her response is always ""Well..., I don't understand why you don't understand"".",0
I took Jennifer's class last fall and it made a deep impact on me. You can tell she cares deeply about the subject. She gives lots of opportunities for extra credit and her assignments are mostly easy. She allows one notecard for each exam and gives you all of the prompts ahead of time to write down. Don't BS the child interviews.,1
"I had her for SCOM 123, and I couldn't ask for a better professor. Her lectures are very interactive, she's hilarious, and you'll get to know a lot about her family. I wouldn't say this class is an easy A with the research and scheduling when to work with your groups, but Nicole definitely does her job in preparing you for the midterm and final.",1
"She grades everything extremely slow, I had to email her 16 times before she graded one of my assignments,(which took THREE MONTHS) she gave the majority of my class zeros on our final paper because they were ""plagiarized"" which none of them were. She knows what she's talking about and might be a good professor if she wasn't absolutely insane.",0
"Dr. Keys is truly one of the best professors I have had! He is very helpful for any classes you take with him and for academic planning. I stopped in his office often to ask questions and talk with him. He has students to his house for game nights and truly cares about them. He classes are tough, but he pushes his students to be the best possible.",1
"I cannot say how Dr. King is during in-person classes, hence my rating instead of 2 instead of 1. I can tell he is passionate about the subject for sure, but Dr. King ended up just assigning textbook readings instead of doing much actual teaching, leaving you to teach yourself. Perhaps it'll be different once classes are in-person again. Hard tests",0
"I was expecting this class to be decent as my last class prior to the semester I took this one was very good and I had a professor who gave me good feedback and clear instructions. Professor Makri does not give clear feedback or instructions, yet hands out low grades anyway. Would never take another class hosted by her again. Terrible experience.",0
"One of the most interesting classes I have ever taken.  It challenged and changed the way I view medicine, and beyond.  Roberts is a solid professor, but i was really my GSI who clarified and taught me the material.  There is ~80pg/week of reading, which is dense.  Several papers, and two exams.  This class is a LOT of work, but totally worth it.",1
"A fine professor. She will not spoon feed you the law. She hates when students are absent. As with any class, study, know the material and you will be fine.",1
I LOVE LOVE LOVE HUG! She is hilarious and very passionate about what she teaches. She relates everything to everyday life which helps with understanding the material. Offers so many extra credit. Participation is good in her class also because  you may get extra credit from it. Total of 4 exams that's it. I totally recommend her! :) ,1
"He is super smart and this class is very difficult regardless of the professor, however Dr. Norris might have given the most fair exams I have ever experienced The study guides are KEY fill them out email them to him & you will pass this class with a good grade. Go to class. Go to office hours, ask him what it is he wants! Don't buy the book",1
He was terrible.  He refused to help students and when he did he was very vague and just confusing.  ,0
"Probably one of the most passionate teachers I have had before. Cares deeply about the subject which for my case was Early American History and a focus on Native Americans. I didn't use the book for the first couple weeks, but you should as all quizzes are based off readings. Loved this class and gives reasonable amount of work.",1
Great professor! She instructs very well and motivates you. Very knowledge for every level of fitness (in the weight room or her work outs in the gym). This is my second class with Ms. Thompson and I cannot wait for summer session (her cardio/body conditioning courses will be four days a week).,1
"Here's the thing about Pederson. He's extremely attractive and he is constantly trying to get students to discuss in class. But if you don't talk you lose participation points. And his tests are really in depth and difficult, so if you don't know everything you will fail. His class is really freaking difficult.",0
"HORRIBLE communicator, never answers emails and is very unclear is specifying what he wants for assignments. Never take his class if you want to keep your sanity. The workload is huge and he is far too particular when grading. No creativity at all in the assignments because if you don't do it to his liking, you will get a bad grade.",0
I hated every second of this class. I studied HOURS AND HOURS and still earned mediocre grades because the professor asked extremely specific question in exams. This made me extremely frustrated the entire semester. DO NOT take this class,0
"Mr. Garcia could of had potential, however he's not suitable to be a professor. He's laid back and all but all he does he show us videos. He's very opinionated. He doesn't even bother to reply back to my emails, he basically just ignores them. It's funny how he has expectations of us but can't even give a response when students need assistance.",0
This she has a thick accent that is very hard to understand. The way the book teaches the material is how she teaches it. The equation / algebraic expressions are literally on one slide. So there is barely room to understand what is going on. The fact that she only grades quizzes and test will make it harder to pass this class. Do not recommend....,0
"The hardest class I have ever attended. While she is a nice person, her grading system is subjective. It's almost as if she expects prior knowledge of economic perspectives before taking the class. Avoid her class(es) if possible",0
Monschientastic!!! Great teacher. Helped me a lot and I would recommend him to anyone.,1
"Professor Evans expects a lot from his students and often gives us very challenging problems. Sometimes I feel that he is too smart to know that someone might not understand what he is talking about. Despite that, he is very knowledgeable about the subject matter. I learned a great deal from his class and it was also fun to work on the projects.",1
"Koh can be boring, but his sample programs usually give the necessary information to complete the homework assignments. The homework ranges from easy to extremely difficult and time consuming. His exams are open note, so they're not too bad.",1
Overall tough and unfair grader. Would not take again.,0
"His classes were pretty dull, and he doesn't always touch everything that's on the test. If you don't have a book for this class, you would defiantly fail. Also, he likes to blame a lot of the bad grades he gets on his students. It's like he can't ever find fault in himself.",0
"She's the nicest professor I've ever had! The layout of her courses may be unusual, but she really does try to look out for students best interests. Do the readings. They are very important. Also her lectures might be a little boring, but she really is very knowledgable and you learn a lot by doing all the assigned readings. Loved it!",1
"THICK accent. I'm Asian and I couldn't stand the high pitch voice. Your grade is based on attendance/participation & 3 exams. Study the textbook unless you miraculously can understand and stomach her voice. We're in college, but she had us read the syllabus aloud in class, line by line.  Dropped her class, I do NOT recommend this prof.",0
"If you stay on top of things, it's an easy A. A few tests and a group project at the end. She gives clear instructions and is ready to help along the way with any questions or issues you may have.",1
"Dr. Mooney is a great professor,  she knows her material and cares about her students.  She explains things well, but she has a lot of information on her powerpoints, which she puts online, so paying good attention isn't critical. Personally it was kinda boring, because I took AP pysch so it was not much new info. 2 papers, 3 mc tests, weekly posts",1
"awesome (and im not a history person!) easy class. she is interesting and thorough. I personally did not use the book at all.  I would definitely recommend her,.",1
Did not like her as a teacher,0
"She's not terrible, but she rushes during classes and she expects us to know as much as she does with the content. I asked her a few questions,&there are just times when she just assumes that you know it already. She reads from the textbook ,I thought going to class was futile. She goes through mechanics without explaining what purposes  they serve",0
"This class is awful.  Instructor is dumb.  She is so unorganized.  Notes that she post are horrible and you can't follow them during a lecture. I honestly can say that I have never had a worse instructor.  RUN, DON'T WALK AWAY FROM THIS CLASS.",0
I learned a lot about culture in foreign countries that I was not aware of. A very artistic and motherly type of woman with much compassion.,1
one of 3 best in my 5 yrs of education,1
"Gosh hes great. Really cares about his students. One paper for the whole term, weekly quizzes, and one cumulative exam. Just pay attention and youll pass - he knows his stuff and is hilarious. Will push you out of your comfort zone so get ready to learn about stuff you might not know about or feel comfortable talking about. But yeah hes great!",1
"First impression of Kata is that she has a strange accent, and after some more time in her class, you'll realize that's the least of her problems. She doesn't give guidelines about what she expects of her students, and she's highly disorganized. Definitely take someone else for 223.",0
"I've been wanting to take one of Hersha's courses for a while now; I've always heard very good things. Currently, I'm 100% online, but I can't wait to take another course with her when I'm back on-campus next year. She's very thorough, and the module content is organized well. She is very knowledgable.",1
Soil Science would be the most boring class ever if it were taught by anyone else.  Dr. Ptak is a good lecturer and he is so willing to help.  He sits down with you and will make sure that you get it.  He teaches some really in depth stuff but you end up walking away feeling like you really know it.  ,1
"Does not teach course material whatsoever. Talks for hours instead about barely related topics, and students are left to teach themselves. That's fine, though- not only is the textbook a better teacher, it has a better personality too.",0
"Way too many assignments for an elective course. He also marks too hard with little to no feedback on the assignments. Each week there's 5 assignments to do. unless you have excess time on your hands, it's difficult to complete. Replies to emails really late and does not take into consideration the fact that students have other courses. Avoid!!",0
"Good teacher, always smiling and happy.",1
Lots of material and it's not easy- but if you study a lot you'll do well. She really is responsive if you have questions- ask her after class or by email.,1
"If you can avoid taking her online course, then do so. She was one of the worst professors I've ever had. You have a self intro video at the beginning of the year and then an informative speech at the end & if you suck @ giving speeches your grade will suffer. The rest of your grade is easy because it's ""quizzes"" from the reading.",0
"Easiest level 300 class I've ever taken. Great instructor, let's you know exactly what to expect for tests and he lectures in a way where it's interesting and fun. Group project can be fun if you think outside the box. Definitely take HRM 305 from him.",1
"I'm not good at politics at all but this class helps me stay on top of what's going on and also it's very interesting. She challenges you to think ""outside the box"" so to speak, and encourages debate & disagreements. No papers for this class, only quizzes and exams that are all essays. I thought she's an easy grader given how I've done so far.",1
He doesnt keep you updated on your grades and doesnt announce anything on blackboard.,0
"Awesome professor, and an awesome class",1
"Very sweet man! The pace of the class is sometimes painfully SLOWWWWW, but it is an easy class and I would recommend. :)",1
"I wouldn't take again especially for an online class. He doesn't explain the assignments, the readings are difficult and long, and the lectures are overall boring. It seems like the more rubbish you write the higher your grade will be.",0
"She goes through art periods too quickly, there are too many images, and she speaks too fast. The lectures require you to take a ton of notes, your hands will ache by the end. There are quizzes almost every week, so studying the pictures constantly are a must! Too much work required for a 3 credit class. She's not a great professor either.",0
"She is knowledgeable about math and she cares about her students. However her online lectures weren't the greatest. If there weren't internet issues on her end, then there were microphone issues. It was also difficult to read her handwriting (I don't think she used a stylus). Dealing with illegible writing when learning math is a huge issue.",0
Paul Kirz is a Man!,1
"So I took Professor Zhangs online class during summer during COVID-19. In order to pass just make sure you study and do you homework and tests day of because you will take hours doing homework and tests (if your not a wiz at stats like me). He also doesnt give extra credit, or bump your grade (like not even half a point).",1
"Class was so confusing that I forgot who I was, where I was, and what I was doing -- it's a great stress reliever.",0
Her English and grammar very poor and she is hard to understand. She should really take some English classes.,0
I've never heard of having to do papers in a math class but we have almost weekly papers on concepts he hasn't even taught yet,0
"It is like she is winging it & she does not have her lecture planned out. Super unorganized, inconsistent & does not follow her syllabus. I didnt know what was coming next which gave me a lot of anxiety. But she grades super easily & homework is lil & easy. For some reason she cannot find words to express wat she is trying to say. Lots movie clips",0
"Too Many notes and are not specific too test. Flash cards did not help, had to read book over and over again. Test questions do not at all reflect what he goes over or focuses on.  demoralizing and threatening. Most students dropped  psyches everyone. Tells us to quit our jobs . threatened extra credit if we did not retake a test I pass already.",0
DJB is my most favorite professor I've ever had! She truly cares about her students and prepares you well for exams. She keeps everyone laughing and engaged in her class at the same time. I can't say enough good things about her!,1
Great teacher tries to help you pass.  Accepts late homework and provides help. take him you wont regret it,1
okay,1
Knows her stuff very well! Ready to help out. Particular about assignments and attendance. Overall worth taking the class.,1
Very fun teacher. Very knowledgable about computers and very entertaining. Provides study guides that makes passing the tests much easier.,1
"Get Chegg. Very abstract, non-linear teaching. Your quiz and lab report grades rest on your group members, so hopefully they actually participate for you. Attend every class, even the shorter, non-lab days.",0
Best professor I had ever had. would take him again. Explain class well and always give personal experience in the field he worked. I learn a lot from him. good professor. I personally recommend it to you!!!,1
Good first time professor.,1
"Prof Hansen really cares about his students. He is funny and acknowledges the lectures can be dull at times, so he doesn't expect too much. The work load is pretty light, especially for a 3 credit course, and it counts for 2 GE's. I've really enjoyed being in his class and would recommend him to anyone.",1
"DO NOT TAKE with her. Does absolutely nothing but sit on the computer while in class. Doesn't know how to answer questions on material or tests she gives! Never teaches or lectures about  new material nor reviews for exams. if you want learn nothing and waste your time then you should take her. She probably has tenure, the only reason she has a job",0
"He is pretty tough to get an A from, but he is a good guy and effective.",1
Fantastic lectures! He doesnt try to teach over your head and gives you real life examples that youll understand. Very laid back and funny. He gives great feedback and assignments are very easy to understand. Youll always know whats expected of you. Hes also a PHENOMENAL advisor. All around great and so very helpful! Wants you to succeed.,1
Amazingly boring.  Arbitrary grading.,0
"She obviously has a great amount of subject knowledge and personal experience with Asian studies, but she is a very poor presenter. Her lectures are long, boring, scattered. Use Wikipedia if you want to know what's going on. ",0
"This was probably the most unorganized class I've ever taken. You don't really have to go to class because the lectures, quizzes (7), and exams (3) are all online. As long as you complete the few assignments, quizzes, & exams you can easily get an A in this class. Don't rely on the syllabus b/c there are many typos and assignments left out.",0
"Not sure why so many students here love this professor. I find her teaching style to be entirely unhelpful. Lots of outside work because class itself is useless. Little guidance on what she expects on assignments, and then she grades soooo hard. Bad prof. Bad class. Hang on for dear life.",0
"He talks kinda fast, lectures are decent. Exams are somewhat difficult if you don't read.",1
"Online class - SPENT HOURS literally on this class each week. Posts are at least 2 pages long sometimes I get a 60 sometimes I get 95, NEVER 100. 5 pg term paper, 3pg midterm and 3pg final. It's all very subjective and you never know what exactly she looking for. HORRIBLE do not take if you can avoid it!",0
Your entire grade is based off of 3 exams that he does not prepare you well for at all. He offers homework that can help improve your exam scores but the homework takes between 1-3 hours to complete sometimes longer.,0
He is just too hard. He gets off topic a lot and doesnt stay focused. When you go for help he is not really helpful at all.,0
"Uses Matlab to avoid teaching. Super nice and has a lot of talk but cannot explain the topics. I think she is still faking it till she can make it. I had to retake course on transfer. Stay away. I don't understand why she was hired, they clearly did not ask students their thoughts.",0
My first online class and it went very smoothly. The class was only 3 weeks so we definitely flew through the chapters but I never felt overwhelmed. All in all it was a good class and the discussion post were an excellent way to engage the class.,1
She should be teaching an introductory class. Her lectures are quite dry. She reads straight from the powerpoint. A lot of modules are online. Majority of the projects are group assignements when they don't need to be. Assignments are graded by a TA that we have never met. This class could easily be an online 8 week course. Quizes might get you.,0
Richard Allen is not a super easy A at all but his tests are very straight forward. I went to class 0 times but watched the lectures and never struggled on an exam,1
"Even though it was very intensive because over the summer(only 11 classes),i got a good understanding of the material.However,we had quizes on every chapter plus 2exams and final.At least he was speaking loudly and slowly so it was easy to understand him.We solved a lot of problems from the book in class that helped a lot!I recommend this teacher!",1
THANKS,1
Avoid like the plague,0
She was horrible. Took her as my first class and there was absolutely no remorse for me as someone new to college and the hybrid format. She took the class way too seriously considering it's a required class and rather pointless in the age of the internet.,0
This course has been the most difficult class Ive ever taken However max is funny and caring prof even though he doesnt look it The labs in this course were BRUTAL and the midterm was equally bad(46% Ave after curve) the exams need to be more fair he should also consider gives us a heads up on what is explicitly gonna be tested.,0
He never uses the chalk board  and never have any helpful exercises. He don't give direct answers and if you ask him for help he tells us to go to the SI student help which: I feel should be the teacher. He is very forgetful and act as if nothing is wrong. He can speak spanish fluently but is not a good teacher.,0
I hated this class I wish I dropped it.,0
I can honestly say that Coach Martin is my favorite teacher at ISU thus far. He's a genuine man who cares about his students. He will also have your name learned within the first two weeks! He's awesome! I highly recommend him!,1
"She really knows her stuff. She's nice but be prepared to do the assignments on time. She asks questions to make you think. Project is not hard, just show you learned from it and you'll get an A.  Gives study guide for tests but they are just concepts so you have to read up. Gives some extra credit when you need it.",1
"She gets confused more than a Math Teacher should. She's had to correct my quiz grade numerous times and I don't know why. She'll grade it a 4/10, ask her why I got that grade, and she'll correct it to a 9/10, which really urks me. I'm glad I already know what I'm doing without her teaching me.",0
Joe wasn't very helpful throughout the class.  Also his test were very hard.  I wouldn't recommend him to anyone.,0
"This class is thought by 3 different professors. Her section is by far the most difficult. She seems to be really passionate about hip hop, black women, and feminism.   The other 2 professors were easy to understand, to the point, and actually made sense when relating back to the main subject of the class.",0
"From experience, I highly suggest taking someone else. Eileen is very rude and humiliating to her students in class. It's happened various times during the term I took it. She doesn't know what she's doing half the time and she doesn't help you, she insults you when you don't know something. Shame MDC doesn't have another Opera Works. professor.",0
"I love Miranda, but there are some things to take note of before taking her class. She has the attention span of a gnat, and having ADHD, it's really hard to pay attention to the class when she herself, cannot pay attention. Also for her assignments (at least in COMM-522) she has left us VERY unclear on what to do. She's hilarious and caring though",1
"Dr. Hwang is not the greatest professor. He speaks very broken English and is condescending towards many students because their beliefs differ from his. He spends most of the time lecturing about material that is not even on his tests. I would show up though, he sometimes gives extra credit to those who show up.",0
"I struggled a lot with this class in the beginning, but she was ready and willing to help me, and it made a HUGE difference. I really enjoyed the class, and I really enjoyed having her as a teacher. The class is not easy, but if you ask questions, and go and visit her in her office, it will pay off BIG TIME!!! Highly recommend if you want to learn.",1
"very cool, very helpful",1
Seems kind of full of himself.  Assignments are sometimes dull unless you happen to be interested in what he thinks is interesting.,0
Super boring classes but they always ended early. Three super easy essays and an extra credit essay. Hes not very nice but an easy grader,0
"WORST PROFESSOR EVER! she literally does not answer her EMAILS! she is a communication professor yet her inability to get back to you with attitude is unacceptable. Her workload is insane she acts like her class is the only one, meanwhile there is other courses. too much for a 200 level class .",0
"This is my second class with Crocoll and he is the best professor for those of us who don't have a strong suit in Math. His lectures really do prepare you for the exams and quizzes, making a difficult subject not so daunting. 5 exams (lowest dropped,) and 17 quizzes (lowest 2 dropped,) and offers 25-40 extra credit points. No homework.",1
SHE IS THE WORSE TEACHER EVER. SHE WANT YOU TO MEMORIZE EVERYTHING ABOUT SPAIN FROM MAPS TO KINGS! I MEAN YOU HAVE TO MEMORIXE THE WHOLE BOOKS. SHE GIVES HARDDD TESTS AND WANT YOU TO BE REALLY SPECIFIC ON EVERYTHING. SHE IS REALLLYYYY HARD. DONT TAKE CLASSES WITH HER NEVER EVER!,0
"Not a professor to take a class from - she does not teach, so much as read to you from the book. An internet course would be better than this - no in class benefit. Tests are not made by her - downloaded from somewhere... Nice lady, but NOT a teacher.",0
"Hard to understand at times, my main problem was the lack of grading.",0
"Like other negative reviews, he does give pop quizzes and is a bit rude, however Lab class is Lab and his lecture doesn't really matter as you need to memorize the lab lists and models for the exams. Hes pretty much there for any extra info you need but 99% of Lab is just memorizing the lists and models",0
"I would have done better in her class if it wasnt because of corona, but nonetheless I would likely avoid her classes in future. Shes very lecture heavy, wants classroom discussion but doesnt often facilitate it well. She gives good feedback on papers and is a reasonable grader, but her participation expectations are hard to keep up with.",0
"I love Dr. Watts! Her english class was so much fun. Rather than a basic lecture Dr. Watts really cares about your opinion and what you have to say. Participation makes the class better. She's really fun and you grade is three essays and four short responses, all very easy. You can also write about topic you're interested in which is wonderful!",1
"Miracle is the worst professor I have ever had. I can't believe he is still even allowed to teach at a major university like the U. Honestly I took AP Calc AB and he made me MORE confused on material I already knew. Easy material, though. Tests are straightforward and easy as expected. You learn EVERYTHING in discussion, so go to those.",0
"Literally worked so hard on an essay worth 30%, wish I took the F and got an extra couple hours of sleep. Worst TA.",0
"Caseys main problem is that he is not helpful at all. His practice tests and the homework are nothing like the tests. When his tests are worth 55% of your grade this sets students up for failure. If you bomb the first test, plan on having a D in the class the whole semester even if you do well on the second test and get a 100% on the homework.",0
"I have taken Dr. Collins for two courses and really enjoyed her. If you take her in person she gives you the opportunity to earn extra credit for coming to the board and solving a problem (doesn't have to be correct)! She does give homework in some courses, but it's graded on effort. If you do the study guides you should pass the test.",1
Prof Vendetti is the sweetest! All the quizzes are in group and she gives credit for trying. Took her during the winter and it was not stressful at all. Homework and tests are easy if you pay attention during the lectures.,1
"Professor Keith-Serafy is awesome!  She works hard to make sure that everyone understands the topics she goes over in class.  Her notes from lecture are what she uses to create her tests, so you always have a very clear picture of what you need to study.  She wants everyone to succeed and genuinely cares about her class and her students.  A+++",1
"He is hard to understand during class, doesn't bother to change the size of the screen to see his code. (if you sit far back enough), It's not easy to follow his lecture, most students aren't even engaged during class time. I would avoid this professor if given a chance, however he is nice on giving back points if you ask",0
"He is up front with the grading and you know how you will be graded. I received a 90, 98, and a 100 on the three tests and I missed two homeworks and I still received a B in his class. His homeworks are weighted so much but are so easy. Given my test scores I should have gotten an A. He doesn't teach well either. Avoid his class if you can.",0
"One of the best teachers I've ever had.  For 5 weeks class, there are 4 tests and book report (u don't need to read the book, even he said so). Tests come from lectures. If ur high school student and need to take STAAR, i recommend doing the practice tests. U probably saw this at least 25 times, but his lectures  are stunning and electrifying!! ;D",1
"I would not take her class. Worst teacher I have had by far, gives no direction what so ever and is not clear on anything. And she kicks so many people out of the class. DO NOT TAKE.",0
not alot og good to say about this class. Alot of busy work that requires too much time for a gen ed class. She openly embarrasses students that give wrong answers. Takes forever to grade assignments. you have about 12 assignments in progress at once very confusing. Poor time management. the only positive thing is if you do the work you will dook,0
Taking classes her was the best decision of my college life so far. I walked into her class knowing I was going to fail. She taught me to FAIL FORWARD. She is so loving and caring. She is committed to helping each student succeed. After taking several weeks of class I was able to see the only way I would fail her class was if I didn't try.,1
Not clear when explaining. Assigns redundant code modifications (that are nearly impossible to read) for nearly all the assignments. Grades more ruthlessly after drop date. Extremely picky when checking homework; don't expect much partial credit.,0
Freedman is great! He is interesting and passionate about what he teaches. Supportive of students and fair with grades,1
"One of the worst at GV. She's very smart and knowledgeable, but she has no clue how to teach. She goes over everything once and expects you to master it. The tests are hard and there is little time to write the paper. She laughed in my face once when I asked a question. She made SPSS more confusing than it actually is. 1/5th of my class dropped out",0
This Professor was probably one of the most confusing and hard to read professors I have endured. She teaches a four hour class that can easily be taught in an hour and fifteen minutes. Only use her if there is no other open class.,0
"Good man, very nice, but shouldn't be teaching anymore. First quiz was very easy, midterm was very hard due to poorly worded questions. Second quiz should have been easy but like his previous exams there were mistakes riddled throughout. Average for the class rn is maybe around a 50 (you can see everyones grade).S/U-covid is saving my GPA luckily.",0
clearly he is writing his own feedback on here. sitting in front won't help. going to innovation lab or slc was only way I could understand it. not helpful. kept saying right... like everyone one understood what he head just said and the room sat there confused and shaking heads as he kept talking... get ready to hear him talk nonstop...,0
Professor Reynolds grading is very tough!,0
"Mr Lopez is a good instructor, he is pretty clear on what he wants. The quizes are pretty easy straight from the book. The test are straight forward. Never missed a class with him because he makes it pretty interesting. ",1
"A challenging class,but for the thoughtful student, a life changing class.",1
Arguably one of my favorite professors! Participation does count towards your grade so make sure you're in class. His exams are really easy if you study the material he gives you as well as the textbook. He made ANT 2750 such a fun and exciting class. If you need to take this class- DO IT WITH HIM!!,1
"Listen. This professor has a decent enough rating on here, so maybe he used to be better; however, whatever he is doing now is NOT WORKING. There are about 10 students in the class left because everyone has already dropped. He's disorganized, forgetful, and will actually make you feel like an idiot in front of everyone for asking questions. AVOID!!",0
Very difficult for Sociology One.  Gives 6 papers and weekly readings that are more than 60 pages long.  On top of that gives assignments and visit to museum and have to write on those as well.  The readings consume you along with the papers for a level one course.  I would not recommend this teacher,0
The worst professor ever :(. please don't take her class I had no choice but take her class because when I register for class all the teacher info was TBD. I got so much stress just thinking about going to her class. she doesn't give you enough direction to perform any experiment and she is awfully sarcastic at everything.,0
Tanya Robertson is a tough grader Ive heard her say many times that a C is if you follow all the directions perfectly. A B is for a student that went way above and beyond. And an A is reserved for a paper that truly blows her away... suffice to say I never got an A and I havent heard of anyone else getting an A on any essays in her class.,0
It is really hard to understand him. He does't say seam allowances and other info while doing the demo. hard grader and you don't get to hear why you received that grade.,0
Professor Palomar really wants you to succeed. She's always willing to help and will answer questions you have during exams. It's more important to her that you learn the language and actually take something away from the class vs. giving you a strict letter grade,1
All tests are online.  He drops the lowest test so if you do good on the first 6 then you don't have to take the last or go to class.,1
I love Dave Dusseau and would take this class over again with him a million times. Take it. He's an incredible prof.,1
"You really have to work for this class. Don't be fooled by the course's content, it's pretty hard. I had a 70 in the class at first but then i bounced back to an A. Turns out her notes are CRUCIAL (TAKE NOTES!) as sometimes she tests you on problems that are not on sapling. Take the time to redo the notes questions and the sapling questions.",1
"Tests are a few long answer questions, but VERY broad. She expects you to be an absolute expert in the subject matter, even though her notes are useless. The question may seem straightforward but it's not. In lecture she normally just rants about her experiences with plants and how amazing plants are to her. Go to the review sessions! Good luck lol",0
"Bridges almost every lecture gets off track with different topics. which makes lectures a little confusing sometimes. She tends to make a lot of arithmetic mistakes, however her tests are fairly easy. She gives written homework as well as webassign homework.",0
"Hillarious guy, just a lot of on-line homework",1
Has an amazing and unique way of teaching. Lectures are awsome because he uses videos to connect with topics. And he gives you readings for the class on pdf which is helpfull. Definitely a professor to take a class with.,1
"Alex is the best TA at Pitt. Comes to recitation with a perfectly planned course that covers exactly what is going to be on the quiz. She is right to the point on how to complete the questions, and gives you clear guided steps on how to solve any problem. She also hosts pre-test study sessions all day the day before. Super helpful.",1
"Even though you complete all the hws and goto every single class, you receive no grade if you don't participate. :/Most of the people in my class are extremely confused and DO NOT understand what he is saying. This professor makes everything difficult and confusing. Don't ever take his class...",0
"This class met once a week for about 3 hours or so. He spent each time playing music while talking over it trying to describe which genre the music belongs to but Its incredibly hard to memorize which genre a song aligns to when he talks over it the whole time. Some of his teachings are outdated and when you try to correct him, he gets mad",0
"This is the worst teacher I have ever had. He does not provide handouts, he is full of himself and if you ask questions he tells you to read the book. He is lazy in his teaching and does not care about his students, only about his new house in EDH. Needs to teach to be a teacher not a money collecting job holder.",0
She acts like this course is the most important course of your life. She is very rude to students and yells at you if you try to leave early. She definitely has a superiority complex and took this job so she could bully students who need her class. She gets even worse after the drop date passes. She knows were stuck with her So she makes it hell,0
terrible because he focuses on side stories and not actual content,0
"There is no textbook needed and a lot of short readings.  Three exams with option of 1 exam being an essay which can be turned in several times to improve grade.  Hardest part is 5 question, 5 minute weekly quizzed due to the time part of it.  Be prepared to read for sure.  Very fair grader and truly wants you to be better at analyzing literature",1
The typical class period is spent in the dark listening to him read off slideshows (usually 60+ slides a piece) while he tries to make things interesting by talking about his own life. The in class assignments are labs that he does not input into the gradebook or even look at. The grades are made up of the various chapter tests.,0
"I would go to his class once a week out of two days, and when I did go, I sat in the back on the internet the whole time. He rambles on and on about whatever. His tests come straight from his PowerPoints which he posts online. My grade could have been higher if I would have put forth a little more effort. He will talk to you about the tests.",1
"I took professor Aguilar my spring semester for 1302 and I would not reccomend to take her. She gets distracted very easily and gives assignments that are six pages long, sometimes more. She does set the boundaries straight from the beggining of the course and she will not take late work.",0
"Great teacher, as long as you have the notes and study for the tests you'll do great. And the paper topics aren't difficult either.",1
"DONT TAKE HER, SHE IS NOT EASY AT ALL, AND NOT HELPFUL, SHE DONT EVEN HAVE OFFICE HOURS TO EXPLAIN THE MATERIAL OK. RUN 4 UR GRADE she is boring, not fair with grading, and the exams are tricky as hell. basically you got to study on your own cuz wateva she says in class is not helpful at all",0
I loved Mr. Tamm's class.  He was a great teacher and a very smart person. He is young so it almost as though he is one of the guys. For the class we took 4 test and a 4 page essay due at the end of the term. I would highly recommend his class. In fact I'm currently looking for another class he teaches to take next semester.,1
"The experiments are quite interesting and I enjoyed working on them.  However, if you encounter some sort of issue, Prof Ho will be of ZERO help to you.  I dont think he spoke more than three times the entire semester.  Youll have fun working on his required 50 page lab reports - any less and he wont even consider giving you a grade above 80.",0
I took her Intro Psych class ad it was honestly very easy for me. Just take plenty of notes and memorize key items. ,1
Easy class but you are 100% on your own. She never responded to any of my emails or phone calls. I even emailed the administrator trying to get ahold of her. She sets up her online class with automatic test results and does nothing else.,0
Her personality is just like her last name );( No sense of humor; no personality. Lectures were long and unclear; exams were ambiguous.  Unwarned  quizzes; no curve; no extra credit; tough grader. DO NOT TAKE HER! Avoid as all cost.,0
The lectures were great and he constantly made sure that everyone understood the material. No textbook is needed but you will need to pay for a program that provides access to the homework. Very easy to contact via email if having issues understanding the material or using the homework website. The study guides for each test are very thorough.,1
"Be ready to get outside help from tutors, SI, or other classmates from the beginning of the class. There are homework problems. Do them before class he lectures about them! This is a class that you have to stay on top of. He doesn't really explain the example problems in class.",0
"Holly is not even a professor. If you wish to waste all your school fee, go ahead. I haven't learn anything from her. She only cares about white people and extremely loves talking about herself which is waste of time and doesn't even teach a thing and gives unclear instructions with ridiculous feed back and you will end up with full of regrets.",0
"Not much homework, Only an article or textbook chapter(he selections portions of each textbook chapter for you to read to save time). He talks a lot during lecture but you learn valuable info each class. Grade is heavily influenced by final project(40%). For each case study article there will usually be a quiz the following class",1
Avoid at all costs. She is completely unclear and unhelpful. Her tests and HW are unfair and never returned on time. She also shows up late to every class.,0
"Do not take this Professor! She is terrible at communicating and, even as an expert in her field of Islam and Politics, is incredibly close-minded. She does not use the textbooks consistently and assigns online readings. In class, she asks specific, unimportant questions on the readings that you will not remember. she cares about her students tho.",0
"Really good professor who takes his time to explain anything youre struggling with. He tries to make time for group work, and is available outside of class times for additional help if needed. Can be pretty picky about notation on turned in assignments but nothing that cant be fixed. Gave worksheets before tests which were very helpful as well.",1
Took Veksler for her Honors class on interpersonal conflict and it was easily one of the best classes I've taken thus far. Actually made me wish I was a comm major so I could have her again,1
I have never met a more self-absorbed professor in my life. He believes his way of teaching is the best despite the high fail rate of his classes caused by nobody being able to understand his lectures. Your only hope of passing this class is to study on your own time from the study guide and recommended questions. Don't even bother going to class.,0
"This is one of the best professors I had in my MBA program. He was able to convert the whole class into a team whose members would help each other and think ""out of the box."" Students can get a lot out of the time invested in the class. Professor James supports his students in any possible way and gives multiple opportunities to get a good grade.",1
Hardest course I've ever taken!!!,1
"Best Chem professors Ive had here at WPU! Dr Xing expects a lot from her students. Lecture is fast and she gives lots hw, but it's there to help you, so DO IT! Exams are tough if you dont know material so be prepared to study & practice. Unlike most professor and you'll actually learn from her! If you need Organic TAKE HER for 1&2, you'll thank me!",1
"Took his online class. The material was barely covered and discussed, and the comments he'd leave on worksheets were rude and patronizing. I learned more from searching on Google than I did from his class. Sometimes the way of solving or formatting a problem that he'd explain would get me docked points as being wrong. Avoid this teacher.",0
"I had no idea about astronomy before this class. I have come to find that my perspective on the universe and reality was incredibly flawed. This class was great and you will learn a bunch of cool stuff from a guy who really knows his sh**, he works for NASA for God sakes! He wears the coolest(nerdiest) shirts abd hes very approachable. Take it!",1
"Wasn't a fan of the class, she did not seem to care for many people had her select favorites, not a good class for a Caucasian male(history of urban america) class was very anti white",0
"Mr. Koehler is a very respectful teacher. I took this class online and it was a breeze. I recommend taking it online, overall do take this professor. You will not regret taking him.",1
"She assigns SOOOO many things throughout the semester, doesn't explain how she wants it done, and then takes points off when you do it wrong, even if it's just the ""draft."" I've never had a professor give this many assignments. I really can't stand her class and can't wait for the semester to be over. If you can avoid taking her, then do so.",0
"Super easy one credit class if you are missing credits, super nice and brings food here and there!",1
"His lecturing isn't the worst, but he makes you fill in blanks and you have to add textboxes when you could be paying attention to his lecture. He tests on very specific and arbitrary details and the marking scheme is unnecessarily rigid (good luck reading his mind when there's five missing words in a row for fill in the blanks).",0
"This is what college should be. Lectures are challenging and policies are straightforward. Emails his notes - study those, pay attention in class (legendary lectures), and you'll be fine on the final (the only assignment)  essay questions that he gives 1-2 weeks in advance. He is brilliant. He is hilarious. Maybe my all-time favorite professor.",1
"Her projects were really fun and interesting.  she is hard on crafstmanship.  she is really nice and friendly.  tough to understand at times.  contradictory in critiques sometimes.  she grades tough, almost impossible to get an A.  it's possible but very difficult.",0
Dr. Walling is a great professor and a good man as a person. I got very sick last spring and he worked with me and gave me enough time to catch up. He was very encouraging and caring for my situation and made sure I do not drop the class. There is room for extra credit. You still need to work hard. I am having him again this fall for ANTH 112.,1
if you think your gonna go in this class and take exams on Jazz History your not.  All 5 of your exams will be on distinguishing what type of jazz you are listening to. not easy because in class ALL he talks about is the history which is not on exam. So u teach yourself from vids on blackboard! If your not a music major avoid! Extra cred impossible,0
The class was a hybrid and anyone who has taken one knows how difficult and stressful they can be. Brooke worked with me to not only understand the work in a way that I can retain it but to keep me engaged and active in the learning process. the work was made easy after her lessons and I probably would've ended up with a 37% if not for her.,1
"Cool, down-to-earth guy. Very helpful with material and more (he will answer other questions too!). Also is on Facebook, and actively participates in student groups/forums. Posts funny comments during our exams for us to see after.",1
"Nice guy but good luck learning anything from him. I've done well in Calc I and II so general physics should be nothing, right? Almost too simple if you're a science major and his explanations and ways of doing things are so convoluted and hard to follow it makes getting anything out of it difficult.",0
"I really like the Professor and appreciate that he accepts late work but I am absolutely drowning in work for this class. There are 2 discussions, a bunch of notes that each have hour videos (usually 5 videos), bunch of quizzes, and practice work that is still graded every week. He has 4 tests that are open note but don't give a lot of time to do.",1
"if yall can read this , yall must hurry to sign up his class cuz his classes sold out quick. he gives us lots of extra credits.",1
"Professor Peterson is so far the worst experience I had as a student. She is extremely condescending, rude, and passive aggressive. If she has any redeeming qualities they are all drowned out by her disgusting personality. I would not recommend any of her classes to anyone.",0
MY BOI SOKCHEAAAAA. LOVE THIS DUDE,1
"Took Business Calc summer class and she was a terrible teacher. Didnt care if you understood the material or not, she just had her agenda. When students asked questions she answered in a way that put them down and that made students afraid to ask questions if they didnt understand a problem. Overall she was not good and strict grader.",0
"I've never written a review but I have to for him. He is by far the worst professor I've ever had. Rude, doesn't help students, and consistently insults and makes you feel terrible if you don't know the answer. He said that if you need help to ask questions and when you do he insults you and tells you that you aren't studying enough. Don't take! ",0
"This was an easy class. Public speaking is hard to do in general, but he was straight forward. Show up  follow the instructions and you'll do great.",1
This instructor is really great. She takes the time to explain the problems. She gives extra credit every class. I can really appreciate this instructor compaired to my other instructors.,1
"Literally the best teacher I have had. Supported me through class and beyond. Is passionate about both learning and teaching how biology can cure some of the most difficult health problems. Her class is designed so that you can learn which ever way is easiest for you, tests are fair yet tough, and you have chances to recover from a poor grade.",1
This professor truly helped me get through my freshman year.  He gave me great resources and made the transition from home to school great!  I enjoyed meeting great peers in this class and getting to do many group assignments (in class) so that I could learn about working with other people.  I appreciated Mr. Jensen for being a great professor.,1
"Wisla is a nice professor, but he is incredibly awkward. His tests and homeworks are pretty tough and he gives no reason as to why he takes off random points. I worked very hard in this class, but the tests blindsided me every time.",1
Had the worst experience with this Professor. Had a family emergency but he did not care whatsoever and would not reply to my emails. He will make your life harder than it should be. Lots of work and hes very extra.,0
"Took over the summer. Did not learn anything from lecture, learned every the material on my own, but attendance was required. Spends too much time on a problem when stuck, and shows that he did not review materials before lecturing. Lab was a mess, did not explain the procedure or setup, and left us 10mins to do the lab at the end.",0
"Mary is a great teacher, this is my third class with her, and just registered for my fourth and final class before graduation.  She makes every topic something interesting and really engages the class in all aspects of the topic.",1
"Mckean is a good teacher, he does try to help his students out. hes pretty crtical on assignments but he wants his students to succeed.",1
I really don't like his class. Too much work for an introductory-level class. The final Essary requires you to find your own objects from 3000BC -1600AD (you need to secure the object when you are only halfway in the class). There are huge problems with the teaching style and hard to communicate. Doesn't care about his student. For online courses.,0
She was very nice but did not explain the material that well. At least one person in our class would end up crying out of frustration. I would not take her again.,0
"6 reflection papers (1 dropped), 2 in-class essay exams, and 1 research paper. An A is pretty difficult to achieve since the class is graded by such few things and Jason doesn't curve, but it's possible. Lots of reading, more than most classes, but manageable. TAs are helpful and participation matters in discussion sections. Class taught me a lot.",1
"I took this class to fulfill a requirement. Did not expect much. Not really interested in politics, but the class fit my schedule and I had heard good things. Glad I took the class. Gave me a whole new perspective on politics and really kept my interest. I really liked all the current articles he sent students to illustrate course material",1
DON'T TAKE HIS CLASS OF COMS3001!,0
She was a great professor. Very open to helping and made the class extremely interesting. Fell behind a little in 101 and had to use 102 to catch up but she really helped with that. Lots of improvement over the year. Ended up loving her and the class.,1
"I really liked Prasad but I gave her a 3 because she doesn't explain directions, the tests and reviews are nothing alike, and before tests, she has students teach the test materials. The problem with that is half of the students don't care about teaching the materials so you don't effectively learn them. She's pretty good, but maybe not the best",1
"Creed is very smart, but don't take this class if you want to be an unbiased, thoughtful political scientist. As was mentioned, the readings are very heavy, but they are all aligned with his political beliefs, and he will berate anyone who does not agree... And he quite literally made up midterm grades (I have written 10 papers, 3 have been read).",0
"Professor Shields is great fun to talk to and listen to.  He is perhaps just a too laid back. I feel that making the textbook reading option was a real missed opportunity as the book is full of amazing info.  I would like to see his genre class go into a bit more detail from the book. Because of the laidback style, it was tough to prepare for tests",1
"Very very hard! Try to avoid her econ 490 class! Her 300 classes are fine, but 490 is totally a nightmare!",0
"Soh is a great teacher. She really knows what she is doing. I learned so much from her this semester. While there is so many things to do for her class, so stressful at times, her energy, humor, and personality make things easier. All assessments are kinda overwhelming at the beginning, she teaches well and makes you feel confident about them.",1
Professor Hayes is a excellent instructor because I was able to take the knowledge I acquired in class and  integrate it into my day to day life.,1
Great class! The classes are always fun and you'll make an A just by showing up and participating. No homework but short readings and remembering lines. Take this class for your Art requirement! Your class become like family.,1
"This teacher is not to bad. He has industrial experience and uses these for examples for the material out of the book. I really was looking forward to more than 3 Labs and hands-on but Marvin mostly focused on the textbooks. It took him forever to grade assignment and he never gave feedback what was not done right. Overall, a good instructor.",1
"the class is not that hard , he is good professor as well  he is an comedian person for real :)   best in CE ",1
"He has a great personality, hes hilarious. But when it comes down to teaching, he just isnt good at it. It felt like I had to teach myself, he goes too fast in lectures and really isnt clear on things. Dont bother emailing him because he takes too long to answer them.",0
"Dr. Rizkalla is a brilliant man, but his lectures tend to be extremely dense, fast paced and disorganized. If you can take notes very quickly and have a knack for memorizing pages of equations you'll be fine.  The class tends to fall into an evenly distributed ""binary distribution"" of A's and F's on exams. The book is absolutely worthless.",0
This professor is not helpful at all. All he does is just send notes and homework without explaining any concepts. Do not risk taking any class with him. Take it at your own risk :(,0
"THIS PROFESSOR IS HORRIBLE. She grades horribly and failed me on a paper because I chose a prompt that other students chose. She teaches the exact same things over and over but will count you off on papers and discussions if you bring them up in your own work. I do not recommend her at all. Yes, she's sweet, but she's a horrible professor.",0
Knows his stuff. As long as you show up and give an effort you'll pass. Easy A course. Highly recommend. If I could I would definitely take again,1
"I took this class for credit and ended up just absolutely loving it. Melissa is a real treat, she's a very respectful instructor with the greatest feedback. We had two students who had been very shy at the beginning of the semester and ended up becoming some of the best speakers.",1
"She lets it be known from the beginning that it's a TOUGH course! There's too much material to be covered in 10 weeks. She has extensive knowledge and compassion about this subject. Her lectures were very clear. However, due to the amount of material the tests were somewhat difficult. I struggled on short answers while others struggled on M.C",1
Boring guy. FREAKS out over phones and laptops for some odd reason. Doesn't even let you take a picture of the lecture notes even though he skips through the slides with lightening speed. Attendance is mandatory so you can stare at him just talk. Unreasonable.,0
"Freaking awesome.  Took a hard subject and made it interesting and fun.  Homework assignments can be gruelingly difficult at times, but he and his TAs hold plenty of office hours.  Well-written tests - if you know what you're doing, you'll be fine, but if you don't, you'll get your butt kicked.  Gives lots of extra credit.",1
"Warning: Attendance is not required, but you will do very poorly in this class if you are not there for lecture. The books were lowkey useless. Everything you need to know is from the lecture. I mean, he seemed nice enough, but really awkward. My gripe was that he didn't seem very engaging and required FOUR books for this one elective class.",0
I've taken so many classes and I am taking him online right now. He is extremely hard and I would not take him again. He mentions rate my professor and about his reviews on here in class.,1
"VERY RUDE, Does not speak clear (very heavy Russian accent). She always follows her OLD EDITION book. Book is EXPENSIVE!!!",0
"Absolutely loved her! Took her for 111 and 112 and the labs, and she was great. If you did poorly in her class, it was by no fault of hers! She gives you everything you need and more! Great professor and I actually wrote to the Dean requesting that she be allowed to teach 113 as well!",1
"If you can get past the language barrier, this guy is great for DE.   His tests come straight from homework, he grades incredibly easy, and you can bring ""cheat sheets"" with you to the test.   Plus, he's a pretty cool guy.  Highly recommended.",1
"The course is not hard at all, as long as you show up to class.",1
"Everything is online so the people giving Crumpler bad reviews haven't actually had a bad professor. Out of all the ones in the chemistry department, this is the only teacher that cares. You don't know what you have until it's gone. He will almost never fail someone as long as they try. That's something to respect about him, and something to adore",1
Five-star professor! Impossible to fell asleep during his amazing and funny lecture. I would suggest you to do your best on essay or you will fail. I would recommended you to take his class if you are unsure. Good luck!,1
"Cone really knows what he is talking about. The class is super lecture heavy so you need to show up to class and be able to type fast. He keeps the class interesting and will answer any questions you have. If you study for the test, show up to class, and read the textbook sections he assigns you will do fine. I would definitely take him again.",1
"Unbeleivalbe how he can be a teacher. Absolutely incomprehensible lectures. He likes to make the students feel stupid when they ask questions. The guy has to realize that we're there to learn the subject; that's why we're asking questions. Never in my life had I been subject to a more useless, confusing-for-the-sake-of-cunfusing teacher in my life.",0
"I've never failed a course until I took this class. I know at least 6 others who failed, and not for lack of trying either. Early in the term I expressed concern for my grade, and he just told me to drop the class, pick another major. He grades tests and essays on an unbelievably hard scale.  I no longer even want to major in psychology.",0
"Solid professor, fair grader, and always willing to go through the complex proofs.",1
Great class. Loved attending and the homework pushed you but was manageable. Super clear expectations and engaging.,1
"Seems like a great guy, teaches a very easy class. Not much material, can learn everything in a day or two. Exams were very simple, basically just use the formulas he gives you.",1
"I am taking her now for an online class, I am regretting not dropping out. Some of her assignments are okay; but honestly it just seems like a lot of poorly organized busy work. I really discourage people from taking this class unless you have no other option.",0
"I took this professor a year ago, but felt the urge to inform incoming students because of how terrible this professor is. I ended up dropping his course after 2 exams because I was failing and he would not help me if I had questions. I ended up taking Chem 1 and passed with an A, yet intro is supposed to introduce you to chem. TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!",0
"Exactly what the person before me said, he's a fantastic teacher!",1
This Prof is definitely by far one of my most favorite professors at Valencia and UCF. He does a great job teaching Organic Chem I and he makes you work for the grade. I would hands down take another class with him!,1
After taking this class I realized how important it is to check this website before picking a teacher. Funny how the opinion I formed of Ms.Bigler matched up perfectly with the above comments. I'm very interested in English but I don't appreciate her purposefully making the class feel stupid. Someone needs to let her know that she is unapproachable,0
"she talks too fast and speeds through her slides. I often answered her questions in class and went to her office and i still failed. She doesnt care about what you have going on outside of her class, and she doesnt like to help you. She allows 15 minutes per student in her office, and isnt even there half of the time. Avoid this professor!!!!",0
boring teacher. showed up to office hours and he was not much help at all. lectures are boring and its hard to stay awake especially if you have it in the morning,0
"Prof Pham is one of the best math teachers I've ever had. She lectures for one day then the second day of the week she designates to practice problems. She provides study guides with the exact/similar questions for tests. For labs, I recommend choosing THURS so you can do the lab beforehand and getting it checked off. She is very genuine and sweet.",1
"VERY unprepared - shows up a little late but the powerpoint he just reads off then has you do the example. The answer to it is not available online. Tells you to put everything in calculator in 1 go and wouldn't go over your work really. Homeworks are LONG, if you don't know how to use R, he don't either. Doesn't put in grades timely at all.",0
"Extremely rude (condescending) to students. I've had plenty of bad teachers, but her level of disrespect is far above any other. She reads off slides created by a TA & HW that is way beyond the scope of the course. Exams are long and confusing. Only thing she cares about are her stories (football talk) during the 1st 30mins. Don't take if possible.",0
"Maureen is a very hard marker! This course is a lot of work and participation counts! I suggest not skipping a single class and keeping up with the large amount of readings. If you want to do well, make sure you talk about feminism.. she will talk forever about that topic! Expect over three quarters of the class to drop this course by the end.",0
"Fran is one of the best teachers in the WORLLDD. I love her so much even though I am terrible at Chem and found the class to be challenging. Tip: her lectures are always more helpful than the book. Also best way to study for her exams are by doing practice problems (I learned this the hard way). Shes sooo CARINGGG almost like a mother :,)",1
"Without a doubt, Jenny is the most caring professor I have had at this university. She makes all students feel cared for. I would recommend that everyone take this course, regardless of your major. The lectures are engaging and applicable.",1
"He has a lot of knowledge but absolutely no structure to his lectures. Trying to take notes on his various tangents and hypotheticals is excruciating. (And you will absolutely be tested on it.) He seems open to helping students who ask and all the readings are provided. But overall, I would not take him again. I can't handle his style. ",0
"Vet Tech majors, beware. Dr. Woodard, while intelligent, has not a clue on how to teach. Consistently changes his mind about the material. Write down everything. He often veers off topic and rants about how students are not doing the work rather than teaching so that we can complete it. Will make you want to change majors. Just stick it out.",0
"Honestly, one of the worst professors i have taken at UCF. She has such a sassy attitude with people its ridiculous... Waking up at 7:30 to sit through her lectures, which mind you last 3 hours is not an example of a good teacher, especially when they teach us that lecturing in front of a group of children is not the most effective method.",0
if you are looking to take this class in the spring or any time in your life please dont. heres why This professor at first might appear nice and warm and funny but she is far from it. the aleks program she uses has no mercy when it comes to grading. take another professor. i spent 24+ hours on one hw which is far too much when u have others,0
"Without a doubt the worst professor I've had so far. Very poorly organized barely teaches anything and the group project is a mess. Any feedback you get back from her is confusing and unhelpful I don't think she even knows what she is looking for. Attendance is a significant part of your grade as well, which is frustrating because of how bad she is",0
I would not recommend taking this class with her. Tests are hard and you basically have to memorize the textbook to do well. Often includes questions on content in the textbook but never mentioned in class. The TA teaches additional material during the discussion rather than help you reinforce what you learned in lecture which was annoying.,0
"Dr. Keeling is a great professor! You can tell she cares a lot about the class and students. You're expected to buy about 20 children's books, and read a book, sometimes 2 every week, which need to be read to do the correlating journal entries. She assigns several outlines/papers thought the semester, but she clearly defines what she expects.",1
"I have never left feedback for a professor before but I decided to for this professor because she is a TOUGH grader. I mean she will comment and deduct points for everything!! Although she is quite helpful, and will reply quickly when you need her to, I wish I took the class with a different professor.",1
"I ended up having to drop this class. During the lectures he would continually get off topic and when I would ask a question, it wouldn't get answered properly. He would assign us 200-400 problems a week of online homework, which I was never able to complete, even after spending five days a week in the learning lab. I would not recommend taking him",0
"He keeps the lectures entertaining. Can't really say to much about his grading-- he uses TAs. Ended up with a C+ in the class, but I hate Shakespeare. So, don't take if you're not even remotely interested in the subject.",0
There is a lot of work in this class. He is understanding and is willing to work with you.,1
Poor lecturer. Only does textbook examples. Provides no guidance other than vague wishy-washy answers for precise project questions. Only redeeming quality was that course was relatively easy.,0
"This class was way harder than expected. The exams are really hard even though you get a cheat sheet. Class attendance isn't part of your grade but if you skip you'll miss a bunch of in class assignments and quizzes. He says he doesn't care if you come to class but he really does. The homework is pretty time consuming, and doesn't relate to exams.",0
This class is easy. you barely have to try on your assignments and you'll get an A. Def recommend her!,1
"Great lecturer, interesting life stories before class, has a lot of knowledge on policy and law and relates it to everyday life. You can catch up with podcasts which is super helpful if you commute. Readings are not too long compared to other Classes and if you do them and go to class its easy to do well. Test are fair. Super interesting material!",1
"Moves through material too quickly and will not pause for questions. If you have the courage to ask a question, be ready to be ridiculed for not understanding the concept. By far the worst teacher I've ever had. I made sure to take an onsite class so I would get the most bang for my buck, but I would go home and teach myself online anyway :(",0
"Easily my favorite prof I have ever had. Doesnt tolerate people not working, but clearly appreciates your hard work. Very clear on what he wants. Blackboard is layed out amazing, very explanatory. He is a stickler tho.",1
"My favorite professor at DePaul. Wonderful writer, very engaging and funny, gives amazing feedback. Took time out from her busy schedule to help me with a piece I was working on independently. Grades are hard to anticipate, but she does her best to let you know how you're doing until your final portfolio is graded. TAKE HER.",1
"So this class is pretty lecture heavy, if you are a solid note taker you will pass this class easily. We had a pop quiz on the third day of class, so write down pretty much everything he says. We also had HW on the second day of class, we had to read and answer 10 questions on Apology by Socrates (that was great). His shorthand sucks so make a key.",0
"The qusis are onlain, and also, she gives lot's of extra greed.",1
"These good reviews are a little to good when I first picked his class. I thought it was going to be easy since everyone else is saying he is. Sadly that's not the case, he has 3 exams (sure there open book) but I cant find any answers in the book or his PowerPoints. I would not take him unless you don't have another better choice.",0
"She is a reall practical person.. Extremly kind, fun, intelligent. Knows what she is talking about :) loved her",1
Hard grader and picky about sig figs. Quizzes come from pre lim questions especially hard math ones. Nice but stressed me out.,1
The guy doesn't teach whatsoever. He tells you he's on your side but that's a load of.... Instead of teaching you the material he talks about how bad professors are nowadays when hes the worst of them all. His exams are really hard and the fact that you have to teach yourself doesn't help.,0
"Took this online over the summer... It was extremely difficult without lecture, because the structure of class is to just do a ton of readings and then answer questions on Skype and write an essay about the readings (at the end of each week). It may work for some people, but I feel like I didn't learn that much or get a good grade.",0
"I normally wait until the end of the semester to write these but I just cant wait: this lady is way too picky. Ive gotten into it with her a few times bc of her unfair grading. She overcomplicates everything. Claims to not have gotten my emails, has yet to fix my attendance when I was in the hospital. She does too much. Condescending & boring.",0
"Dr. D is very friendly and caring. Her tests reflect the content well, and she incorporates lots of examples/related activities in the lectures. Very enthusiastic & quirky. But I also think she is a very average professor - not too extraordinary or mind-blowing.",1
Exploring Entrepreneurship it was!,1
"Kanetis's excitement and energy will show you how much he loves teaching philosophy. I didn't really enjoy this class as much as I thought I would, but having Kanetis as a professor really helped. The only thing that I didn't like was that his lectures lacked variety, meaning it was the same routine every day.",1
"Still uses moodle when we as students pay for D2L. Talks about himself like he is the the ""best."" The lectures are all over the place. He starts talking about one topic bounces around to another topic. Be prepared to be confused with his teaching methods very unorthodox.",0
Awsome Instructor while I was there.  Went through ROTC with him at the same time....easy class.,1
"I dreaded this class every day! The class was so unorganized and not very interesting at all. The tests were common sense and never opened the book. As long as you go to class you will do fine on the tests. Marty is very credible and has a lot of accolades, but the other professor I had, You Li, was nice but not a good teacher.",0
"Great guy, really helpful and nice. Down to earth. I wish i had him for ENG 105.",1
Not only in college but my entire life hes the worst teacher Ive ever had by far. He sets the class up like a videogame so no one knew what was going on most of the semester. You have to teach yourself through videos. He requires you to get an 80% or better to pass a test or its a 0 and you retake it. If you don't play his games you get nowhere.,0
"Would not take with him he is always off topic, we were 4 chapters behind where we should have been give easy questions for assignments and super hard ones for test. Doesn't explain things well. Would not take again with him",0
"She is very biased and if your opinions do not match hers she gives a lower paper grade. She is a really nice lady and does care. This was her first year, so hopefully she improves.",1
A fantastic teacher. Never would have dreamed Shakespeare could be made so interesting and accessible to me.,1
"What I liked most is the integration of cultural stories and personal experience that you cannot find in any textbook, that helped look at issues from a very, very different perspective. The only criticism is that this course covers too much. But I would recommend it to anyone interested in Islamic and Middle East studies.",1
Best prof.,1
"The topics of her classes are very interesting but I feel as if I had not learned anything at all. Her lectures are very disorganized, she expects you to read more or less about 00 pages before every class time, and she gives confusing and unclear answers to questions. If her classes are not mandatory, I strongly recommend that you not take them.",0
"I had a great experience with this professor. Especially during the pandemic, she went out of her way to help me achieve my goals. Would take her class again!",1
"Súper unorganized!! He says everything is online yet not even he can find his stuff on the folders he adds online. This class is NOT for people who are bad at math. He teaches as if everyone knew what he is talking about. He says homework is not mandatory but he will take it as extra credit. He won't. Also, he's never in his office or replies email",0
Worst online teacher. Im a 4.0 student and he grades DQs super hard.,0
"350 Characters aren't enough to describe how bad she is so I'll just list them: Homework after EVERY lecture (2-3+per week), does NOT explain things well at all, does not notify about homework well, hard to keep up during lecture, jumps all over the place when presenting powerpoints. Never have a class with her. 4 yrs of school and she's the worst",0
"Vincent is the best instructor that I have had at Baker. He gives great feedback plus additional information and links to help understand the material. He loves to teach and it shows. I highly recommend taking a course with him, you will not be disappointed.",1
"Pynn can be a bit intimidating. He expects students to have a philosophical perspective on everything, which makes discussions difficult. I can tell that he's a nice guy, but the work load and policies are a bit much. 3 absences are allowed, anything after that results in deduction of 1/2 letter grade. four 5-pg long papers, and 3 other papers.",0
"This class by far the worst class I have taken at Troy. There is no study guide and the information on the test is confusing. The instructor really does not take time out to help you in the course, my advice choose another instructor.",0
"Dr. Fontenot is a brilliant professor. He is very down to earth, and is willing to help if you come by his office. He's a tough essay grader. However, if you take good notes and participate, an A isn't impossible.",1
This professor is honestly the worst professor I've ever had. He is very unfair and won't even grade your tests accurately from the university's grading key. Take this professor if you want to be screwed out of not only the grade you deserve but also your hard earned money.,0
She is kind and prays for her students every day. It would be helpful if she actually taught the material. There is a pervasive feeling of frustration in the class and she ends the discussion if there are too many questions. I have an A but feel that I may need to retake the class from someone else so I actually learn the material.,0
"Best lady ever. I recommend everyone take her class. She was so amazing and caring and the class was a breeze. Minimal work and she helped us a lot, she really cared about our class and it was cool. Be nice to her cause she is nice to everyone no matter what. 20/10 recommendation.",1
Awesome teacher!The best online course ever.Mr.Narin and his TA respond to emails immediately.The textbook is very easy and clear.The online quizzes and tests were not timed and contained only material that just have been covered.You simply can't try hard and be dropped or fail this class. I higly recommend this class.,1
"I had the pleasure of taking Coach Milburn's Health 101 Summer 2018 I really enjoyed the course I learned much more than I expected to learn, Coach offers plenty of extra credit so there is no reason not to get your easy ""A"". I highly recommend this course Coach Milburn is the best!",1
"Rivas allows students to teach themselves, and the lectures were almost solely driven by the class. There's a TON of reading, and what little writing needs done is easy. Since Rivas doesn't direct the class, walking into his final is a bit of a nightmare: it covers the entire semester's reading and requires you to think like someone with a PhD.",0
"Doughty class is very boring. He dose not know when to hush up. His class work is quite simple. 4 papers,6 tests,etc..",1
Never take! I ended up withdrawing from her class because of her grading. I received all 0's on major assignments for small errors like a spelling mistake. Absolutely horrible,0
"The kindest professor, truly cares about her students learning and understanding concepts. What you learn from this class will help you tremendously in other classes where you have to write and research.",1
"I think she's the worst teacher at the J School for first-year students. I know she has good reviews for her upper-level courses, but it didn't go well when I had her for a 100-level class. She expects you to know things you haven't been taught yet. Her tests are also pretty difficult because she focuses on very obscure sections of the textbook.",0
Prof. Rico knows his stuff and is extremely intelligent but his lectures are hard to stay engaged. They are long and quite frankly uninteresting. Had to use the textbook to clarify sometimes but most content within the class is logic and not very difficult. Didnt do much studying and did well in the class.,1
I adore her! She is awesome! Respect her and she respects you. She is very helpful. Takes the time to explain and clarify the material. I wish more professors were like her.,1
"I liked the way he went over the homework in class. If anyone had trouble or had a question, he wrote it on the board & explained it. I also liked how he gave 4 tests during the semester & averaged them for the grade + points for homework. I think it's much easier than just one test at the end & you can see how you are doing before it's too late.",1
"Very professional and wonderful communication skills. Passionate in convictions and dressed smart, sophisticated and classy. I highly recommend this professor .",1
Tonya Warden is the most ridiculous professor I have ever had. I took her for English 1020 and she graded like it was a 4000 level course. If you make any grammatical errors she instantly turns a silly one page paper into a C. Would highly recommend avoiding her!!!,0
With having this pandemic going on I feel like this semester she did not care for her students. This class was extremely complicated with a lot of technical issues. I recommend taking this class with another professor.,0
"He lets you know the first day how hard and fast the course is. He really does want everyone to do succeed. He frequently checks his email to help students. He does give a lot of homework though, but it is helpful.",1
Stay as far away as you can from this class he is a nice guy but he flips the switch on you quickly if you miss an assignment. If you have no options then GROUP CHAT is all I can say and make sure you message each other so you dont miss an assignment,0
Great teacher. Made class fun and enjoyed it.,1
"He literally teaches from the book. There's no point in showing up to class, your best bet if you end up with this professor is finding someone who already took Calc II and have them help you with the class. Take someone else if you can help it.",0
Boring but good professor. He sends you the notes over everything on your email.,1
What are you all talking about? College classes are so hard and she finally gives us a class that is easy! You all just don't appreciate when a teacher cuts ya some slack! Quit hating!!!!,1
Paul Kirz is the BEST!,1
"I have never disliked an English class so much, and Im an English major! Mike doesnt like his students and obviously has some insecurity issues because he uses his job to make himself feel better. He has no clear grading criteria, asks for 3 papers a week, gives pop quizzes, and is flat out unprofessional and rude in his feedback. DO NOT TAKE HIM",0
I found this Prof ro be very helpful.  I enjoyed her classes.  She seems to care about the students but holds a high standard- I learned my stuff,1
"Research Methods in itself is a difficult class. Dr. Weston made it easier to grasp. There is a research proposal due at the end, but each week you work on a section of it along with some discussions and worksheets. If you spend the time you will be fine. There was also some extra credit at the end. I learned a lot and worked hard to get my grade.",1
"Linda is a very talented ceramics artist, she can be quite rude but I think that is just her nature, the assignments are fun though! If you attend class and do the work you should be fine, I would take it again even if I did not need to.",1
"One of the only times Ive enjoyed a gen ed class and it was all because of Kosnik. He doesnt read off slides like some people. He knows what hes talking about and knows how to teach it. He gets to and through the point quickly, so class is usually short but still effective.",1
"Takes all the math out of statistics, which has its positives and negatives. Weekly homework and various different assignments required. Tests are tough and require a large amount of critical thinking. Class can be painfully boring at times. Best part of the class is the textbook which Professor Velleman wrote himself. Easy textbook to read.",0
"Dr. Ferguson is a very nice man, however, his class has a lot of ""busywork."" There is a ton of reading required and his lectures are sometimes hard to follow.",1
I love RIT,0
She is an amazing professor. She is very helpful and her class was based on 4 quizzes and a written paper. She is also very sweet and in our final exam she bought us fiber bar :),1
She really doesn't know how to teach  and she gives you a bad grade even tho you work hard in her class sometimes she doesn't know what she talks about such a terrible teacher don't take her  ,0
"would literally open the slideshows and skip through almost all of the slides and go ""you probably know this"" like no we really dont plus i ended with a 79.5 and the dude basically told me if i had done better on a few quizzes i would have had the grade i wanted so he wouldnt bump me like yeah do you not understand how grades work? was concerning",0
Tons of papers to write and lots of reading too. Extremely boring class not fun at all. Doesn't take recommendations from students. Held a B grade in the class all semester and he ended up failing me because I missed more than 5 days,0
Don is hilarious. Keeps the class entertained and engaged through his humor and quality lectures.,1
Utterly incoherent. His lectures are a colossal waste of time - just review the slides on your own.,0
took a basic intro class with prof peters and made the drastic mistake of signing up for her 3 hour once per week class. She expected us to come to class having already read/outlined the chapter and know most of the information beforehand. we covered at least 1 chapter per class and the info was a lot at one sitting. not terrible but not great.,1
"He is a very nice man. Helps with proofreading papers more than any other professor I've ever had. As long as you participate in class, always come to class, and meet with him to discuss and revise your papers (3), you should do well.",1
"I took her for approaches to Literature. She is mean, unless you agree with her feminist agenda. I have to give her credit though, she was on a grading committe who changed my grade, so I give her a little credit for that.",0
"Fall 20 online; Good professor, fun but also gives out work so be prepared to work for your grade. Mainly discussion posts and reply to others. One project that involves a research paper but it's not hard. Not a hard grader. Quizzes and exams on pearson so you will have to purchase the code. Gives extra credit. Overall good and chill professor :)",1
"His English is very difficult to understand Lab and Lecture are totally not relevant Youtube video, link on lectures are useless Regret going to KPU because of his class",0
I absolutely hated this class. He really cannot teach and he is the worst professor I have ever taken. Assigned so many hw and it is not even on the test. Such a crappy class.,0
Completely does not teach. Unless you have teaching assistant you must teach yourself. head in the clouds. Makes things more complicated that needs to be. Very nice though.,0
"please avoid this prof, one of the worst professor i ever had",0
Didn't use the textbook for the class but the way she explains stuff without really explaining stuff makes a textbook necessary. The homework is impossible because she doesn't teach half the stuff we need to do it and when I asked her when are we going over this or that concept in class that we need on hw she says we have to learn it on our own.,0
"WORST DAMN TEACHER EVER!
 Not only can she not stay focused during class, she needs to ask for a copy of the syllabus just to see when her own assignments are due.
 
 Worst of all she is just a mean lady.",0
THIS INSTRUCTOR LOVES TO FAIL STUDENTS! His temperament is not suitable for teaching a introductory painting class. Their grading scale and attendance policy is very strict. This instructor ruined my GPA. THEY TALK ABOUT FAILING STUDENTS IN CLASS!,0
"Not recommended for online courses. Answers emails quickly but doesn't read them carefully to answer your question. Relies heavily on the textbook and the included online homework, but doesn't answer questions using those concepts. The final has less than 20 questions, all absolute mastery level.",1
"Very rude and unhelpful via email, though I suppose that is because it is an online class and she does not want to be bothered with helping students. I sincerely hope that she isn't this unapproachable and rude to all of her classes.",0
"David, overall is a pretty nice professor. However, his teaching style is VERY outdated. You take tons of notes everyday and expects you to know the information based on the textbook&homework. Homework isn't graded but DO THEM, EVERYTHING YOU WILL LEARN WILL BE BASED OFF THE TEXTBOOK. He makes mistakes so please POINT IT OUT to him. Also DONT SKIP.",1
"oH mY gOd! One of the worst pro. ever ever known. If I have to describe about Chef Haze' class: boring, boring, and super boring. Does he know how to teach? Do homework at home and take quiz online. No choice for hospitality students to have a wonderful chair who is super un-organize and lazy. Dont take this ""hero"" otherwise you gonna cry out loud.",0
"I took geography online with him and I loved the way he had his online class set up. There was a chapter due each week and for the chapter you would have to do a short assessment (true false quiz over chapter), a map quiz, and an assignment (usually just about the reading as well). Easy to get done, learned a lot, enjoyed this class.",1
"She is a good teacher, from Spain. gives pretty good feedback about assignments and has interesting points when teaching. She can be a tough cooking and a hard grader, be sure to do all online and homework in additions to the things that are shown in syllabus. She constantly is adding homework or asks to post things on BB discussion. I recommend. ",1
"Since this class hasn't been taught in a long time, there's some trial and error to it. There are a large number of readings we're responsible for that we never get to in class. The citation style we use for class is also completely arbitrary as if she made it up, but make sure to follow her instructions clearly or you won't pass with a good grade",0
"He's a good teacher, very nice and humble.  Happy to answer questions and help outside of class.  Lots of guest speakerspresentations from the actual arizona forensic labs.  Very interesting.  He's pretty straight forward.  Would definitely recommend taking this class for a basic fingerprintsfirearmsquestioned document refresher.",1
"THE CLASS ISN'T HARD. HOWEVER, THIS PROFESSOR GIVES EXTRACREDIT( JUST 2 POINTS EACH EXTRACREDIT). YOU HAVE TO WRITE ALL THE NOTES BECAUSE YOU GONNA BE LOST IN HIS TEST, WHICH IS 20 QUESTION MULTI-CHOISE. THE QUIZZES ARE HARD AND HE NEVER GONNA HELP YOU, SO FORGET THIS GUY FOR SURE..iTS DIFFICUL GET ""A"" FOR THE ""HARDER"" QUIZ.",0
I'm not a public health major but was interested in taking the class due to my major being Health sciences. I was hesitant on taking it due to the heavy course work from my other class but i'm glad I did. Her lectures are very interesting and talks about how the topics connects to the real world.,1
She is really cool and easy going and she makes the class room interactive so you feel comfortable giving speeches. Attendance is mandatory but the class is not boring so its not bad. Also you have to study bc the quizzes and tests are pretty hard so dont go into publi speaking thinking it a blow off class.,1
I took him years ago at San Jacinto. I had been out of school for a long time and was never strong in math. He makes you think! You have to get past the block in your head!,1
"Professor Wo was wonderful to have for the class. In reality her accent is not tough to understand. She is passionate and driven towards the subject and her students. She isn't very strict but the way she holds herself deserves respect. If I could choose to be taught by more Professor Wo's I would. She's funny, passionate, relatable, and driven.",1
Dr. Dotts was fantastic. It's super clear that he's super passionate about teaching and he really cares about helping to bring up some good teachers one day. Just go to class and pay attention in class and you'll be fine.,1
"Spotty English, mandatory iclicker participation, essay, group project. Midterm consists of short answer and multiple choice. Same with final ",0
"He is a good professor, He just has to organize better the examples before going to the blackboard.",1
"I really enjoyed James's web development class. The course was a good balance of real world projects, experimental work, and fun challenges. I really appreciated his patience and clear explanations.",1
"Good guy, but terrible teacher. Class is start to finish lecture where he shows no energy for his subject, and merely talks in a monotone voice the whole class. I showed up every class and took notes. His online homework is absurd, takes at least 3 hours for each homework, and there is about 25 of them. Online quizzes are easy. Tests are hard!!!!!!",0
"Mary is hilarious and knows so much about nutrition. She is seriously just a cool person. Her class was straightforward and interesting. Her tests are all short-answer and are somewhat like case studies, but if you go to class and take notes during lecture, you will be fine. I would 10/10 recommend any class taught by Mary, she is amazing!",1
Dr. Smith is a laid-back professor who's very informal. He seems to put more focus into socializing with his students than actually teaching them. I don't feel like I got my money's worth with this course and wouldn't recommend this guy to anyone. Assignments are fairly easy but lectures aren't engaging at ALL so plan on learning the stuff yourself,0
"Always willing to meet before or after class hours. Extremely helpful, kind and caring!",1
"I think this is the first professor in mercy's history that lost a students mid-term. This class was unbelievable, i wouldn't recommend this professor to my worse enemy. He has too many teaching jobs and gets confused which is why he lost my test",1
"Calc 2 isnt easy, but Dr. B really cares about her students and goes the extra mile for them. She makes sure everyone understands everything and is thorough in her lectures. If you participate and study she will help you through the course. Would take her again in a heartbeat.",1
"Professor Ryburn is the absolute best. She is caring of her students (awesome enough to learn everyone's name), has a great personality, and will help you out whenever you need it. I strongly recommend taking her for Precal if you must take the class.",1
I don't know why this course is only available in 3 hour once a week sections. It gets incredibly boring but showing up increases your grade so just tough it out. Bring a lot of snacks and your laptop to class you'll need them. Class material is not interesting and he will never let you leave early. Just avoid this class unless you must take it.,0
Horrible.. no passion to actually teach. Seems like she likes to assert her authority or dominance onto students. Constantly makes kids feel uncomfortable in the middle of a lecture. Very unprofessional presence in the classroom. Doesnt know what partial credit means. All She is good for is putting your test threw the scantron.,0
McGurr is boring but pretty straight-forward with regards to exams and homework. Gives good study guides and extremely helpful homework sessions.,1
"Prof Song is a great person; energetic, smiley, loves what she teaches. The lectures are EXTREMELY boring. Barely learn anything about Microsoft Office and learn about one other type of software. Lots of extra credit offered. Didn't really learn anything important. Attendance is taken in class but not doesn't go toward your grade so its pointless.",0
"Horrible! One of the absolute worst professors I've had to take. He says the content is easy if you study... that's bogus. Doesn't do well explaining concepts, and don't even bother with him in office hours. He comes off as cold and calloused.  He CLEARLY doesn't like teaching. SERIOUSLY! GO ELSEWHERE AND TAKE IT!!!",0
"Professor Birnbaum is a interesting teacher. He is unorganized with his lectures and grading. All over the place. IF you ask a question he will make you feel incompetent. tests are ridiculous, the study guide barely helps. I would advise taking this class with a different teacher. he ruined my experience of forensics :(",0
This class should honestly be taken before any other biology classes because it provides useful information that helps you understand biology. Also no math in a statistics class!,1
"Does not answer questions or gets angry if she does. Blabs more about authors than literature. Rushes students through presentations. Does not post clear directions about her assignment s. Fails too many students, in our class as well as at least one other she teaches. Gives very little explanation about her grade. Rude. Condescending.",0
"Dr. Lim is a disgrace to the CHE department.  He does not teach!!!  When going to office hours, he won't actually answer questions and just tells you to look in the notes.  Semester tests are easy, but the final was incredibly hard and lowered most peoples' grades by two letter grades.  The class did not prepare anyone for the insane final.",0
"Very passionate about his career and teaching. Would like more student participation vs. ""sitting in the dark and listening to lectures for 6 hours a week."" Need to add some excitement or other structure in lecture class.",1
"Just finished up A&P1 spring 2018 with Prof Zeman. She really is a wonderful teacher, the best I have had at RCC so far. She is so funny, and tells it how it is. She can totally relate to students as she was a student herself not that long ago so she gets it. Only wish she were teaching A&P 2. Definitely take her, you wont find anyone better!",1
"The material taught by professor LeBlanc is difficult to learn outside of his lectures. His lecture slides help, but his demonstrations on the whiteboard are far more beneficial. Assignments make you think, but they are not overwhelming. A background in networking will help you significantly with this particular course.",1
LA is amazing. She is a giant source of knowledge about anything touching criminology. She has so much experience and she's great at explaining. The tests are fair and easy enough if you do your readings and attend class. Textbook is mandatory but also very enjoyable in general. Would take her again without hesitation. I love her.,1
He did not teach a thing just read straight out of the textbook so it was pointless to go to class but he marks attendance and it was a part of the grade. He posts no notes or wrote anything on the board so it was all textbook. Hard to study because he did not teach anything so did not know what to expect on the tests.,0
"Reads out of the book ONLY! Will not show you how to solve problems or put anything on the board. Asked her to show me how to solve a problem she said we didn't have time to do so. She said her self ""the class did bad on the quiz ,we are not having a quiz today because we are not grasping the material and we have to move on. "" DO NOT TAKE HER.",0
"Difficult class.  A majority of that was due to Dr. Wilson's inability to actually teach.  Assignments, etc were moving targets.  I altered study habits w/ each section to see which would bring the most success.  The amount of time that I spent studying for this class did not coincide with my final grade and overall effort.  2/3 of class dropped.",0
"enjoyed this class and all the reading materials assigned. nice guy with good intentions, sometimes a little unclear. definitely a hard grader, but if you try he will help. just follow all instructions and turn ALL papers in on time. pretty cool class overall. i got an A",1
Took her online 6wk course. At first it was intimidating bc there were many things due every week. You have a discussion posts due every Thursday plus two replies to classmate's discussion posts every Sunday (includes scientific articles/research& citations). There was also 1group project & 2 Diet analysis projects. Tons of extra credit though!,1
"As head of the GW math department, one would expect a professor who is knowledgeable about Linear Alg and able to help students learn Linear Alg. Half the class dropped after the first midterm, and the professor did not curve the class at all. Professor failed to discuss the fundamental theorem of linear algebra. Save yourself the mental headache.",0
No tests! No surprises! Do the blog and the project and you're good. ,1
Wow I took African-American Art and it was a complete waste of my time. Gelburd makes this class difficult since she grades like everyone is an art major.  She is no help in any way and doesn't care about her students at all.  Her scratchy voice gives me migraines and I'd rather fail than have to sit through her class for another year,0
"He is a great professor. The class is easy. He just goes through a PowerPoint every day ( the lecture) and then you just take a quiz after. You can also take quizzes during class and can work with others. The only big assignment is a 9-page report, but it's just about yourself and how what you've learned connects to you.",1
"Part of my rating is about the overall class as a whole w/ material. Professor Kula himself is a great teacher. Yes, in the beginning he was intimidating and scary, but as the semester progressed, he definitely warmed up. The material itself was difficult for me, but I don't believe he should be penalized for that. He's just doing his job!",1
"Professor Thompson is excellent at teaching organic chemistry. I never had a problem understanding a concept, it was simply a matter of memorizing it for the test. While he's worth taking chem off-track for, don't be fooled into thinking his class will be easy. You have to work extremely hard for a good grade.",1
No great at explaining things and isn't accessible outside of class. Told me if my group members didn't respond to do the group project by myself? while everyone else in the class does 1/3 the work? Also talks super slow in lecture its painstaking. Classmates and myself state feeling unprepared and confused on just about everything.,0
Boring subject material but very straightforward. All tests open book. Great guy but horrible material.,1
"She is a really nice teacher, always helps if you need it gets the class involved and keeps the topic interesting as much as she can. An excellent professor to say the least",1
THE BEST OF THE BEST. caring and willing to help,1
"I am about to take my 4th semester with Tokunaga-Sensei. She is easygoing and makes a genuine effort to gauge conversations to each student's skill level. I enjoy that she only speaks in Japanese during class. I wish the level of difficulty was more consistent with her written tests. She teaches 4 semesters, your only option for intermediate JPN.",1
"I took two classes with Brian and if he offered more that I needed I'd probably take another! The lectures are super easy to follow (TAKE NOTES, THEY ARE THE TEST) and invite you to take part in class discussions. If you don't like psychology you may not like the class, but hey at least he'll probably make you laugh. Tests have study guides.",1
"Kind of disappointed by the rate my professor when I first enrolled for this class. This class wouldn't let anyone of us breathe. Each week we had a discussion, 2-3 activities, 4 hw assignments, 10 pages of modules to read, 2-3 hours worth of video notes to watch and fill in, 4-5 quizzes, 4 exams throughout the semester, and a project. GL.",0
"His classes are interesting & he's very helpful & clear about the law, BUT what he wants on his exams is NOT clear b/c everyone practically failed his class or found themselves on AP. He needs to be more clear about how he wants his exams.",1
This is a bad teacher i had so far in north carolina state university. avoid this teacher at any cost. he is the worst teacher you can imagine.,0
"If you are a Food and Nutrition major, the semester you take NHM 362 is going to be your hardest semester of your college career. Not because the material is hard, the professors pile on the work. It's busy work and group projects. You will be taking around 5-6 classes. Dr. Park's tests are super hard and tricky. She is a tough grader.",0
"I took this class because I already took a lower level class with Prof. Lorimer and I liked her style. I didnt know much about California Indian history before this class, and I learned a lot! We did a lot of in class work with primary sources and we also did a quarter long research project on a specific tribe. I would def take her again",1
"James is a laid back teacher who randomly goes on tangents, repeats lectures, and forces his personal opinions on students.  I had a background in photography.  If you're a beginner he grades differently than if you've had experience.  I would not recommend his class.  His photography work is dull and does not look professional. Expected more.",0
"This class with Mark was great. There was a lot of discussion and dialogue which was appreciated. We had about 2 big papers, but most of our grade was based off participation and how well we could contribute to discussions. He's kind of all over the place, but he's very smart. I loved this class, and really like Mark as a professor.",1
Very nice guy though a bit on the quiet side. Easy A.,1
"If you do the short hw readings, class is simple. If not, no biggie unless there is a pop quiz but those aren't too hard. The tests are take home (but 12 page essays) and the in class test he gives you the question weeks beforehand and you bring notes. I got above a 97 on all tests, easy easy grader just use the lectures online!!",1
"STAY AWAY!!! from this lady do not take her online for math because she barely explains anything, she just gives you the text book to read and expects you to know. She also is very rude when you ask her about extra credits.",0
"Nice guy but treats Intro 101 class more as a master's class. Too much material covered & ""study guides"" are just lists of what's possibly on tests; did not include what he's specifically looking for, which is relevant bc there's so much side material that you lose site of what he's considering the main points. Low class test scores so not just me",0
Took the online course. VERY unclear with directions and assignments. Grade is based on 3 online exams and participations in weekly discussions. Never answers e-mail questions. If you read and teach yourself from the textbook it is an easy course but if you are not self-disciplined do not take his online course.,0
class is easy just show up to class and do the work he explains andy questions anyone has. You don't feel rushed taking his class.,1
She never responded to any emails. If you skip more than 2 or 3 classes your grade will suffer immensely. Not very understanding about technological issues or absences. She doesn't accept Dr's notes either. Pointless class with only busy work.,0
Worst Teacher ever.... boring lectures.,0
"Like my fellow classmate, this is the second class I have taken with Mr. Hanna. I actually love his style. Like the way he puts in stories of historical people in that time period. he does give a ton of essays but no test! I got an A the first time I took his class, hope for another A this semester.",1
"This was the WORST college professor I have had in my life. I have been in school for years. I am currently going back to further my education. He made sexiest jokes (that weren't even funny), not allowed to drink water, can't wear a hat (not even in the winter), if he sees your phone, he will take your final grade down by one whole letter grade.",0
"Great class on borders especially relevant at this time. Prof. Is very good, knowledgeable, and well-respected in the field. Fair grader, clear syllabus, extra credit - what else do you want? Taking another class with her next quarter.",1
WAY too much homework and hes very rude. Dont take him.,0
Cool guy hard to pass  if u dont like jazz get graded on the 5 exams and participation If ur not going to take time to listen to music posted on bb dont even bother to take class  save ur gpa,0
"Biased professor, very egotistical.  Must spit back his own opinions on papers and tests or you will get a bad grade.",0
Sarver puts a 20 point curve on every assignment and test. Not because he is easy but because all his quizzes and test are very hard. He didn't use the book but expected us to read the chapters and understand it without using it in class. The tests went way more in depth than the notes ever did.,0
"Just passed the FAR section of the CPA exam, one year out of college. Couldn't have done it without the building blocks learned through Dave's 301 stories/lectures. The guy can teach, and he's comfortable in his own skin. If you want to LEARN the subject, take this class. However, if you plan on going to his office hours, bring a hazmat suit...",1
"Super easy GESM with Sasha and she is so nice and fairly oblivious to most stuff. 70% of grade is showing up to events and 2 short articles, other 30% is C/NC easy assignments. Great class, she's a lot of fun, really nice, and always brings food. Events are on weekends though, so be prepared to give some free time to the class.",1
"Her grading criteria sucks! 60% is based on test 10% is on hmwrk.  If your not good in math, My suggestion is keep looking.  She purposely makes the test hard so you can fail. When she grades your test she marks you off for every lil thing even though it is correct.",0
"take someone else, avoid him!",0
Not the best professor. if you don't have the same opinion be prepared not to do well on tests.,0
"Disgustingly strict, bad lecturer, doesnt answer hw probs throughly. I feel like there are still a lot of things I dont know before each midterm.",0
I took a class that was a boring subject but he somehow made it interesting. Super funny and laid back.,1
"One of the best playwrights in the country, and one of the best teachers, too. Fiercely intelligent.",1
AMAZING instructor. Never once was lecture boring with her. She is very intelligent and funny. Jill will take out any extra time necessary to help you understand the material or if you just need someone to talk to. She tests off of her power points and the book is more supplemental to that. You are very LUCKY if you end up with her!!,1
"I would say average professor. He'll explain things, but will also often go on tangents & not really teach. His organization needs work and makes sense to him so that's what matters to him. Also, restricts you report topic to your field of study, doesn't let you branch out and choose. He's enthusiastic, but his grading is abstract and not clear",1
"Not what I expected in a Children's Literature class. The work assigned was not hard just too much. It was hard to follow her syllabus as it was not updated to the textbook required for the class. This professor was the worst at grading, and forget about getting a response back if you had any questions. I do not recommend taking her class online.",0
Readings were easy. Average on the open book midterm was a D which was curved to Bs and As. Monotone lectures which consist of reading off blocks of texts on a word doc. What the prof is looking for on exams is unclear. Says he wants little to no quoting but you get graded down if you don't use the specific vocab from the reading.,0
Extremely boring. You will hate your life for the hour during which he speaks,0
"Professor Hanratty is very clear about her expectations on assignments and communicates ideas effectively. She is available for questions and assistance when asked and may not be known to be an ""easy grader"" but is fair in her grading and communicates what you could improve. For this reason, I took both English 121 and 122 from her.",1
I took the online 101 course and Prof. POPOVICH was great. He was clear with what he wanted and how he wanted the work done.  I wish he would teach HIS 102 also.,1
Professor/Dean Lanham is amazing! Love her!,1
Great Teacher! Make sure to read and understand lectures. If you need help before a test she will clarify. All slides are online and grade is straight forward. Tests are not easy but as long as you know the study guide and pay attention you WILL PASS!! She knows how to teach and she knows about anthro. I highly recommend her class !!!!!!!!!!!,1
"Dont take this dude, he knows what hes talking about to some extent but the class is very opinionated, purposely makes the class harder than it has to be. If I had a choice between he and a squirrel as my teacher Id choose the squirrel.",0
She's not my fav. She would cover many sections in one class and didn't care if you understood it and then expects you to do all of the hw from those sections. She picked the hardest problems from the book for the test. I didn't learn anything. And if your phone goes off in class she deducts pts from your future test!,0
This class was my favorite class for the entire semester. Talbert is hilarious and a great storyteller. He will engage you to the point that you will wish class wouldn't end so you could hear the next part. There are a lot of papers though (5) and he does not hand out (cumulative) 8test questions/specify study areas beforehand (only sample tests).,1
Dr. Carlton is one of the few professors Ive had that truly cares about you and your success. Highly recommend.,1
"This prof also runs the skills lab and does not do anything for the students. She spends most of the time socializing with co-workers while she ignores students in the lab, or kicks them out for a hair appt. BTW the lab hours are always scheduled during class so you can never go. Completely useless...",0
"I came to every class, asked questions, read the book, followed her syllabus and rubrics, and still did terrible in the class.  She's a really nice person, but just reads from the power point during class and doesn't go into great detail with examples.  The tests were extremely difficult and she graded the papers very harshly.   ",0
Do not take for a GER.  Tests and quizzes are based on irrelevant information. Would suggest taking Art History for the GER.,0
very helpful describe in detail. give a good feedback of your all questions,1
all you do is read the textbook. the lecture are SOOO short and no help at all. I was really disappointed by this class.,0
Took his online class and what he expects from you is extremely confusing and difficult. His tests are ridiculous (45 questions in 35 mins) and 3 essays in 75 mins (plus identifications) I suggest dropping his class immediately if you have the luck to get him.,0
I have had three classes with Prof. Tang and have loved every single one of them! She's a fair grader and genuinely wants people to do well. She pushes ideas in class and challenges students because she wants you to flesh out your thoughts more. She knows theory like no other and is amazing. One of the best professors I've ever had.,1
Super easy class. Only meets a few times a semester. I enjoyed going to this class I kind of wish we had more face to face classes. An easy A,1
"Dr. Kosnik is a great professor. The class is pretty easy and he is always willing to help. If you go to class and take notes you will get an A. The tests are relatively easy, if you study. Overall, he is a good professor and the class is interesting",1
Emily is very kind and sweet. She is a fair grader and helpful if you seek her help. If you are looking for an easy A this ain't the class. You need to do the readings and participate in class. If you do that and you get good grades on all your essays then you'll get a decent grade.,1
"Plan wisely when its nearing exams because you will have labs, projects and reading assignments on top of it. Its a lot sometimes, but its a good education and is worth it. Chuck is fantastic at teaching and has a great sense of humor. Just be aware of his wrath when its a bad day. Don't be disappointed if you don't get the get the grade you seek.",1
"Avoid this class. Prof. Bauner is from Germany and it is very difficult to understand him, and his presentations were boring. The only reason I went to class was for iClicker. Homework was difficult, and the multiple choice tests were not representative of what was taught in lecture. He is also not interested in helping students learn or understand",0
"He is very intelligent, which can make it hard for him to articulate what's going on inside his head. Definitely recommend having prior calculus knowledge, but he gives sample tests which are very similar to the real test, drops your lowest test grade, and is very fair. If he makes the test too hard, he will curve to compensate. DO NOT take Jesse!!",1
It was fun. Now I can speak Russian. The trip to NY was amazing!,1
Autumn does NOT keep up with putting grades in the grade book. She grades differently than stated in the syllabus. She does not respond to emails and keeps you from knowing your accurate grade until the last day final grades can be entered. She tests on materials that is different than what she lectures about and refused to help me in lab.,0
wonderful teacher! can't find enough good things to say about her! her class is not easy and alot of people dropped out but if you attend every class and learn what she tells you to learn you'll do great in this class!,1
He is an amazing teacher and his class is an easy A if you keep up and do the work,1
"Professor Hutton was a very tough grader, It was very hard to fix what she wanted on the rubric because she was not very specific on what she wanted she also quizzes you on what she likes. (EDU 104)",0
He is a good professor with MAJOR anger issues. He got really mad at certain times almost scary. I would take him again but I wouldn't want to piss him off. He's helpful and VERY sarcastic. He thinks he's the best thing since sliced bread and talks himself up all the time but it's more amusing than annoying.,1
Don't bother to take the online class.  You will receive little to no specific or constructive feedback on assignments.  You will do tons of useless busy work.  She will have you write rough drafts that she will not bother to grade or provide feedback on before the final draft of the paper is due. She is one of the worst teachers I have ever had.,0
"Awesome class with an awesome professor. He knows his stuff and gives great examples. Also, there's a movie night. How cool is that? Definitely take Rasheed for 107. Few things are graded so make sure to copy all of the Powerpoints and study those and you should be set.",1
"This was my second time having Dr. Osborne for a class, and he was as fantastic as the first time. He is very funny and entertaining, and tries to make the texts more relatable. The only thing to watch out for with him is there will be a very intense reading schedule. Your grade will be based on two big tests, a big paper, and a few quiz grades.",1
"Dr G is by far the best instructor I've ever had! He is extremely knowledgeable (about EVERYTHING) and very passionate about environmental issues. He's also very accessible and willing to help you out. That being said, this is a HARD class - there 's an enormous amount of work between study guides, personal responses and other projects.",1
"Dr. McDougal is quite humorous.  He comes off as quite arrogant.  His class is difficult but that is most likely due to the class and not his teaching.  He does curve his tests a bit, as the class average is usually a low C or high D.  Overall I would recommend him for O-chem, but know you will have to study a lot and it won't be easy.",1
"Il fonctionne avec le manuel, cad aucun notes de cours aucun power point (a part quelques powerpoint du manuel quil va envoyer par email). La personne est respectable en tant que tel mais sa maniere d'enseigner est mediocre. A eviter, il y a de meilleurs profs pour ce cours a uqam.",0
"I took class with him .... the you really need to be regular in math classes especially with Martin.. His quizes and exams are really easy but his teaching method is terrible cus he only understands for himself.. pay more attention when he teaches row reduction, span,bases, eigen value etc...",0
"He was an amazing professor, I took him twice at Hofstra. I know he is now teaching at a college in New Jersey, Kean University. A shame he left Hofstra.",1
so much homework and its not explained very well how to use the software that what kept me from finishing the homework on time.,0
"This class was awesome! He is a great prof, very funny and quite entertaining. You must attend class and take great notes (use a laptop). ",1
"Took Professor Riley's 9-week course, it was a really good class. Learned a lot about computer parts and there's are hands-on Labs that you have to do with a partner. The class was easy and Mr. Riley is willing to help out if you don't have any experience with computer parts. Highly recommend him!",1
"He is lost more the 50% of the time, he knows the business but doesnt know how to teach it. If you dont match his ideas and his views you might as well quit film because he believes you wont make it and tells you. As well he goes on tangents that dont have anything to do with the class,.",0
"The only redeeming factor of this ""seminar"" is that you don't have to attend to get an A.",0
"I had this prof. for Spring of 2020 and he very difficult to reach through email. He was very confusing, and unhelpful. Unless you had previous background in it like I did, you will most likely struggle. I had to guide quite a few students through the material. Some were promised regrades but did not get a response at all towards the last few days",0
"Marks entire letter grades off reports for minor mistakes that isn't even an out-of-order lab report. (Insert graph after the wrong line? A -> C.) Don't take if you're looking to get a good grade for your hard work. Also, experiments are uninteresting and always inconclusive. Almost no equipment; Take a lab somewhere else.",0
"By far the most difficult course I have taken. If you arent a calculus wiz, stay away. Very ineffective and difficult class.",0
He explains everything in detail and gives out plenty of worksheets for students to adequately practice the particular lesson that he is teaching. He also dedicates several of his classes to review for tests which are a major help to anyone that might be having trouble understanding a specific topic.,1
"Not a good teacher, hard to get into contact with and gives huge amounts of homework.",0
Online class but prepared on your own as this prof is has a very small office hour window and replies late to emails Homework is lengthy try  to work ahead Work comes straight from the book Almost had to drop because of the 95 bucks on an access code required to submit homework on Would've been good to know before I purchased the textbook,0
"I know a lot of people give him crap, but Illindala is actually a good professor in my book. He gave a nice curve for 5041 (80-85% was a B+ for reference). Beware of the final paper though, just follow the guidelines and ask for help from him and you'll be okay. Exams were kind of tough, but only a few questions each, so look at the practice exams.",1
"He's a nice teacher. Always cancelled class a lot & let us out early. He said we would have quizzes periodically throughout the semester, but we only had 2. Very easygoing/laid back. He loves when you laugh at his jokes. I'd definitely take one of his classes again.",1
Awesome teacher she kept me interested so I actually learned...  Pay attention in class and you get an A in the class,1
Good prof and very care about students. She could explain the question very clear but her test was very hard. Her few extra credit can not change the grade and some questions of the test are you never seen before.,0
His homework requirements sheet is vague and everyone could come up with their own interpretation but you will be graded based on how close you can get to his interpretation of the question and close to someones solution he thinks is the best. His grading is very strict and unfair at times.,0
Considerate,1
"One of my top 3 teachers. I had her for Fairy Tales and Fables and I wish I was allowed to take that class again. The class was a very open discussion about concepts and it was a class that we could think in. Only had 3 essays throughout the class, and we had plenty of time to think them out. She's so sweet, and very easy going. Loved this class",1
"The prof can't explain anything properly, he doesn't have homework clearly written out, he's totally unclear to a point where students ask each other what he means throughout lectures, and he grades essays extremely hard. Get A's in all your previous English classes? Too bad man. Expect C's. He means well, but he needs to get it together.",0
"Great guy, but he makes us take the quizzes before he actually teaches the material, so they are tough. 7 online quizzes 2 tests and a final. You have to read case studies and be prepared to talk about them because he will call on you and that is what participation points are based on. He starts with a joke everyday. Its hard but I recommend him!",1
"I have had her for several classes now and I enjoyed them.  The books that she chooses are not run-of-the-mil, but very good.  She is very informal and knows what she is talking about.  She can be unclear at times about what she expects, but overall, if you do the work, you get a good grade.",1
"This man knows absolutely nothing about Muslim Fundamentalism. However, that does not stop him from giving his ""expsert"" opinion every time he can ""grandstand"". Stay away!",0
"Prof is very knowledgeable but a lousy prof who does not value students ""thinking outside the box"". Will tell you one thing, but when you do it, it wont be good enough and you will have to change it at least 3-4 times. He will even tell you he doesnt like something he has approved first.I was exited to learn at first, but he really killed it for me",0
Not only does he not curve but a 90% is a B+; how messed up is that? His grading scale actually makes it harder to get an A.  All of the other science classes I have taken have either the normal grading scale or they make an A 87% and above then scale off of that. He is not interested in seeing his students do well.,0
Very helpful professor who knows his stuff. Costa puts in a lot of effort to make sure his students learn difficult and abstract concepts. He maintains a course page where all stuff for the class gets posted. I wish my other professors cared as much as Costa does.,1
Writes in-depth comments on written work.,1
Great Teacher!  AAA+++,1
You will get a B! But this guy is a a chode and  he thinks he is smart when he is not. You will not use any of it in real life and this class should be cut from teacher ed. ,0
"He's a great guy tbh. At first he wasn't my cup of tea but, overtime he became nice. The class is awkward though, no one wants to be there, so no one talks. He's a very tough grader no matter how well you write your journals. He gave me a 28/30 everytime. Which makes getting an A hard since those journals count for a lot of points. Good luck.",1
"Seems like she used to be a good professor, but has fallen apart a bit.  Never got back half the assignments, and the ones we did get back literally took months.  Never gave clear explanations for anything, took days to respond to emails (if ever), just very disorganized and unhelpful.  I hope to never take a class with her again.",0
"Decent teacher, but he was not understanding at all when I had a severe case of the flu and had to go to the ER on the day of a test. A doctors note from the ER was not enough for him to allow me to retake this exam. I spoke with the dean on this matter and applied for a grade appeal. I highly advise everyone against taking this class with Knox.",0
there are only 3 exams and no homework there is study guide before each exam the class is really easy HE IS THE BEST HE IS A NICE GUY,1
Everything to her is about the American Dream. We didnt even learn how to to do anything she just had us write papers over the American Dream. Multiple papers and presentations over the same topic and wanted new information in each different assignment like what do you expect if were doing he same thing over and over again.,0
Fantastic teacher.  Lectures are straight forward and highly organized. Provides Practice exam through the library. You are responsible for getting it and making copies.  I only read through the notes and memorized the practice exams and both my husband and I got A's in the class (and he is a History major).,1
He is not very helpful and quizzes and exams rarely relate fully to what was learned. The homework he assigns is barely worth doing since he never goes over it and it isn't the same problems as the quiz. ,0
As the others have said If you want to major in poetry take his class but if you are just taking the class because you have to for your GED or your major then don't. We were required to have five different books. He wants you to write in a similar matter as Aristotle and Plato. I took the W on my transcript rather than staying in his class.,0
"I have a feeling that the two ratings that rate him thumbs up are fake. Is a horrible professor. He doesn't teach. He is *not* accessible outside of his class hours. He stands infront of the board, writes something, then erases it before students even see what he wrote! Refers to what he is covering with ""this"" so you don't even know what he wrote.",0
"2 Major essays, 2 minor essays, and a group project. He isn't always clear about what he wants on the papers but asking for his thoughts 2-3 days after the due dates is a great choice. All he wants is creativity and to develop your VERY OWN style of writing",1
"Literally every single lecture was a prerecorded video from another semester. I could have learned the same stuff from youtube, why did I pay Oakland thousands of dollars to watch videos. I have never witness a professor care less then Jonathan Maisonneuve. I'm struggling to find words to describe this sorry excuse of a professor. Just don't.",0
This is the absolute worst class and professor I have ever taken. She is an unreasonably hard and inconsistent grader. Gives contradictory feedback and is rude and belittling in doing so. Her grading system is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. I should have dropped this class. STAY AWAY!!!,0
"His grading criteria is unclear, yet strict. I know, that doesn't make sense, but if you take him you'll understand. He marks you off for NEARLY everything you do ""wrong"" in your lab report. If you take him, just make sure you know EXACTLY what he wants on his reports.",0
"Under the impression teaching A&P was not her first choice and it shows. She is a speed reader and will not slow down to give time for note taking from the time class starts until 5 minutes after. No make-ups, no late work, no excused absences, doesn't present the material in a clear way. Minimum of 15 hr study week, no multiple choice test. ",0
"The professor is a wonderful person  however, sometimes when he teaches students are very confused. More office hours and TA sessions would have been helpful for this class.",1
Give great feedback not just grades. Very inspiring.,1
I love Mrs. Barclift. She is very understanding. She knows what she is talking about and is very interesting. She is more strict in this class than she is in other classes.Most people do not know how to take her outspokeness and crude humor when they first meet her she means no harm.,1
"AHHH this woman expects you to read her mind or something. Don't worry about getting a bad grade-chances are you will get one because she is all over the place. She drives me crazy, I dreaded her LONG, BORING, CLASS. You will never get out early, and she is difficult to impress. (She also dresses like a teenager. I guess she is a nice lady though",0
"Wouldn't recommend taking this professor. If you do, use your own note taking system...his is very unclear and repetitive.  Also, he is very condescending...he treats you like junior high students. I've never written a review for a professor before, but this guy made me feel like I had to.  I enjoy history, but I do NOT enjoy his class.",0
"There are weekly online quizzes, which are generally pretty easy and follow the book. However, his lectures do not follow the book at all/boring. The midterm and final are essay questions where you are expected to write 2 pages per question. There are 3 major papers throughout the class based upon supplemental books and a topic of your choice.",0
"If you completely understand something, you will be confused once she explains it. She never finishes a thought, and is completely unclear. She is not too tough in the grading though, but get ready to teach yourself. ",0
"I took Jason for DRAW 1, DRAW 2, and Life Drawing. He's amazing. Not a crazy amount of work, he explains everything, is super kind and funny, and is very understanding if you're in a major like photo or film and don't draw. Would highly reccomend. I wish I had the opportunity to take him for a painting class too. 10/10",1
"How does he have 4.7? This guy gave me major headaches. The workload is too much looking at the fact that we take other courses too. He expects too much, please stop. Huge papers (10-20) pages due each week. He is telling us to get jobs, how do you expect us to do this with the workload you give us? Currently crying. Also show off and ranter.",0
"he definitely knows nothing about teaching a class!!! his class is no use at all, and the lecture is just reading from the material. never teaches anything useful, the lecture and the homework and quiz has nothing related!!! definitely do not take his class ever and ever!!!! the worst teacher in this University!!!",0
"A lot of homework, class isnt very interesting , shes not open or friendly but very critical and a tough grader, she cares about improving your writing skills but not about helping your grade or anything else personal. I would not recommend her at all, she takes her job way too seriously.",0
"Great professor, need textbook to pass class",1
"Great Professor for Algorithms, in both teaching and research. Received lots of help from Piazza and lectures.",1
Prof. Shine is a good professor. Hes very knowledgeable and understanding. His lectures are difficult because most of the time he will go off topic then switch back to the topic. Its nice to have the option to redo your midterm until youre happy but its tough when you dont know whats going on. Lost interest quick due to confusion.,0
Lectures are hard to pay attention to b/c kinda boring. Tests were hard considering the class basically failed. NO CURVE. Iclickers so class is mandatory.,0
"He really tries to make you learn, and I'm sure he would be fascinating if I was interested in the subject.  All tests were take home.",1
"Maureen speaks VERY quietly so sit in the front row. Meet with her at the very beginning of the semester even if it's just to say hi. If you do so, she'll bend over backwards for you. Shes not always clear on what she wants you to do so ASK QUESTIONS. Participation is very important if you don't want a major assignment. Didn't really like the class",0
"Prof was unclear in his expectations for assignments and exams & never had enough material to cover a 3h lecture. More than half the class was review from the previous week & all the new material is crammed into the last hour, often resulting in keeping us until 10PM. He means well but doesn't explain concepts well so i relied entirely on the book",0
"I took professor Kanetis for intro to philosophy. He is full of energy at 8 am everyday and is ready to roll as soon as he steps through the door. If you are a person that skips class, you won't pass his class. He has a strict participation score. As long as you read the chapters and participate, you wont have a problem passing.",1
There's a ton of homework. Quizzes are pretty easy. You need to put a lot of time into this class if you want to pass. I do that and I'm on the edge of failing still. He makes his tests very hard!! He's a nice guy overall however so I can't hate him. I just wish he would not make his tests impossible to pass.,0
"Prof. Hansen always talked about really interesting topics and if you take good notes and go to all the lectures, you will pass his class with an easy A. His tests are 5 short essay questions but you only have to respond to 4. All the questions should be easily answered if you pay attention and take REALLY GOOD NOTES in class.",1
"My favorite professor ever!!! I love Dr: Ferreira, she explains everything so clearly and always available for your questions. Make lecture fun and keep you interested. She is extremely caring, attentive, and patient with her students. If you want to take this class, I highly suggested.",1
Extremely interesting class and caring teacher. Network administration is a very useful course to learn the necessary skills for the employment market which allowed me to earn an industry Network Pro certification. Syllabus seems exceedingly demanding at first but when I started doing the assignments they were a lot easier than I thought initially.,1
"His class was awful! I would avoid if you could. midterm is fine as long as you attend lectures and do readings, although his lectures weren't clear and all over the place.",0
"A decent teacher for most of Calc II, but when he gets to infinite series and sequences, he does a terrible job explaining it. You shouldn't have much trouble as long as you have access to a math tutor for the topics above. If you aren't familiar with Mathematica, get familiar.",1
easy A if you read and show up. didn't like her teaching style but some people do.,0
"He provides lecture notes, but they are very unorganized and involve a lot of unnecessary detail, and he doesn't tell us what is important for us to know. He goes off on tangents, wasting valuable class time, and further confusing his students. Averages are in the 70s on most of his tests, but he does nothing to change that or help his students.",0
"OK, I realize a lot of people do not like this class, but as someone who does not understand math at all, I thought Rayburn was extremely helpful especially during office hours. The class itself is not easy, but you get to use a notecard on tests and he gives extra credit. I thought he was actually a pretty good teacher.",1
Pros (3),1
"I took Biological anthropology taught by Dr. Cox . The material she presented was interesting and went beyond the textbook. There were not any complaints that I could find for her class. Well structured, clearly graded and multiple opportunities for extra credit if you missed an assignment. Great lectures, Dr. Cox is enthusiastic about teaching!",1
"Took his class that was adapted for covid-19. It was definitely easier since there were no exams. He's a really great lecturer and teaches you how to write better code. The projects were fun to do, and most of them were straightforward. Couldn't have asked for a better professor and class.",1
"Everyone else covered everything good about him, so I'll go over everything else. All was good in his class until he stopped grading around November-December. A strange thing he does is he makes students copy-paste their replies to other students in a separate discussion board. He won't grade the ones in the original boards.",1
Excellent class. Would take again. Loved his conversations and easy to talk to. Can't say anything negative.,1
I love the way he teaches. I had fun and retained the information. Would recommend and take it again.,1
"Dr. Steadman is a little on the hard arse side but as long as you speak up when talking to him and show respect, he'll like you. He seems cold but loves to joke with students!! DO NOT BE LATE. I'm sure he's harder in other courses but he's a great EG101 instructor & a good person to get in good with because he's the dean of the college of eng.",1
"All in all, I liked his class. Hes a good teacher and builds you up to speak in front of the class. I do wish he would have incorporated some impromptu, ungraded individual speeches to take up class time and get more public speaking experience before the major speeches. I know people would have appreciated the extra time/practice. Highly recommend",1
She is ridiculous,0
"I would not take Liya for an upper division course. She doesn't really explain key topics clearly. Many times she'll just read from the lecture slides, and it seems as if she doesn't really know the information. Also, the book goes into great detail for certain topics, that are very complicated, but she'll hardly explain them class.",0
"Prof. Mirbod is AWESOME! Great lecture and very caring and knowledgeable. Her study guide is very helpful, but you need to read and do the HW to get an A. Accounting is not easy but she wants to make sure you understand. She puts a lot of practice questions online and goes over the problems in class. Best professor.",1
"Professor Talbert was okay. He knew what he was talking about in his lectures, but they were so boring. There were no slideshows, just his voice and a list of important people/words. The TA's didn't give good feedback on the papers. He only gave us 2 hours for the exam even though it was university policy that he give us 3.",0
Teaches very boring. Long and unnecessary. Hyprocrite,0
"It was an online class, so I'll give her the benefit of the doubt. She curved the final by 10 points, but when it's worth 50% of the class, that doesn't do much. You can find a better, more caring professor willing to work with you",0
"I took lecture with Sobhi and found that the content was not clearly taught to the class, many of my classmates were also not doing well, he read off the powerpoint but did not explain much more than what the slide said verbatim. The online homework was difficult and had content that wasn't taught to us. Meeting during office hours was encouraged",0
Can't listen to her as she never uses microphone,0
VERY VERY VERY HARD,0
"His lecture exams are horrible each multiple choice question is 3 pts so if you get 3 wrong you are already 90%  I am really disappointed taking his class I just did not have any choice he was the only one listed for bio 242. Boring lectures not helpful for exams. His study guide is useless, don't spend your money and time.",0
"Take his class and you will wish you dead several times throughout the semester. His lectures are boring, his voice is monotone, his tests are stupid hard for no reason, the power points are not even close to what is on the test. I had him for a summer semester online and he shows the class averages on Canvas. Most of the class did not pass. warned",0
I took this as a Distance Education  course in the Spring semester 2015. Profssor Chidinma Udezeh was very helpful.,1
Dave is a very funny and entertaining teacher. Business 101 is an introductory class so there is a lot of information to learn. That being said he lectures are never boring and he is there to help if you need him.,1
"She is definitely not meant to teach this class. Her incredibly high expectations fit better in a more advanced English course, not one required for just about every student. She is very rude and snaps with the slightest thing. She will penalize for things such as claiming to never get your email when there is proof you sent it. its YOUR fault",0
Dr. B is an amazing person and very devoted to his students. This class is so much fun. He makes sure that all the students know that he is there if they need any help. I learned a lot in such a short period of time. I recommend him if you want a helpful teacher.,1
"Spends half the lecture ranting about student complaints; said he gets so many complaints he doesn't care about them anymore. Doesn't teach anything; told us we ""have to learn how to Google."" Don't bother asking questions, he'll answer with ""I don't know"" or ""you have to figure it out yourself."" He'll kick you out of his office too. Disgraceful.",0
Great and interesting professor.,1
"The class itself was fine, he seems like a really nice guy and a nice and easy teacher. That being said he is an older man and doesn't seem to be up to date on terminology. He continually used the word r*tarded, called people who self harm ""cutters"" and blatantly hated people with personality disorders. His class is an easy A but not a safe space.",0
"Dr. Pannell is a phenomenal teacher for stats. Go to class, office hours, and stat lab. Tough class but if you do well on homework, quizzes, projects, etc. the exams are not that bad.",1
He should stick to teaching business majors. He is unfit to teach stem courses as it stands. Essentially just taking advantage of these students.,0
He does not really care about hi students and he is not very specific. He goes through things too fast. He takes too many points off of lab and it was a struggle to get good grades on labs. I would have to go to another professor to get good grades on the labs.,0
"Had him for COM 221 and honestly he's one of the best professors I've had here at Riddle. If you follow the rubric and the steps provided you'll get an A or at least something very close to it. Furthermore, he adds a lot of flair and personality to a class that otherwise would be pretty boring. He'll keep you engaged. Overall 10/10 would recommend.",1
"By far one of my favorite professors. She's funny and genuinely cares about her students. There were four papers, including the final essay. She does peer review for every paper, and it is required. There is a group project at the end of the semester, and she bases many of her assignments off of TV/movies. She gives good feedback on all essays.",1
"I had to take this specific class twice, and I think if I had her the first time I would have finished on time. She was very nice and explained everything in a  way that everyone could understand especially because she didn't like math either. She gave the class her math cell phone number to answer any questions we might have outside of class",1
I don't understand his class. I am just attending and for credit. I need to pass it. Attend the class and u will pass.,0
"Nelson may be a ""brilliant"" author; this does not make him a good professor. Nor an ""OK"" one. His classroom persona/schtick/call it what you will, precludes his engagement with material and students. His classes exude what appears to be a lot of knowledge, but you'll leave class everyday emptyhanded- because everything Nelson does is about Nelson.",0
"She is really hard to understand on her video lectures. Also, she often times works on the homework in her video lectures and gets the question answers wrong.  That's worrisome. She takes forever to upload her video lectures. Really nice person, but not the best professor. If you don't like doing HW and quizzes last minute do not take her. ",0
This professor is so hard if you do not know spanish and to top it off he is a prefectionist. If you miss an accent or mispell somethings its wrong. He is boring and his class is to hard.,0
"I don't know if online isn't his thing, but he really dropped the ball this semester. Everything from lectures to hw resources posted late enough to not be useful, or not at all. On top of that he doesn't let you show work on exams. Makes our lives harder to make his easy. Avoid.",0
"Mrs. Smith is, by far, the kindest and most caring professor. The course itself involves a lot of work because of the amount of material but Mrs. Smith is always available for questions or advice. She will be retiring in December and will certainly be missed by all of her students! I'm so glad I decided to take her class. She's a real gem!",1
"You pretty much have to do the readings, and if you do the work, you can definitely make a high A.  It helps for 111 if you've taken AP- Bio.  He's witty, interested and interesting.",1
"She goes off of powerpoints, but it's also important to read along and do problems in the textbook (she usually uses the textbook problems in her exams). Most of her exams are usually open ended, so make sure you understand the formulas. Overall a great professor, and she really does help out, but you just have to make an effort.",1
"Dr. Fazelpour is an amazing professor. Spends extra time with students after class to ensure they understand. spend in total writing 80+ program but most are just copying code with some homework; working in pair. Test cover question from the book, a lot the question are the same as the given study guide.",1
"Very rude sense of humor, if you're sensitive don't take him. Not straight forward at all, assignments, if any that are given are confusing. Attend class or you will be completely lost! Tests are super hard but if you study and put your mind to it you will do well on them, its all memorizing. Must get the textbook, all reading and hw is from it!",0
You wont need a textbook for this class and all the lectures are posted online Incase you missed something during class. She gives study guides that are exactly the same as the test. If you show up to class and listen you will easily pass with an A,1
Excellent Prof. Do the readings and complete the homework and you'll get 100% for that part of your grade. Take the papers seriously cause he wants you to write well.,1
"He was a good teacher idk why people complained. Watch lectures, study, go to GSS and you should be fine lol",1
"gives good explanations, and always answers questions well.  However, gives hard exams!",1
Attending lecture is not helpful. He always assumes you know something. He puts high expectation on you but does a really poor job teaching us in a understandable and organized way.,0
he sucks. i have never been in more boring class. all you do is listen to him lecture then do a bunch of hawkes. easy math only if you pay attn in class but its so boring no one goes. hawkes is hard..not the same as what he teaches in class.,0
She's a good teacher; presents complex material so that you can understand by relating it to our world.,1
"obviously intelligent, possibly hides behind an incredible sense of humor, witty, has a keen eye for detail, respectful even when using derogatory statements, so applause for that.",1
"100 slides copy-pasted from Wikipedia and elsewhere. there's time for about half, but who cares: there's no apparent structure, he produces nothing but truisms and mainstream opinions, no critical approach at all. In international politics! Don't email with criticism, he won't respond. I grant, it's an easy A. Hardest part is to stay awake",0
"Jane is awesome! She knows her material inside/out & is passionate about biostatistics! You'll get 3 midterms (MC, T/F, problems), weekly hw (3-4 problems)+lab work (you can work in groups). Overall, the class was easy. She explains all the concepts clearly and gives relevant examples so they are easy to remember. Oh yeah, the final is cumulative!",1
"Took this professor for two semesters, he's awesome. Explains the material pretty well, talks a bit about how the material relates to current events or situations. Tests were cake as long as you study the important sections of the powerpoints. Overall easy A if you don't slack off. If you need any clarification on his lectures, he helps to do that.",1
"He assigns homework every night and although it is easy, it is extremely pointless and repetitive. During class, he will call on you and challenge you. Also, he is an extremely hard grader its very difficult to get 100%. Before you can turn in an assignment, you have to visit the writing center. Take this class with a friend, you do peer reviews.",0
"He didnt let me take a retest becuase i missed the class for a funeral, we said I didnt have enough proof even though I had the proof. I couldnt understand a single thing he said. DO NOT TAKE HIM! I get all A's and still failed the class.",0
Wut a Honey! She is a pretty good teacher also. Do your HW and study and you'll be fine. Only thing i didnt like is she loved to use every second of time you were scheduled to be in her class. Dont plan on getting out early or class being cancled.,1
GO TO OFFICE HOURS. I went to office hours more than lecture (just bc im not a morning person) but he's very patient and helpful in office hours. He tries to give hints if he realizes everyone is stuck on the same question on an exam. His exams are mostly free response and he tries to give partial credit.,1
"He is a great teacher and I suggested him to all my friends and all the people compaining about him are just mad because they sucked at the game you play all semester. Read the manaul before playing and the class is an easy ""A"".  He is very unorganized but he makes class fun. Take him!",1
He is a terrible teacher. Please don't take him. I had to drop. I don't feel like he gave me the chance to really appreciate the subject and topic. His exams have only 3 questions and are nothing like the 40 questions homework he gives you. He CANT TEACH! He will mess up your GPA.,0
"Accounting is very difficult in itself. Professor Cho, unlike most professors gives you immense extra credit along with curves on exams. Her exams are not easy and you definitely have to put in at least 15 hours of studying per exam to do well, but she always gives a review sheet of things that will be on the exam. She cares about her students.",1
His h.w are incredibly long and he takes points off for everything (have to include where in the textbook you found equation and do a sketch diagram for every question). when you answer questions for his oral exam he doesn't give you any feedback just a grade. incredibly hard class. the only good part is that it's an open book test. Do Not Take.,0
"Best English teacher I have ever had. Took it because I had to, and loved every minute of it. Engaging, funny, energetic, enthusiastic teacher. Goes out of his way to help everyone individually. Competent, makes the material a blast, and an all around really fun class with a great teacher. Simply cannot say enough good things about this teacher.",1
"billy's a necessary evil because he's the only organic chem prof, he's an idiot, you can find his companion notes for the textbook online and he just reads them word for word, you'd be better off just reading the book and only showing u for tests, if you remember anything about gen chem 1, you're smarter than he is",0
"Is a non-Native English speaker, and is difficult to understand as others have pointed out. Lectures run long, homework is ungraded and never discussed, and office hours are minimal. If you take her class, you'll need a VERY skilled tutor and likely spend 12-15 hours per week studying outside of class.",0
Not clear AT ALL on what essays need to be written for his class. And NEVER responds to emails. Most incompetent prof.,0
"He seems mean at first, but he's not that bad. Grades pretty fairly with partial credit. Usually just reads off of his powerpoint. Does minimal problems on the board. Has a thick accent, but you can usually figure out what he's saying. Came late to class a lot.",0
"He is a very difficult grader, but he doesn't seem too bad overall.",0
"The lab was easy , and fun, but there too many assignments, I like when we work in partners , dr. Sobhi is so nice , and he always willing to help when you need him, for explaining unclear instructions on the manual",1
Excellent teacher! She was wonderful. Extremely helpful. I took this class during the summer so it was slightly shorter than the fall semester. She was great at responding back to emails. A few times after class I would ask questions  and she was always willing to stay and answer. Highly recommend her. Wish she taught higher levels.,1
"I do not have professor Hartman as a teacher myself but he works with me often in the math lab. He is so helpful and works very hard to be sure that he is tutoring to your personal satisfactory.  If he is this great of a tutor, he must be a fantastic math teacher as well. I would definitely recommend him as a teacher without doubts.",1
"No tests/quizzes that were not take home. He is really up to date with whats going on with celebrities/movies/etc. has unique perspectives and is an all around nice and understanding guy. The online tests can be slightly tricky to find the specific answer, but not too bad. All notes are online. Would recommend him!",1
There is a lot of material in this class and it is worth learning. She will clarify anything that is confusing as long as you take the time to ask.,1
"Mr. Gerritsen has showed me what a true professor should be like. Not only did he teach us the importance of Genetics, he taught us other vital information. He prepared us for possible interview questions, gave us helpful advice, and went above and beyond to make sure we felt comfortable with the content. HIGHLY recommend.",1
"he sucks attendance wise, he marks you absent if youre a few mins late and he makes you get some textbooks & you NEED to bring it to class bc if not hes considers it as an unprepared & literally says youre basically useless so he marks you absent for that too. i dont recommend him drop the class or change teacher if you can!!!!",0
Stephen is a horrible prof His grading SUCKS. More than 17 people dropped out of the class and maybe 5 made it to the end with probably 2 actually passing the class If you get a tiny part of like a 10 mark question wrong then the entire question is wrong Its basically impossible to pass unless you have a photographic memory doesnt care for student,0
"He is very vague, goes off topic a lot, its very difficult to pay attention in his class but he is very lenient on grading and is pretty nice",0
"DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS DURING THIS COVID PANDEMIC .His rules for his hard online exams and final are so strict that if you do something wrong intentional or unitentional, his Gradescope will straight up denied it. He also refuse to reply or give any feedback back to your email if you late or have any trouble with his final or exams .",0
"Lectures are a little boring, but the professor's a nice, understanding, guy. He knows his stuff and the class isn't that bad as long as he isn't teaching the course with Polentz-Bernard. If she's in the class too, get ready for a lot of work and crappy grades. She will suck the fun out of any course he teaches.",1
Great instructor for this course. Good balance of humor and seriousness,1
"He expects you to know what he is talking about. Walks out of class while you do classwork, brushes you off if you have a question. Not very helpful, but he is nice.",0
"He is a good professor, make you learn the realistic use of chemical engineering unit operation lab",1
"I love Dr. Childs, especially for logic.  She makes it easy to understand.",1
"I loved this class. The books were great, and Professor London really contributed to my understanding of them. The writing assignments really made you think, but it challenged me and my writing has greatly improved since I've really learned what makes the difference between an A- and an A paper.",1
"I went 15 weeks and didnt even know his name, let alone what he was talking about. discussions are pointless and vague. tests, book and discussions are all so different from one another. 1 paper, midterm, final. I have no idea what I was supposed to even get out of this course. Def wasn't what i thought it was going to be. movies SUCKED.",0
"She knows what she is talking about in chemistry, but honestly she is the type of teacher that assumes you get it really fast. She is super nice but a little unorganized. If you go to her after class she will definitely explain it to you which works better for me since I feel like throughout lectures she would rush.",0
Best online prof ever! She was always clear on due dates and is quick to respond to questions/emails. She was very understanding and made things easy to understand.,1
"I normally don't write these, but I felt it was necessary. Mike is the BEST professor I have ever had. He cares about every one of his students as if they were his own kids. He worked to have all our material online so we wouldn't have to pay. He also will do anything he can to make sure he does not miss class. UNR is truly lucky to have him.",1
Harsh grader and doesn't provide rubrics. You never know what he is looking for. Claims that you don't need prior coding experience but still assigns multiple coding assignments without teaching how to code. I also went to his office hours once because my computer wouldn't run program. He couldn't even recommend a specific computer to replace it.,0
"Soh at times is a nice person, but I would not recommend her as a professor for LITED 3115. The class itself is already so much work, but she takes forever to return your work and she'll ask you to completely change your lesson plans the day of teaching them. She doesn't answer your emails and when she does it's not a kind reply. Not worth it.",0
"This is absolutely NOT a class that is meant to be online. The first two months of this class was studying on how to execute a good *informative* speech, and the kicker? The speech had to be given LIVE, as in, OVER THE COMPUTER, and we had to emphasize ""eye contact?"" What a joke. This class should've been cancelled indefinitely.",0
"Thank you professor Qumsiya for being so approachable during the pandemic. Applied Calculus is a high level of Math, and I'm so thankful when professor Qumsiya has live online classes twice a week. Besides, he offers office hours on Zoom which I found extremely helpful. Applied Calculus is not easy, so if you have questions, feel free to ask him.",1
"All I have to say is good luck! This professor is a very tough grader and gives tons upon tons of homework. There were always various assignments due at one time, whether it be a lab, worksheets, or online homework. I took 20 units last semester and never had as much homework in all of my classes combined than I did for this single class.",0
Very nice and understood that there is a life outside college.,1
"She means well, but she had a very hard time with my class. Good deal of online work. There is a lot of self study needed for this class. Its almost like teaching yourself. ",0
Maril taught the honors version for SOCI2110 and he was very demeaning. It felt like a true lecture versus discussion and we just had to swallow and accept his ideas. He said his notes were based on facts but he picked which facts he used and omitted others. Very harsh grader and told me I didn't care about my grades when I went to his office hours,0
"Nice guy, teaching skills just OK... I miss the woman they had teaching here last year :(",1
"First time professor and extremely demanding. Mandatory activities include: learning how to play a pan flute, dancing during lecture, and having to write a 5-page ethnography paper. TAs were amazing but discussions were not helpful at all. 3 quizzes, multiple choice + essay final, doesnt post slides and no photos. Avoid as much as possible.",0
"Prof is knowledgeable. Very difficult, read lec. before class. 12 online quizzes (7 Pts each). Answer will be either on PP or on ur class notes but not online. 3 exams (the last exam was cumltv). After class lecture, class assgmt needs to be completed before class ends worth 1/2 a pt takes 20-30 mins to complete. 3 individual case assgmt.",0
"Good professor. Hard grader with both exams and essays, but if you go to Prof. Major for help, you will deff get a good grade, because he tells you exactly what you need to know and what he is looking for to get the best grade possible. Participation and attendance are a must but  the better your attendance and participation the better your grade.",1
"I learned a ton in his class. He's very thorough. Lots of notes, but interesting. Definately quirky.",1
"Professor Silva is one of the best professors I have ever had. I have taken this class before, and failed so i was terrified to take it again. Mr. Silva made a difficult subject very manageable and I actually enjoyed coming to his classes. He is funny and always willing to help his students. There is a lot of homework but it helps you understand!",1
I've NEVER had a B in my life in an English class. This is the first time I was given Bs consecutavely on every paper. She offers no feedback & is very unclear with what she is looking for in papers. I should have just left well enough alone and stuck with the original class I was enrolled. Unorganized & very disapointing class.,0
"Sachs was awesome and so was his Social Media class. This was the best 2 credit- 7 week course that could possibly be offered. Do the work every week. Simple assignments and quizzes each week. No need to get intimidated by the work, just don't procrastinate & you will be good.  Cheap books.  Answers e-mails fast & helps if you have a question. TAKE",1
"She was amazing, one of the best teachers or professors I've ever had. lectures make good sense and helps a lot to understand the material",1
"I took her class online and it was great. Just do the work and the readings and you can't fail. She was really fair, really likeable, and extremely helpful. I liked her a lot, I liked the content a lot, and I feel like I learned a ton. The essays were interesting and I feel confident writing essays now. If you can get into her class, do it! ",1
"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible. This was one of the worst classes and worst Professors I have ever had. She was boring and not involved. She never even took the time to lean anyone's names. Terrible Professor and an absolute snooze fest",0
"I loved this class, I love the theories he taught, In fact I still know them. I hate the fact that his Exams are THEORY BASED though. What good theories only for engineers. What good is to memorize with very little applications. Its easy to pass his class. But hard to get A because he takes of A LOT of points for little things. Like wrong sign, -20",0
Dr Wilson is by far the worst professor I have ever had. She requires that your life solely revolve around her class. She assigned 400 question LearnSmarts due in 48 hours. She gives only 20 minutes for a 20 question quiz. She refuses to answer questions in class and calls you unprofessional for asking questions. She cannot explain things at all.,0
"Took this class this summer. 2 exams, one project, HWs, and bonus HW question. 50% on the exam and other 50% on HW, project and learn smart. To be honest, you have easy 50% on your hand and the Bonus HW question. HWs are easy but exams are not that easy. if you learn and understand the concept. This class is an easy A. Do bonus HW question!",1
Nice guy but didn't understand a thing in his class,0
"Dr. Anderson is very knowledgable and thorough in his study of Church History.  His lectures are insightful but narrow and sometimes a rant, he does not respond well to questions from broader views that shred poor light on fundamentalism.  He's certainly biased, and fails to give fair exposure and explanation of opposing view points.",1
"If I could give this professor a zero rating, I would. He has absolutely no care in the world for his students and if you go to him with personal concerns he will send your email to the entire class and then tell you to drop the class. STAY AWAY IF AT ALL POSSIBLE. He tends to ramble and not actually stay on track to what he's teaching.",0
Great teacher... I attended his lectures then would go home and watch them in 2x speed. Do the hw early and go over the test review heavily. He knows his stuff and provides you with all the tools necessary to succeed so take advantage of it. Would highly recommend Mr. Sylvester to anyone.,1
Absolutely awesome professor. Very helpfull and has a very creative teaching style.,1
"He was an amazing teacher, very good at explaining everything in the class and is very clear. He is there to help you when you need it and he wants to see you do good. Very tough grader, and you need to go to class to pass. Put in the work and you should be good. ",1
"Hard to understand because English is not her first language, so she's unhelpful just because it's hard to know what she's saying. If you've had a lot of art instruction in high school, she probably won't teach you a thing - your best bet is to submit a portfolio and try to place out of 1005 altogether.",0
"This professor would pick on specific people. There was one girl in my class who she would be extremely negative towards. She would make fun of her when she wasn't in class, tell her her ideas for projects were terrible with no constructive criticism. She lacked a professional attitude and she seemed to lack compassion for her students.",0
"Oh boy, this was not what I expected when I signed up for his class. I barely passed this class. Its true, he didnt teach and he didnt prepare us for the longest and worst exam of of life. Pure hell with him. At the end he let us retake exams and that helped me pass but I wouldnt ever take this again. F ++++ for his teaching! Worst professor!",0
"Like Professor Ryan, except the other way around, and not interesting.",0
"I am fairly conflicted from her class. i found it very hard to understand what she was saying, but she is very willing to answer questions at the end of class and during office hours. She can sometimes fly through some really hard material in 20 minutes, and then spend 30 minutes demonstrating tangential velocity in the classroom.",1
i highly recommend prof. lundin. he is one of my favorite professor at st.joes! to do good in this class you MUST take good notes and attend every class. if you participate regularly he will love you. he is extremely helpful and made the 3 hour class fly by! take him if you can!,1
"I took this class for my ""literature beyond ENGL1102"" credit, and I don't regret it. Betsy is super straightforward about her expectations, and as long as you make quizlet sets for each unit and do your homework, you should make an easy A. Her only drawback is that she's a very slow grader, but she is a grad student so that's kind of understandable",1
"This guy has a HUGE ego and it shows. He also claims he will confiscate your phone if it is found to even be on during his class. When asked if the exception would be made if the student is a first responder (EMT, firefighter, police officer, etc.) who is on call, he says you should just take a different class. It even says this in his syllabus.",0
"Worst professor I've had in MAE and gave a bad impression for what to expect from the department. Homeworks were extremely difficult with really tough math, office hours are treated like an extension of lecture such that if you can't make it to both, you're going to do poorly in the class. Exams unrelated to homework, super hard, worth 50% of grade",1
A very scholarly professor who knows her stuff. She is passionate about writing and wants all students to improve. Such a sweet person. Really goes out of her way. The way she treats disrespect by killing with kindness is remarkable.,1
This professor goes extremely fast and does not really explain much.  All she does it go over a lot of problems and a couple of the problems that are not done in class are on home works etc.  She is not to helpful at explaining the material.  Also when she asks if anyone has questions she give like 2 seconds before moving on to other problems.,0
Professor was obviously new but semester got better over time.,1
"Do not take him. Do EVERYTHING you can to avoid his World Civ gen ed class. His expectations are absolutely ridiculous, and his tests are impossible. I've been in a number of times to his office hours and he is NOT helpful. If its between not having enough credits, and taking his class, take the less credits. Avoid him for a gen ed class.",0
Awesome teacher! Project at the end seemed like the scariest part but we got 100% just for doing it. She's super funny and cares about the individual person you are,1
"HARD CLASS.  Not an easy grader AT ALL.  I didn't get an A on any of her papers.  (she actually gave me two 89%, like come on..just give me the 90%)  Shes very very nice, but tough.",1
"If I could add another tag, it would be ""Lecture Heavy""",1
there are Wiley Plus online assignments which you have to submit at the end of every week. The number of questions are numerous and reading the notes she provides won't be enough as the assignments touch all topics of the chapter which she won't talk about in detail. Having a text and reading it will be vital to your success as she expects you to.,1
"I think he is pretty average. He actually delivers his passion for economics throughout the lectures, and it is pretty clear for me. He is pretty fast while teaching. You have to choose good group members for your group, and ensure what you guys did in his weekly assignment is all from his mouth. Also, he is kind of unapproachable.",1
"She was boring, but the class was easy. I would not recommend her to anyone else, unless they want to pass out.",1
"He's a funny guy and I don't have anything against him as a person, but as a professor he leaves something to be desired. He can and will ramble the whole class, and he's a very confusing grader; he rarely gives a reason for the grades he gives and although attendance is mandatory, he picks and chooses what days he actually takes it. He's just eh.",0
"Professor Vannier rambles a bit but is an okay professor. You can easily pass the class by completing the weekly quiz during lectures and briefly skimming the lecture slides. Anything difficult is pretty easy to figure out with at most a couple minutes of searching. The text book is a waste of time, the internet can suffice.",1
"Seems like a nice lady when you first meet her, her teaching style is awful and if you ask for help, you have to beg. She does not let you make up missed quizzes or exempt anything. I would not suggest you take this class with her because it should've been a lot easier then she made it. GET OUT ASAP",0
"I think hes a good professor, and probably way better in person. He tried his best but the course just wasnt structured well, and the grading criteria was practically non-existent. Kind of difficult to figure out what hes looking for.. two assignments, midterm & final essay. Answer a series of questions (5) about 1/2-2 pg each.",1
I'm a senior year grade A student with a 3.94 GPA. She's very rude and a very tough grader. Before taking this class i went through this website and was skeptical at first since this is a class where you constantly have to talk and contribute to discussions and keep writing so much only to realize that you have received a 70% on the homework,0
"I thought CMST would not be that hard at all. This teacher makes it 10 times harder than it should be. Her quizzes are outrageously hard even if you study for them, read the textbook, and listen to the podcasts. She talks WAY too much she usually only gets through a slide per class. She is a tough grader. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HER",0
"She is so entertaining and such a great professor. Lectures are pretty tolerable because she's so animated. There are pop quizzes, but she only counts a handful of them so its not really worth stressing if you don't show up/fail it. The only annoying things about this course is that there's a lot of reading every night.",1
Her lectures are very interesting but not really that helpful for exam preparation. She basically expects you to learn everything by yourself so she's able to talk about the extra things that ultimately are unimportant. She never explains how to do questions but only goes through the answers because she expected you to learn it yourself.,1
"If youre good at memorizing, take him. His tests are solely based off few things from the horribly boring book he assigns and random things he says in lecture. Pay attention and youll make an easy A. He truly wants you to succeed in life. Hes very awkward at times which is funny. Too bad you have to show up since his class is easy.",1
"He is most definitely not politically correct in the way he speaks and often comes off as arrogant. Gary, however, cares about teaching and pushes his students to think critically. He does not hand out easy grades but, if you put in the work you will do fine. There were two take-home tests 4 papers, and a presentation. These make up most of grade.",1
"This guy is a donkey. I will never in my life on earth take this class again with him teaching it. He don't offer extra help In lab, you have to beg for it. He make rude comments trying to be funny. The professor takes mechanical pencils way too serious. Can't use regular pencils or pens. There was 6 people remainding out of 30 students. HEART LESS",0
awesome. turbo wedns night. one of my favorite professors. made me laugh all throughout class. shes very smart and funny. and i learned a lot,1
"The material was difficult, but the professor had good humor and vast knowledge of Latin American culture that he integrated into the linguistic learning. He is a very much effective teacher. He is even more effective during his office hours. The tests are the only thing I would change, as even a slight spelling error gives you a 0 on the question.",1
"I've had her for other classes and she couldn't be a better teacher! Lectures are real-world and supplement the book. It's not an easy course, but stick with it and you'll be proud of your final creation (from scratch). I liked that the chapter tests could be taken online on my schedule. Fair grader. Best not to get behind.",1
"Almost no classroom management skills or actual teaching. While he sat at the desk grading papers, everyone just spent the period talking really loudly, playing on their phones, and leaving whenever they felt like it.  Also, Norton showed movies around 12 out of 30 days. You've been warned!!!",0
"I personally hate this class. The layout of the class makes no sense. The countries are scattered and the order is not related. He constantly talks about the ""Universal Pattern of Culture"" which is in no other academic source online or otherwise. The only source I have found that has anything similar contrasts his definitions completely.",0
I would not take this professor if you are really wanting to learn biology. He gets off topic very easily and his notes taken in class do not correlate to the test. He takes attendance at different times during lecture but if you leave early will change it to show absent.,0
"Prof. Morra is wild. He's funny in all his lectures and keeps you entertained. Exams and final are minimum 12 pg papers. You have to start essays WAY before the due date to finish on time cause they're long. Can type them straight from your notes and get an A. Show up, takes notes, pass. Can skip a few times but you'll miss notes. Sports fan too",1
"This was the worst professor I've ever had. I'm so disappointed that SVSU employs someone who could care less about his students success. Makes his students feel stupid, scared to ask questions, and does not try to help you in any way. Tried telling me I plagiarized a paper this semester even though I went to the writing center for help! AVOID HIM",0
"This is an extremely easy class, but also extremely pointless. None of the information is useful, so she does try to make it a little interesting but it is hopeless. You print out the notes for class so there is little effort involved. Just memorize and know the general concepts for the test and it is a breeze.",1
"Professor demanded perfection from students while constantly being late on his promises to the class. He pushed deadline for the final assignment 3 times, totaling two weeks and and kept failing to provide the assignment specs. In the end, he didn't even provide what he had promised and basically said ""too bad."" There were also lectures missing.",0
I have this class as a requirement and is hard she gives lots to study over the weeks and when you try to contact her she misses you or not respond. I wouldn't take her at all get another class people. Most of the work is online but if you don't pass the test in person forget it.,0
"Easiest professor ever. 1/3 of your grade is quizzes which are easy if you skim through the chapters, 1/3 is attendance which now you only have to go 6 times a semester, and 1/3 is the final which is now a 4-6 page paper with 6-10 slides outlining the paper that you can work on with 1-2 other people. Take this class with a difficult class.",1
Professor Z is a good teacher but this class is definitely not an easy A. She is a harsh grader and can sometimes be too harsh of a grader. Do not take her course if you don't want to put the work in. I had an A for pretty much the entire semester but then it went down to a B because she started grading harder. Do not take her!,0
"When it comes to teaching, he doesn't know how to do it. He may understand math himself, but the way that he teaches it leaves everyone utterly confused. I know that it wasn't just me that wasn't getting the material because the whole class was completely clueless every day. I had to teach myself all the material and spent hours learning it at home",0
"Dr. David G. Schuster gives awesome lectures. He is very passionate about the subject he teaches which makes the class all that more interesting. Only takes grades on four papers and two exams. Exams are all essay, so break out your pen.",1
"Great teacher! He knows what he is talking about. Straight to the point, very smart man and very helpful! I would definitely recommend him to anyone.",1
"He was a good, experienced professor, however, I would definitely appreciate the class more if he was more engaging during lectures and didn't just buzz on for 3 hours. That was my only problem. Overall, he was a pleasure to have as a professor.",1
"We are currently a month into class and I don't think the class as a whole is keeping up. We had a journal entry due today and when she asked who *didn't* turn it in, 80% of the class raised their hand. This is not a class problem, but a failure on the part of the professor to properly communicate what is due. already dreading the rest of the year",0
A very great German class. Class wasn't too difficult with many quizzes and written assignments to make it so your grade isn't dependent only a few things. Homework each class but it's easy and just checked for completion. As long as you show up and engage you'll do well.,1
"He is very nice and respects students. He is also very empathic, effective and teaches so that students would understand the concepts. Try to attend class and pay attention and you would pass. If possible record his lectures and make your notes from it. His exams are not difficult if you listen to him in class.",0
Very opinionated and does not take or teach other opinions very well.,0
He is a fun teacher and makes taking core history fun. He uses slides which helps with taking notes and as long as you show up to class you will understnad the material as he explains it extremely well. Would take him again.,1
Great professor. Really got me interested in ecology even more than i already was. I am taking his Bio 492 class and it is awesome,1
"I cannot speak for in person learning, but IF DISTANCE LEARNING EVER HAPPENS AGAIN, DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR'S CLASS! Maybe he's more engaging in person, but over the computer- NO HELP AT ALL! ZERO class participation, just reads off his powerpoint. Doesn't explain content. But, he did provide all the materials to BB for you to teach yourself.",0
"Obviously a very smart man, but he showed up to lectures late more often than not and was unprepared for them the vast majority of the time. Taking this class over the summer with him was probably a bad idea, considering the pacing and that he was hardly ever available outside of class.",0
"Veryyy good professor, he is clear and helps his students alot. A Good man.",1
"100% recommend him for stats227 if youre going to LATTC! If he was able to teach every class I needed to graduate, Id choose him as my only professor! Very patient! He makes sure you understand before moving on, gives extra credit for participation, Attendance is MANDATORY! Hed rather drop you than fail you, so do your part! Youll enjoy math!",1
"Dr. Mehta is one of the best professors I have ever had thus far. His assignments take time and effort, but are carefully crafted so as to effectively teach the material and do not feel like 'busy work'. Beyond this, Dr. Mehta is a genuine and caring person who likes to get to know his students.",1
"Very good professor. He is passionate about chemistry and that shows in his lectures.  Chemistry was never an easy subject for me but the way he taught and explained it made it easier.  He is extremely kind, but expects you to try your best. He is very fair with grading (partial credit) and gives extra credit if a lot of people do bad on a test.",1
"Note: He's semi-retired, only teaches part-time now.  Definitely the best Psych teacher I've ever had. Stars every class with 'joke of the day' (always corny ones), very succinct and straightforward in lectures. Tests are easy if you pay attention and take notes. Engaging and fun. Definitely recommended.",1
She was extremely rude and was constantly calling out students. She was also very unclear with assignments and got pissy when people messed up. She would walk around the class and stand over people's shoulders all the time as well. I did well in this class but she made me uncomfortable.,0
"Her integrity is lacking. She talks badly about clients, and about other students. She doesn't explain anything and then gets angry when students are confused. Her syllabus is a disaster, as is her BB site. She expects you to live and breath her class, and kiss her butt. But she will always pass you because it reflects badly on her if she doesn't.",0
turtles all the way down,1
Her exams are a mess. Some questions I swear is from her nursing practitioner background and nothing to do with the course. Brags about herself,0
"Very poor instructor. Classes consisted of confusing slides and even more confusing explanations. She seemed very disinterested in the material covered. If you read the books and decipher the slides, you'll pass.",0
"Had Dr. Collier for PSC 141 & 142. Very laid back teaching style. Grading criteria is simple and fair to everyone. Only 3 tests for the semester (4th optional), so take good notes during lectures. Most test questions (mult. choice) come from lecture notes and power points, but READ chapters. FANTASTIC TEACHER! Definitely recommend this class!",1
He was nice at first but he clearly wants there to be a hierarchy of grades in his class. It's like he doesn't want to give out A's to people that log on for class every day and TRY. He's rude & queeny and sometimes he makes offensive & shady remarks. His grading is very nit picky and he loves giving you a borderline grade. Take with someone else!,0
"Dr. Haspel assigns journal assignments almost every class period, which are surprisingly fun and easy. He assigns 4 large papers a year, and no midterm. He is a great teach who is more than willing to help any student. He is also very funny and interesting to listen to.",1
"doesnt take attendance which is awesome....basically your grade only depends on the 5 tests over the semester, you pass those your fine..homework is easy,he goes over it in class and you can get your answers there and i loved that he gave you credit on tests for trying even if you got the wrong answer, but he was really softspoken hard to hear",0
She's cool but a super hard grader you won't get higher than a B. Don't take her,0
I've had Clark for three semesters now and she is one of the best teachers I have ever had in my entire life!  She's always there to help you out when you need it and will even look over papers that you don't write for her class.  She defintely deserves an,1
Very funny and interesting,1
"I would avoid this teacher He was unclear on which book we should have, he currently has the incorrect copy. He claimed we gave him the wrong answer saying ""PEMDAS"" then went on to explain PEMDAS. Talks very quietly and writes very small. If you can't change classes I would sit up front, get a tutor and hope for the best.",0
She is by far my favorite teacher here at STAC. She's so passionate about English and seeing her students do well. She is such an amazing professor that I am taking her again next semester. She makes hard topics more bearable. YOU MUST USE THE TEXTBOOK FOR THIS CLASS!!,1
"He was a great professor, all his lectures were entertaining and made you reflect a lot on personal issues or something that may be going on with your life. Do all the homework and you'll pass with flying color, easy grader as long as your answer seems like there was effort put into it",1
He was my absolute favorite professor. He gives you readings before every class but they are not that long and most are enjoyable. Sometimes he gives pop quizzes on them but they are not difficult. The final is a two minute speech on any topic! One of the nicest guys I have met. He even threw a BBQ for his students at the end of the semester.,1
"Marvyn is great, he really cares about his students success and will go above and beyond to help you. I thought I hated math until I took his course! He tries his best to relate concepts to everyday life which really helps.",1
Dr. Kim has an accent that is hard to understand. I went to her office and she made me feel like I wasn't worthy to even be in Ochem because of my score. She is not nice outside of class and she is overall not good at teaching.,0
"The better professor's class was full so I had to take Felber. She is a very strict grader. I'm a senior and have never encountered such harsh grading. Sociolinguistics can be a challenging subject. Don't add to that difficulty a teacher who subtracts points for petty, nonsubstantial reasons. If you must take the class, choose someone else.",0
"Erika was one of the worst professors I ever had. She's very rude and only lectures. She showed us really boring movies also and I wanted to fall asleep every day in there. I enjoy history and anthropology, but this class made me question that. Also, the readings were so long and hard to do. Please don't take her class.",0
"Don't take marketing with her. Night class sucks the way it is; she makes it worse. She reads directly off the powerpoint slides the whole time, but takes attendance for points so you have to go. You'll have a marketing plan that gives hardly any direction & takes hours of outside work & still fail. Her tests are nearly impossible, so good luck.",0
"Dr Costanza gives a fail-proof lecture in World Religion. You have a whole week to complete two short assignments, and some weeks there's only one assignment. A couple easy, short writing pieces, a brief anthropological study, and you're on your way to an A! A passionate teacher, but often unforgiving about missing class or work.",1
One of the worst economics professors i have come across.,0
Dr. Collins was so focused on the students she knew from the psyc department that she gave little attention to anyone else. She does not post her lectures on BlackBoard so attending class is a must. She is a difficult grader on papers and will take 10-15 points if you do not structure it the way she prefers (even if content is there).,0
Mrs. Fritz Is an amazing teacher! I've learned so much about the field of education.   She is very knowledgeable when it comes to topics in education.  I highly recommend taking her.,1
"Kendra is amazing.  She makes everything interesting, and I love how excited she gets about ideas.  Take her class - it will teach you to write, but more than that, she will teach you to see the world around you in ways you never have.",1
This Professor is very helpful.You have to read the chapters and do the worksheets he gives out.Exams are easy and he reviews with you before the exam what other prof.does that?You'll love him!If you don't pass something is wrong with you not with him. Take him you'll learn a lot!,1
Very kind and caring PROF. Strongly recommend her!,1
Her class was full of notes and online slides. Yes i admit her tests required very detailed answers but i mean its college for a reason. She always tried to make the class laugh and is a very laud back and non egotistic professor,1
"The first day of the class took 45 minutes to do attendance. The class consists of him reading off the textbook with no visuals except his forehead through the camera. No canvas, everything is done through email. 3rd class meeting consisted of him figuring out how to use his mic with tech support there in the call for an hour. Would've scored a 0.",0
"Professor is so sweet. She went out of her way to offer me honors designation in the class and met with me every week. If you take notes on the textbook chapter before class, you'll be fine! You're able to send your papers to her ahead of time and she gives great feedback.",1
"Professor Keating is a great professor. Participation is essential and if you follow his revision instructions it always goes well. I really liked this class and was afraid of writing at first, but I settled into it pretty quickly. I worked hard at this class, but came away with an A",1
An excellent professor who is wise in her opinions. The only way for this professor to have ANY bad rating at all would be for the student to NOT follow directions- which I didn't. I can still compliment this professor on her professionalism and wonderful understanding of the world. Beautiful inside and out- she never struggles to keep it real.,1
"I hnonestly can say that Leslie Looney is the only reason I go to class (that, and the iclicker credit). I can't say that I've actually learned anything in this class, though Looney is fairly entertaining.",1
"This was the worst class I took this semester and I don't recommend to anybody. He does not explain instructions very well. He moves onto new topics very quickly without asking. He does not use canvas to assign us homework, grade or discuss material. Makes us text him via cellphone to send assignments. His phone rings often over zooms. Trash class.",0
"English majors will love him, underclassmen who have to take cores will not. Dr. Caldwell is the quintessential Literature professor. He knows everything about anything; the man is literally a genius. He appreciates originality, so try to be creative with papers. My love of literature has increased significantly because of him. Highly recommended.",1
"Very smart man, definitely has considerable knowledge in terms of sound reinforcement. However, his tests are unnecessarily difficult  and most of the questions on the test don't pertain the textbook, lectures, or study guides he hands out. I would not recommenced taking this class if you have no experience working with sounds systems.",0
"I am a history major here at HSU and I have never encountered such an awfully taught class. The way I look at things, she is much more focused on making things difficult rather than making sure students understand. I have never been more stressed out and frustrated than in this class. I will be avoiding her for the rest of of my time here at HSU.",0
just don't do it,0
He's a nice guy but doesn't teach. Just hands out packets during class so you basically have to teach yourself the material.,0
Genius!!!!! :),1
"Very easy class the only thing you need to worried about is the quizzes, the two mid terms, and the paper which is easy. For the quizzes I would highly suggest you bring some type of voice recorder  because when he goes over the quiz the class before, he talks kind of fast...but its a pretty easy class.",1
If you need anything he is there for you. He loves his job and it shows. He wants people to succeed. I would take him again. There is no assigned homework in the class. ,1
"amazing teacher, really passionate about the subject and makes you think way past the text. sometimes reading could get boring but it wasn't always necessary to read. discussions were usually really interesting. not as hard of a grader as i thought he would be. definitely take this class if you're even remotely interested!",1
Tony Bass is awesome! His online class last semester was great!,1
"The definition of 'One of the best teachers you will ever have'. She really teaches you what you need to know, and actually makes learning grammar and the overall subject bearable. I can't reccommend this teacher highly enough.",1
"He's a really funny guy and his lectures are pretty enjoyable. There is a lot of material and he does iclicker questions in class. The material is not that hard to grasp, but there is a lot of memorization and some of his questions can be a little bit tricky. That being said all his midterms were 100% multiple choice.",1
"Dear Black Students, DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. Unless you want to sit in a 3 hr night class and listen to your classmates demean us. If you can handle that then its a super easy A. But if youd like to keep your peace of mind. STEER CLEAR. Discusses black topics. Without the discussion. Great for your gpa, horrible for your mental stability.",0
"Marna is a recent grad student. She says the same words always: ""Thinking of this idea of."" you'll get tired of it quick. And if you ask her a question she'll say ""ok so what we're gonna do"" and literally give you no answer. However, she is a very nice grader and a nice person. Sometimes passive aggressive but overall not bad. would recommend.",0
This professor will not reply to your emails and never sent out emails regarding our assignments. Our class was left with nothing and his syllabus was super unclear. He cut class short due to COVID-19 but never graded any of our work; even as a I write this I dont know my grade in the course due to his poor involvement with the class.,0
I was not looking forward to public speaking but his class made it easy because of how well he reached his class and directed it.,1
GREAT PROFESSOR MY FAV.,1
"This is the absolute worst prof I have had. I CAN'T stress this enough, do not take his class if you want to pass. I am an amazing student, and I never once missed class, but he still managed to confuse me more and more. I also went to the tutoring for his class and STILL managed to not do well. Also, he only grades based on the THREE tests. BEWARE",0
this class is very frustrating. She gets corrected almost everyday in class. Her teaching method is to just read from the projector and not explain anything. She clearly lacks confidence in this subject. Her tests and even quizes are riduculously hard compared to how she teaches.,0
"I thought her class was a little dull, but looking back (after studying some of the same data structures in another class) she did a great job of explaining.",1
"I took this class online and because of that her lecture videos were very long, however, she prepared me for exactly what was on the homework and the quizzes were just HW problems with different numbers. Accounting isn't easy but she is a great teacher. Also, i recommend to take this online because the at-home video is the same as being in class.",1
"She's adorable but she does have her moments of sarcasm which come off a little rude. She provided us with a website to access the online textbook for free. We had 3 speeches which were straight forward for the most part, study for quizzes and tests cause that'll certainly help your grade! Overall I hated presenting but its not too bad if you prep.",1
"Don't take him!!!!!!! Boring, sarcastic, and a very tough grader. Class is only based on essays no book work.",0
I wouldn't recommend takin Professor Ni. She lectures a lot from her head which is okay but sometimes she forgets and there is no energy in the way she teaches so it's very easy for students to not be interactive with her.,0
"Great lecturer with great examples. You have to put A TON of work into this class (homework takes at least 3 days, if you don't want to burn yourself out), but it's super interesting and directly appllicable to the field of chemical engineering.",1
"Ratana is a pretty awful instructor who can struggles to explain the most basic concepts of operating systems. He recycles assignments, quizzes, and tests, and he teaches this class pretty often, so it shouldn't be difficult to find resources from previous semesters. ",0
I always enjoy Dr. Walker's class. He has a story for ever speech. He gives feedback to improve your delivery of speech. He is lenient to his students but do not take advantage. Do your work and put effort into it. Deliver with confidence and make sure you practice your speech beforehand. Wonderful instructor. I will take his other classes if any.,1
"just stay at home, read the book, u will be fine",0
"Despite doing well in the class, I feel that Professor Cain is a professor that I would avoid in the future. Her style of teaching and constant miscommunication made it difficult for others to receive a better grade. She is very hard on grading, and will never allow you to rewrite if you missed peer-review.",0
"Professor Sokchea is a very nice guy and knows a lot about economics. But this class was very difficult, his test were very hard and he wasn't very good at preparing us for the test. Also DO NOT forget to do a homework, you'll need those points.",0
"If you have the chance to take a class from LaBelle you must! She is so nice and down to earth. There is one midterm and a final but she provides study guides for both, but they are very easy. Lots of chances to boost your grade. She really cares about the students and makes sure to get to know each of us. Cant wait for another class with LaBelle",1
"He knows his stuff, but he is very arrogant. If you don't know something he will put you down and say you shouldn't be out in public not knowing the answer. He gives a ridiculous amount of work, so don't try to take this class as an elective or if you are busy. He comes across as nice, but send him an email for help and you won't get any.",0
Professor Hansen is the best professor I have had at the University. He made me think about things  I never had and gives you a new worthwhile perspective. His class was an hour and fifteen minutes and I never felt the need to look at my phone because what he says is so compelling. Not to mention he is also hilarious. Take any class you can w/ him!,1
"Provides vague instructions. When asked to clarify, he said he couldn't waste time on my questions.  A few times he changed the focus/ parameters of an assignment, but the updated requirements were buried in his response to another student's DB post. His feedback is  a generic form; unhelpful, & mixed in a copy of the assignment instructions",0
"All I can say is: RUN! She does NOT give out A's, I did all assignments perfectly and still got a B. She literally takes off points for no reason. If English is not your first language, you are screwed because she expects a perfect grammar essay on nutrition EVERY week. She seems to enjoy ruining lives. She is the WORST TEACHER I'VE EVER HAD!!!!!!!",0
"Avoid her class like the plague. The content would be interesting if she wasn't teaching it, she uploads 80% empty slides on D2L and excepts you to do well somehow. Our 2nd midterm was 12 powerpoints with roughly 90 slides in each one, so 1080 slides for 1 midterm lol. Should retire since the only thing she's good at is lowering your GPA.",0
"Worst professor at QC. NOT accessible outside of class, she doesn't answer emails. Disorganized, opens the submission link weeks after assignments are due. Boring, we read straight out of the textbooks during class discussions even though reading the textbook was our homework. She will call on you and make you feel dumb if you don't know the answer",0
"Honestly disappointed since I thought this class would be greatI'm interested in the topic. However, for the vagueness of her teaching, her tests are extremely specific and trickily worded. I felt like she was trying to trick us the whole time I was taking her tests and it was really frustrating to know you studied your hardest but won't get an A.",0
He is a very good teacher and makes understanding business very easy. He is funny sometimes and i highly recommend!,1
Such a kind forgiving lady.  She's enthusiastic about biology and that shows in her work. If you miss an assignment she'll most likely work with you. My only gripe with the class is that at some points in the lectures a few students made it hard to pay attention. She's trying her best though and it shows. I reccomend.,1
"This was supposed to be a 2 professor course, but it ended up being just her. Honestly it was such a horrible course and very dreadful. 99% of the people in this class NEVER paid attention to her. Kinda felt bad, kinda didn't. Don't bother emailing her, she'll never reply. Nice person, horrible professor. If you don't mind busy work it's an easy A",0
"Took this course online, I think it might have been easier to take in class. Decent marker, but is not really clear on expectations. Assigns 3, 8-paged papers, doesn't care what the content is only penalizes you if its not 8 pages. This course makes you think outside the box, prepare for many personal discussions with the rest of your classmates.",0
"He was a substitute for SPAN317. Even though he wasn't teaching his material, Prof. Newall still put in his best effort, was there for questions and concerns and made sure the class understood the materials before the exams. I really respect his dedication to the class.",1
One of the best course taken in this semester,1
"not the best teacher in the world. its a good class but the teacher has her own expectations. my previous teachers have made english pretty interesting which motivated me to actually read, she made the class very bland. if you don't like english much, this is not the class for you",0
"I took this class for a general education credit, and I'm not a biology major. His class was hard but definitely passable. You have to get the textbook and you have to go to class if you want to pass the tests. His lectures were fun and very informative and he did a lot of in class activities.",1
"Super Hard grader. The pop quizzes are worth most of your final grade. At least telling students about the quizzes even one day beforehand will help. There was a pandemic going on, and I felt like the guidelines were so harsh considering the state of mind so many people were in. He doesn't think about the students and doesnt grade fairly. UGHHHH",0
"As a senior I regret taking this class w/ him. Attendance is not mandatory but is graded on icklicker questions, u only get points if u got the answer right to the question he asked. Homework is due every week. U never know what ur actual grade is in the class because he hides it on canvas which is very frustrating when studying for multiple exams",0
Professor Persaud hands down one of the best professors at southwest. She really does care about students. Make sure you attend class as it is important. You review everything in class. Give test reviews and basically theyre the same as the review. Books are need but both are inexpensive.,1
Took Prof Kumari for Macro and OH BOY... the work load is a lot.  I took her over the summer so the class was over before I even knew it. Every week 4 chapters of 10q homework and 10q quiz + a discussion + an exam.  She offers extra credit which I highly recommend  and she's a solid choice but get ready for butt- hours (about 20 or so/ week),1
"Eager is a very compassionate guy and tries to be as helpful as possible, I recommend him, every math class is tough if math isn't your strong suite",1
"He is a really good and nice guy but his class is pretty difficult. He loves physics and trying to make the class get involved. But a lot of what he says isn't in the textbook. There's a quiz everyday when you walk into class on a half of a chapter that you have to read and teach yourself, which is a bit annoying.",1
do not recommend if you care about your GPA. the tests were all hard and he also had many assignments.,0
This is an online course.  The semester is over and there are still unanswered e-mails that need a response. Not a good communicator at all.,0
This class was very easy as you can find most of the answers online. The only thing that frustrated me the most is that she was no help outside of class. Whenever you would ask her a question she would tell us to refer to the syllabus or her announcement. It was very frustrating as the answer was never there. She made getting help so difficult.,0
"Really funny guy and wears funny space shirts every day. Interesting subject and i got an A, but you have to do the 3 homeworks and random extra credit opportunities. On the homeworks, read the questions carefully and only answer what he asks. Nice dude. try to show up b/c there's no attendance sheet",1
Cared more about covering textbook from cover to cover than teaching the material. Be prepared to teach yourself the course. Speaks so fast that you lose him within minutes. Exam format is ridiculous- stay far away from this professor. Waste of time and money. Touro really needs to re-evaluate who they hire as adjuncts.,0
"Nice dude, but you dont learn anything in his classes!",0
"Not a very respectful teacher.  She cuts you off in the middle of your sentence and tries to assume what you were going to say.  If you don't share your opinion she tries to discredit you.  The class is extremely easy.  All you do is watch movies, read long (sometimes boring) articles and write a 1/2 page summary.  Elementary school stuff.",1
"If you don't think his way, you're screwed. Don't even think out of the box. Just go with the most boring standard ideas there are and you will get a good grade. Usually, teachers that are interesting like out of the box ideas but this guy, forget all about it",0
"He is an amazing instructor. Makes class interesting with his story telling. Technically there is a lot of reading, a few hundred pages, but you do not have to necessarily read it all to get a good grade. I only did half the readings, showed up, and tried on the exam and got an A+. Easiest A I've ever had. Only dedicated 30 min a week to this class",1
"Yes, Gennady Bachman can be rude sometimes but he is definitely one of the best math teachers out there. He can decompose a really hard topic to something even a kid can understand. I would definitely recommend him because he makes it so easy to understand. I get that he is rude sometimes but if you give him a legitimate question, he will answer it",1
great prof! super nice and caring,1
"Mrs. Perez isn't bad as she's described here. I do agree with others who say she is tough bc she is, but what most ppl don't understand is you actually have to actively read to understand the material. It's not a hard course. It takes discipline to properly prepare for any class. If you genuinely want to take this class for its content, go ahead",1
"If you have to take a class for CHM2340, don't even bother taking this professor. Most of the time you won't understand what he is saying. His Exams are TOUGH; I've studied all of the content he explained, it didn't help at all. YouTube teaches better than this guy. Attendance check on Friday be careful.",0
After the switch to online he decided not to use zoom or any other video software. Every week he just posts some notes and homework numbers. He's more of an assigner than a teacher.,0
"he is a great prof he knows how to keep me awake in class, he is so hip and up to the times, sometimes more than me!!!! i would totally say take all his classes!!!!",1
Really cool teacher with a great sense of humor. I learned a lot too.,1
Really fun prof. Made French grammar interesting. I am excited to take another course from her!,1
"I appreciate the effort he puts in to try to make the class engaging, but at the end of the day what matters is his ability to teach and properly assess the material, which is mediocre at best. Seems to lack empathy for students. When the exam average was in the 50's, he just said that was normal and made no effort to help or improve.",0
"The worst professor I have encountered. His rudeness, disrespect, and attitude are so poor. The guy clearly has issues and needs some help. Do not take his class unless if you want to experience his poor grading skills.",0
You'd be a fool no to sign up for this class immmediately! She is very understanding of situations. Just do the few simple essays that she clearly explains and study for the few quizzes that she gives a study guide for and clearly explains and you should get an A. Highly recommended!!,1
"Awesome teacher! Love his vibe, and humor in the class. Made learning guitar fun, and enjoyable.",1
Professor Rice is very rude to students. She takes forever to grade quizzes and lab reports. She is a tough grader on both (especially lab reports). I got anxiety walking to her class because I was worried I had done something wrong and she would kick me out of lab (which she did one time because a student wore the wrong type of socks). Avoid her!,0
Mr. Lovio was GREAT he is an easy teacher and makes class so much fun. I missed 4 classes and turned in all my homework assignments late and still passed the class. He is A wonderful teacher and has lots of knowledge.,1
"She teaches scatterbrained.  One of the basic qualities a teacher should have is organization, but she doesn't have it.  I had an A on all the assignments, but did poorly on the tests because I had to jump around so much in my notes to study just one topic.  People who have had the subjects covered in this class before have the advantage on tests.",0
"she is the sweetest lady ever!! she just makes me smile b/c she's so sweet. her class was so easy, her test were too. as long as you pay attention to her lecture your good...even if you dont, alot of her questions are common sense. the papers were super easy. I recommended her to my friends and they love her!!",1
"I hated this class. Pia is not a very understanding person, nor does she understand many american customs. I do not think she is the right person to be teaching an introductory spanish class.",0
"Dr. Pekarske was an awful teacher.  If you want to get a good grade (I somehow ended up with an A), your papers need to have very little information, a lot of fluff, a lot of questions, and you need to figure out how she likes stuff written.  She canceled class a lot which was nice, but there are definitely much better english 100 teachers at UMBC.",0
Out of he twelve things we were supposed to cover in the class we only covered two. The whole class revolved in a philosophy he claimed would be famous one day (he made it up). We literally talked about the same thing everyday. The class was a major disappointment and he acted immature when students disagreed with his philosophy. Run while you can.,0
"No matter how interested you think you are in this subject, trust me, it's not enough to justify taking this class. Impossibly hard.",0
No Comments,0
"He is extremely pretentious, does not post powerpoints, goes extremely fast in class and get's mad when someone asks for clarification. Put more effor into this class than any other ones and still ended up with a C.",0
"Awesome Guy! He listens and teaches well!! not good for students of little patience/effort, but awesome class!!",1
"Horrible professor, so rude and reads straight from power points, doesn't actually teach. Tests are confusing. Read the anatomy textbook because it's your only chance of passing.",0
"Difficult class, but you will def learn how to write. He is a great guy.",1
"I LOVE LINDA LIN. She is absolutely fantastic. Take ANY class you can with her! She really takes the time to make sure everyone understands, and while the work can be hard, it's not unmanagable. Plus, everything is super interesting. Love her!",1
"The class has about 12 labs, run by a different TA for each week. The lectures before the labs were very dry. Make sure you read the lab manuals to complete lab reports. The final exam was extremely difficult and no one expected it. Know everything about everything if you want to do well on the final and get an A in the class.",0
I went to every class paid attention. Went for tutoring in math lab & nothing helped. When he gave the first test the info seemed foreign to me. I wouldn't advise taking him.,0
He is funny and full of energy.,1
"I took this course online. I thought I knew a lot about computers, but this introduced me to the world of office. I have been able to use this class for my own personal life. Expectations are clear cut, and you have multiple chances to take tests. It's an easy A, but projects can take a little time. ",1
"The professor taught an online course that was not ADA or 508 compliant. The course had only five assignments in the grade-boo and absolutely no online discussions. If the course ended on a Monday, no assignments were graded until the Saturday before, two days before the course ended.",0
"One of the smartest professors I have had at WMU. If you are a finance major, you want this guy to be your best friend. However, his class is tough. Go to class and know the numbers. If ya don't, welp, your parents couch is hopefully still open.",1
"Professor Murphy is easily sidetracked and very disorganized. Our class was unable to cover even half of the material intended for the course. This caused many students to not take the class seriously and become rude and disruptive, making for a bad learning environment. The final grade was based on a total of three assignments.",0
"Hes a decent guy but the way he teaches class is ridiculous. Your grade is based off of 2 exams and the final and for the 2 exams he grades so hard. Theres vocab with no word bank, any little detail he takes off points, hes just not a good professor, do everything you can to avoid him in order to save your gpa",0
almost through with the class and still dont know whats going on. not recommended! ,0
"I took him for a CIT 170 class and he was insanely amazing. I am generally a bit slower in school so an online class was very confusing for me, well for the START. I met with him twice and he really did help clarify it with TONS of patients. He literally sat there with me while we did one of my tutorials for over an hour. Take him if you can!",1
Very intelligent Professor who teaches in a style that many do not like.  He lays out what is required to do well in the class and many refuse to listen.,1
"Very easy class to sit in and not pay attention if you want to...but if you want to participate, its really difficult because she likes to talk. Very opinionated. If you are writing something she disagrees with (shes liberal), she will say your argument is weak (even if paper, truthfully, is good). Annoying mannerisms - including stutter.",0
"Terrible teacher. Got good grades so far, but approaching him is useless for help. He's very rude to plenty of students. The class is all lecture, and for tests, he only gives you the questions. 100 questions on test, must find answers yourself. 6-8 page essay. 2 100 questions tests. Never expect to leave early. Would not take him again.",1
He is almost impossible to reach via email which is annoying considering the class is online. He will respond to one email which may take a few days to get a response. His class was so easy one homework a week and 3 tests for the entire semester. His only tests are easy and so is the homework. I recommend taking because of how simple the class was.,0
Professor Fan is one of the nicest teachers and truly wants all her students to succeed. She is very passionate about what she teaches. Her class is pretty simple and pretty easy. A few tests and homework assignments as well as a paper at the end. Not at all as hard as everyone made Econ 40 to be.,1
nice guy,1
"Orser is a lovely woman, however, she is way too tough of a marker and not active online through moodle, feedback was less to none. I think everybody failed one quiz and expects you to read all books ( which are expensive) while having a full courseload and life",0
"Seems like a nice guy, but that means little when 90% (his #, not mine) of students fail his classes. He moves quickly, and you take TONS of notes. By the time you finish writing something, he already moved on. I know everyone makes mistakes when doing math, but we have to correct him 8 or 10 times a day. He uses ambiguous wording on tests, too.",0
"Literally worst professor I've ever had. She is rude to students, doesn't helped when needed and her tests are ridiculously hard. Especially for a class that is required for a lot of majors. Never take her.",0
"Professor Meade is a very intelligent man. He clearly possesses a large amount of knowledge that leads him to pick texts for the class based off of his own knowledge, but this leads to many problems. He expects you to simply follow his lead and doesn't push his students to embrace the stories and formulate their own theories. Smart guy, bad prof.",0
One of the few lecturers that cares about students and will take time to explain. Clearly loves his subjects and has passion,1
"Uncle Dennis! What can you say about Dennis, he really loves art and was very supportive and creative in the class. Never a dull moment. If possible I will take another course with him if possible.",1
speaks very fast and is unclear. copying the notes from her lecture slides before or after class is helpful and simply doing the examples in class. would not take another class with her.,0
I'm Junior and this is hardest class I've ever had. I have no hope on exam 3 tommorrow. Professor is good tho.,0
"Yet another great course with Dr. Beckman. I didn't think I would enjoy this class because it is heavily based on class discussions about the readings, but it was interesting and informative. The tests can be pretty hard, but they're all open-note/open-book (NEVER FORGET YOUR TEXTS.)",1
Suck,0
"Where do I start? She has no clear idea what she is teaching, her reflection quizzes doesn't help in my retention of the material that is covered(if its covered). She doesn't place all the assignments somewhere where it can be easily accessed and seen (almost costing me). And her grading system for group projects doesn't reflect fairness.",0
Prof. Felber is awesome! Her feedback is really helpful.,1
"Int. Acctng. was my 3rd acctng. class with Dr. O and sadly, he never got better at teaching. I am now transferring to USF knowing NOTHING about acctng. It is hard to communicate with the other students because it is a web class, as almost all the acctng. classes at MCC are, so I suggest getting a group together at the first meeting.",0
Do not let anybody convince you this class is easy. only take if MANDATORY! First test I had a 16 pg study guide and 55 slide powerpoint of which she selected 50 MC questions for the test. horribly unhelpful and covers vast amounts of material in some classes. I believe we covered over 600 years of history in an hour and twenty minutes one class,0
"Tests are primarily on lecture material. Pay attention take notes. Key items from the previous lecture are touched on for review at the start of the next lecture (know it). Participation can give extra credit. Seems eccentric in class but very nice and helpful one on one. Email replies are very slow, go to office hours.",1
"JTerm was easier than the full semester. She takes into consideration that students only have 11 days to complete the course so everything is cut down to accomodate the time crunch. She tells good stories, laughs a lot at her own jokes. Highly recommend JTerm to get 3 credits out of the way, but u gotta do the work.",1
most sweet and nice proffessor ever,1
"Such a great prof! He genuinely cares about his students and wants everyone to do well. Explains things clearly and is open to any questions you may have. His tests are very fair, if you go to class and do the homework you'll do well",1
"grade is based on a point system, not percentages. no tests or quizzes. final project and exam, but don't have to take as long as you have enough points added up by then. lot of writing assignments for homework, very interactive class.",1
"Although the class is lecture heavy and sometimes boring, its definitely easy. Only 2 online tests and 2 simple presentations. Mr. Dotts is also a really nice man who wants to see his students succeed!",1
I have her this semester for HED 200 very frustrating does not give any material related to the lectures for exams.,0
"I took his class a year ago, and did everything he said to get an A in the class. First off, he will grade you tests/papers poorly if you are a Republican. I would site pages from the text books he gave in class, and would go into detail about my explanation. If you even show a glimpse that you are right wing BOOM C- on a final. What a joke.",0
He should be a literature lecturer in stead of a science or engineering lecturer. He keeps using fancy words and tends to make simple concept complicated. His teaching is very disorganized. 50% of the questions given in homeworks are not learnt or practise before.,0
"I took lessons from pawkett for 1 semester and it was disappointing. Not a good teacher for ROCKBLUES type stuff. He seemed like more of a classical guy. His lessons are monotonous and a lot of the time it felt like I was learning random things for no reason. Plus he hardly seemed interested throughout the lessons, often ending lessons early. ",0
I never read the textbook it was a waste of money. Just make sure to show up when he goes over the study guide it is very very similar to the exams. He cares about anthropology but mostly just him talking all of class. can be hard to understand with accent. Never once put scores on elearning.,1
Awesome and nice professor! Definitely take  him.,1
"Sue Liebman is the most confusing teacher because she goes off the topic all the time. Secondly, she's slightly arrogant when she makes smart remarks when she critizes.",0
She doesn't remember what she has/hasn't told you so there's a lot of material on the test that she didn't go over or expects you to read in the textbook even though she didn't teach it. You really have to study hard to pass and make good grades.,0
An absolute waste of time.  Do yourself a huge favor and drop whatever class you're taking with him and wait until someone else teaches it.,0
great prof. not a lot of reading but still have too. do journals they help and just follow the handout he gives for the paper and you can get an A,1
He allows only 2 abcenses or you get an automatic fail so if you have the class at 8am you better be ready to show up. He does have a few annoying habits like tapping his marker on things but besides that he is a great professor.,1
"Online Math 90 Class.  Class runs itself.  If you have a question, don't expect an answer until after the assignment in question.  Don't expect your tests graded in a timely manner either, he'll blame the school for not delivering them to him.",0
"Probably my favorite professor ever. If you need to take this course, take it with him. I'm typically really uninterested in political science, but since being in  Lorentz' class, I feel much more politically active. The class ends up providing you so much more than just a grade. If only he taught all of my classes!",1
Dr. Miller is a nice guy but he does not try to help you at all. His labs are the absolute worst.,0
"I really wish there was a tag option that says: DOES NOT CARE. I reached out to her several times throughout the semester, received a response 1 in every 5 times. She doesn't care about her students whatsoever and an all around horrible professor. The idea behind her extra papers is fine, but she gives you nothing to go on. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS",0
Really nice guy and passionate about what he teaches.    three helpful hints: 1) get DB entries done early don't wait until the last minute (trust me i had to learn the hard way) 2) take lots of notes trust me they help and don't be afraid to ask for help if you need  3) take advantage of the extra credit it honestly really does help,1
"Read the book for this class!!!  He makes sure you understand the material, but test questions come from the book!  Do all your homework and PeachTree.  If you get full 100 on each of above and maintain test score of 71% and higher, he guarantees B in his class.  He will repeat that throughout semester so students don't stress out.",1
"He's a hard grader,  but really cares about his students and offers extra credit. Great person, just a hard class",1
An easy professor is a disservice to their students and the college; an easy A means no effort or real attention was paid to the material. Kelson will make you work and will make you have both the knowledge and tools to succeed.,1
"Quite honestly the worst professor Ive had in a while. She was almost completely absent from the course the entire semester. Never answered emails in a timely manner, doesnt respond to student questions online, never made assignments available in time for when we were to do them. Complete lack of attention from professor. Do not recommend.",0
"Professor Gonzalez is a helpful and comforting professor who teaches his students in a fun and interesting manner. Throughout my time in his class, I and the rest of my classmates were laughing and learning. He presents the information in a simple way and allows us more than enough time to write each of our papers. Could not recommend him enough.",1
"You must go to class and listen to his lengthy lectures to pass. You will have 1-2 quizzes every single class, no doubt. Seems easy at first if you do well on the quizzes, then you take the all written test and realize he is the hardest grader ever. He expects the work of a level 400 class. TESTS and FINAL ARE EXTREMELY HARD.",1
"Being a Spanish-speaker I didnt struggle as much as others BUT she wouldnt help those who really needed it. When students would ask for clarification, or simply had a question, she would get mad at them or/and ignore them. Very rude! Not a class I would take again.",0
"While Prof. Luallen does make the class very difficult at times, his wealth of knowledge and clarity of explanation makes the class interesting and valuable as opposed to a different EC11 professor. While this class is certainly no cake-walk, I definitely recommend it for anyone seriously considering an econ major.",1
Mr Leonard is pretty cool. He is very reasonable on his grading scale. The work load in his class is definitely manageable. You have to go to the labs or you probably won't pass the class. He gives you a study guide and the answers so there is no reason to score less than a B on them! Good teacher!,1
Eddy is one of the most caring instructors that Ive ever had. He encourages creativity and is willing to teach you whatever you want to know about fabrication and engraving.,1
"Avoid this professor, She is extremely rude. Not approachable & she will make you feel stupid. Grades are always your responsibilty but providing education is theirs. She has no conceptual understanding of this. Reads off old slides and if your answer isn't verbatim it is wrong. Participation is encouraged but makes you feel dumb when you do!AVOID!",0
"Very hard class!! Unorganized. Erin looks nice ,but not willing to help. I dont recommend her  if English is not your first language,she lectures too fast. Her tests are tricky and hard. Shouldn't teach Bio160.",0
"Takes his class seriously.  He has a good personality, and it is very possible to do well in the class as long as you study.  If you are a slacker, you're gonna fail.  The best ""test"" teacher I have had...had tests, but very fair and cover exactly what we talk about in class.",1
"(This course was taken during COVID, so take this with a grain of salt) Falk is a nice, kind man, but he is the worst professor I've ever had in my life and I no longer want to pursue a math minor because of him. I feel like I am paying thousands of dollars to teach myself the content on YouTube because he never provides solid, concrete examples.",0
"While she uses the book a lot for homework, she hardly ever uses it to teach. Her entire method was hinged on whether or not you took French in high school. If you did, you're golden, if not, look for another professor because you will not get the necessary foundation for french from her.",0
"I took her for CHDV4920, 4930 & 4960 and she is AMAZING. All lectures are informational but easy to follow, she makes sure to add transcriptions of all lectures and gives very constructive feedback on assignments. She is very approachable and makes time for her students, which I admire. I learned so much in her classes and recommend her to everyone",1
Professor Acosta's class was difficult because I struggle with math but she made it make sense. I learned a lot in her class. She had a lot of tips on how to get through the math software for the homework. Her lectures were straight to the point.,1
Took this class this past summer. Interesting guy who truly enjoys teaching students about Genetics. His test came straight from previous quizzes and exams or the class notes. He was willing to help you out in any way you needed.  He really made the class interesting. I would recommend him to anyone! Didn't need the book once.,1
"Very low voice, soft-spoken. Gets embarrassed when things aren't clear. Went over individual example programs in class. Let us write our own with guidelines for added practice, without grading. Not really able to clearly explain in simple terms. Fairly attractive.",0
Ridiculous with her grading. Not helpful with quetions or willing to help. Made this online class unbearable. Do not take this course online with her.,0
"He barely knows what he's talking about it seems like, students are constantly correcting him. This confuses the students and makes it hard to understand. He seems to not care about failing students and probably thinks he's doing his part in helping explain the material which he isn't. Don't take him, you might as well teach it to yourself.",0
"You need to show up because she doesn't post notes. Also, about a third of your mark is based on discussions, so you should be ready to talk. You get a lot of freedom on the research paper, which is nice. The final exam wasn't super tough. Overall, great class and probably my favourite class and prof so far.",1
Josh Loar does not accept late work without a Doctors note submitted through the deans office. He was of no help when I added the class late and asked for a syllabus or explanation. He told me to check canvas and go away. He talks a big game about how he used to work in the industry but is of no help when it comes to explaining class related topics,0
"The course consisted of each student giving two presentations and a paper at the end. Super Easy, but you'll walk away with some new knowledge. Nelson has a lot of experience with economics and is a really interesting guy. No test and no textbook. He only gave pop quizzes over material covered in the presentations.",1
Your not going to have a good time.,0
"Dr. Ghosh is excellent and she is organized, and the course is very useful. She answers her emails usually fast. I learned a lot. The book is kind of expensive. Need to watch the deadlines. But she is a good teacher.",1
"If you are a student who is able to get by 100% on their own, then you won't have a problem with this professor. She offers modules filled with busy work and, if you do ALL of them, you'd do fine in this course. My issue with Ms. Dodson was that she's awful at helping. Doesn't give direct answers and refers you to StatCrunch or says ""it's simple"".",0
He is the best!,1
"AWESOME professor, would take any class of his again in a split second, just do the required readings overnight and be prepared to discuss them the next class period... he is over-helpful and prepares you with ten times the information needed to make a great grade than any other professor will...",1
"all of the questions on the exams are trick questions and are extremely hard even if you study and think you know the material, you'll get to the exam and be confused probably.  don't ask questions unless you're prepared to get roasted by him.",0
Horrible! :( Feel bad because he means well. But take with a diff teacher if you can,0
"Maria has been my favorite teacher so far at DMACC.  I took her online Humor in Lit class and it was phenomenal...a nice segue into actual schoolwork the following semester.  She assigns great books, sometimes even movies, and is up front if they will be dryboring.  Plus I didn't have to buy pricey textbooks, most titles were free online!",1
"do not take him-does read out of the book, is clear in teaching, but totally unfair-takes a lot of points, and not reasonable. the humor works while in class, at the end when u get ur grade-hes not fair!",0
"Hard lab professor. Tests are hard, material is not covered in class with much help. Couldn't continue because my lab grade was too low with little help from Prof. Stevenson.",0
"Worst professor ever. I've struggled with math my whole life and she didn't make things any easier. Students were always correcting her work, she rushes through her lectures. There's 4 homework quizzes worth 8 points and 4 tests worth 100 points, no extra credit and she does assign a few random worksheets only worth 1-2 points. Wack grading system.",0
Great teacher she is very helpful to her students online. If I had any questions or issues she responded in a timely manner which was great. I took her for both 2301 and 2302 and I would definitely recommend her to all students. ,1
"All the stories about him are true as this was my most traumatic academic experience. I literally had to study every day, especially when he might spring a pop quiz on us. Lectures were hard to follow, since he went too fast when using powerpoint slides. His english is incomprehensible at times (achume?). Shockingly helpful during his office hours.",0
LOVE HIM!,1
best professor for 1A if you're continuing to 13 or even taking philosophy... Professor Toth did an amazing job but it was Professor Slate who taught the fundamentals and also gave superb examples of rewriting conclusion whereas others may accept conclusion as an intro rephrase. grammatical errors here because i have to run,1
"Br. Daniel must be protected at all costs. He's very easy to listen to during lectures, is endearing, and explains things well. It's a pretty easy class as well. 10/10 would recommend for CMP.",1
"She is young and spunky and relates to us on a personal level. She holds a lot of reading discussions. If you can't write essays, you will struggle.",1
"He was very chill at first, said that he only uses 2 hours out of 3 hours maximum, and does not require textbooks. And I thought he was a good professor. After a few classes, I saw how lazy he was. He posts another prof's notes on blackboard and expects you to read it before class, and in class he barely teaches. He's very lazy.",0
"I absolutely LOVED his class! He's super funny, and seems like a genuine guy. Really gets into the lesson and clearly knows his stuff. There's a lot of reading, but the two tests are not hard as long as you actually read. While he counts a lot on participation, he makes sure that even the quiet kids have a chance to speak.",1
"If you want to do good in this class watch the lectures he posts online before class. Instead of taking all of my notes during lectures, I took mine from the videos, then adding anything that wasn't covered in the videos during the lecture. It's a tough class if you haven't taken chemistry in high school.",1
"Great Professor, awesome Lectures, a lot of examples. YOU'LL NEED TO WORK YOUR BUT OFF FOR AN A. If you like a challenge take her class, if you're lazy just quit while you're ahead. ",1
Its a tough course but if you work you'll get through.,1
Professor Gibson is awesome. Show up for class do the work and pass. She teaches you how to write papers step by step. Easy A if you really try.,1
"talks too fast, very sassy, talks in third person.  Does not give partial credit.  If one period is out of place or a word is misspelled she marked it as wrong-- many kids are international students so this is difficult for them. I dropped the class and would not take her again if i can avoid it.",0
"Dr. Leamon Bazil is an excellent professor. I highly recommend him to anyone. He cares about his students, always available to speak with you doing office hours or by appointment. His delivery on the subject matter is unique and makes class lecture interesting and challenging, always leaving you with something to think about. Read your book!",1
"Her lectures are very boring, although she is very sweet. Her test are difficult, but nothing too crazy.",0
"He does not honor his grading system. Or at least, his staff that does all of the grading for him doesn't. Two papers, that's your grade. Says multiple times that participation counts but it really doesn't. Good luck trying to make sense of anything that goes on in this class.",0
Always late to class doesn't teache you hands on . You can't walk out the class without him even knowing,0
"He has an accent, but easy to understand.  He has a good sense of humor and tries to answer questions. He had to cover a lot of material so recommends that you get a tutor if you cannot understand beyond the classroom.  He does give opportunity to go over HW questions on following week. Very fair teacher. Don't miss class - you'll miss a lot!",0
"I had her for both lecture and lab. She was great for the lectures: her powerpoints and videos were detailed and helpful. With the lab however, she graded extremely hard and did not give helpful feedback. I would not take her again due to this as it brought my overall biology grade down.",1
She's kind of a harsh grader. Give your papers your all and don't slack off (There's 6 of them). Pay attention to her rubrics. I recommend her.,1
"A fantastic professor. Important you apply yourself to the course and show up to class. She allows you to skip the final if you already have an A in the class which is super helpful come finals week. If available, be sure to take her class.",1
"brilliant man. entertaining..hilarious when angry. i dont think one person this semester has asked a question, we are all terrified of him.",1
"Just go to class and you'll do well. Write solid papers and turn them in ON TIME, EVERY TIME. Go to every paper review day and you'll make an A. Just do the work. Pretty funny, obviously loves what he does.",1
"Im doing well in his class, but ONLY BECAUSE I TAUGHT MYSELF EVERYTHING! If you want a class with a professsor who writes equations and does not answer questions NOR explains how to apply equations, this is the one for you! If you can avoid taking him, do it at all costs, especially if you cant teach yourself this stuff. I",0
"I originally took this class to make sure I wouldn't fall below full-time student status. I was glad I did. She made food almost every week. We would have occasional guest speakers who were interesting. The readings she gave were a little dry, but also captivating once you got into them. Easy fun class.",1
"Great guy, he talks kind of fast but the lectures are recorded, entire grade is determined by 3 tests",1
"Notes are based on the questions he gives for hw. Be prepared to jot down random things he says bc I couldn't figure out a concise way of writing notes. My best advice is to open a document and copy the q&a's as you go through the semester. He recycles homework so you can prob find it online. An ""eh"" prof overall with two papers as your grade.",0
He requires your full attention. NO CELL PHONES or he'll ask you to leave. Gives partial credit for your attempt. Group work every week. He gives you the formulas during exams but you're expected to remember all of the calc work. I could have done better if I studied more.,1
She has a deadline at 8pm instead of 11:59 pm like everyone else. She also doesn't explain assignments well. So far we've wasted about 3 classes for one assignment. There's a trivia that we had to cite. Who does a trivia with citation?,0
Only a midterm and a final. He didn't get through all the material in my class. Takes notice to people that talk about his book with him. Smart dude but not a very nice guy or a particularly good professor. I would suggest taking someone else because of how painful it was to sit through lectures but it can be an easy A if you try,0
"Business cal is a hard course. You will not get everything out of just going to her class and listening to her lectures, BUT she has always been there for help. I have a gap before her class and she is always in the math lab helping her students. Kim loves what she does and she is always very helpful and if you put in the work she will help! ",1
"Did not enjoy lectures, very long (2.5 hour class with only a 5 minute break halfway). Most things in the notes were not on the tests, tests were strictly book, even then when I read the chapters I still did poorly on the tests.",1
Very good teacher. she is very helpfull and knows thermo in and out. Great course.,1
"Everything is lined out and the teacher follows according to her plan.  Reading with weekly tests and end of unit tests.  One major project that you work on with an assigned group (yes, group project) however it seems to work out well with what the project is.",1
"Sweetest guy ever! Very smart, his accent is thick so it's difficult to understand him. He wants the best for his students. A lot of hw, gives multiple try's to do it. Overall Solid teacher, learned what I had to and did well",1
"This was the easiest class I have taken at UNT but I took it in the summer and missed the most important assignment of the semester. I am retaking it and this time around I am actually doing the work. It is super easy and you learn a lot about yourself. Buy the workbook, do the discussion boards, and workbook pages and you will get an A.",1
Great professor. He clearly wants all of his students to perform well. ,1
"She doesn't care about her students & is a VERY hard grader. She doesn't give enough time to complete exams & we had to be on zoom AND respondus during them. There's A LOT of knewton hw. Her lectures are confusing, taught like you should already know the material, & she expects you to have everything memorized from algebra, precalculus, & calc 1.",0
She goes out of her way to prevent you from reaching your full potential. She is arrogant and laughs at students who are trying their best but may just need some guidance. She expects you to be a professional researcher like her. Avoid her if possible.,0
"He is a nice guy, but he really sucks at teaching. On the study guide, he only gives us the names of artwork and thats all. He talks a lot, and introduces the topic in a really boring way. Its very difficult to study for his exams. He thinks that everyone likes art as much as he does. Overall, not a good professor, and I dont recommend him.",0
Lots of work outside of lab.,0
"Dr. Capper knows his stuff and teaches it with energy.  Class was interesting, and I looked forward to it every day.  It was discussion based and involved the students.  Tests were all essay based, and the final was a 10-page paper, but they were graded easily.  Paying attention in class is a must; doing the ""required"" readings is not important.",1
"DO NOT TAKE HER CLASSES. She expects you read more than hundreds pages before every lectures. Her lectures is the most boring I had ever have in UW, also the most unclear. I don't understand why UW would hire her. She is not even community college level professor.",0
"Graham should never be able to teach a college class again. If you want your GPA to get bent over then take his class. If you want someone who just expects you to learn everything on your own then take Graham, everyone I talked to from my class was also failing all quarter long. Terrible lectures and he has 0 care about your effort for your GPA.",0
Prof is amazing. I would definitely recommend DeLuna. Learned so much from taking his class. Easy A,1
"She is very nice, but too confusing and loves to go on rants.",1
"He doesn't seem too bad till you get your exams back. His grading is completely ridiculous, and if you have the chance to take this class with another professor by all means do it. Odds are you won't pass this class.",0
He was an ok teacher.  A lot of the times he would have to go back and correct himself.  I had taken the class before and he made some of the easiest topics confusing! I would stay away if math isn't your strong point!!,0
"Overall, a really great guy, though not always perfectly clear (especially in-class discussions). Then again, Old English and Chaucer isn't the easiest. Understands a student's workload, and gives extensions with no problem. I would recommend him to anybody.",1
"Professor Kraft is one of the best english professors! I thought his class was going to be hard since I don't like English, but he makes it interesting. Received an A for my first time in an English class. Would take his class again!",1
Do not take this professor unless you want to teach yourself everything. He yells during a four hour lecture and is honestly not very nice,0
"This is a flipped classroom, so if that isn't helpful for you then don't take this class. However, she tells you way before add/drop that this is the case and you even get to try it for a couple weeks before deciding to switch classes. I personally enjoyed this because working on problems w others in class led me to learn material better.",1
"I looved this class. It's easy, but I still learned a LOT! There are about three problems of homework every week, and the tests are also simple. He truly cares about students' progress and will go to great lengths to make sure his explanations are clear as possible. If you want to really learn Italian, you have take it with il professore Sbragia!",1
The quizzes are really hard. This class was very stressful. Quizzes were 15 questions each and they'd take at least half a day to do finish. If youre in nursing i do NOT recommend her. If you have no choice then get a study group together help each other on the quizzes.,0
"The lectures are heavy and he doesnt write anything down, he just goes off his own PowerPoints that are poorly made and have many errors and always goes off topic. He doesnt discuss the homework or how the equations work. He is no where to be seen after or before class if you have questions, doesnt care about students, hes a terrible professor.",0
Hes a great professor and you learn a lot from. Be prepared if you have him twice a week then youll get quizzes mostly every class. Also on his midterms and exams he like to give extra credit questions on things off topic from the lecture like a video he showed. My only issue with him is he likes to give last minute assignments the week of finals,1
"Reminds of School, Sending you back if you are 5 mins late to class, i am serious not joking at all! Gives a lot of Quizes and final is cummulative! Trust me guyz dont ever take her class. Lot of studying for low grade!",0
"Paoline was great! There are 3 test and attendance which make up your grade. He passes around an attendance sheet and everyone has to sign in. As long as you go to class and take notes and STUDY, you should be fine. I ended the class with an A-. He is very helpful and down to earth. He made the class very enjoyable. MUST TAKE.",1
"Professor Wisner is the best English teacher, hands down. Take him for any English class, I promise you won't regret it. ) I've taken him for all mine and wish he taught higher level ones. :( He even dropped a test at the end of the semester which saved me. He is very clear with what he wants each week and the reading and discussions are easy.",1
"He's been in the game for a long time and I feel like he knows what he's talking about. The reason I gave him a 4 and not a 5 rating is because he's a really good teacher but he ain't perfect, I'll tell you that. P.S. But then again aren't we all...",1
"Unless you have a good previous understanding of chemistry, avoid her like the plague. Yeah, you might pass but if you learn anything its most likely because you taught yourself. Getting extra help is like pulling teeth and her lectures are absolutely brutal. Such a waste of money for this class and will probably have to retake at some point.",0
"She is by far one of my favorite people on this campus. Having her as both an advisor and professor was great and I will miss this class dearly. She really makes the texts more enjoyable and the environment very lighthearted, very easy to participate in the class.",1
I took the online class because I needed only two more credits for my psychology major. She barely emails. Don't bother emailing her when you have a problem because she takes two weeks to respond back. There were two different instructions for our final project. She submitted final grade without completely grading ALL my assignments.,0
"She would go over a few key points during lecture so they were helpful. However, when she said the tests questions were based off of the test in the order they appear, she wasn't kidding. READ! Covid-19 was difficult for everybody, unfortunately she kept having her lectures corrupted or had technical difficulties.",1
Best Teacher Ever. She wants everyone to do well and will help you if you arent.,1
"Not understanding the negativity in other reviews. Dude's really enthusiastic about his field and knows what he's teaching backwards and forwards. Classes are very lecture-heavy, but I found that alright because he's a very good speaker. Take good notes and get a good mental model of the material, because it's hard to fake it on his tests/projects",1
Took him during Summer Session. Grade is 50% midterm & 50% final 7 essay questions in class no notes. He expects you to attend class. If you didn't do well in an exam he offers other opportunities for you won't fail. Just read your notes and memorize all the key terms w/examples. He curves the class & tries not to hand out anything below a C.,1
Withdrew from her class.  She seriously will give you a hard time.,0
"He is a great teacher! He teaches math so nicely and makes everything easier. His class is hard though if you aren't in the right course you should be in, like I was. I wasn't prepared for that course, but even then, he made it very understandable. He is an all around great guy!",1
"I had an A until the last two weeks of class. Only the auto-graded things were graded and given very little weight like 10%. The term paper wasn't graded before the final exam paper was due so you have no idea how she grades. The things she has to grade (essays, short answer) counted too much and weren't graded until too late to apply feedback! Ugh",0
"Labs were assigned every week. Some were short and easy, most were long and complicated but still manageable. Midterms and finals were long, but also manageable.",1
"Wonderful professor, great class. Human sexuality (BIOL 30/PSYCH 30) was very informative about a lot of things I had no knowledge about prior to taking this class.",1
"Incredibly cool guy, and a very talented author.  Sometimes the content of the class seemed to be very focused on what Miles wanted to do or see, and not really anything to do with the curriculum.  Worst part about Miles is that he takes way too long to grade things.  Probably wouldn't take again, but would love to still keep in touch.  Cook guy.",0
"Loved my journalism class, & Prof McMeans.  Learned a lot about the news industry, which is what I signed up for.  Grading is tough, but she allows each assignment to be resubmitted for higher grade.  I def. recommend doing each ""easy"" extra credit assignment for the tokens.  They add up and help.  I started out rocky, but ended up w/ a ""B""",1
"She is the worst teacher I have ever had. Courseload was ridiculous. Multiple projects due at the same time, over a course of a few weeks. She is not afraid to make you cry in front of the whole class. You get one thing wrong and she BLOWS. I am afraid to participate now. Told us we didn't have an exam, now we have a project & essay final. RUN!!!!",0
She is the best teacher at gadsden state. Will go way beyond to help you!!!,1
"So Caldwell is a genius. There's no denying that. But, if you don't write in your papers exactly what he believes, you won't get an A. Also, he tends to go on these like weird tangents pretty often. Overall, he's smart, and teaches well, but not the best grader...",1
Prof. Luallen knows what he's talking about but was not willing to slow the pace of class or cater to anyone not immediately up to speed on material. He moved relentlessly through lectures and delivered tests that had to be curved up from low averages every time. Mentions kegs/beers/frats when possible. His class effectively weeded me out of econ!!,0
"Mr. Wilbrandt is by far the best teacher I've had at Auburn. I feel like he cares a lot about the way students learn in his class and is exceptional in explaining most of the information and if something isn't clear, he always happily goes into further detail at the end of class. He also holds study sessions before exams. Exceptional!",1
ughghghg....boring,0
Insanely hard grader on 8 micro-themes and 1 paper worth 25% of your grade. She's very intelligent but expects us all to teach her something new about the Old Testament which is nearly impossible so unless you're willing to devout your whole life to this one class do not expect an easy A. The midterm + final are long and require lots of writing,0
"Teaching Economics might be Prof Luallen's second job, but he never treats it like one. He is fully committed to making his students understand the concepts. Additionally, his lectures are presentation-heavy and fast-moving, but he takes regular pauses to ensure clarity. He is funny and has a self-perception of being stringent, but is very helpful.",1
"A very, very hard course, which should be expected because it is Advanced level. However, he generally does a good job explaining concepts and is very helpful during office hours. Sometimes it is difficult to stay concentrated during class though.",1
"This will be the worst Econ class you take at Creighton. Dr. Wingender will basically ramble on about Obama for an hour and fifteen every single day until the day before the exam. The gist, only show up that one day. Exams are taken over two class periods! Look at the test go home study for two days, come back. If you want to learn Econ, stay away.",0
"Dr. Matthews is easily the worst professor I have ever had. After a few weeks in class, the class became a work period where we taught ourselves how to use AutoCAD by attempting to copy drawing posted on his website. Unclear expectations throughout whole semester, but extremely easy grader as long as he sees you are trying",0
Profe Ana is the best Spanish teacher I have ever had. 10/10 recommend her class. Very dedicated to helping her students learn and loves to see them do well!,1
"She's a good teacher in the sense she knows what she's teaching. Her biggest downside is that her exams are much harder than her classwork, homework, and practice exams.",0
"Great teacher, VERY aware, can't get anything by her, a little out there when she was lecturing would rush through content and expected you to know everything. AWESOME clinical instructor and you can learn a lot from her. enjoy and just know your stuff!",1
Drop the class if you have S. Kern. Ask him for help and he told me he could not help me.,0
"She's a hard professor but she is one of the few that will truly give you the education you pay for, She is respectful, does not like bad language in the classroom, this is a class you DO NOT want/should miss!  I've taken her twice and have received good grades but it was all hard earned, by far one of my favorite professors.",1
"He said that the grade would be 50% midterm and 50% final, but ended up grading based on participation only. Doing the readings & ""optional"" writing assignments are helpful for participating, but often assigns too much hw and doesn't explain the content clearly, so it can be hard to participate.",0
"Mr. Paramsothy Thananjeyan was a great lecturer but not necessarily a great teacher. Personally, I found him rather bland. He's not the worst, but he could be much better.",0
"David is a quirky math teacher. His styles carefree and fun. He genuinely wants all of his students pass, andis care for his students outweighs anything else. He goes above and beyond for his students, and is willing to give you resources and get you connected with the programs on campus. He is a good teacher to take if you have anxiety with math.",1
Pretty easy class. Just don't sleep or go on your phone and you'll pass. ,1
"The first and most important thing is DO THE HOMEWORK!! His quizzes are literally from the homework and the tests are modified homework stuffs. Do you homework guys. His lectures are fine, but you have to be there to understand the materials. Other than that, he's fair. Very fair. Gradewise, personality-wise, and otherwise.",1
"The presentations were very clear and easy to understand, and had almost everything you needed for the test. He also gave very helpful non-graded practice quizzes to prepare you for tests. Grades based on 4 tests and a short research paper. Professor Gaidos seemed very nice and funny. He definitely gave you everything needed to be successful.",1
"Trina is amazing! Her lectures were easy to follow and she always took extra time to explain the material. She is a touch grader and requires full participation, but is very caring and is always willing to help. I absolutely recommend her, she is the best!",1
"knowledgeable ,  cool guy",1
"Just say no, and stay away or youll be sorry. I dont even know where to begin on how bad this course is. You will need to teach yourself because what he tests on has nothing to do with the lectures that He drones on about. If youre trying to get into a limited access program then definitely stay far away Because this course could ruin it",0
Horrible is the only way to describe her. She does not respond to emails and the assignments make absolutely no sense.,0
"he is really knowledgeable and is always there to help with material questions or questions you just randomly think about. You MUST show up to class to learn but he is kinda funny and a reaally nice guy. I studied a good amount and got a B+ despite getting 70's on the midterm and final. TAKE THE LABS SERIOUSLY, even though they are a joke, do it!",1
"The ancients told us of a man who was born beyond time who would come down to bless us engineering students with the wisdom and knowledge from beyond. But seriously, this class is definitely the most helpful with understanding engineering in an industrial setting and will prepare you for real-world engineering.",1
"Fun to listen to, he clearly loves what he does. Somewhat disorganized, but he doesn't mind being reminded of things he planned to do.",1
"She is a great teacher. She works hard to help you learn the material, and she has very fair tests. She came early to help us, along with HANDWRITING note packets for us. I have never had a teacher work so hard to help me learn. That being said, she definitely expects you to work also. She assigns a lot of homework and uses the full class to lectur",1
"Class is made up of 500 points in total, 300 of which is the midterm and final. Lots of information in the lectures, 90% of which is filler talk. The midterm was way harder than the final, homework was just busy work. He's not good at specifying what is expected to receive points on assignments. In my opinion, he's just there to collect a paycheck.",0
You literally need to attend class if you want to be on her good side and get a good grade,1
"Mr. Jung has a very strong accent, but you can pretty much understand what he is saying. He sometimes makes his explanations a little confusing but corrects himself after. Very sweet & helpful",1
"MAKE SURE you will have plenty of time outside of class to teaching yourself the material using the textbook w/ (optional) homework before commiting. Class is lectures that introduce each topic w/ an example or two, the rest is up to you. DO THE HOMEWORK if you plan to do well. If you're not a diligent student this class may not be the best option.",0
Sanda has been one of my least favorite professors in the VCD program. Her talk on the first day of classes dismisses any chance of thinking you can get a good grade with her. Her critiques are demotivating and not very helpful. Her project guidelines are vague and usually she is displeased with what students bring in. Poor communicator.,0
"Ridiculous woman.  Entirely too fascinated by herself, a sentiment you are guaranteed not ot share.  She will demonstrate her knowledge of Latin and Italian at least 15 times in each lecture, something no one else cares about at all.",0
"Shes alright, I dont like her tough grading or how shes to picky.",1
Professor Chalakani-Baier is one of the best professors at Ocean. She explains exactly what to do and how to get an A. pay attention to what shes telling you to study for the quiz. And for the final she allows us to bring 4 huge index cards to use for notes. I loved this class and will def take her again.,1
"Amazing professor, but very tough class. Good thing is that you are bound to learn a lot on law! Exams are in class written exams, not multiple choice. She does hand out study guides which are almost identical to the questions on the exams. Study those! 4 group assignments is the rest of your grade which are more like mini projects. Come to class!",1
"I love this professor! I took her summer nutrition class and it was a breeze. The course had a normal amount of homework, nothing that takes to long to do. Just do the work and you will do great! She is very quick to respond to emails and cares a lot about her students. I would definitely take her again!",1
"A world class musician, and an even greater teacher and human. Although not a major in the studio, I was treated as if I were a major, and I cannot emphasize how substantial this has been in my musical pursuits. Terry is able to adapt his teaching to your individual goals as a musician, and genuinely cares more than most . Highly recommend.",1
"She is the worst professor at the university. In a class about why one ought not to make sweeping generalizations about groups of people, she found it very necessary to do so with regard to her class. She insulted the prior education and viewpoints of the class on a daily basis. She is a hypocrite and a know it all, who doesn't actually know jack.",0
This was not a class that I needed for my major but I wanted to take it due to I am a business owner. I felt it was the first class I have taken business wise where the instructor knew what he was talking about. I also felt like the class applied to today's world.,1
"Dr. Mueller bases all lecture off relying on students to read from a workbook in which instructions are unclear. The workbook itself is often criticized by Mueller for being inaccurate as well. Taking notes is only somewhat helpful, and lectures are often detached from the students' understanding and difficult to retain.",0
"Although she can be a bit unorganized and late to class, I truly enjoyed this course. If you take this class for honors, she will try her best to brainstorm ideas with you and find scales for your project.",1
"This class is hard, but its a two-in-one gen-ed knockout, and the content is very stimulating. Unlike most classes, you have to actually participate to pass. Sections are easy and offer extra credit every week. Very funny dude. Not much more I can say.",1
"As much as I hated this class and the material, I know I could've done better with a better professor. You get 4 grades; midterm lab/lecture exam and final lab/lecture exam. That's it. They are HARD. Took notes and nothing was on the lecture exams. Lab exams he does do a review, GO!! And do not miss labs they help your grade a TON! Good luck!",0
"Lively teaching style, never bored me. Can be irreverent, has many interesting ideas and topics that broaden knowledge in other classes outside foreign languages. Brings in fascinating, worthwhile Spanish and Latin American literature selections. I wouldn't have missed these classes for the world. Highly recommend!",1
I have been using rate my professor since my freshman and never made a rating. Until now because Professor DBH is amazing. She will go the extra mile to ensure you get the best grade possible. It is a writing-intensive class so papers have to be done. Easy A!,1
"She is very passionate about Italy, which makes learning much more interesting. I like her but she would get very frustrated with my class. She seemed a bit demanding also, I felt like she expected me to spend all day studying Italian and have no outside life.",1
"Worst teacher! I took him for A&P 1. Its hard to understand him at first but eventually you pick up what he's saying. Yes, his homework is unlimited but he gives you like 70 questions, each question has 15+ parts. Gives you a review of 200 questions a week before exam and expects you to know them all for 150 question test.",0
"Mr. Daigle advised female students in our class to invite other (complete stranger) students home with them for study group. A lot of his other advice was also archaic, not to mention dangerous. He is stuck in another time. He also gives very few tests on lots of material, so if you have a bad memory, this is a class to skip. ",0
"The exams in this class are beyond impossible. Even if you read and take notes, the length, detail and layered opened ended exam questions are impossible. She never updates grades and class averages on exams are failing even after the curve. The most pointless and relentless class ever. She speaks down to you and assigns tons of busy work.",0
slightly crazy but hilarious. have to read multiple novels but overall fun as a teacher and loves movies/tv shows in class.  not much work involved,1
She give out alot of questions prior to and after the lab. The only test is the final.,1
"Don't get fooled like me with these reviews. STAY AWAY. You have been warned! This class is unbearable online. professor is unorganized, inconsistent and gives a lot of work in a little time yet takes about a month to grade assignments. Had to withdraw to save my sanity.",0
"Proff itself isnt too bad at teaching. She is nice and caring, but very strict. Her tests are alot more difficult than other proffs. Take any other proff if you want a good mark, or else youre risking your gpa!!",0
"I took her online class.
 One annoying thing is the old assignments that junk up the pages and sometimes the tests don't work.  There are also brief reports due with each chapter. 
 She is very unorganized. Not reccomended",1
"Avoid! Class is extremely boring and he teaches half the course based on his own bias and beliefs, homework heavy, but he gives you the answers. Content is extremely specific and useless. Not friendly or caring, very loud, often wrong about things he teaches as facts (google fact check him). Says ""out there"" and ""makes sense"" so much I kept a tally",0
"I liked Professor Aizura. He's a good person and pretty funny. However, I did not enjoy the structure of this class. I thought it was pretty confusing. You aren't graded on a lot, so the things you are you actually have to do well on. There's a ridiculous amount of reading though.",1
"Her lectures are based from the textbook so I suggest reading the textbook ahead of time then going to lecture for a clearer understanding. Your grade is based off of 3 exams, 1 group project and a few other assignments, but the assignments vary depending if you have her large lecture or smaller class.",1
"Connect Learnsmart and HW assignments, 1 midterm, and 1 final. The tests were all MC, but there aren't that many (12-16 Q) and you get 2 hours. The questions are more calculations and less conceptual. The practice exams are very similar to the actual exams. Go to the Discussion Board if you need help. If you put in the work, you will pass.",1
"Once gave a pop ""TEST"" ""TEST that is"" NOT a pop QUIZ, ""POP TEST"". And his tests take like 2 weeks to complete. He should also be retired/gone since he sits in his office 70% of the time!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
"Stats is a nightmare but Maojoudi made it easier! A lot of homework, but it is worth it. Attendance is a must. Group quizzes once a week. Three tests. A final project. He is very passionate about teaching and is one of those teachers that wants you to finish every class understanding everything. Very sweet man. Best stats teacher at Skyline!",1
"Absolutely awful. Can't understand his accent, doesn't understand you to help you. IMPOSSIBLE tests. Terrible with scheduling. Very hard grader.  Find a different professor... you can't be a good professor if you cannot communicate with your students.",0
Useless... inconsistent...unmotivated...ineffective.,0
"I could kick myself for taking this class AFTER reading the poor ratings on ratemyproffessor.com thinking that maybe the reviews were reflective of poor students and the fact this is the only online class for 2071. NOPE, the reviews are dead on.  The syllubus even warns not to harrass the instructor.  Illuminating!",0
"This class was easy: read the book, write essay and u will pass, HOWEVER, I expected much better teaching style. He just came to class, gave us book quizzes (which were hard), and then he would quickly go through the chapters asking us what we thought. He didn't lecture and there usually were long pauses because he obviously was never prepared.",0
She's a very nice professor and loves what she teaches but she's a very hard grader. She is not specific on assignments and activities in class.,0
"I honestly thought I was going to fail because of this pandemic. My class was without a teacher two weeks after school closed and then we were assigned, Professor Pfeifer. He was extremely understanding that this pandemic was emotionally and mentally draining on us. I was allowed to do assignments pass the original due date and get full credit.",1
She is an awesome teacher will be taking all of her classes that I can. She's understanding the work is very clear and straight forward and she responds to all emails and questions,1
"She really is not that great of a professor, some of her email responses to you can harsh and really does nothing to assist you on passing. Worst teacher ever!!",0
"I really like Prof. Lyons. The course was really hard due to the massive amount of material to get through, but she's knowledgeable and passionate about the topics, and if you take the time to come to class and read the text book, it's very informative. I'll take another class from her for sure.",1
This teacher is awesome! I learned so much from this class and I actually retained a lot of the information. He is a public defender with great stories.I would totally recommend him. LOVED HIM!! :),1
"Easiest ochem 1 prof at CSU, but teach yourself. Unresponsive to emails &  reads slides to you. Exams are fairly straightforward w. lots of bonus chances &  curves. Knows kids cheat & didnt care. Final is repeats Qs from quizzes & tests so GO SEE UR TESTS. Some Qs from test banks others from Depoali's hw assignments. If u need an A shes your chance",0
"Easy A, however the workload is very intense. Either an individual or group assignment due every week. He doesn't release grades often, but gives everyone full credit  don't fret. You will have to create a lot of diagrams & charts for unnecessary things. He usually gives poor feedback and complains even when you follow his instructions. Easy A tho",1
Never again he doesnt teach us anything at all your book is your best friend. #facts,0
"Bonnie is a strong professor and in time could become a good friend. She won't sugar coat anything for you. Instead, she will work tirelessly with you to improve you journalistic writing ability. This is not a class to take and slack off in. All in all, a really good experience. Many opportunities to push your comfort zone.",1
"Chef Haze was never in class! He was either writeng emails or gone while we cooked the food of the day. If we have ?s, too bad! Poor class, poor teacher.",0
Good teaching style. He really cares for his students unlike most professors there.,1
"Ward's class is straightforward and interesting. ""THEO and ECON"" is the best theology course that you could take at Marquette because it's so interesting and applicable to your life/other studies. If you read bare minimum and participate, it's not hard. She gives out potential questions for tests, has extra credit, and easy points. Take this class.",1
He is simply the best!!!,1
terrible,0
Quite boring..strong accent.semi-lenient with grading..unclear in lecture.he is nice though.,0
"He's really helpful and want his students to pass. Very passionate about the subject and knows his work. He talks all throughout his class time but his stories are interesting. Attendance is not mandatory but you will want to be there, 4 exams notes come from the textbook and his own notes/worksheet packets. Awesome professor. Highly Reccomend!",1
I have taken Stephanie for going on three years now. She loves her students and loves teaching. She wants you to succeed in everything you do and instills not only the proper execution of steps but proper etiquette and history of dance. She teaches you from the ground up and makes you work for it. the way to go for beg. ballet and int. modern.,1
You will have to self teach and she shows NO mercy. Dont take unless you can afford an F. Worst experience ever. You shouldnt be a teacher if you dont care about your students.,0
"Mark was a great professor. At first I didn't think the class would work well considering he's pretty young, however it was quite the opposite. He more than well knows what he's doing and everything you do in that class is designed to make you a better writer. He gives great feedback on essays and explains things really well. ",1
Just go along with the class. Doesn't take opposition well. Well that's The whole social work dept. You can and will be able to tell if she doesn't like you. She takes things personally.,0
"Her lectures were not helpful at all, she tends to ""talk with herself"" and ignore students' question. She is probably really smart so it was hard for her to lower to students' level.  Lots of her exam problems are from recommended book problems. I got an easy A by going to CLAS.",0
"He is laid back and brilliant. He truly cares and is more than fair with grading. If you need help, he's maybe the most accessible prof in Cox. Put in the work and you will do well. His lectures are enjoyable and low stress.",1
"Dr. Schumann is a real gem, I had him for two courses. He gives specific questions to answer for the writings so you know what he wants you address. He breaks up the class by showing documentaries so it is not just hours of him lecturing, and has guest lecturers. No tests or book for 4050. He answers emails quickly; only downer is group projects.",1
"This prof is terrible. He is the most horrible prof I have never ever seen before in the school. All he can do in the class is to only read PPT. Everyone can be a prof if only reads PPT. Also, he hates to answer your question. I take his morning class everyday but leart nothing. Do not take his class unless you want to fail this course.",0
"She is a great professor. She is incredibly smart and she is also fair. However, you should really read the text book if you want that A, this material is not easy. Taking her again for corporate tax and I'm looking forward to it. Structured class, clear grading structure, great presentation slides, nice person overall.",1
"He has multiple choice tests and homework that he writes with very unclear, vague language. Any attempt to ask for clarification was met with dismissal or misleading, half information. He simply doesnt care about his students.",0
"Super great teacher. Had for 101 and 199. Funny and easy to talk to. All the information can be re-found from the ppt online which is super helpful when doing group work. As long as you pay attention in class and do the work your told to, especially in your groups, because there is a HUGE amount of group work, you should be fine.",1
Im sorry shes very nice to her students but her exams are just too hard for a 100 level class. The group projects will save you from failing. Dont take her unless you are good at geology or want to take a hit on your GPa.,0
"I am so grateful to have Mark as my professor. I took two geology classes with him. I wish all professors would like him. Online quizzes, in class mid term and final are easy if you have paid attention to his lectures. Test reviews are great! Will take him again and again! :)",1
"Non accurate prof. Tells you one thing but screws you over for it. Not the best prof in scad, should just leave.",0
"He is very passionate about architecture, tough as nails to please, will tell you one thing one day & another thing the next day, trust your gut, explain why. We did a lot of abstract stuff, more than what you think (not floors plans, elevations, etc.), not my style but I learned a lot. He made me want to quit so many times but i made it out alive!",1
"attendance is mandatory even though nothing she goes over is on the exams. Exams are based solely on the textbook. Probably would be better as an online course. Her attitude was not the best, i wouldn't recommend",0
"Class is really not worth taking. Did not even come close to getting through all the material. Lectures are incredibly boring and he just puts up pictures on the board, no actual information. The information he says in class is generally useless. The papers are not long but he grades them extremely tough and it is unclear what exactly he wants.",1
Dr. Anderson is a great professor. He always emphasizes on working FOR the student. He makes learning Latin very easy to understand and is attentive to any problems you may have. It is obvious that he has a passion for what he does and makes the classroom (even online) a fun and safe environment. Highly recommend!,1
Very strong accent that I could not understand at all. I'm currently taking this class and regret it very much. I wish I would have not purchased the book and have chosen a different professor. He does not go over examples with students like other Math teachers. Avoid if you can.,0
"He is really nice, enthusiastic, passionate and knowledgeable. Lot of writing and reading. First two assignments are group projects which make up 30% of your grade. He has everyone fills out a survey after the project is complete and he adjusts each persons grade. you can raise your final grade by 1/3 by writing more than the 7,001 in your journal",1
"Perhaps my favorite teacher thus far. She is very helpful and has real world experience in the business world. I find the class and material beneficial for my future in the business world. If you show up to class, it should be an easy A. ",1
Contradicts himself and then denies it. Very disorganized. Gets defensive when you ask him a question and takes things wayy to personally. His tests are much harder than the material he presents in class.,0
"Horrible horrible professor. She never had a lesson plan prepared, spent half the class just googling things vaguely related to whatever we were talking about, and was just plain awful. Useless papers and feedback. Easy enough, but if you want to learn take someone else.",0
"Great prof. Had her for a fourth year lab class and I can tell a lot of the other replies here are from first-years who are more alarmed at the way things are taught at university (very fast, info-heavy lectures) rather than objectively speaking on her as a prof. She is smart, kind and always willing to help. Awesome role model for women in STEM!",1
"I am a hard working student and willing to do whatever work a professor throws my way. However, this class is something that I recommend to stay away from. I could not understand her half the time and the communication was quite bad. Only class I have withdrawn from.",0
"Dr. Evans-Nguyen's class is very difficult. Your grade is 95% tests and 5% homework. He does ALL sample problems for you, does not explain well. ""Review"" sessions are the night before a test and you can't ask what to expect- entire semester is fair game. Never unwrapped book. HW is very time consuming (2-3+ hours/chapter). Very poor experience.",0
"LOVED HER. She can definitely be intimidating, but she taught well and was very engaging. I wasn't interested in the theme of the class, but she gives you a lot of wiggle room when it comes to choosing essay topics so it turned out okay. Definitely not an easy A, but totally worth it if you're looking to become a better writer!",1
If you want someone who is never on time to class and never grades assignments then this is your teacher! I took her for comp 2 in the spring of 2016 and the only grade she entered was our final. I still have no clue what I made on any of her essays because she never posted them or have them back!,0
"Weird class structure. Emails last minute about in class presentation. UMass should not qualify such professors, its super bad for students. I got an A for presentation but she sent me emails complaining about my work. I don't get it? I was absent to class twice due to medical reasons and she assumed I dropped the course and removed me from wiser! ",0
"Very easy class. By far the easiest multiple-choice I've ever had in college and all of the essay questions are given well in advance. Questions come straight from his notes, but reading the book is nice for a better understanding of material. He get's off topic rather often, but has some interesting stories to tell once in a while. ",1
"A pretty awful professor (her lectures/powerpoints do not focus on what is on the exam at all -- it's like you're taking an exam for a different class). Goes on tangents about the importance of not being stressed but just stresses you out. After we went online due to virus, she completely abandoned the class and only did weekly ""check-ins.""",0
"She was very unclear with her instructions and her syllabus. The second day of class everyone lost 10 points for not doing an assignment that we were not told about or was stated clearly on the syllabus.
 She also plays favorites and picks on other students.",0
"Professor Endlich is such a sweet professor and really caring, she gives you a clear criteria of what and how she is grading, also the work in class is really easy, there might be a lot of work but it's really simple and as long as you keep up with it and put commitment to the class.",1
"So sweet, so caring, so funny. She wants you to do well and to participate, but she isn't rude about it and won't call you out if you don't (unlike some other professors). She allows for a lot of freedom and flexibility with assignments and projects, but do know you'll have to read (but not that often). Would take her again. One of the best at SMU",1
She's very kind but not the best at teaching. Her lectures areong and tedious. She expects you to be an expert after a long powerpoint lecture and rambles when she lectures.,0
His way or the highway.  Not my way.,0
"I could never be sure if he was going to snap at a student or engage nicely. Yarotsky's brilliant & can teach but beware, he's moody, talks a mile a minute, & can't be bothered inside or outside of class. Heavy lectures w/4 hard exams (won't know when they are until days before) but fair grader. Record lectures, read the book & keep your head down!",1
"I had Herring for Math 15 and she was pretty good. She assigned a lot of hw, which really helped with lectures and doing workbook problems. She lectures a lot, but always made sure to make it fun. Practice tests are very similar to the real tests. Nice professor.",1
"Melissa was very helpful and very accessible outside of class. If you uploaded an assignment and it did not show up on Blackboard's end, she reached out to you to let you know so you could email it to her! Some teachers would penalize you.   Group project. Head's up.",1
"This class was asynchronous so I don't know much about him as a person. He seemed caring and willing to help. His class was pretty easy. Each week was a new chapter with a quiz at the end. There were also 3 tests. His lectures were easy to follow and the tests/quizzes were easy. The quiz questions were the same ones on the tests, so it was easy!",1
"Take it with some one else. He is a nice guy, but over-complicates topics that should be easy to understand. Awful at explaining the material. If you don't have an innate knack for stats, this class will make your situation even worse.",0
The professor spent the majority of each mandatory class meeting to discuss her personal life and forbade working while she discussed her life. The assignments had little-to-nothing to do with the learning and the learning materials were so basic it felt insulting. Terrible emailer and communicator.,0
boring class ..cant keep students attention ..knows his material but has a hard time putting it into simple terms,0
She has high expectations for her students. She is a tough grader and tough teacher but she is a great person!,1
"Ms. Parker's class was interesting. Not an art fan. Even though this was an online class I still had a ""field trip"" to our local museum (did cost a fee). Which was pretty cool since I had never been. Very fair grader, made a ""B"" due to me not checking my blackboard after I submitted my last assignment. Easy ""A"" if you do the work.",1
"This class was pretty good. Not sure where people are getting the feedback on Quizzes and exams, the class didn't have any. Prof was very helpful when I had any problems. Found them fair.",1
"Honestly, I would take this class again. And, I'm not a math sort of person. Mr. Wildman is eccentric and a little weird at first, but he uses that to his advantage. His quirky analogies and activities help you understand the course material. I would say that one quarter with him beat four years of high school. Don't pass up this opportunity.",1
HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE! This man cannot teach. He hardly gives notes/examples which is very essential in accounting. Very boring and cannot answer your questions cuz he doesn't know himself. If you take him you will fail. He's late most of the time and reads from powerpoint print outs. You're guarenteed to fall sleep or stare out the window.,0
God bless Dr. Bradshaw!!!!,1
"Without a doubt, the absolute worst instructor I have ever had. She speaks super fast (and won't slow down when asked), she is rude and arrogant. Your lucky if you get a 70% on her tests. She expects you to answer questions exactly how she describes them (even when she is incorrect). She is a really nice woman but a terrible teacher.",0
All like an amateur writing workshop.  Didn't get much out of it.  She was soometimes nice and helpful and sometimes full of herself.,0
Difficult class - do not take unless you have a strong interest. Very unhelpful outside of class and won't answer simple questions for you. Exams cover things she does not spend much time on in class - there were major issues on the exam that weren't even mentioned.,0
"She is one one the most beautiful individuals I have ever met. Just do your work and actually try and she will make sure to help you along the way, if needed. I am truly going to miss her.",1
"He is smart but moves extremely fast and does not like to answer questions. Gets annoyed and raises his voice after one or two questions. No real reviews for tests or final. Gives comprehensive final without telling what will be on it. I would NOT recommend to anyone, especially if weak in math.",0
"This is supposed to be MWF class, but Prof Baez only had lectures once a week. Every week there is a Sapling Learning (SL) assignment. HW is very easy if you read the textbook/listen to the lectures. Prof Baez's lectures are clear and follow the book very closely. Tests are on SL and are just like the hw. Easy class, would recommend",1
"He's a really interesting person and gives really interesting lectures. Makes good jokes, but its up to you whether that is worth the immense amount of reading you'll be doing. You have weekly readings and quizzes and you won't be able to make up one you missed. Make sure you take notes and don't be on your phone. He will call you out.",1
He is a tough grader and he gives u 4 essays and the final and gives u grades on those and thats all and then for extra credit u have to listen to his Boring friends talk. Gives u a lot to read and it is almost always on the same crap ok get your note card out today class we gonna talk about the sublime and how It is good to use Forget him,0
"He's very new to teaching & it shows. He's VERY difficult to understand & has an extremely hard time with being wrong & being called out on it. He's absolutely brilliant, but clearly not meant for teaching. I'm majoring in chem, so I didn't have a hard time w/ the class, but I read the entire book & ignored his lectures. Thats the only way to pass.",0
"Sp 20 Honestly speaks in Spanish the whole time, youll be lost, and shes got a lot of attitude when she emails you. Stay clear",0
"A tough Professor, shes very serious in class but very knowledgeable about the material. speak to her one on one for help. People came in with the impression of her as a bad professor b/c of that, they treated her poorly and got angry at her quickly. If you listen to her, its not difficult. She can come off as cold but shes just blunt and honest",1
She is on of my favorite professors I have had at FSU. She made the class more entertaining than it was meant to be because of her sense of humor and energetic attitude. I highly recommend her. She does not get to create the class schedule or assignments but she does make them more enjoyable.,1
"Horrible teacher! First off, he doesn't response back to emails in a timely manner. He don't give feedback for smaller assignments in a timely manner, only for essays. He's a very tough grader. He's the worse teacher I've ever took. DO NOT TAKE!!!!!!! You'll only hurt yourself!",0
"I believe he is very smart and always want to help you to success. He is always late to the lecture as well as online meetings. He rarely help in lab, basically you just figure with your lab partners and he's doing his own stuffs. Takes forever to grade and provide very very little feedback on your homework. Tons of homework due at the same time",0
"Tests consists of 4 short answers and an essay, the 4 short answers can consists of any of the 40 things we learned before the test",0
he's sooooo mean,0
"If you're going to get your students to buy a textbook about Brazil, assign more than 50% of the readings on Brazil, and spend 70% of the lectures time talking about Brazil and remembing all the good times you had in Brazil, DON'T title your course ""Latin America."" She is like a one-hit-wonder band from the 90's with nothing new to say.",0
"Professor Johansen is a very intelligent,capable,knowlegeable in the subject in which she instructs, learned a lot about myself and about the mental health profession, she is very encouraging about students continuing their education, absolutely loved her class, you have to do the work, nothing comes easy but she is helpful",1
Unnecessarily strict with grading. Gives poor feedback with little to no reasons as to why a low grade was given.,0
"Professor Zakar was an awesome professor. Took him for Social & Ethical Considerations of Business and he makes it difficult to fail, let alone get a grade below an A. Just do the weekly assignments, discussions, paper, and presentation and you'll be fine. He has an amazing and very relatable personality.",1
I wish I went with Falzone on this one. He's not approachable or helpful at all. He doesn't care about his students.,0
"Professor Sang makes you think! He is great at helping you see things from different perspectives, and he is pretty funny too. There is lots of reading to do, 6 quizzes, and 6 one paragraph essays. There is also a midterm exam and a final exam(although we wrote an essay instead due to Coronavirus). He also gives extra credit, overall a great guy!",1
"I had him online for summer 2020. He is awful. His recorded lectures are him just reading off of his slides. I stopped watching because it was better to read the textbook and make my own notes myself. When asking him questions, he is unclear and I feel like he doesn't really listen to the full question. Quizzes are brutal; exams are fair. Beware!",0
"Solid lecturer, would definitely take another class with him. Lots of readings to do, so just prioritize your time. Ask questions, he likes that.",1
"Great teacher, uses every resource available to help teach!!! Keep up the good work Brett!",1
Be prepared to stress but good thing is that open book besides on midterm and final.,0
Frankie was the best.  Learned more from her than from any other in the texas state math department.  She goes above and beyond to give everyone under her tutelage succeeds.  She gets an A from me,1
"there is no way to describe him other than pretentious, Ive never met a professor that is so quick to tell you that you're always wrong. he will rip on you on exams if you don't include one small piece of curriculum OR don't go above and beyond (just to get a C). he will make you feel stupid and belittled for asking questions or arguing ur grade.",0
The information she provides in the lectures is rarely if ever useful. She is not helpful if you ask for advice regarding studying. The tests are incredibly difficult and specific. They cover everything from the book and the lecture. Also the powerpoints are not uploaded to webcourses so take notes and pictures!,0
she is a fun teacher but grade projects really hard.,1
"The material is easy, and this instructor does everything she can to make this class the opposite. There are more assignments than anyone can keep up with. This can lead to some half-effort work, but more or less she'll always find a way to take points off a lab report/worksheet. The most nit picky grader you will see. She is not the best choice.",0
"I had a lot of trouble in this class. Her assignments made no sense an I often found myself stressing over due dates because she was so unclear about assignments. I love science, but this teacher has made me resent teaching the subject. I dread going to this professors class because she never gives us any breaks and we often have to stay late.",0
Wonderful professor. I graduated a few years back and had the urge to give her a solid review. I use things I learned from her classes on a daily basis. She will challenge you. She is hilarious in the best of the ways. Do the readings and embrace her feedback. You will improve as a writer and you will develop more sound arguments.,1
This teacher is useless make sure if you get her run. Her grading is ridiculous and grades you down for the wrong reasons. She has her favorites and her tone of voice is very annoying. DONT TAKE HER!!!!!!!!!!,0
Horrible.,0
"You wouldn't know this class is a gened based on how harsh he grades you. You have to get down to the specific details of his rubrics in order to get an A in this class. When the class is struggling to understand what he wants, he records extremely condescending videos and shares them. Do not take this gened if you need world society filled.",0
Lecture was long and tedious..........,0
Professor Lusk is AWESOME. I enjoyed her class very much. She takes the time to make sure each student understands the material before tests and quizzes. It is helpful to at least skim the book before class or at least before tests. She made the point system very fair and clear.,1
Kildea is one of those professors that you will genuinely enjoy his company both in and outside of the classroom. He is a very laid back and down to earth with a lot to offer. He really goes above and beyond with his students especially when setting up film shoot locations. He is by far one of the best people to learn from--great guy!,1
"I absolutely regretted signing up for his class. My cumulative GPA, as a senior at UT, is 3.88. Needless to say, I am neither unintelligent nor a slacker, but this class was just miserable.",0
"She's very rude to her student and talks to them like we're all kids. Almost everyday she come to teach with an attitude and makes rude sarcastic remarks to the class. Need to go to the bathroom? You'll get told you move too much. Want to blow your nose? Don't you'll be ""too loud"". I've never had a teacher be so rude and uncaring than walling.",0
this man is a g,1
Professor Kaufman was hands down the worst professor I have ever had at RVCC. He is a stingy grader and his tests are unbelievable hard. He doesn't care if his students fail and he is not flexible with grading. I highly recommend anyone to not take his courses. He truly made anthropology an unlikeable subject.,0
"I dropped his class, it was the worst. don't be late! hell lock the door and won't let you in. he has an accent and is a little hard to understand. he makes you feel bad for asking questions. and goes through the lesson very fast, I could barely keep up. he also gives tests like every other week",0
"Prof. Jacoberger is very nice and motivated young professor with allots of knowledge! She has a very easy way of teaching, just read the chapter informative and after that the materials she gives you, such a power point presentations and videos, will make things clear. this is my second class with her and online, it is great as the in-person class!",1
"DO NO TAKE THIS CLASS! Unless you live, breathe and dream about local and state politics I strongly recommend not taking this class. Papers are insanely hard and the prompts are extremely vague and confusing. No true teaching or lectures, you are expected to basically know everything before you walk into the door. Find a different professor please!",0
"Her class is not structured/unclear of her expectations.LOTS of reading, and some annoying online discussions.If you have the time to submerge in her class take it.+presentation,essay exams. 3 essays book report.class was hostile.Diff, but you will learn!",0
"If you put forth the effort, this class isn't as bad as people make it out to be. Mr Mac tries to make it as bearable as possible. Come to class, find a study group, and study hard and you'll be fine. He's easily approachable with any questions or concerns you have. He does move fast tho, so it's not uncommon to go home and review afterwards.",1
"Great teacher, great person.  Really energetic and positive.  She knows her stuff and teaches it well.  She is a bit picky when it comes to technique, but that's needed for improvement.  REALLY recommend her.",1
"Brett will go out of his way to not help you when you need help. I spent a month trying to arrange a mandatory meeting because I can't make his office hours, he never once suggested a time. Passive aggressive about my EXCUSED absentees until he tried to fail me because of them. Avoid unless your a perfectionist who can stay on his good side.",0
"Professor Evans knows just about any question you can ask him. The class is challenging for everyone, it's not as hard for people who have had programming before but still isn't easy.  Class is taught for people with no prior CS experience.  Tough course but is definitely possible to get an A if you put in the time and effort.",1
"Dr. Smith is a great professor. You can tell he really cares about his students and wants to see them succeed. When I had questions, even if they weren't related to class, he went out of his way to help me. Also, his lectures were interesting and he gave useful feedback on assignments. I would recommend taking his classes.",1
Very easy teacher that does not take attendance. All homework is easy and for the majority so are tests. The only thing that makes this class hard is writting notes due to how fast she gives her lecture. She is also very nice and help you out at times when it comes to an assignment. If you gotta take SC 101 take her.,1
She runs through power points EXTREMELY fast. I mean barely having time to write down half the slide before she moves to the next so keep this in mind. Aside from that if you read the book you'll be ok. Pay attention to midterm and final review. Online tests are timed.,1
I took OS with him awhile back and have still have no knowledge of operating systems what so ever. He is a professor that specializes in networking and he seems to only teach this in what ever class he teaches. Not a tough class just wish I learned what was supposed to be taught.,0
She's honestly the most amazing person I've ever met she cares about you and really wants to help. the material in class is never boring because she talks about things we really go through on an everyday basis. definitely take her you wont regret it you'll have an amazing semester with her!,1
"i love professor queen! he cares so so much about students succeeding & the course content is super interesting. super easy a if you're willing to put in the work. 40% of grade is based on a journal that's graded on word count, and he gives grade raises if you go significantly above the words. 2 group essays 15% each, 1 individual essay worth 30%.",1
"Let me just say, she is a nice lady, but she expects you to know every single thing, when all she does is give lectures throughout labs, when it's only supposed to be during lecture. I'm glad I withdrew, because I would probably have failed, from out of the ordinary things, such as her accent, her unorganization, and her way of teaching in general.",0
"I took her class because I had to, a friend warned me and I blew her off thinking she just didn't like math. I LOVE MATH, I passed 112 with a 97(for some background.) She gave us 152 problems,PLUS review to do for ONE chapter in TWO WEEKS, plus at home tests. She's cheery, but gives no guidance. I studied for a month straight, that's how i got a 78",0
"Halfway in the semester and all I've learned is basically the psychological effects of breast feeding. Your points come from attendance and tests, which he does provide a study guide for. If you are willing to sit through the lectures and study then go ahead. If not, find another class.",0
"Good professor, he doesn't assign a lot of work",1
She is by far the worst teacher I have ever had!  She goes through the material very fast; the problems we do in class to practice are nothing like the problems on the test.  I think she intentionally tries to confuse everyone.  Do not take her if you don't have to!,1
"Wonderful professor. Intermediate II is a tough class, but he does a great job of breaking down the material in a way that is easier to understand. His tests are really fair and he gives partial credit. High recommend!",1
Honestly record all his verbal notes if you have to its stressful but will get you the A. Also said participation matters but never entered a grade for it it looks like the grade was just based off of the midterm and final. Write as many notes to pass this class,0
"Dr. Childs does not know logic, therefore she should not be teaching logic.",0
I see it's been a while since anyone has commented. Well allow me to update you all. Not much has changed. She teaches a 3000 level class like it's graduate school. Expectations are beyond ridiculous! I am very opinionated and she did not like that at all. Her being a scholar has really gotten to her head and she is overly cynical. Do not take her!,0
"Make sure you get a good group for your research project! She is VERY unclear on assignments regarding the project but lets you turn things in late and resubmit things, I was stressed out and worried about this class all semester, but if you are staying on top of stuff you're good. Create a relationship with Olga she is very nice and understanding.",0
I took him because a friend said so. He''s a very smart professor and one of my favorites. His tests aren''t too bad assuming you took notes and listened to his lectures.   He does lecture a lot and sometimes it can be boring. But pay attention take notes and come to class and you''ll get an A.,1
Not helpful at all goes through problems easist way possible not good poor way if teaching would not take again,0
Easiest class I took! If you just do the assignments and show up to class you'll pass--the class is only pass/fail anyway. Professor Summers is so kind and realistic. He offered to take students on tours through the Nurse Learning Center. He also will add 10 people on the first day of class so go if you don't get in and you might have a chance!,1
Professor Juarez is a great professor and I had the pleasure to take him for three classes. He is very knowledgeable in the field of Social Work because he is a Social Worker himself. I grew to love social work classes because of him and I would like to be a social worker like Professor Juarez. Please take him he is great.,1
Notes are very vague sometimes... Seems like half the stuff he goes over isn't on the quizzes or tests. Never worked so hard in my life to try and pass a class . Make sure to write EVERYTHING he says down because you will need it in some type of way. Moves very quickly so pay attention! Prepare to study hard. ,0
Really a horrible instructor for math 95 and higher. She does not know the materials for any of this math class. Really rude in class and yells at students when she made the mistakes. Her office hours are really late and when students goes to her office hours for help. She sleeps in her office hours and yells at students for no reason for material.,0
"Prof is very passionate about the material. Willing to give hints on how to treat assignment questions if you are stuck. Very positive energy. Get the books though, he can be hard to follow.",1
"Dr. Kim knows what he is talking about and knows that you know he does. He went very fast the first half of the semester and the language barrier was a little difficult, but his tests are very similar to the homework and mainly looks for knowledge of the application.",1
"He was a very kind person and tried to make lectures fun and entertaining. This was a difficult class because many of the concepts are more counter intuitive. Parts of the exams were group focused, but it's still on the student to know what's going on. I failed this class the first time and had a different professor. Recommend Loren over anyone",1
Homework has some tough questions that are made harder than they need to be due to the prof only giving one or two examples per topic. He's quite friendly in his office though and can explain things a lot better so definitely utilise those hours.,0
"He always seemed bored with what he did at NOVA. If a couple people didn't show up to class (even though attendance wasn't mandatory), he'd regularly go on rants about attendance to everyone who was already there, ready to learn. Books weren't needed and he gave lots of EC.",0
"She is a good person. She is a good teacher. She does not give any other grades besides 1 to 2 point extra credit and her tests. Her tests are 30 multiple choice questions, 5 short answer questions, and 2 essay questions. She counts it wrong if it anything misspelled. The 2 essay questions have to be written like it's going in a Biochemistry book.",0
"He's OK, knowledgeable but like some others pointed out a little too frank which comes off intimidating. I'd take him again if I had to. Class is way to easy once you understand the way it grading, quizzes, etc works. ",1
Prof Foster after two semesters has become my favorite teacher. There is homework almost every day which is needed when you are trying to acquire the knowledge of another language. What you put into it is what you are going to get from it. Intellectually challenging with creative assignments that keep it fun. I recommend Prof Foster hands down.,1
"Every class was a complete mess. We spent about an hour talking about pure nonsense. She was almost always late. Every paper we did made absolute no sense and her notes were completely illegible, she can't even read it. The only thing I appreciated is the comprehensive steps each paper had, made it easy to write. She's really rude and judgmental.",0
"Assignments are extremely easy because he practically gives you the answers. The later assignments get a little harder, but they are all doable. His lectures are extremely boring though and all of the notes are on the website. I didn't do as well on the tests because of not getting the material in class.  I hear he curves generously though.",1
kind helpful fun(for the matterial) insitful,1
"One textbook is required, but she gives you links to other readings that will be required. You will have a reading quiz every single day of the semester with 5-10 questions of the LARGE amount of reading that she had assigned. She's not a very easy grader. Extremely passionate about feminism.",1
"MA is one of the more interesting professors I have taken at Clemson. While she is a great lecturer, she is a tough grader and intends to make the class harder than the material really should be. Make it to every class and put in your time and this class should be an easy A. Don't ask her questions, she tends to make fun of students who do.",1
Learn nothing from this class! Lecture are terribly boring. He expects you to know everything! Midterm and Final are bummer. Do not take this class unless you know all the code and HTML!,0
"seroiusly, do the homework. just do it. and you WILL pass. with flying colors. two tests in and my average is 114. yeah, 114. ive been out of school for three years, and didnt take the course before this one. he literally TELLS you everything on the test the class before. he answers every question on the homework.",1
I had this professor for Calc. She was a very nice person but has no idea how to teach. Unless you are already very good at calculus and can teach yourself I definitly would not reccomend her.  She also gives alot of homework but never explains it until the day it is due.,0
"She is really sweet and teaches very well. has a load voice where you can hear her across the room even outside the class room. She wants you to learn and she will help you. you do have to read for PBL, if not you can not do quizzes. test are confusing but you have group projects and labs that help. if you take her you will enjoy it but its alot of",1
"Dr. Crowley was specific in how to succeed in the class and on the final. She provided a workbook to be used instead of the textbook, which she created. This was extremely helpful to learning the material and obtaining a good grade on exams. ",1
Honestly this woman is amazing. I took her and got an A. Extremely lenient and understanding when it comes to late assignments but dont take advantage. As far as that her class is easy do the work on time with proper formatting and you'll definitely be good. Taking her again for the second time now.,1
"many of the previous reviews were in large lecture halls, i've taken him for quite a few classes, including a small seminar with less than 20 students.  he does have a thick russian accent, but good luck finding a prof in the math department who doesn't. his tests are pleasantly challenging. he's a fun guy who has a passion for what he does.",1
"You will love this professor, except for the fact that he does not tell you what your grade is until the end of the course. Get ready to laugh because he is crazy weird. You will be working in quite a few group projects. The final requires you to present a blog filled with all your work and you will print and mat 15-20 of your best shots.",1
Don't get on his bad side. Not very understanding. Everything must be done his way or no credit. Makes multiple uncalled for political jabs.,0
"Brooke is the BEST math professor Ive ever had in my life! I really struggled with previous classes from other teachers, but Mrs. Kennedy made math a breeze. She gives awesome study guides that cover nearly everything on the tests, so I always felt prepared without wondering what the questions might be on. She is also very enthusiastic & caring!",1
He was no real help even when I specifically emailed him for assistance. This was a very frustrating and stressful class. I have no idea if it would even be better taken as a non online course.,0
"Dr. Lim is a knowledgeable prof. Notes were clear. However, he is incapable of teaching or getting anything across. Took him in the summer, and it was painful to watch his lectures to get somewhere since he focuses on things that dont matter. His midterms were okay. Final was natural selection. Advice: dont take him unless you absolutely have to",0
"Not the most difficult class in the world, but tough grader on papers. Show up on time and stay for the whole class to get the most out of everything. Read the materials that she puts online and you should do well. SHE WILL MAKE YOU A BETTER WRITER. Two tests and three papers. Paper topics are very interesting! Highly recommend",1
"Dr. Ferrero lectures from her own powerpoints and the class has 4 exams, 1 presentation, and lab/class work. There is a lot of information covered in the powerpoints, so she provides a review for each chapter so you know what to study for. She is very smart and kind. The class has zero surprises. Bio 2 is hard, so you must study!",1
I wish didn't have to take this class. I felt like I drew the same trees for most of the semester and it bored me to tears. I suck at art & I still wished we did something more challenging. Most of the projects are geared toward 3-d for 1/2 of the semester(??) He's nice but you do not leave feeling you learned anything.,0
"I'm pretty good at English but her class was impossible. She assigned 2 papers every week that had to be 3-4 pages each. I fell behind in all my other classes because the homework took up most of my time. On average I spent between 3-4 hours on each paper. It was also just really confusing, most of the time I felt completely lost and overwhelmed.",1
"Awesome guy! Helpful, and knows his stuff. His class is based on the midterm, the final & attendance. Hs test are really easy and he seems to enjoy what he is talking about. I would really reccomend him. :)",1
"Does not explain his grading for the homework, which is 50% of the total grade, lectures are fairly well organized but also fairly boring.",0
If you don't have your notebook you've basically failed the class.,0
she's so nice and she gives all the help you need to succeed in her class.,1
"Awful professor. Can't answer anything on the spot and is rather unknowledgeable about most things (i.e., referring to PCC as PPC, or thinking methylene chloride is the same compound as chloroform). Apparently used to be a great professor until recently. Not very well respected.",0
"Best teacher I ever had a Stockton! Loved her class more than any other class I've taken. There is a lot of work involved but as long as you keep up with everything you will be fine, she is a fair and easy grader. This class was inspiration and the service learning was my absolute favorite thing about it!",1
Really nice. I had problems with the TA marking unfairly and she read my essay and put it a grade up. She is very approachable and fair.,1
"Great teacher! Is very flexible and helps you if you need it. You have to study, her tests are hard.",1
"At first I didn't like Swank, but now I see that she is an amazing teacher. It might not seem like she's teaching you anything but you learn a lot! She also is very sweet & gives good & helpful criticism so you know what's good & what needs to be fixed. Isn't too harsh of a grader & will give you all the help you need to succeed in her class",1
"Lectures were very dull and hard to follow, plus he brought up his personal life a lot. This was a lot of people's first CS class and I didn't feel like I was being guided by a professor at all. He taught us things that weren't important for each section throughout the quarter. Please don't take if you are new to programming.",0
"Gives very detailed and insightful lectures that really allow you to grasp the content as well as the texts. Midterm required you to recall smaller details, but it was open book and quite easy if you took good notes. Tutorials had regular pop quizzes but they are not difficult if you have read the texts.",1
I enjoyed this class. It was online so I can't comment on the lectures. But I enjoyed the course and was happy with the feedback and the timing. She took the time to read everyone's responses and respond as needed.,1
Although the class was extremely boring (2 hours 3 times a week with an hour of lecture and a hour of recitation back to back) Dr. Ross was very informative upon showing example problems to where it was easy to understand the material. Also his 2 midterms and final were very easy as long as you studied and he provided many extra credit chances.,1
"Lectures are mandatory as you don't receive notes outside of class. Labs are the easiest thing ever but the exams are extremely difficult. He claims ""short answer"" but when it's worth 10 marks and takes up a full page, I consider that long answer. Will test on very specific things. Likes to compare phyla. Would not recommend.",0
"I don't know what the other rating was saying, but homework is NOT optional. He emails me everything when I turned in an assignment saying how bad I did, and offers no suggestions. I don't even understand how it can be wrong when it's perspective questions. This isn't just me, it's everybody else in the class. He does not teach AT ALL.",0
"Professor Dominguez is an exceptional teacher. His standards are high and he expects his students to be dedicated to reaching those standards. He spends an immense amount of time making sure that his students understand the material. Although his grading can be tough, he gives feedback that will help you improve as a student and writer. Great class",1
"1 Laura Ridenour a Quality of Teaching ai The worst teacher you will experience aii No quality in her teaching b Organization Skills i Nonexistent (she is supposed to be expert at organization?) c Communication Skills i. none, she is the worst",0
"She is an okay teacher, the homework assignments are extremely long, taking up to 3 hours to complete and most of the material on the assignments are not learned until the day of. She gives plenty of help if you need it, but if you don't then you end up wasting a lot of time sitting around. Grading on everything is extremely harsh.",0
"The lectures are dry, but, do your best to push through them and take excellent notes... You need to go to lecture to do well on the exams. There are two exams and one final, and one two-page essay.   You will be required to read many texts, although, I got an A without reading any of them. Don't waste your money, find them for free.",1
"Dawn is a fair but hard professor, but you are taking her class for nursing so it should be expected. I took GH 125 with her and about 90% of the class did not do the reading and would constantly miss class. Again this is college and the material is difficult. If you refuse to read, attend class, and study you will fail. Expected if lazy!",1
Impossible to understand. Rambles incoherently at times. Just read his slides and sign the attendance sheet and you'll be fine. Bring something to do in class though.,0
"Harvey is the best professor for chemistry within the LACCD system. She clearly tells you what you need to study for her exams, gives you countless examples of every type of problem that you will encounter on the exams and makes the lab time very constructive and focused. You literally just have to listen to what she says and you can get an A",1
For those of you that want to pass English 1A there are many other instructors that teach this class with the student's success in mind. Stay clear of this instructor unless you want to learn English within prison walls. You will buy many books that you won't use. Be prepared for boring lectures.,0
This teacher is one of the worst I've ever had. She bases her class on personal opinion (about abortion being wrong and the likes) and you don't learn any sociology. She goes on about not being politically correct. And  her tests are like 60 questions of stuff she didn't teach. Everyone saying she's great has to be white and have the same opinions.,0
"Gives totaly subjective quests that r impossible 2 find specific answers 2, yet she wants u to somehow manufacture multiple citations frm the text 2 support ur position. Don't think she even reads the Bb responses b/c she repeatedly gives canned responses that ""you need to summarize and give personal examples"" even when they've already been given.",0
"Devoney is a super nice lady and does care very much, but she has no idea how to effectively teach and is constantly at least 2 chapters behind all the other classes. She seems to be constantly stumbling over her words and confuses herself. Unless you take the time to go to the extra work sessions, you will always be confused.",0
He loves the sound of his own voice. Take another professor if you really wanna learn stats,0
Unreasonable strict on grammar. More strict than my English professor.  It doesn't like a planning class more like an art class. Lots of reports  and analysis. Too much details to lose your mark. I would drop his class if it wasn't mandatory.,0
"I recently took Bachman this past summer, 2019. His grading scale is based on three tests, each 1/3 of your grade. For the sake of my credibility I got 100% on all three. He expects you to have a deep understanding of algebra. If you do not understand the material you need to do the hw! Tests are predictable and based on the hw and study guide.",1
"I love Dr. Oakley as a person, but this class is very hard for non geology majors. There are SO many opportunities to bring your grade up from the tests throughout the semester, but if you don't get As on those it can stop you from doing well in the class.",1
Mrs. V is one of the best teachers ive had at wake tech. She explains the concepts that will be on the test and the labs we completed were fun. Recommend her to all of my friends. Put forth a little bit of effort in this class and you can pull out a B if not an A.,1
I really wanted to enjoy this class. Phelps is very opinionated and constantly contradicts what's in the book and DVDs. He will start lecturing about material in test 5 before you've even taken test 6 He is overly critical of the ONE PAGE writing assignments and is known to berade the class before passing out the graded essays. Very disappointed,0
Excellent experience.,1
"In regards to personality, Dewey does like to throw in jokes which may or may not work, but he realizes that and isn't afraid to laugh @ himself. He looks a bit like Paul Rudd too. He'll answer your q's, help you set up for a presentation, no homework but he grades hard on speeches. On the upside, you do peer evaluations which count for easy points",1
"Very smart, cares deeply for his students, class is interesting ",1
"Honestly not sure what the Stats I students are talking about, but they're entitled to their opinion. I had the privilege of having Dr. Wang for quality control and it was a very pleasant experience. She knew the material and really went out of her way to make sure we understood what was happening. She's also very fair when grading and considerate.",1
B-O-R-I-N-G !!! Impossible to stay awake in his class... he surely is a nice and intelligent teacher but there is no structure in the course. You can definitely stay at home all semester and just read his power point online...,0
worse teacher ever,0
Good teacher but needs to take a breath during class he never stops talking.,1
"Everyone has their niche. Teaching & explaining is not Rogers niche. One of, maybe the worst professor I have ever had!  Take someone else.",0
"I disliked this class for multiple reasons. He takes roll at the beginning of class and at the end. It's additional 5% extra of your grade and believe me you need it. My class was Tuesday's and Thursday's from 5:30pm-8:10pm. We stayed their one time until 8:20, just so he could finish his lecture and to take roll. Focus on concepts!",0
"You will not pass if you don't have the textbook. On your review sheet, review and read every single little detail she tells you to read.",1
She is very picky with her instructions and expects way too much out of an online course. She makes it very confusing and complicated to submit your work.,0
I had to take summer school and so I enrolled in Dr. B's class.  I'm so glad I did.  He's amazing.  I'd taken a different professor and failed because I couldn't write down all the notes on the black board... but with Dr. B he really helps you.  take him!,1
"Definitely hardest professor for comp sci. Grader takes million years to return work. Professor does not give feedback so go whole semester without knowing grade. Assignments are confusing and professor often makes mistakes in directions, often updates directions. Have to start early. Exams very difficult. Grades A or F, not give partial credit.",0
"GREAT professor! I took online Comp II, and got an A. It is not a slack off class, but all the assignments are extremely clear and he will help if you need it. I really, really enjoyed this class and feel like I actually got something from it. Highly recommended!",1
"He knows a lot about his subject and has interesting lectures. Old way of teaching, he lacks pedagogy. I got lost in a sea of information. The process of how to write an essay was confusing. If you are a visual learner like me you will be lost. There are no charts, drawings, pictures, audio or movements to support learning. Just disorganized text.",1
i love her.... she keeps me interested.,1
"A jolly nerdy fellow. He's a little strange, but does a great job teaching the topic. Assignments, labs and lectures are very organized. Very pleased with the course.",1
"Obviously those who don't want to do the work will give the worst reviews. Those who say she has an accent are plain ridiculous. She is very organized, gives wonderful lectures and has emailed back in a few minutes. So not sure what the complaints are about! Tough class, so do your WORK!!!!! She made an online class WORK! Great prof.",1
"AWEFUL!! I took Cultural History of Dogs and was SO excited for it.  She totally ruined it by teaching the class as though it was an impossible writing class.  If you can help it, DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS!!",0
"This course is so heavily dependent on the text it's not even funny. The lectures are long, tediously boring, and ultimately useless as they do little more than summarize the text. The midterm was easy, but people stopped showing up to class after that and he purposely made the final hard to screw everyone over! My mark dropped almost 10%",0
"Outstanding math teacher. Very knowledgeable, willing to help, and explains concepts with great clarity. I took this class after taking Calculus so it wasn't much of a challenge, but she kept my interest by using real world application of stats.",1
"This professor made one semester for me at Northeastern a living Hell. Easy enough class, but my experience with him was one of the worst in my academic career. Do not take a class with this professor f you are a working student or require flexibility with your deadlines/workload . 0/10.",0
"An interesting take on education, by challenging current perceptions. It was really fun getting to work with the Elementary school systems was a great way to understand concepts. Will is an amazing and well-informed instructor. Lots of reading, but no textbook, quizzes were a bit hard.",1
Loved Mrs. Gray. Her class is an easy A.,1
Average exam scores are always below 60%. Heavy homework. Doesn't explain things very much. This course requires intelligence of your own. I wouldn't take this course if it weren't for the graduation requirement.,0
"FAVE professor! He is very nice &easy going guy. Makes terms and processes of the human body VERY easy to understand &will go over anything if you just ask! Def uses the textbook. 12 quizzes and 4 exams, takes away 2 lowest quizzes! REALLY helps your grade. You just need to take notes and study, only goes over what is needed. Wish he taught A&P.",1
"This professor is the least caring person ever. He never answers emails and could care less to help you pass the class. He claims the class is easy but your final grade is literally determined from 4 things the entire semester and he refused to give you full credit, but won't tell you what you did wrong. Seriously, do ANYTHING to not have him!!!",0
"Never will understand his lectures. He is the worst prof tbh, never take his courses",0
"This is by far the worst professor I have ever had. He does not know how to teach. He will lecture the whole class on random information and then give you a pop quiz that doesn't even have to do with anything you learned. He doesn't post any grades. When checking in with him to see what my grade was he said ""I don't know calculate it yourself.",0
doesn't know how to give proper instructions for the test,0
"Prof Jones was amazing! He is definitely passionate about art and wanting the students to take something from the course and continue to learn and appreciate art. It was a lot of fun for a summer class. Some lectures his voice was monotone, but the power points were chalk full of information. No final. Just quizzes and projects. Easy A. :)",1
She takes this subject way to seriously for being a beginning 101 media class. Way too much outside work for no reason and doesnt let her TAs do anything. The lecture is usually super irrelevant to the tests which sucks because the whole class grade is the tests. Shes a SUPER awesome person and would be a dope friend but cant say Id take again,1
"Very hard grader!! I was lucky to even get a B in his class. You get 4 essays to complete throughout the semester. He allows you to bring a rough draft and edit with your peers,which helped. Make sure you do homework and participate in class discussions. Try to go to his office hours prior to handing your essays it will help avoid falling a essay.",0
She is one of the kindest professors at Ramapo. The work she gives you is based upon your own skill set. I would definitely recommend taking her  classes.,1
"Im ngl, Fontenot's classes give me depression. He's a necessary evil. His projects are heavy and pretty difficult, so it's great project experience, but it's substantially hellish during the process. I am grateful to be challenged, but he challenges you to reach his very high expectations without teaching in class how to get close to it. Good luck",0
"I gave this professor a chance in the beginning, but she moves through her lectures incredibly fast and she doesn't care to make sure everyone is on the same page. Plus her smart indirect side comments did not help. I was struggling with this class and when I came to her for help because I wasn't getting it, she indirectly told me to withdraw",0
"SWEET person, bad professor. The readings were so boring and the assignments were so long. All 6 projects took a substantial amount of time and she talks and talks and talks and talks. You get bored. Really bored.",0
I took Ancient Western Philosophy with Prof. Shartin. I was extremely excited about the class until I had him. He is never organized and gave the exact same notes every day. Then didn't understand why 75 percent of the class failed his first quiz when none of the questions pertained to the notes he gave. Steer clear if you like organization.,0
Shes a really good professor,1
BEST PROFESSOR OF MY FRESHMAN YEAR. He is so funny and really cares if his students are understanding what he teaches. He is clearly very passionate about economics and presents the concepts in an extremely clear and digestible way. No homework if you take notes on the lectures and open notes for all assessments. 10/10 would recommend no question.,1
"Love this professor so much and really enjoyed taking her online class. She is very caring toward her students and gives good feedback when you email her. The content of her class was truly amazing and I loved learning poetry, short stories, and playwriting with her. She made class fun and very interesting. If you can take her I highly recommend!!!",1
"Traditional style lecture with ppt slides that she skips thru(states wont be tested on but sometimes are), very few examples considering its a science course. No hmwk to better understand material. Xcredit assignment after, 1st exam that helped comprehend material. Make sure you read all chapter & review all ppt slides before class.",0
No extra credit. His test are worth 70% of your grade. doesn't drop lowest test. Doesn't explain things and is very rude.,0
"Avoid this class as it's a lot of work. She is unforgiving of absences/missed work and personal needs. There are many papers to write, projects and debates. She says her online exams are hard and timed and most people fail them and yes, it is completely true. She favors girls/outspoken individuals. There are better classes out there.",1
4500 words report + 1.5 hr quiz for final. NEVER answer your question properly. Whatever you say is a complaint.,0
"He was my advisor and happy to say that he's also someone I email every so often to say ""hi."" His classes were very hands-on, engaging discussion, and use of multimedia. Always willing to help, always available and is an asset to RSC!",1
"Very tough grader and will not curve. There will be extra credit questions on the tests, but, you will also have major points off for minor mistakes. Moves very fast. If you don't already understand the math that you are taking you will be in trouble. If she likes you, she's nice. If she doesn't...........",0
Dr. Hughes is a very complicated teacher. She piles homework as if it is an accelerated course and is not forgiving on assignments. Very judgmental on grading. I am a Sophomore and have had nothing but A's. She is unorganized and unpredictable. This will be my first class I drop out of. She is unresponsive and I regret wasting my time.,0
"No math teacher has opened my mind to the beauty of mathematics as much as Tuan Le. His asynchronous lectures were clear, concise, and informative.",1
"I don't understand why this teacher yells during his lecture as if the class cannot hear him. He is ineffective as a professor because during a group quiz, none of the students knew what was going on. I would advise to take another professor over this one.",0
"Lectures are very thorough? This guy legit never writes a SINGLE LINE OF CODE in his class, and he has no DEGREE according to KPU faculty, how could you take him? There's a reason why only 8 people show up at his ONLINE lecture!",0
"Singleminded, not helpful, poor presentation, has huge favorites/dislikes",0
Mike's feedback and grading criteria are unclear and subjective. Everything we read was gratuitously sexual and/or violent. The content of the class was honestly disturbing. Mike is not tolerant of the opinions of his students and is downright condescending and rude. My high school English classes were infinitely better.,0
Absoulte space shot! I had her class at 3:30pm and was still falling asleep. She will give a paper s low grade but give hardly any feedback as to how to do better. Do not take this woman's class!!!,0
"Extremely tough when grading tests and quizzes. If a student makes one mistake, all work following it is worth 0 points.",0
She's not a very helpful professor because she usually reads off the slides. Class is usually boring. Attendance is a must.,1
"This guy's class ia a joke!  I would not call him a teacher, but rather a mere facilitator.  There is no input from him or any of the other professors that ""teach"" this class.  The class is pretty much run on auto-pilot with virtually no involvement from the ""professors"".  Useless busy work - This is from someone that got an A!",0
"Horrible teacher, easy tests. Don't take if you actually want to learn/are a business major.",0
"Professor Chang is a gem! I'm not sure what that one person was talking about with the language barrier (just because people aren't white doesn't mean they don't know how to speak... that was real stupid on their part, any-who). Chang is so nice, he guides you through his assignments so it's impossible to fail unless you want to.",1
"This professor likes to point out the ""appalling propaganda"" from movies and groups that promote conservative ideas like capitalism... but fails to include analysis of propaganda from the liberal political ideologies. Sure she's inspiring - if you like being spoon fed political indoctrination.",0
Do not take this professor. She is rude and gets frustrated when you ask questions. Lectures are very disorganized.,0
TERRIBLE professor. He is very cocky and the entire class is about his life. He does not use power points or study guides and the test are all essays based off of his random opinions. Avoid if possible.,0
Very into the subject matter. Excellent professor.,1
His class is so boring.  You have to read all these poems he picked out which is boring and write a essay on it. The class is mainly on participation. I got good grades on my papers and still got an C in his class. I only take it if you have to.,0
AVOID AT ALL COSTS.  Ms. Bridges was one of the least effective teachers that I have ever had.  She often times makes problems way more confusing than they really are because she doesn't understand the material.  Those who did well in the class had previously taken calculus.  Her tests are really tough unless you understand all the concepts.,0
Professor Megan Tucker is absolutely amazing and the best professor. She listens and definitely willing to help. Easy A and textbook is not required so far as you pay attention in class and go over powerpoint. She gives a lot of extra credit.,1
Sitting through this class is utterly painful. He gives you a syllabus but rarely sticks to it. He makes you buy a textbook you barely use b/c you need to get 3 course materials packets (that he uses). He teaches the same idea abut 10 times and then moves onto another one. I have no clue what the final will even test on,0
"I had Dr. Kauanui for Conflict Management and she was great. She really worked with the class if we wanted to change around extra credit or grading, graded fairly, and although she rambled a bit at times, she was extremely helpful and knowledgable on the subject. I enjoyed her real life examples from her personal work experiences.",1
"Professor Peters is brand new but she is great.  She is honest and tells you exactly what she wants on assignments.  She is also understanding and will extend a deadline if people are struggling.  Very fun class because she has a great sense of humor.  Not too difficult of a grader but is crazy for APA, she can see a 1.5 inch margin a mile away.",1
"I really like Angela as a person, and she's clearly knowledgable, but her First Year Seminar was a bit tedious. She only had three books on the syllabus but they were all difficult to find and once you got them you only used them maybe two or three times. If you do what little assignments there are you'll be fine.",1
"I didn't have problems with her.  She's pretty helpful outside of the class, fare with grades. Didn't like her lectures, but book helps.",1
"This is the first class I took for my Masters at NAU. I thought that it went really well. There is a lot of reading material, but if you are good at skimming there is no need to read everything, just enough to understand the concepts of each piece. Discussions are easy points as long as you participate.",1
"Dr. Kostopoulos is a great instructor. Participate in the conference activities and submit your papers on time ( he is flexible if you are not on time but communicate with him), you will get a good grade. Make sure you post useful entries in the conference.",1
"man goes way too fast, mumbles, has horrible handwriting, and just all around sucks",0
Tonya Warden is very rude! She doesn't help you with anything she assigns. She's never understanding! She will give out big papers but won't let you work on it in class to help you prepare for the paper by the time it's due. She's close minded and one of the most disrespect professors on this campus! I recommend no one to take her class!! ,0
"Professor Bonner is by far one of, if not the best math teacher I have ever had. His class is the first math class I have taken where I felt I was not just regurgitating information. He encourages you to explore fields where the topics you go over during the course are applied in the real world.",1
Took sociology 101 and an advanced sociology class called social problems with him and absolutely loved it. He makes the class fun and interesting while learning a lot of valuable knowledge about each discussion we have. Would highly recommend him!,1
"Dr. Grapenthin is amazing as a piano teacher, despite her focus being organ. She is there with you every step of the way, and is very understanding of anything that comes up. She works with you no matter what your level of experience in music is, and she attunes the class to where you are. I could not possibly ask for a better professor.",1
"Dr. Purser is very helpful and highly intelligent.  Although he is extremely smart he does his best to help people understand the material.  His lectures are fun and he encourages class participation.  However, his test are VERY HARD!  When he tells you to read something, write someting down, or to attend a study session you should do it.",1
Participate!! No pop quizzes but gives a lot of homework. Disorganized and have to keep asking for feedback and grades.,0
"She seemed a little overwhelmed at times. Mostly timely feedback was provided on scores, a few exceptions. Very participation heavy with lots of reading and study questions. No real tests, final grade from formal study questions (like a short essay) and presentations. Pretty easy A, but work-heavy.",1
"Best professor I've ever had while at UNCC, you can tell she actually cares about her students. I highly recommend taking any class she offers! Class was only held when it was needed and the days we did attend a class she made it fun and easy. She is also the most reasonable professor I've ever had.",1
"While obviously brillant by any standards, Nelson should not be teaching freshman composition. Lectures were not helpful and he was never clear about what he wanted in a paper, although he likes classical litterature more then modern stuff. The class was the bane of my existence this year.",0
Literally worst experience of my life. Shouldve listened to people when they told me not to take him. I learned absolutely nothing in orgo,0
"If you aspire to be a poet (do they even exist anymore?), or would like to experience what it feels like to learn English inside prison walls, then this is the adjunct warden for you. GOOD LUCK!",0
Very Sloppy! Don't take this Professor! Test are mostly easy I got a B with barely trying.,0
i took building construction with him online. its like he wasnt even there. he never talked to us about anything. we just did the assignments and got no feedback. this was my 1st online class and i never want to take another 1. i had no motivation to log on from my house and i was always late with everything. he gave everyone As onthe paper though.,0
A person inflexibly attached to policy without regard to its practicality.,0
Keating marks you down on EVERY error on a paper. It is impossible to get an A on a paper unless you have 0 errors. Very anal and controlling and wants things his way.,0
This professor is useless. I have learned more about teaching science on Pinterest than I did in this class. She's grades hard on senseless assignments and her lectures are just 2 hour power points. This teacher is not up to par with the other EDEL department teachers. This is the worst class I took during my teaching credential program.,0
Dreaded this class everyday that i had it. Couldn't wait to be done. This teacher takes alot of pleasure out of insulting kids on thier work and pointing out thier mistakes. He emails you late at night and gives you 50 pages of crap to read for a quiz the next day. Dont think he's an awful guy but dont take this if not serious about graphic design,0
"Prof à éviter. Les explication ne sont pas claires, il lit les diapositives tout simplement. Les examens ne représentent la matière, (Plus difficile que les exercices fait à la maison). Passe sont temps à se venter de ses expériences professionnelles, rien avoir avec le cours. Un chose bonne: Répond rapidement aux courriels!",0
"Professor Amundson is clearly passionate about what she teaches. However, the lectures are super boring because she just talks, and theres barely anything to the sideshow. There is only a mid term, a final, and an essay, which are all difficult. If you love history then maybe this is the class for you, but if not do not take this class.",1
"this class is so boring it is making me come on here and write a review. seriously, I am writing this as he lectures. the tests suck. I worked so hard to do the study guide for over a week and only managed to pull out an 80 on the test. he talks a mile a minute so it is impossible to write down what he says and his slides have absolutely no info.",0
"Loved him, took him for first year seminar, very laid back, wrote one essay the whole semester",1
in grading papers he LOOKS for ways to take off points...the type of teacher who tries to make you do poorly...also never available for after class help..would strongly NOT recommend this class with him if you have any desire to get above a C,0
"Easy grader, but it's an interesting course. I went into it thinking it would be a men-bashing feminism course, but I actually learned a lot. She's pretty un-biased and lets you write about your own opinions. No tests or quizzes just short readings every unit and a journal but she grades very generously",1
"It is very difficult to learn just from lectures. Does not allow electronics in class meaning , no laptop to take notes. Goes over slides too quickly and cannot finish taking notes. Uploads unit notes on the class before exams. If you're stuck with her class isn't mandatory. You will learn more from the book.",0
"Mike is an EXCELLENT instructor. Clearly explains information while keeping class entertained and involved. Sometimes when studying texts one can become bored and dissatisfied with material, however, Mike has the great ability to help the reader enjoy the material while relating to it in modern terms.",1
Sandy is a nice person but a bad professor. She simplifies everything to a level that makes you feel like a child. She takes points off for not showing intermediate steps that are already implied within the formulas that are used. She also gets mad and takes points off of test and quizzes if you use different methods even if the answer is right,0
STAY AWAY! First english teacher at smc and was the absolute worst. Old school type of grader who only wants his essay done his way only. Zoom meetings are the same every day and doesn't help you with essays because he thinks everyone already knows how. Find another teacher asap.,0
"Really great professor. Highly recommend. His lectures are great, and his feedback on assignments was super helpful. He clearly cares about his students & wants everyone to do well.",1
"Mme King is a great teacher and person. Totally recommended for taking French with her, especially French I! She's very caring of her students, teaches well, and is generally accessible outside of class and responds to emails in decent timing.",1
Ok she is a tough teacher but unless you are one of her favorites and she does have favorites you will not get any positive feedback from her. She will knit pick you to the point that you can get a note out of you. She'll make you so mad that you'll want to punch her. She can be extremely disrepctful to you infront of everyone!Take someone else.,0
Awesome professor and awesome class.  Lot's of fun and you learn a lot from his experiences.  He tells some great stories.,1
"This class was an easy A! She has so much extra credit available that it could boost you a whole letter grade. There were 3 tests total, 1 HW/week, 1 project, and 3 article responses. To be honest, she doesn't seem that knowledgable about enviro sci because I literally didn't learn anything in her class, but if you just want the A, then take this!",1
"Fair amount of reading, but interesting. We did 2 essays & a final presentation (last term they had a final essay) but as long as you pay attention & write something mildly thoughtful on the daily notecards you should be fine. Professor Neff obviously is dedicated to learning of all sorts and cares about his students. Nice guy. Highly recommend.",1
Very passionate professor. There's only 4 essays but the prompts are so specific and he practically addresses them in lecture. Easy A. It's REALLY hard to fail this class.,1
"I wouldnt recommend to take him for summer. He speeds through lectures. Exam every week, he has a unique way of teaching, which can be confusing. He is funny and... thats it. Other than that, asking questions or help on homework wont help.",0
"Speaks too softly, constantly loses control/attention of the class. Questions his own intelligence in front of class. ""Does that make sense?"" You're the one with the PhD. You tell me. Easy classes. Got a B without trying, caring, or hardly even showing up.",0
One of the best professors Ive ever had. You can tell he enjoys his work. Knowledgeable and entertaining. Willing to help outside of class.,1
"Do not take this professor unless you are a math whiz, like really fast-paced classes, or already have extensive knowledge in the class you plan to take. I took her for Trigonometry, and i was failing most of the semester. She does not take the time to explain her methods and is extremely rude to her students in class. Be ready to study hard.",0
He's flexible and helpful ,1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. Three tests and a final. THAT'S IT. No quizzes so you don't know how you are doing before the tests, and the tests are only 3 questions. Barely any partial credit, so one question wrong and you have a bad grade. Very smart guy, but cannot get on the students level to teach properly. Flies through the material.",0
"Good Professor.  Not as funny as he thinks he is, but damm smart. Tests are fair but long.  Big final presentation in both.",1
"worst prof. I've ever had, the online 6 week class is a joke and I don't recommend taking it, she does not know how to teach and likes to throw in tough trick questions.",0
She is not a good professor at all. she expects you to have knowledge in what she is supposed to teach. I couldn't understand what she was talking about because she never explained and tried to make it sound more complicated than they were. If you are taking this class you should read the text book for exam and dont care about her lectures.,0
"Do not take qualitative methods with him. Your grade is based on three assignments which he does not give instructions on. I'm not even kidding, the final assignment was worth 45% of the final mark, and he gave out a 4 word outline - NO GUIDELINES. Between Turcotte and the TA, there was so much contradicting information given out.",0
Took this as an online course. Only thing she ever posts is reminders on days of tests. I had difficulty and bombed the first exam so I reached out for help and she referred me to the book. The computer graded everything so basically she got paid to do nothing. I discovered on my own she uses practice problems on test.,0
"Professor was very nice and his classes were always interesting. He does give a lot of writing assignments for homework. For midterm and finals, he makes sure he gives you a study guide. If you study it, you should pass his class with an A. Overall, he is a very good professor.",1
"I am writing this because of the negative comment here about this professor. he is one of the best teacher who knows his stuff and you want him to teach you. Take his class and you will learn alot. People here that say negative things about him are people who do not want to do any work and get A, wish he teach all my courses",1
Dr. Heilman is very knowledgeable in the subject and wants you to succeed. If you can not write fast I wouldnt recommend because she talks for the entirety of the course and does not post notes/slides. Office hours are very useful and gives great feedback if you go talk to her but not much written on the papers itself.,1
I loved her class.I took it as a Deck course my freshman 1st semester nd by far my faorite class...the acting techniques and exericses we do are fun and interesting...it helped me come out of my shyness..fav class at Stony,1
"Peevish but knowledgeable professor mainly interested in research. There are three strictly-graded essays which make up your grade. You will find absolutely no leniency in Kello regardless of the validity of your excuse, so research well, follow the rubric, and use professional writing. Lectures are very interesting, but attendance does not matter.",0
he was a nice professor but was too liberal for my taste. very strange and hippish,1
"Well, this is the last lecture he'll ever teach, so it doesn't really matter.  But he still sucks.  An especially big thanks for asking questions on the midterm & final that weren't even in the lecture notes.",0
You will learn so much in this class. She is a very caring and understanding professor. I took her for two classes and I had a blast. She really knows her work and teaches very well love her,1
Great slides and goes over lots of example questions.  Knows his material very well.  Nice guy.  Good at explaining concepts.  Midterm and final weren't super hard but there were some challenging questions.  Thought that some midterm questions were a bit irrelevant (not what we learned or from Chem 112).  I would take another class with him!,1
Professor Petro is a great professor! I loved and enjoyed his class. His test are fair and he gives extra credit problems and a take home quiz. You have to keep up with the MyMathlab assignments in order to stay in track. I suggest that you go to every class to keep up.,1
Dr. Haspel is one of the most admirable teachers I've had. He's funny and his class is very enjoyable. He is very easy going and is willing to work with you in any way he can.,1
"SO HOT. He is a fine looking specimen as well as the most helpful prof I've ever had. Relatable, personable and encouraging. He made me want to change my major. Always available to help and is easy to contact. Makes an effort for the class to get to know him as well as each other. Class participation is a must but he makes it a lot of fun.",1
"Amazing Teacher, Grades very fairly based on understanding of material and will take half points if he can tell that you know what your talking about but just used the wrong word or something like that",1
"Not very helpful. He doesn't respond to any students e-mails for help. Also he hands homework back extremely late, so you are not sure if you are doing all of the problems correctly. He seems like a nice guy, but I wish he would explain things in class and show some initiative towards his students.",0
"Mr Boehm goes above and beyond to help you. He even gave other students extra credit projects after they were barely there for class! He is so funny and makes literature interesting, I HIGHLY recommend his class. I had him for 102 & Lit 1 and I hate I can't have him again. AWESOME TEACHER!",1
"This is my second course that I've taken with Professor Ariail.  Made an A in both classes.  Great teacher.  There is a lot of work to complete, but if you do your assigned work,  you will pass.  Seems to care about his students. Responds promptly to emails if you have a question.  I recommend any of his classes.",1
All of her grading is very unclear and doesn't make sense even after emailing and asking for clarification. As long as you do the assignments you'll get credit but be careful with instructions. Easy class for the most part but difficult teacher to get along with. She could use some communication classes of her own.,0
"Dean is approachable, understanding and overall just a very nice guy to have class with. I've had two classes with him and received a 4.3 in both. With a little effort there's no reason you can't do the same.",1
"I would stay away from her by all means. She is intelligent but is a terrible professor. Be ready to read between 100-200 pages each week with her. She has made her political views well known. While she has asked subjective questions she is not open to opposing views, she will tell you what to think.",0
"I completely failed this class, but I am now taking him once again he really easy but the test is a little tricky. you have to study very hard to pass this class. exams are every thing",0
"Dr. Gerard is a great person. She's nice, very intelligent, and a joy to be around. Class wise, she expects students to be at her level of intelligence, she does not offer the best clarity, and offers surface level information but asks for descriptive analysis on exams. Read the book & study with friends in the class if you want to do well.",1
"DO NOT TAKE! As the poster below me said, his exams are IMPOSSIBLE. I studied a minimum of 10 hours for each exam and am struggling to hold a C. Dont bother asking him whats on the exam, he will just send the class an email listing the names of the chapters covered. He doesn't care if people fail and does little to help those struggling.",0
"Great Professor! Tells you what you need to know and very fair. Tells you everything you need to know on the test, be sure to show up to class because attendance is graded heavily. Got through the class with rarely opening the text!",1
"Professor Walter is a nice guy. It is just a very boring class. All he does each class is read word-for-word off his power points. Definitely take him if you want an easy A but if you are actually interested in this subject, do not take him!",0
"She is always on Facebook when I come to ask her a question. She really doesn't spend a bit of time with you trying to explain something, she jumps all over the place. After taking the exam both writing and test don't expect to receive it when she says she will. I recommend taking someone different at the Pensacola campus.",0
Dr. K is a great insructor.I wish all of my other professors would utilize his teaching techniques. Dr. K got you to think about the class and responded to all classmates postings.,1
"-Great, entertaining lectures -very caring -professor brings scantrons for his class",1
This guy is funny! Good PowerPoint. Make sure you have a good pen to take all the notes. He does not e-mail or post the PowerPoints. This is one of the best teachers that I have ever had and I am gradumated!,1
"Most of the assignments are out of 95 points. When the grades are put in canvas it is out of 100, so the highest you can get is 95/100. Super long lectures but the exam is not that hard as long as you study. Almost 90% of the grades for the semester were not posted to canvas until the week before finals.",0
Very hard course for a 200 level course. A ton of reading as for the quizzes even though it is open book the questions are extremely tricky. The VOH sessions in general are completely useless they do not provide any relevant information. I would not recommend this course.,0
"Like the others said, he's loud and opinionated.  He doesn't give students a chance to speak their opinions and if he does, he counterattacks.  His class overall is simple with 2 essay questions and 50 multiple choice.  If you don't mind rude teachers that are offensive then take him.",0
"Worst professor I've ever had. I'm not a good writer by any means and he did anything but help improve my skills. He is unintelligent, ignorant, and disorganized. Assigns to much work and grades harshly, assignments are misleading and lack optimal choices for questions. DO NOT TAKE HIM. ",0
An absolute hottie.,1
"This course was set up well during the pandemic, with a module due every 2 weeks. The modules contained 1-2 quizzes and a discussion plus the occasional case study. Just make sure you completed everything in the module and know your due dates as they dont show up on your BB calendar. Great class with lots of flexibility.",1
I took photography online. His description of major projects were photos and title for the projects other than the first one. He didn't seem to be open to creativity. He would never explain projects to the fullest then tell you you did it WRONG. With out explaining the project in the first place.,0
"Rude, unforgiving, does not participate in BB discussions",0
"He is really into what he teaches, and is often really excited about it. His class is easy, and he often admits it. Attendance is not mandatory, however clicker questions are about 5 points a day- they add up. Easy class, not always interesting though.",1
Professor Bratcher conducts zoom meetings for any student that has questions about the assignments. You can also reach him by email if you have anything all.,0
"Professor Caldwell is the archetype of a wheezing, crazy old English professor: lectures commonly included strange interpretations of course material and the occasional yodeling. He's exceptionally brilliant and well-read, but If you struggle with poetry/literature or lack interest in the subject, you will almost certainly grow to resent him.",0
Grades very inconsistent. Does not respect students very well. Super picky about small details and grades everything way over the edge compared to other clinical instructors. WOULD AVOID TAKING HER,0
"Solid choice for this course. I don't think i would say that she is the greatest teacher, but you definitely know how to program in java by the end of the course. There is a lot of homework. Lectures are long, but she goes in depth on multiple programs to show what shes talking about.",1
"Dr. Porfleet is amazing.  She is a wonderful woman who really wants her students to connect what they are doing in class with their lives.  Her classes are fun and make you learn a lot about yourself.  If you have the chance, take one of her classes!",1
"Avoid this class if its not mandatory. Assigned useless papers, took an easy class and made it as hard as possible. Would never recommend :/",0
One of the best English i have took at Medgar Evers College.  She not a good professor and all ask if you need help.  So always take the opportunity to receive the extended hand and you will get the grade you deserve.  Best of luck,1
"Do not take this class whatever you do. If you want to learn calculus you are better looking at youtube tutorials than learning it here. If you do not spend 5+ hours studying the homework (Given every 2 days) then you will fail the class. If you do take Eran Makover, Good luck!",0
"In lab or out of class, Mr. Dr. Woodard is very nice and approachable. Makes jokes and usually discusses things with you if you have questions/need help. In class, however, can be irritable to a fault and often changes mind about what material we are studying (I.E. changing worksheet for our weekly quiz about five times every week) Lots of writing.",1
I took her and personally feel that her lectures and lab are not correlated at all and are not organized. I come out of lab feeling like I didn't grasp any information. Her lectures are easy and brief and exams are in-depth and difficult. Had an A in BIO 141 and now i have a C in her class. and she lectures during lab?!,0
"Prof. Scaltriti was honestly THE best Professor I have ever had. He is a native speaker with a sexy accent, so that made class more enjoyable. On the plus side, he is very handsome and that was a good motivation to study Italian. I hope I will have him next year! He is THE man!",1
"Anne Paulet is a great teacher. She tends to grade hard but if you do what she wants you'll get a good grade. Studying is a key to passing since you will have 2 midterms, A final, 2 essays, A map quiz, and more. She really wants her students to pass. She offers help for her essays as well as study sessions. She is an awesome take the class with her",1
"This was a tough class. By the time the class closed i still didn't have 4 things graded and so I have no idea how i really did. I think it's unfair that students are given strict deadlines, but professors are not held to the same standards when it comes to grading.",1
crazy... too strict on attendance.. too much work...,0
"Professor Rays class was interesting. Hes a good guy and knows his English, but a very tough grader. His quizzes are mostly on the vocab and are pretty easy, actual grade saver, because he toughly grades the midterm and final paper. Participation doesnt help your grade though.",1
"This class is very interesting but her methods of grading are horrendous. She gives you the questions she will ask on the midterm and goes over the answers in lecture, but even when writing all that out and more from the textbook she says it's ""too vague"". She is very hard to talk to about how to improve, and lectures are VERY disorganized.",0
This class is going to be hard in general so if you are going to take it take dr purser! He is a great teacher!! Very relaxed and funny. He is definitely interested in what he teaches and takes it very seriously. He does not rush through lectures and makes sure you understand the material. I would definitely take him again!,1
"Professor Ramsey has no communication skills what-so-ever with her students. She has a poor attitude and I don't like being snarked at when I ask for help. Overall, the class is easy... But communicating with this professor is a chore.",0
"This class deteriorated my mental health this semester. Dr. Brown's tests are multiple choice - no partial credit. This resulted in me failing tests despite somewhat understanding the content. His lectures are just awful - an hour of rambling and not much else. Please take this course with a different professor - or better yet, at Wake Tech.",0
"WARNING: Don't be fooled by the reviews. He is nice and but he always goes off topic. I tried taking 2 classes wiyhwhim. Had to drop, too much confusion. Had eng & biblical class with and he just twists the Bible in both classes. Talks pure foolishness and makes up things as he goes along.  Don't make this mistake.",1
"Very easy online class, she was very helpful when needed. Really great at grading things on time and the essays were easy to pass.",1
"Professor Garcia is an EXCELLENT teacher! She makes sure everyone in the class understands what needs to be done for a paper. Each paper she gives you will teach you something amazing by the end of it. She inspires her students and lets them know that they can achieve anything they want to. I HIGHLY recommend Professor Garcia, you wont regret it.",1
She is very knowledgeable about the subject. Explains the subject very well.,1
"has an accent but not hard to understand, explains things well and is happy to help. Exams are easy if you do the practice problems. No grades except 4 exams and a final but you can have notecards. He makes statistics very simple. Get out of class early almost every day.",1
Tests are not that easy. Takes awhile to get back with you (text or email) but will respond.,0
Best teaching professor I have had yet! She is just amazing and truly cares about her students! Buy the books for this class they are invaluable to you as a teacher! You learn so much and she truly makes you want to be the best teacher you can become.,1
"If you're looking for a Human Values in Art Class, this class is not for you. The class felt way too focused on world history. The class had tons of reading and hours of assigned videos per week. On top of that, every week she assigned 5 writing assignments that were graded solely on number of words written. The class was boring overall.",0
"Dr. Zavarin is very knowledgeable but more importantly is an effective teacher.  He is relaxed, funny and approachable, and will make himself available for questions.  He seems to want you to succeed and provides thorough practice exams and solutions and some extra credit.  Lectures are thorough and not at all boring.  Definitely take his class!",1
Makes the concepts easy to understand.  Has clear expectations of what desired learning objectives.  Very knowledgable.,1
I wish there was another CS320 prof because he is the worst. I'm not even being salty or joking when I say he is a tough grader and doesn't teach that well. This class was a living nightmare with no help at all and the worst way to grade. I got 0's for the smallest mistakes and tests were just ridiculous levels of time and difficulty. Worst prof.,0
"She teaches really fast and when you don't understand something, she'll be like ""WHAT?  what DON'T you understand?""  A little confusing at times, but she'll help you.  A little short tempered.  Her tests are alright, no trick questions.  She emphasizes on the stuff that's going to be on the tests.  She makes you practice the problems a lot.",1
"Mustard has a rep for meticulous grading & being strict, which is true. But he does care about students that attend lab and put an effort in. His grading in 210 and 211 will determine if you are fit for a degree and career in the sciences. I found that he was extremely helpful. Show up to lab or get marked down a lot! Do not put off your notebooks!",1
Terrible teacher. This was the worst class I've taken at Hamline. His jokes are stupid and makes a fool of anyone that raises their hand.,0
"Although she's occasionally witty, her lectures consist mostly of her reading off lists and statistics from her lecture slides. The work load is pretty light even though her project instructions are kind of convoluted.",1
He is an excellent teacher and a genuinely good person.  I enjoyed his class and learned a lot about writing.  I recommend him to everyone!,1
"The class is pretty straight forward; I'd recommend studying for testsquizzes, but they're not impossibly hard. Eric is a great guy, but his lectures are very dry.",1
Mrs. Hanratty is wonderful!  She gives clear grading criteria and she gives good feedback on papers so you know how to improve. She cares about her students and wants you to succeed. She gives you plenty of time to work on assignments. I would highly recommend her if you want to learn something in English!,1
"This professor should not be allowed to teach the engineering students. Aside from getting 4 books to read, the content she covers conflicts with the expectations of the other professors.",0
Miracle was a terrible lecturer. He would basically write up examples straight from the textbook and would switch the type of problem he was showing without warning or purpose. He also didn't take a single question in lecture all semester. Discussion and great TAs are what got me through this class. Tests are very reflective of hw and worksheets.,0
GREAT TEACHER!,1
Quizzes everyday and is a tough grader. Her tests are very hard and her tests / quizzes are worded very hard. Don't take her you will hate that class and she makes it so much harder. HW every week and her lectures are so long and boring but you have to stay to get points for the quizzes.,0
"Everything on those power points. She is a little too happy, never seems sad or angry, talks to students like they're kindergarten students. TOO EASY CLASS, I felt like she wanted to help students pass, one of those easy prof. that have too easy class that doesn't really prepare you for BIO Series at UTSA. You will not find easier BIO Class at NVC.",1
"As much as I'd love to find the good in professor Vitz at UCSD, I simply cannot. He does not ""lecture"" he simply reads out of the articles and adds unnecessary pauses in his voice to make it sound educating. Papers require lecture citations but all uploaded power points are useless (they are just pictures & words with no context). Avoid taking him.",0
Very fun class. Easy assignments and fun lectures.,1
"Dr. Mandell is one of my favorite professors I have ever had. There is a ton of reading, but it is a literature class so that is to be expected. She is very big on participation in class, but that is not a difficult thing to do. She honestly cares about her students and it shows. She places emphasis on learning instead of grades. Would take again!",1
Very tedious work and you have to pay to take the final and midterm and to have someone watch you. Not flexible about deadlines either. She's rude through email as well.,0
"I respect Dr. Ferguson very much. She has so much knowledge that she just wants to share with us & to learn and expand our knowledge on that. Participation matters and helps the class become more interesting. Buy the books and do the readings. If you do not take a class with her in your years at URI, you will be missing out. ",1
When grading tests and quizzes she tends to give you partial credit for questions you answered CORRECTLY and showed your own work yet tells you that you didn't show the work she was expecting...,0
"this was an 8 wk summer class which consisted of 2 test. the second test is not cumulative. opportunities for EC and i would do them since you can get up to 20 points. there are quizzes each chapter. for this class, she gave us the pdf to the text. there's in class assignments. lots to read.",1
"I like Dustin as a person but his class has horrible grade structure! 90% of your grade will be based on questions and problems that he has never shown you in class. And there is no homework, no tutor, cant see what you did wrong on the exams and Dustin is no help besides telling you that you suck pretty much. No joke, I hope you the best of luck",0
"She is a really good teacher. I am currently in her class and enjoy her lectures very much. She grades her essays heavily, but she gives many opportunities to rewrite. I attend class regularly, but  I don't go occasionally and it hasn't damaged my grade. She does like deep and sad readings so beware. Her blackboard postings are really annoying.",1
"Professor Ibrahim is a nice guy, but his teaching was lacking. He would walk us through mechanisms but wouldn't explain what was going on. He would post lecture notes, but they were often unclear in their content, and the exams were very long and difficult. Student often stayed close to half an hour after to finish his exams.",0
"It's very disappointing that  EWU continues to employ this professor. He is extremely unprofessional, he even takes pictures of all students on his personal phone without asking permission. If at all possible, take statistics from another professor! He sets you up to fail so work hard and you can pass, the math is extremely easy.",0
"This is my second course with him, and it's essentially the same thing - name-drops of famous poets that he knows/knew and long, dry lectures that last the whole class period. He'll ask your opinion on something and then lecture over you anyway. Worth standing because he knows a lot of things, but definitely dull. I was dreading class by the end.",0
"Very passive aggressive! It gets frustrating when he punishes the class because someone else was unprepared and in the next class too.  Difficult tests, he expects perfection but he tries not to hide what he wants and expects.",1
"Absolutely hands down the worst professor I've ever had. Not helpful, not available during office hours, completely self involved. Pretentious, teaches theory entirely from one perspective. Also she can be rude and inappropriate. Essentially, she does not care about students, she is not interested in teaching, and she should not be a professor.",0
"Professor Pell speaks very quickly, it can be hard to catch her pace most of the time but if you do your revision after every class, you should be fine. Also, do your homework and attend classes, score the free marks it will help tremendously.",0
"I love her, she loves us and inspires us to be a better person! I am an international student and have learned so much from her. If you do need a class that will help you with your writing and change your life, this is your a must-option!",1
"Dr. Chalk is very good at leading discussions. When people don't have anything to say she'll input her own ideas. Participation definitely helps. There is a lot of reading, but it's also a lit course so what do you expect? Very available for help on essays. The books are interesting and she has good insights. She's also funny which helps",1
"He's a great teacher. Very knowledgable and super nice. Loved his class. Quite easy. He gives out a ton of bonus. You will need the book for the exams, but  not much else.",1
"Incredibly rude and irritable, hair trigger anger. Incredibly particular in aspects that wont matter in future classes. Seemed bitter she was teaching a 100 level course and not higher level. The worst I have ever had and hope to ever have. If you have to stay at Hunter another semester to avoid her do THAT instead. Unrealistic expectations also.",0
"One if the best teachers I've ever had! I learned so much! She teaches it in a way that is understandable, she also uses power points and study guides so you know what to focus on.",1
"Professor Stacy (no e in her name) Hansen is knowledgeable and experienced. She often intimidates her students and leaves them feeling stupid if they ask questions. She is quite moody and will tell you that herself. Her final exams have been incomprehensible. I like her as a person, but would not take another class with her again.",0
"Lectures are dry and quite boring honestly. As a required class, you'll have to deal with it. Maybe just don't take it as an 8am class and the lectures would be more enjoyable. He seems like a genuinely good and funny guy. I just don't enjoy his lectures.",0
"Okay first off. Shes pretty cute. But other than that she grades really tough. Only makes one or two comments on papers and deducts 20 to 30 points. Dont even think about talking when shes lecturing, she actually puts your name down then decucts points from participation. She is also a very boring and slow speaker, but shes still hot!",0
"*online class* This class shouldn't be taken online. Her notes were hard to understand, any feedback from her is non-existent. Self-taught class.",0
"Doesn't teach. Just regurgitates. She is very unclear at what she wants and makes last minute decisions in terms of exams and content. She leaves the student wondering what to study for, when in reality, the only way to pass is to have the ENTIRE book memorized. When the class average was 60%, she blamed us for not studying enough.",0
"Prof. Doroshenko made math, my worst subject, extremely easy! She is always open to answering any questions to make sure we understand the material. She always has a easy way to explain difficult topics. Coming to class would be the best idea to ensure that you stay on top of your assignments.",1
"Very educated teacher who expects his students to be on the same wavelength. That being said i learned a lot about the preternatural, so many other fields of science, and even some Latin. Pay attention, do the hw and don't skip.",1
"I took her for Editing and she is very clear, very into editing and shes also involved with the Paisano. Most hw is out of workbooks and she likes us to bring our small textbook to class. There arent any tests, just quizzes. We had four this year including the final. Overall easy. Takes attendance. three absences is two pts off total average.",1
"This prof  is for sure the best I've had in the Police foundations diploma.  She is approachable, frienldy, and seriously cares about students.  She has very clear boundaries and you will do well if you work within them.  Her police experience makes it fun to learn in her class.  I would take again for sure.",1
"She does have a thick accent but she is a caring person and does care for her students. She is a good professor. She gives a review that is the same as the test. If you practice the exercise, you are fine to pass the class!!!",1
Took class with him in Fall 2011. He was paired up with Eileen Kelly.He taught the policing portion of the class. He was the easier of the two professors. Everything he lectured on or told you that would be on the test. Read the required materials and you'll be ok.,1
She is really nice and always willing to help!,1
"David is a nice guy, but he has trouble engaging students and discussions will drag on way longer than they should. Criteria for grading as well as due dates of assignments are also very unclear. Had to do 4 oral presentations and a bunch of papers, so lots of work, but pretty much everyone gets the same mark, so not worth putting in extra effort.",0
Incredibly strict grader. Will take off points for even the most trivial of details. Didn't include a screenshot for literally every single process of your database creation? Points off. Perhaps a textbox accidentally obscures a minor part of your query? Points off. Very slow on grading too so getting timely feedback for the final was impossible.,0
Hes a kool dood boi!!,0
"She is a really great professor. Not gonna lie this class was really hard, but if you're gonna take physiology it has to be with Ulrich. There are 5 test and a lot of extra credit in the beginning of the semester, but gradually she gives less and less. The tests get harder as you go on, but you should get the hang of it.",1
"TAKE HER!!! Prof. Curry is an incredible professor. She puts the fun back into learning (at the college level) with her Kahoot games and wild sense of humor. There's no doubt that she loves what she does and wants to see her students succeed. Her class was my oasis this semester - and no, it was not that it was easy. Rather, I felt supported.",1
"This professor was by far the best professor Ive ever taken! She makes learning fun, enjoyable and a great time! If you get blessed and have her a professor thank the gods bc she is amazing! Youll definitely learn a lot in this class and also have a great time learning and laughing! She cares about her student and understands the student struggle",1
Prof Regan is the definition of teaches by the book. Homework and classwork assignments are direct readings from the book. He speaks very clear which makes him easy to understand. He also calls on random people during review to get see who does and doesn't understand the work. Test are not overly difficult but require practice(HW and CW) to pass.,1
"Overall really nice guy and genuinely wants everyone to succeed. However, the final project was extremely vague from start to finish, he doesn't post his lecture slides online and talks extremely fast so it's hard to keep up. On a good note I did learn a lot about marketing.",1
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. Rude and unprofessional. If you don't already basically have a masters degree in physics he is going to make you feel stupid. Doesn't care about his students or their comprehension of the material.,0
"He is great for BA 370 but NOT MIS 300. I am very positive towards learning, but I can honestly say, in this class I learned maybe the same amount I could have read on my own in two hours, & I'm avg. at comps. He uses the same tests of the professor who wrote the course. Easy 'A', but if you care to learn, doesn't teach well like he does in BA 370.",0
I had to take this guy's class twice. I failed the first time & failed again this semester. He's very passionate about the subject but he makes it hard for some people to do well in his class. Quizzes are super easy but the tests and homework's are super hard. If you're good at science you'll be fine in his class but if it's your weakest good luck.,0
"This is an easy class to pass, only if it is your ONLY class. She overloads you with work and in my opinion tries for force this stuff down your throat. I am sure she has good intentions but this felt more like a high school instructor than a college professor. I feel bad even saying this because I am sure she means well.",1
"Professor Peters is one of the nicest professors you will have in college, I cant say enough great things about her. She made the material very interesting and did her absolute best to engage the class. She is also extremely understanding and kind. I dont really understand why the rest of the reviews are negative, she is an amazing person!",1
"Fun and quirky guy, but not one of my favorites. Long lectures and assignments as well as lots of reading that'll correspond with the Clicker questions he asks the next lecture. Bit draining especially for those who take the course in the summer.",1
So far the best professor I have taken! Cares so much about her students and human service field! Clear grading criteria and she is very easy to work with and understanding. Have so much fun in her class and get to know some amazing people.,1
"He was very knowledgeable when it came to the material but I felt like he covered it too quickly. The final is open note/open book, but you need to do the reading throughout the semester otherwise his exams will seem impossible.",0
Easy class. Gives a lot of time to complete tests and readings. Took this class during the pandemic Fall 2020. Definitely recommend.,1
"DO NOT TAKE CLASS WITH HIM! Can't understand him, and makes you feel bad for asking questions. Homework takes hours and is extremely hard. I wasted money and withdrew cause I couldn't stand it anymore.",0
"He started off the year seeming like a nice guy.. He changed as the year went on, Hes pretty harsh I learned this the hard way. He tries to push his views on you (politics, vegetarianism, etc). I think he chooses favoritism as a way to grade rather than what work or effort you put in.",0
"shes extremely vulgar and doesnt really care how she comes across but she can be funny sometimes. we hardly did any work but when we did she would take several weeks to grade it, if she did at all. she doesnt really care and I attended every class, yet she still marked me absent so I have a C in that class. Its an easy discussion based class",0
Amazing prof! She loves what she does and it shows. Simple weekly assignments in class and one midterm/final. Be sure to keep up with hw or else you are screwed tho. 11/10 would recommend.,1
"Her class is not so hard ,but she gives a lot writing assignment and the films for the class are an hour .",1
"Lots of reading but let me tell ya. Dr. Heth is my favorite professor ive ever had in my 4 years at Taylor. He is a man of God, he offers so much wisdom and knowledge, and he courageously follows the Lord even when others dont agree. Amazing feedback he really reads your papers and offers some helpful tips and acknowledges your successes.",1
"He issued assignments from the text book that were vague and he had not prepared to answer question on the assignment.  The mid-term was a bit disappointing, but he did allow us to take it home. I will post more on this class once I have completed the semester.",0
"She demands contacting via Canvas, which no other professor in HCC does. I tried emailing her for problems with the platform but she ""stated on the syllabus to contact her through canvas"" and that was enough to drop me without giving me even a chance to start the course. Dont risk your time or your money.",0
"Probably one of the worst profs i've ever had! Doesn't not stick to the textbook she assigned, the class was a complete waste of my time. Takes for ever to mark assignments, and has obscure exam questions. To top it all off, she chews gum and says um throughout the whole lecture...classy! One might question how the H she got a tenure position!?",0
"Disrespectful to his students and he repeats himself throughout the semester. He spams you with email everyday and doesn't teach you anything about photography. If attendance wasn't mandatory, there would be no reason to go. He brags about students that he has taught but he only does so he can find more faults in his students.",0
"I enjoyed the class, hated the instructor. She did nothing the whole semester. She put the assignments on canvas and then I never heard from her again the rest of the semester. If you need a class that is more structured with feedback on assignments, she is not the teacher for you!!!",0
"Easy A. Quizzes, weekly discussions, 1 and 2 page papers every other week, and a final exam. Veerrry easy grader. Don't need the book. Discussions are majority of grade. Second time taking Dr. Larson",1
Recommend taking him during the summer. It's an easy summer course. 1 essay a week about 5 or so pages. He makes you write  journals for hw but they take 10 minutes at most. Easy summer class. Learned a lot. Boring class though. EASY B and if you try then easy A.,1
"I like him as a person but he is a terrible professor. There is homework everyday and this stuff is complex stuff too. I mostly chegg everything but Im looking at a D to pass in this class. He teaches it like youre in graduate Electrical Engineering college, not an undergraduate Mechanical Engineering. Im glad I can take him only this once.",0
"Very respectful, inspirational, gives helpful feedbacks and very thorough. Tabea is not generous with grades. She is very passionate about her students leadership growth, how they impact their communities and the world at large. Tebea is awesome!",1
"Shaw is an awful teacher. She might know about dogs, but she is a ridiculous and unfair grader, with unclear expectations. DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. I love dogs and she made learning about them unbearable.",0
"Compared to other psychology profs at uOttawa shes not bad. Her curriculum is fair, with a presentations and two midterms. But as a person, shes really unpleasant. Even though I performed well in the class and loved the topic I found it really hard to like the class",0
"This man is painfully awful. He is super sarcastic and when asked a questions he will revert it and at as if it is a comedy club. Even though no one will laugh he still sticks to his act. Not very good at teaching at all, flies through content and the whole class gets low scores on quizzes. Awful professor, would not recommend.",0
"Does not care about the students, does not care about the class. Not that it's a difficult class; he rambles for 85 minutes and teaches actual substance for 5! One of the most disheartening and dull classes I've taken. Literally told students to not get an English major. Just awful.",0
"She is a great professor, always there if you have questions. The class is very independent meaning homework and lectures are done all on your own. The times we met online it would consist of quizzes/test and she watches you take them. The lectures and notes and homework are exactly like the quizzes/test you just have to put in some effort.",1
I had her my first year of college and she was great! You are required to buy books. I normally dont like reading but u enjoyed what she assigned and she makes it easy to understand. Great professor!,1
"Ashley is amazing! She is incredibly smart, though often overly academic/verbose in her lectures that she has to clarify. Participate and do your best to answer her questions. Talk to her and treat her with respect, and she can work with you on extensions in emergencies and treat you with respect in turn. Funny, genuine, helpful, engaging!",1
"You have got to be kidding me! Ridiculously boring lectures, all class, every class (this is a liberal arts college!), difficult to understand, and a horrible grader. Expects very much from students taking a 100 level course.",0
"Just don't choose this teacher unless you already know the material. You will be correcting this professor's work on the board. He doesn't always keep up with his own working on the board, but will fail you for anything",0
"PART 1: For the 1st week, we had an intro assignment that wasn't due til the end of the week. I completed it the 1st day PLUS the one response required. We also had to attach two docs onto our post that needed an e-signature. I emailed her multiple times for help on how to attach the docs, but she coldly responded ""go back and read the directions""",0
Best lit professor at UMD. Workload is reasonable and content is interesting. The man knows his stuff!,1
"Expect the unexpected on lab exams. Expect to know every part of the fetal pig and in a convoluted way. They are not clear pictures. Lecture assessments are very hard too. Rarely will you find direct answers in her material. Questions are worded to be very hard. Very challenging, very frustrating, very hard. Would study constantly and get a C",0
if you're planning on taking this class i'd suggest you find someone else. Ridiculous amount of homework with unrealistic due dates. His lectures are you filling in the blanks and not helpful you're left with more questions than answers. if you ask for help he tells you to go back and read again. take someone else!!!,0
"Vague rubrics for projects which sucks, but he had good availability outside of class.  Funny, interesting lectures, he seemed to actually like teaching so that was great!",1
This class is very difficult. 30 seconds to answer a question on lab exams so its basically you know it or you don't. She's really hard on the students and makes the excuse that if we want to go to the medical field you need to be able to do well under pressure. I would say this class messes with you mental health.,0
She is probably the most disorganized professor I have ever had. Grades from the very beginning of the semester was not entered until last days of the course. I wonder what she does with those 5 months.... It's aggravating because you won't know what grade you have. Email replies have so many typos. Late replies or no replies most of the time.,0
"Take him over winter or summer and you will get to use cheat sheets. On those cheat sheets put all of your hw mngr problems and step by step how to do them. Learn to use your calculator. Tests are 1/2 homework type problems MC answer and 1/2 theory MC. Its not easy, but I like finance, I got an A, most people got C's. He doesnt explain that well.",1
"Tells you the first day that you should quit your job or drop all of your other classes and just have his for the semester! He expects your to study minimum 2-3 hours a day. If you're 100% that you'll be in the medical field, then take it. A lot of people dropped his class within the first week. He made me feel like a dumb college student.",0
"Good class. Participation grades would have mattered but because of COVID, he didnt do that. 4 main tests that were open book/notes.",1
Don't expect any help when it comes to the end of the semster with your grades claims she's there for the students  however if your 1 percent off of the next letter grade she claims she can't do anything to help you. Which is untrue because she will reopen asginments as she sees fit.. tough class avoid if you can,0
"She is amazing, and you get to choose between shop or show hours to get full credit. I chose to work the first two shows, and you have to shows for all the tech rehearsals and shows on time in order to receive a good grade. She is very friendly too. :)",1
He really cares about his students and how they do. Attendance and participation do count. Three test and you do need to study for them. He does give a study guide. He explains the material with real life stories. Also he does give extra credit!,1
"Get ready to read 60+ pages a week. Her lectures are boring and she has a horrible turn around for grading. She grades the papers easy, but she waits until after you have taken the final to grade your homework assignments, so if you weren't doing well on them you would have no idea and would be given no opportunity to improve. Don't take her.",0
"Fantastic Teacher. Very understanding and amusing to be around. Occasionally he'll make some mistakes when it comes to homework but it's very minimal and rare when it occurs. Clear grading criteria, a LOT of homework, but you pass with an easy A if you just participate and listen.",1
Dreaded his class. Just teaches the textbook during lectures with minimal effort to make it the least bit interesting. Exams are a joke and unnecessarily hard. I was looking forward to learning about marketing but he made it hard to appreciate. Good luck if you have him for 300!,0
"Iliana is an amazing teacher. You have to study, do the homework and not be afraid to speak in class, but if there is any subject you're stuck on she will definitely help you with it. She really cares about her students and their grades. I loved this class.",1
"Caflisch is one of the best professors I have ever had. Her study guides are very similar to what you need to know on the exam or quiz, if you are feeling like you did terrible on an assignment or exam, she will meet with you personally and hype you up and give you pointers and she is an absolute gem. Highly recommend her!! Absolutely love her!",1
"Shes a really really good prof if you dont get an a in this class its either because you didnt study for the tests, or read the textbook! Btw make sure you read the research study because alot of those come on the test",1
My first essay was a B+ and no matter how much I went to the Writing ctr I get the same grade wc is frustrating she's really nice and kind you have to participate in class and AVOID being late bc she doesnt like it the only thing w/her is w her esay instructions its quite confusing and no matter how you change the roughdraft its the same grade,0
"This class was awful, i never wanted to go and when i did i was counting down the minutes to leave. She is not helpful at all yet expects A LOT of work from you and mostly all of it comes from the books she assigns. Notes taken in class were mostly useless, very unorganized and a very hard grader. I would not recommend this class to anyone.",0
Shes so mean!!! Humiliates her students in front of the class and makes them feel dumb. I left her cpr class wanting to cry. She talks to her students like kids who are in trouble with their parents,0
"I've never cried over a class in all the years I've been here, until I took policy with Rombo. Probably the worst experience ever. Gives little to no help, and makes you feel stupid when you ask for help. If you go to class or skip, you'll be 5 years behind, no matter what. Worst class and professor I've ever had at Oneonta",0
She moves way too fast but she does give the opportunity to ask questions. I studied hours for each test and I couldnt get an A in this class. She takes points off for everything. She gives study guides but her test questions are different than the study guides and her expectations are always unclear. Shell find any reason to take off points,0
One of my favorite professors!!! He grades every speech but it doesn't go in the grade book. Only your midterm and final will be put into ecourses and used for your semester grade. Both tests are online.,1
Very good teacher with a clear method. He makes you participate and his classes are light.,1
"Ill be honest, yeah he is not the best at teaching BUT outside of class he really wants you to do well and acc would help you, so talk to him, he is so kind and understanding and mans acc funny! I didn't expect to do well, but he helped me get the grade I needed!",1
"He's intelligent and really willing to help out anyone, but most just stare at him blankly. He is really clear in his expectations, I liked the fact that the grade was just two exams and bi weekly HW assignments to basically boost your grade as long as you turned them in.  His review lectures are GOLD and help to focus on the pertinent information.",1
"Prof. Dagenais seems like she cares about the course content and is interested in students opinions. She struggles with her hearing impairment and I think some days this does have a negative impact on her, which is understandable, however her lecture style is very dry, often runs over and she faces the slides rather than the students.",0
An immense waste of time!,0
"Dr. Schnittjer has a reputation for being a difficult teacher. (Something which he seems to be proud of) I wouldn't mind that if his difficulty was actually beneficial for learning, rather than just for the sake of being difficult. Dr. Schnittjer is a kind and very intelligent person. But, he is trivially particular about minor things in grading.",0
"really amazing prof. Had him for online summer 4wk session. If you're not good at math, he will break down the course and make sure you understand it. Only graded off 3 tests. Lots of practice problems if you need more help. Attendance is not required but highly recommended. He will help you no matter what, ASK QUESTIONS!! and take him please :)",1
"He is a very helpful teacher and is willing to explain anything until you understand it. He can be a little unorganized at times though. Gives a all online assignments, does examples in class and gives a review packet and review day before the tests. Also lets you use a note card occasionally ",1
Absolutely brilliant educator. She was very simple to understand.,1
He is the best prof ever,1
"Buahahahaha!! See you on Thursday, G.! -de la Veaux",1
He's a pretty rad teacher. Just do your reading assignments and you'll pass all of his tests/journals.,1
"Makes jokes the entire class, doesn't teach!!!",0
"Incredibly easy class with clear cut grading criteria! Amazing and clear lectures: there were 8 lectures coupled with a quiz, 3 assignments that had to be done with a partner, and 1 midterm and 1 final. She provided a study guide for both exams and the week before she holds a review. I would take her again and highly recommend her to anyone!",1
"I have always hated math and almost failed every math class I've ever taken. Angelica is the best professor I've had to date in my college career, between 2 different college's. She cares about her students deeply, and will always stay after to answer extra questions. She makes sure you fully understand the material before moving on. Take her class",1
Professor Konya graded way too harshly and doesn't seem to care if a huge percentage of his class is failing or has to withdraw to not get an F. He takes off so many points for tiny things. I definitely advise against ever taking his classes!,0
This professor is very passionate. The material itself is hard and he goes through it relatively quickly. I wish he provided more practice. He explains things clearly. He has a slight accent.,1
THIS IS NOT A CULTURE CLASS IT IS A HISTORY CLASS. What I thought would be interesting ended up being super boring. I skipped class all the time and when I did go I never took notes because she went way to fast. Her tests are pretty easy though. Get the english version of the book if you can...that saved me in this class.,0
"One of the worst profs Ive had. She rushes through her slides, and does not give nearly enough time for students to write down what shes saying - let alone understand it. Took two five minute breaks during the lecture, which seems nice at first, but then has to cram material in at the end of the lecture. Her exam questions were very difficult.",0
"Her exam questions were more comprehensive. Her lectures contained a relatively dense amount of material. However, she missed her first couple of lectures since she misunderstood the syllabus. She uploaded an asynchronous lecture the night before reading week ended. Told everyone the final was non-cumulative when it was cumulative. Unreliable.",0
Totally awesome. In 2 weeks I was honestly speaking in Japanese.  Prof Garrisi starts speaking in Japanese the first day of class. Awesome Awesome! She takes attendance for every class. You want to be there. Daily homework from the workbook. Quizzes and test super easy as long as you attend review classes and study. TAKE HER YOU WONT REGRET IT.,1
"Pros: he knows what he's talking about Cons: cocky, arrogant, belittles any student who asks him a question",0
This class had potential. however the professor teaching it isn't a teacher. She isn't a director or even a decent human being. If you take a class with her you'll regret it..,0
Strange class. In class materials/lectures did not co-relate to tests/final exam. We paid a lot for text books but only used it once for in class presentation. In class debates are also unfair. She must prepare us at least once before giving out random assignment.,0
"Pretty challenging classes overall, but Daily really does do a good job overall. Tough on exams, but gives you potential questions beforehand. Requires 3 APA papers and is tough on grammar and content so make sure you proofread your stuff. May seem difficult, but really helps you prepare for graduate school and other higher education.",1
"She makes every student accountable for what they do in the classroom. If you don't show up to class on a consistent basis, she makes you accountable for that as well. Thank you so much, for your lectures, group work, and assignments. I will put the word out, that everyone should want to take your class. It'll change their life. It changed mines!",1
His online hw is so annoying! There are 40 questions and a lot of them have more questions within the question. His voice is very low and monotone so you can't really understand. On top of this his lectures are fast. He tells you what to do for a problem but doesn't go into depth about the concept. He also expects you to already know most stuff.,0
She goes through her presentation way too fast for students to clearly understand the material.,0
"Dr. Searfoss was my favorite English prof. She does a lot with the textbook and she got me to appreciate writing a bit more. She can be really sassy especially if you tell her you didn't know something was due. She really wants you to pass, so she'll help you when she can, but she does make you work for your grade.",1
Easy class and he entertains with his stories.,1
"The class itself is super easy, but I wasn't the most fond of Gray as a professor. I liked her at first, but from some of the remarks she's made I realized she's kind of an insensitive person. Aside from that, get ready for boring group projects, being treated like a 12 y/o and lectures that seriously drag. Should've taken the 6 week online course",0
Do not take this class! The instructor is rather condescending and his TA is just as horrible. They do not really respect the views of others and talk down to the students. My personal experience was terrible. He is extremely boring and his office hours aren't as helpful as one would expect.,0
"So, I thought it was me, but after speaking with other students in the class, there was a consensus that he isn't very friendly and cold.  His lectures didn't help me at all so I studied on my own which was better use of my time.  Take him if it's the last resort.  But he clearly doesn't like students.  In office hours, he'd come off as a jerk...",0
"Mr. Dayoub is by far, the worst instructor I've ever had at DMACC. He can demonstrate programming, but he can't teach it. He won't answer questions, can't tell students the ""why"" of programming, and thinks students learn by copying him. The homework is so frustrating b/c it's not practice - it's teach yourself if you can. Avoid this teacher!",0
she is very caring and passionate about what she teaches. her reviews are the exact test which if you study your okay to pass. a decent amount of homework and easy A's. not a fan of the way she teaches but she does care about her students and isn't rude at all. I don't recommend taking her because she's a tough grader when it comes to exams.,1
He is a wonderful person but as a teacher he is not as good. He gives a lot of notes so be ready to write. His only grades is tests. Although he drops one they are all very hard. He gives study guides and tells you what to study for but most the time what he tells you study is only a few questions where as what he says not to study is all over it.,0
"She is a good teacher, easy, class is never boring. Helpful, kind, constructive, easy grader on debates, and she wants you to succeed. If you need help go to her office hours and she will help you. I recommend her.",1
"Think twice before you decide to take this class during summer. Cannot remember when was the last time that I met a professor who would disrespect students in front of the whole class to comfort his anger. Extremely harsh grader, pray for B before getting any of your work back. A condescending professor, not a qualified educator.",0
"Three hour class that can be done in 15 mins. The professor skips over the slides, which I could be doing at home. Papers are simple but he is a tough grader for no reason. Does not provide constructive criticism for you to do better on the next paper. Asks questions about your opinion, however if it is against his opinion then you are wrong.",0
"She had no idea what she was talking about. Told us to google stuff because she didn't know the answers. Reads straight from PP and you can barely understand what she is saying, but she puts all PPs on blackboard. It is pointless to go to class. Only gives grades for tests and doesn't grade them correctly. You can pass but you'll be miserable.",0
"EXCELLENT professor! I went into this as my first Greek class and I fell in love with it! Im considering taking more Greek classes I found it super interesting. Prof was a sweetheart, super easy to talk to. Clearly LOVES Greek History, he prepares you well for the exam. He has enthusiasm. Text was cheap and used constantly. Excellent Professor!",1
do not recommend,0
took the 8wk class online! well structured. 4 essays. quizzes for each chapter. 4 exams. 1 final (not cumulative). we had to write a response about the chapter (our thoughts) & respond to at least 3 people's opinions. extra credit is offered at the end of the semester. i honestly would take him again. everything was due on sunday at midnight :),1
"Spanish is difficult if you've never taken it before. I've taken spanish for a long time, but this professor is very willing to help you during her office hours and even lets you make up missed work (unless its a habit) She gave up on the online part of the class because it was too hard. Shes a great teacher and is hysterical! TAKE HER!",1
Great professor who makes learning fun. He's also pretty good looking so attending class is not hard. He makes learning fun. ,1
What a dick.,0
"She's really not that bad. I have an A in her class and I've never had to pick up the book once. Just read the powerpoints and make flashcards. She's nice enough. It's the kids who want A's handed to them without any effort who are bitter. You don't even need a professor for this class, so don't bother rearranging your schedule to avoid her.",0
Fairly easy class. I am taking a Bio. lab and for the most part we work in groups and do  labs each class. Id be surprised to see a person fail his class unless they never came or participated. Id take him again for any science.,1
"Awful, currently in the class right now & cant stand it. Shes extremely rude to students who ask multiple questions. She zooms through showing the class the steps to learn & solve the problems because she can enter everything in excel & use function buttons. Requires you to listen to her online lecture as well lots of homework. WCCCD needs new prof",0
This guy is a freaking joke.  I'm am astounded as to how he hasn't been let go. His packets and handouts are extremely hard to follow. His lectures make zero sense and he can barely speak in a coherent sentence.  Grades tough. Good luck understanding his annotations because his handwriting is impossible to read.  DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS!,0
"Very confusing. You only use the notes you take in class for about 4 different extremely difficult tests throughout the semester. They will do you no good on the weekly online quizzes. I thought he was okay as a person and he seems to know his stuff, but hes not a good professor.",0
"Very difficult. She grades according to how she views things and does not have any room for error. Grading is very harsh, somewhat unfair. I studied for a whole month ahead of the ECO 103 final and still got a C! If you are not ready to spend 2+ hours a night on Econ just to pass, I would not recommend taking her class.",0
Though I received a passing grade I still regret taking this class and thinking about this professor is going to anger me for a while. He told me I wasnt aloud to question him because hes a professor. he thinks he deserves the utmost respect by everyone but doesnt reciprocate the respect to students. I would reconsider if you are taking his clas,0
I had her for two subjects which are Advanced Pharmacology and Advanced Pathophysiology. She is wonderful very receptive and gives excellent feedback. She is approachable and you will feel her dedication in her work. I wish I can have her in all my classes. I highly recommend her!,1
He was very rude and set unrealistic goals for the class. I would not recommend anyone to take him!!!,0
This class is one of the WORST classes i have ever been in. He is so monotone and boring and he jumps from place to place when hes talking so im not sure what exactly im suppose to know. He also seems to have an attitude when your coming in and out of class rolling his eyes. I would NOT take this class again if i ever had too!,0
"He wastes a lot of time asking students to talk, but doesn't teach himself. When he does finally explains things, it's not clear at all. He doesn't explain stuff in order and just jumps around. It's really hard to take notes in his class. Hard grader for essays. He'll grade easier if he likes you. Overall, i wouldn't take again.",0
Good professor and good course,1
"For MTH 207, there's 3 quizzes a week, so don't plan on skipping. Also, he doesn't explain things very clearly and he'll work through the easy problems, but leave the hard problems for you to do. Dr. Eager does make you feel dumb if you ask questions at times and he's not always around when his office hours are suppose to be. Wouldn't recommend him",0
Worst professor I have ever had at UB . I wish there were more professors teaching this course that are inspirational and encouraging to their students. If you take him be prepared to have a semester filled of stress and depression. It does not matter how much you try he will always find problems with your work and just wants more and more.,0
"Mary is a great teacher.  I admire how excited she is about her subject.  At times her class can be a bit overwhelming because she has soooo many things due at once, but if you do the work she will give you 100 percent credit.",1
"I'll give you an honest critique. The professor is okay at best. He can be funny at times, but I would stay away from him altogether. The class content is bland, he's bland, it's a horrible combination, snore-fest. Class is v difficult, you will have to work your ass off for an A, to get a C, you can get by half-assing it. Stay away please.",0
"My main problem I had with Sammy was his classes. Reads directly off the slides and if you can't write as fast as he talks, you'll just not have that information. He posts his notes no where because he doesn't want them ""stolen."" STUDY FOR THE TESTS! One bad grade on those it's hard to recover without acing the rest.",0
"Lois is a good teacher, but not great. I found her to be a rather difficult grader and did not give great feedback. I did find her lectures to be great, her guests very good, and I did enjoy the class. The use of D2L was a bit much as well, and added to the confusion more than helped it.",0
"This teacher is a great person, but not a great teacher. She did not teach this whole semester. All she ever talked about was her kids and her life. She only taught a lecture three times  the whole semester, and still expected you take quizzes over material each week. Get the book, its the only way you will pass.",0
"Second time having this professor for an online class. This time around, there was ABSOLUTELY NO feedback or communication. I've turned in 25 assignments and completed the final and still not one thing has been graded. Super disappointing considering this is an important class for my major.",0
"I took Farris for Chem 151 and then again, unfortunately, for Chem 152. He was the only one available to fit into my schedule and I really wish I had another option for a General chemistry teacher. He is a nice enough guy, but his lectures drag on, and he does not prepare students properly for his tests. I do the work and still end up disappointed.",0
"No rubric for any assignments and shows you how to do stuff, but doesn't teach what it is you're doing. Almost every class starts at a different time. Instructions and guidelines are unclear and vague.",0
"He explains problems while writing on board, then u don't have time to figure out how he gets answer. Not good with patients for others, you may somewhat understand, then he totally throws u off before u leave class. U leave with confusion and head spinning! And tutoring lab teaches differently. He knows math but not one to teach it!",0
"Exams are all multiple choice, however very tricky and involved a lot of critical thinking. In the end, she did not give us our exams back so there was no way of finding out what we got wrong or give us a chance to study appropriately. Lectures were unorganized and each exam was on 2-3 chapters. The fin grade is based on 3 exams and participation",0
"Deb Fels utilized a series of guest lectures in lieu of presenting course materials. The guest lectures represented related content; it did not explain the concepts of the course text book. The final exam was 100% from the textbook. I know I did not Fel the exam, but I did not do as well as I could have with lectures on course material.",0
"She was really cool, very understanding.A bit strict when it comes to grading papers. I would recommend her class.",1
"I thought it was an easy class, if you did well in 2nd year research methods its almost a review. No exams, all assignments. If you go to class he gives you good directions for them, is enthusiastic and willing to help.",1
"It's clear that KMack is very knowledgable about ECON, but his ability to transfer that knowledge to students is nonexistant. Syllabus is outdated, and tbh useless bc he doesnt follow it. No one understood how much each exam was worth. No explanation was ever given. No grades were distributed. Went into the final not knowing where I stood.",0
"Very to the point with his lectures. Class didn't make sense until right before the first midterm. After that, tests were exactly what he said they'd be on, which was also very similar to the hw/quizes.",1
Gave class 10 pnts to bring mean up to 60% on a particular exam. You can be absent a max of 8 times. 2 mins late? 1/2 absence. Will drop you without notice. Witnessed it happen to the guy next to me. Will dock points if you skip a super obvious step on an exam. Grades solely based on exams. 10 Qs per exam with his grading? Dont take this class,0
"Professor Cho is literally so sweet, funny, and actually wants you to pass the class. She offers extra-credit on the exam and before it that help you study for the exam. If you read the chapter before you go in, you'll be good. Just pay attention, participate, and show up to class.",1
"Professor Spaeth was pretty good overall, and the content was really interesting. Her readings were a bit excessive (she expected us to read 200 pages a week), but you can get by reading only a bit as long as you participate. She requires discussion boards and has a few group projects that aren't too bad. Overall solid but a bit demanding.",1
"she gives a lot of work like assignments, her lecture is good, the exams are the way to difficult and she is difficult to approach",0
I took her course this past semester and her study guide saved my life! They are so helpful and she is so caring and willing to discuss any issues or concerns.,1
"8 weeks are usually loaded with tons of work but this one is pretty easy. 4 essays, no midterm or final. Lectures are boring but make it enjoyable for 3hrs. I would highly recommend taking her if you want an easy class in English.",1
"Worst teacher I have ever had in my life. Mocks his students, mean, biased, overall horrible teacher. AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!",0
currently taking online class. she is very lecture heavy and hard to understand. Homework is easy but exams are very hard. Class averages are always low. she does offer extra credit a couple times throughout semester to help raise grade. wouldnt recommend.,0
"Her class is very boring she doesnt have a clue how to grade, assignments. I have her next semester and I dont want to be in her class.",0
"Class was canceled often which was good for relaxing, but not for learning.   His lectures drag on and are hard to follow.  His notes are repetitive and all over the place.  I barely used the textbook, which was a waste of money, and it took forever for him to hand back our essays.  If you have another choice, I would take it.",0
"If you're looking to actually learn about literature, don't take this class. Its structure consists of games that have nothing to do with the pieces you're learning about. Dr. Lawrence is the least helpful professor; he lets the students run amok 75% of the semester. And all you do is group work, so if you're an introvert, its that much worse.",0
"He is one of the greatest professors I have ever taken for a Math class. Allows you to use your notes on Exams, Quizzes, and Final. Be aware that you'll often be taking quizzes since he expects you to do the HW and use notes. Calculators (including graphing) are allowed. The only way to get better at math is practice. I would highly recommend him.",1
Edward J Tavss is perhaps the best chemistry professor in the country... The universe? Maybe... He is funny and he makes sure that his students understand every single concept before he can even think about going to the next slide. Is it worth going to Cook/Douglass three times a day for an hour? Not one bit... However Tavss uses a sign-in sheet.,1
Professor Knesek is THE BEST. That's all I really have to say. I loved the class and I would take a class with him again in a heart beat. ,1
"She's not very clear, sometimes she runs off tangent many times and forgets what she's talking about.",0
Professor Royce is a very intelligent man but doesn't know how to teach. He is very unclear about what he expects and goes way too fast in class. He's a hard grader and gets frustrated when you ask questions. Avoid if at all possible,0
"Worst prof I have taken so far. The class itself was not very hard but her grading style is ridiculous. Her directions and criteria were vague and asking her questions only made it worse if she actually gave you a response. It could possibly be because it was an online class, but to be safe, I would avoid her classes at all cost.",0
Great prof! Make sure to attend all lectures and do all assignments and ask questions when needed! The material is not the easiest.,1
one of the worst teachers at cape fear. hard to understand and is basically a self taught class. cannot teach a lick. unclear of assignments and embarrasses you if you ask a question,0
"sad excuse for a human being ......let alone for an english professor!!! drop him, dont take him he will make your semester a living hell.....believe me!!",0
Dr Whitt is very hard. He is so smart it's like he may not understand that the rest of us might not have any clue of what he is talking about. He needs to relax a little. I guess he does a good job though.,1
"You will absolutely love her if you are passionate about Chemistry. That being said, she has online homework assignments that took me on average 6hours to complete. I am NOT exaggerating; it is brutal! I got only a handful of perfect scores, and I feel that after pouring so many hours weekly into just HW, I should have gotten a better HW score. ",1
"He knows his stuff, and will grade you according to his knowledge. The perk is that you can rewrite your papers all the way up to the last day if you want to receive a better grade (You will need this!) The final is take home and is literally on anything talked about during the lectures including random vocab words he writes on the board.",1
"He is a horrible professor I really do not recommend anyone to take his class he talks down to you like if you are a moron, says horrible mean jokes, and his grading is just horrible DO NOT DO THIS TO YOURSELF!!!",0
"I took this class during the fall semester of 2020. His lectures were interesting. He has a lot of meme content which kept it interesting, but it was kind of excessive. We were only graded by 2 midterms and a final. He pre-recorded lectures and he hid the final lecture in a lecture without giving a clear date for it and many people missed the final",0
"She is very strict with her grading on the homework assignments, so even minor errors can drop your score significantly. Her lectures were all PowerPoints and she didnt really explain how to actually code a program very well. Labs often took way longer than expected, and required work outside of class.",0
She can be over-the-top w/her echo &choral responses(vocab words I learned from her) She was the only teacher to EVER push me to work hard &do more than expected. I respect the way she didn’t grade work bc it kept me working hard. She was the ONLY prof who taught me how to teach. My future students will thank her bc she taught me everything I know.,1
"Took Business programming and software development, lectures are clear and he expects you to do according to his specifications, the sky forest project is not east but he is very helpful",1
"Raquel is a cool person, and she says she gets our busy lives outside of class, but her workload says otherwise. What kind of class puts a quiz with 3 hours of information to study for on the same day as a speech? c'mon now, lol nah. Take this class only if you know you have time to put in all of the work for the quizzes. Whats up summer school?!",0
"Professor Riffe has been my favorite professor for my time at UNCC. She has a clear layout for class with 4 or 5 speeches with outlines and 2 midterm tests that she preps you for. Professor Riffe truly cares about making her students better speakers and making the class enjoyable. Please take this class, you will not regret it.",1
"While his lectures were excellent and he knows his study, Mr Schlortt seemed vague and inconsistent in his feedback on papers and took off points from every minuscule mistake imaginable. His quizzes and ""cartoon analyses"" are extremely rushed in class (he hangs over you if you haven't finished in 5 or 10 minutes) and rigorously graded.",0
He's a pretty good professor a tip for the final is know the formulas or you won't pass the final which is worth 45% of your grade. I would take him again. Also go to class because he takes attendance and gives extra credit for coming to class,1
"Often does things without telling students including making midterm dates and putting notes on tophat. When the midterm was cancled he didn't email the class with the new date, instead making the next class the midterm. Basically all the work is homework, expect 5 hours of reading every couple days. Not a good class when you already have a workload",0
My entire class LOVES Janey. She will make you very interested in the language as well as the country. You need to attend class daily or you will fall behind very easily.,1
"She was an okay prof, in terms of teaching I would never take her again. She reads of the powerpoint without properly explaining and a lot of times her review slides DO NOT MATCH HER EXAMS! she teaches something else and gives us review on something else. There are quizzes to boost your mark but doesn't really do anything.",0
"Mrs. Wang is really sweet. You have to show up and apply yourself, however she is fair and clearly states expectations in the beginning. She is easy to contact outside of class, and even makes herself available on the weekends.",1
"I loved this class.  While some topics are boring, others got the class going.  Great teacher and I will recommend anyone taking his PHI class.  All in all, my favorite class yet.  He cares about your opinion.  If you back it up with decent evidence in why you chose to go that way you will get a good grade. Also, do the presentation.  Its will help.",1
"This class was easy and I recommend taking her. I made a 98 in the class. She extends deadlines and is flexible if you have any problems in your field experience. There are 3 bigger assignments and a few weekly reading summaries. Lectures can be long, but she likes people to participate and show at least some understanding of the content.",1
"She is wonderful. Very informative, and gives lots of help and information in the class as well as out. she is also my advisor as well.",1
Professor Doubleday is an amazing professor and is perfect for teaching russian. Her conversation class is well organized and great for facilitating speaking skills. It was a fun class that definitely benefited my learning of a language.,1
"I thought he was horrible, i also thought she was the worst and mean teacher ever there, she thought she knew everything but in reality she didnt know a thing. if you dont have to take i wouldnt take her if i were you.",0
"I took this course during the summer semester. The exams are tough. Take notes on everything in his lectures (what's on the Powerpoint AND what he says) and you should be okay. He only has four grades, which are all exams. I can't stress how important it is to copy down EVERYTHING. He gives lots of valuable information, though. Good luck! :)",1
grading was super late and i had written half of the essays before one was graded. weekly in person recitations and zoom workshops. intensely boring lectures. i felt like i was just regurgitating information for a grade.,0
Mr. Finelli was a very mediocre professor who let peers instead of him determine the grade a student gets. Aside from this he carried a very rude and non-caring tone when he responded to emails sent with relevant questions. The class was okay but this professor definitely does not need to be teaching.,0
She is a good teacher but isn't as helpful as people say. I asked for help all semester and she kept emailing me to go to the math lab or come 30 minutes before class but that wasn't enough time. She is rude and doesn't care about your concerns. Would've passed with a B but she wouldn't give me the help I needed.,0
I wrote previously about my first class with him and he is an amassing teacher! Very passionate. Definitely recommend taking him! ( I chose the wrong rating ) wish there were more stars to give cause he's that awesome!!!,1
Such a great director. Definitely recommend joining her team. Live changing and bonds that cannot be broken.,0
"Although his test may be difficult he usually curves. He has a lot of passion about biology and his students, and it shows in his lectures. He also gives great advice about life.",1
she is the worst teacher I have ever had I hated her class and dreaded going to it. she is boring and is just ughhhh. DO NOT TAKE HER. avoid her at all costs,0
"Not the greatest professor out there. He just talks about the HISTORY of physics but doesn't teach or how to solve physic problems, and all his test are equations and problems!  The exams are no really similar to his reveiws either.  I'd take Prof. Johnson instead.",0
"This professor is tougher than she looks. The course seemed to good to be true, and it was exactly that. She would provide me with feedback that really made me feel incompetent and discouraged about my writing, especially since I received a 4.0 in both my English comp classes. Vagueness seemed to be attached to all of her assignments too.",0
"If you can switch classes, then do. If you cant find a tutor! His teaching style is so hard to follow that I have to teach myself all the stuff. We usually have to correct his mistakes at least once per class. One thing if you have him-Do the homework. Its not mandatory, but hell be more likely to give partial credit on tests if you do it.",0
"He's a fair grader and makes everything very clear. Go to class everyday and take a lot of notes. I'm in  love with him, he really enjoys teaching.",1
"Doug is great.  Really helped me increase my skills in drawing. He is honest with you on your drawing, which is great if you are looking towards a career in Art.  Great class! would take again ",1
Overall Great Prof! If you actually read the textbook you will get an easy A. Also the tests are open note!,1
"Professor Theus is HANDS DOWN the BEST teacher I have ever had!! She is HILARIOUS, makes the class go by fast, and very considerate of students time. She is truly passionate about what she does, and teaches the subject very well. Do your homework, study your study guides (VERY HELPFUL) , and take notes and youll pass! TAKE HER!",1
I love Dr Colavecchia. She's one of the best professors I've had because she cares a lot about what she's teaching and she makes the material interesting. She's an amazing person too and really cares about her students but her tests are decently hard. You really need to study and know the material but it's 100% worth it to take one of her classes.,1
"Dr. Alderete takes an interest in your learning and wants to know about your future. I feel that, because of him, I now know how to read science articles critically and how to write better. I will work full-time in a lab and feel I will be headed to graduate school. I wish my other profs were as challenging and motivating as Dr. Alderete.",1
"I wish I started taking his classes sooner, he is very good and knows his stuff.",1
"Mrs. Wright barely taught us anything & barely communicated with us (in-person or through email). Lots of group assignments and quizzes on TB chapters (which you don't have to read). No lecture material. She is not very accommodating or approachable. She does not reply to emails for weeks. The class was an easy A, it was just frustrating",0
Dr. Hill knows the material he teaches and teaches it well. He's very clear when you have online quizzes due and will send reminders. Don't text in his class or eat or drink in the classroom. He gives out chapter topic lists and lab term lists to help you when you study for tests. Online quizzes are on the test and you can review your answers.,1
Told us all assignments are on hold during move to online which was a 2 week period and then did not change the course load. Actually made us go back and complete assignments that would have been due even though we were not in session for that time period. Can't give him a bad enough rating.,0
Dr. Tulin is one of the smartest people I've ever met. You will learn things in his class that you won't get anywhere else at Howard. I took him for Ideas in Antiquity which is a lecture course. Lectures are fascinating and his main goal is to make sure that students are absorbing the material. Take him!!! He is a fair grader.,1
"His lectures frequently meander and he repeats himself, but I don't judge his classes based on that. He assigns a really good assortment of reading topics. He's thoughtful and fair. I like it when he reminisces. Just do the required reading and you'll be fine.",1
Eric is not a good teacher. He will have you do all your homework online and he gives a quiz every time your in class and they are timed. He's not helpful.,0
"ENG 1A Overall you write 4 papers 2 midterms and 1 final. Class is pretty easy and the homework is ALWAYS the same throughout the semester. Class goes by pretty fast. He cancels class just to meet with you and go over your paper, very helpful!",1
This class has a million TAs but it takes forever for assignments to be graded. The tests are very difficult and the reviews aren't recorded. High expectations for a GE class. Lectures are very very long and boring. Not a lot of talk about current events. Could have been much better and had a lot of potential but just fell flat b/c of COVID maybe??,0
"Dr. Childs is great! I thought logic was going to be very difficult but Dr. Childs does an excellent job explaining the material and making sure everyone understands! She's very understanding and hilarious. If you want an awesome teacher and an A, take Dr. Childs!",1
"Every class is just a lecture with a monotone voice, but he does know what he's talking about and has a lot of experience.",1
"Taken during COVID, she's too unaccustomed to online learning. Assignments were graded harshly, we got 0 feedback, and we didn't finish all the syllabus assignments due to her negligence. Had very little sympathy for students, answered questions with annoyed sighs and insults. Learned mostly through Pearson study modules & the textbook.",0
"Dr. Sobhi is a great Chemistry professor , he is gentle , and cares about his students , but you must follow his instructions , and write all his notes , the lab is very straight forward ,I am going to take chem II with him as well.",1
"Prof. Wood's nice person & knows lots about math; BUT, she expects you to know as much about math as she does. She grades EXTREMELY HEAVILY on tests & quizzes. One skipped step in factoring & your grade will suffer. She'll mark your answer wrong if you use a different method to get the same answer. Good luck on trying to pass this class :/",0
"I really liked Professor Chiu for Financial Accounting. I went to her after every test and she went over the entire thing with me. Don't skip any classes because the material builds on itself. Her lectures are the whole class period but she has slideshows. The homework is online and easy, 3 attempts. There is a tutor who is SO helpful. Go to him!",1
"I had this professor for my calc I and calc II class, I ended up failing both, but not for the lack of trying.  His lecture are very confusing and he spends most of his time moon-walking across the classroom.  I would only recommend him if you are good at teaching yourself and are absent often, he doesn't care about that.",0
Dr. O is a great teacher that gives life lessons as well as he does accounting lessons.  I didn't do well in his class but that was my fault and I'm actually looking forward to taking it over and excelling at it.,1
"Very judgemental! Never is clear, when you ask for help, goes around in a circle, alway's a communication problem. Summer quarter gives out so much homework, and I repeat other classes that are suppose to be more lengthy, gives out less homework. Military/police/firefighters, Do Not Take Her! If you do you'll see.",0
"I absolutely loved going to lecture to see Prof Tewari. She is so lovely and if this class were taught by another prof I probably would've dropped it before add/drop period. The class, on the other hand, was extremely difficult. You need to know a thing or two about basic physics AND have knowledge on music theory. Not an easy gen ed.",1
"I agree with the clothes.  Not professional at all.  Sometimes very rude to students should you not share the same interests.  Group work is too much.  There isn't much of a lecture/she just reads from slide shows.  Only positive about her is she calls you when she cancels class.  Expects a lot of work to be done (this is college, not high school).",0
"Hard to believe she is still at UBC and teaching! I have nothing good to say about this instructor. She is late all the time, confused with work expectations, disorganized, never hands back assignments. I know that she is not a native French speaker, but sometimes it's really hard to understand her French. Never ever!",0
Great teacher. She really takes the time to get you to understand the information and gives good feedback. She puts her PowerPoints that she teaches from on Blackboard and all you really need for the class is the online homework course.,1
"He doesn't care for students! Didn't do any accommodations during pandemic ""because it's online class, we continue as planned"". Poor lectures, just reads slides and puts up recording. You have to teach everything yourself, tests are 5x harder than review, and no curve. Homework is mostly theory and statements, while exam is only problems. GPA Kill",0
"This class is one where subjective grading is prevalent. A majority of the class is made up of discussions and participation grades, where no real grading rubric is available. Many times the professor would talk about topics very one sided that made some people openly feel uncomfortable. The class was not the best experience for me.",0
"Not only is McFaul strict, but he's very difficult to be around with and like to use his power to bully students in his classroom. What does annoy me and other students is his egotistical personality. When anyone tries to communicate with him, he will make his students feel stupid as he humiliates he occurs all the time In school.",0
"His lectures are pretty boring and unclear, I don't even sure whether Ryan understands the concepts been covered. I have to say the workload of this course is heavy, get prepared for it.",0
No stress,1
You think it is an easy class until he piles all of the stuff at the end.  An alright teacher.,0
"I really enjoyed Prof. Stewart's class. Research methods is dry by design, but he made it fun and interesting. He's subtly hilarious and is a real character. You do need to put a lot of studying into the course, but that is just the nature of research methods. I'm really glad I got to take the class with him and I'd take another with him if I could",1
I took Dr. Liszka in my undergrad. I thought she was great!! I wished I would have taken more classes with her. Her class isnt easy but it is very entertaining and informative. She also was so funny in lectures. I say go for it! Youll definitely learn something about Egypt.,1
"I have a 4.0, having taken over 20 classes at Oakton. I love school. She was my worst professor. She went on vacation in the middle of the semester! She failed to answer any of my questions by email about anything, AND she gave me a B when my grades added up to an A and had to change it cause she clearly does not care at all about her students. NO!",0
horrible...,0
"Great instructor. Knows his stuff, makes the material relevant and applicable. Classes always interesting, even the dull topics.",1
unorganized and grades pathetically hard! most students dreaded the class,0
"Peggy only wishes for her students to succeed and find happiness.  Her classroom format is weekly journals, some classroom presentation, but most importantly, getting to know your classmates. The homework might not be what you get out of her class though.  She has guest speakers, and other projects designed to help you figure out career goals.",1
He has a very thick accent and spends most of the class writing theorems and equations on the board without explaining what they do. Exams are way harder than the content seen in lectures and homeworks. Do not take his class if you are not ready to learn all the topics by yourself.,0
"Worst class I've ever taken. EVER. If you can avoid him, do that. Sitting through lecture is like being tortured. And he's just such an awkward person to be around. He might know what he's talking about, but he certainly isn't very good at explaining himself.",0
"I loved Professor Lamprey. She is such a sweetheart. All the work for this course is online, everything is straight forward and clear and she is always there if you need help. She also adds points to each exam. It is basically impossible to fail if you do the work and do it well. This was one of the easiest classes I have ever taken. ",1
"One of the worse teachers I have ever had. He is condescending to students, rushes through the material, and does not explain or give key mathematical applications. Don't bother asking questions because he will either make you feel stupid for not understanding or just interrupt you and yell at you for not looking straight into the camera.",0
"Plan on several hours of homework, and tests that make no sense.  Working with the groups in her class is frustrating, and time consuming.  Good luck if you take a class from her.",0
"No lecture slides, no in-class questions, he is the epitome of an old-fashioned Proff. Learned a lot, very refreshing. Go to class and take good notes, he doesn't spoon-feed you. Haters are just too lazy to put in the work that he demands. By far my fav Proff!",1
He is on of the best instructors in the Biology department. He makes lectures interesting. He relates the topics to real life work fields and he is willing to work with you to make sure you understand. His exams can be difficult but he is very fair. You have to attend class and participating helps you pass the exam.,1
Its her way or no way. She does not let you use a calculator for your STATS and will rake off if you do not show her step by step how you get the answer. She also will not help you in class and gets very aggressive when you ask for help. Dont take her.,0
"He is really hard to understand. He contradicts himself during lessons and confuses himself a lot, which makes it hard for his students to understand. He is forgetful and spends most of the class mumbling.",0
"I withdrew from Ms. Lytle's class because she was very difficult to contact, seemed picky, and assigned a speech outline the first week without giving us any information or examples about how to do it. Perhaps she would be better in person.",0
Annoying and hard to listen to. For the love of god say the word verBs. Its not verVs. Her class was a mistake to take. Expects you to have gotten 100% in Spanish 12 when you're not even allowed to take it with span 12. Makes stupid jokes that aren't funny. Mainly talks about how much she loves random celebrities and how old she is,0
"If you enjoy submitting assignments and being deducted points for your PDF quality, then this is the course for you! Prof. Schap is your typical tenured professor: could care less about his students. Tests are super hard and do not reflect the material taught. TAKE THIS COURSE OVER THE SUMMER AT OTHER INSTITUTIONS!!!!!!",0
"The worst professor I've had at NDSU.  Granted, incredibly intelligent and holds SEVEN graduate degrees.  But he humiliates students openly in class, is highly ambiguous about his expectations and just seems a little off.  I cannot stand his classes, his approach is very de-motivating and frustrating.",0
"Take great notes!  Two exams, all writing.  Write two papers.  He is a tough grader, BUT you have the choice of giving him a rough draft beforehand.  If you do this, he will advise you on what needs fixed in your paper.  Loved the class!  Great Professor!  I worked extra hard, and was able to get an A!  He rarely gives those out!  All about effort!",1
Roxi is a pretty good lecturer. I enjoyed her class and I became a better writer thanks to her. The only issue I had with the class was the amount of time spent philosophizing over the small stuff. Getting too deep and too technical with the boring stuff. That made class a bit less interesting.,1
"The classes are extremely slow, heavy, and redundant. Her teaching method is very confusing unless you ask specific questions and get the answer youre looking for. Resources on blackboard are all over the place so it will take you a while to find the correct resource for the assignment youre working on.",0
"very knowledgable in the Muslim culture and experiences, explains everything thoroughly and her sense of humor is great. Her class is easy if you read the material she assigns and you pay attention. Easy A if you put effort in!",1
Tim Sether was a great teacher. He was very friendly and helpful. I enjoyed the class very much and highly recommend him.,1
"Professor O'Sullivan isn't really a bad guy, he's not a great professor. If you ask for clarification he'll give it, but whether or not it's actually clearer depends on the concept. As far as assignments and tests, I've been completely lost. You'll have to do plenty of outside work to do a decent job. He's curved some tests, which helps. Avoid.",0
BORING,0
JR is a super cool dude. He is extremely funny and he is a really good teacher. He is also a pretty tough grader and the class was kind of like an english class mixed with a political science class. I learned a lot from him. His class is difficult for being an eng101 class but it is very entertaining. ,1
"I loved taking class with Dr. Santos. She always has a great attitude and lets class be really discussion driven. She gives out small writing assignments all semester, and only has 1 long term paper. Her final is making a movie trailer, which is super fun! I would take this class again just for fun!",1
She is very condescending and patronizes students. Not helpful and just plan rude. Avoid taking this class if you can.,0
"Horrible professor. Great about lecture and tips. Terrible at testing material, unclear on verbal instructions, and doesn't like lots of questions from students. Always advise to refer back to lectures and figure out the problem while I struggle. I wouldn't take her again. Never again! It hurts!",0
"Dr. McKenzie is overrated. Everyone said to take one of his classes because they're ""fun"". This was a 100 level class but he treated it like a 400 level class and I had to teach myself everything from the book.",0
fall 2011- hard to understand to the point making it a very hard class. material is easy though but i wouldnt take the teacher again,0
"Gets uncomfortable if you have different political views than him, which he voices very clearly. Lots of difficult reading. Main journal assignment is difficult because he wants it done before class which is before he actually teaches anything. Absolutely no feedback and grades wildly different each time. Yells a lot. Did learn a little though",0
Warning. I had a horrible experience with this guy and his class was not what I expected. Be aware. ,0
I would have rated this higher but the instructor pushes political beleafes on you. That said he is an alright teacher but only has experince in civil engineering and not in Mechanical engineering so his examples are onesided.,0
"Sidenote: If you haven't taken BIO 324 but need to, take these two at the same time. A lot of information overlaps, at least if you take cell bio with Juris. Might as well study for two exams at once.",1
"You leave class everyday confused and learn absolutely nothing. You're expected to know what he left off after class. Relies HEAVILY on MyMathLab Homework assingments, which only boosts up your grade by one point. (Don't miss a day on them, it will drop your grade badly!!) Try not to fail any of the four tests, will bomb your grade.",0
Due dates basically don't matter.  I honestly think you could turn in every single assignment on the day of the final exam and he probably wouldn't care.  I thought he did a great job teaching this class.  He is very helpful if you need help and gives good feedback on assignments.  I recommend his AutoCAD class,1
Great teacher really knows what she is talking about.  Lots of reading for the class but it is all interesting.  Quizes every week.,1
He doesn't excuse being sick even if you have a note. Almost never uses chalkboard. You do homework online and its very disorganized. I had to contact Dr. Baretta for specific webpage as the prof required it but had no idea how to assist us.  He is not helpful and is never at his office during office hours. It's pathetic. Good luck if you take him.,0
He knows how to set up a class perfectly and gives homework at a very appropriate time. His lectures are very direct and he does not waste time. He communicates the subject extremely well,1
"READ THE BOOK. Lectures are not specific enough to prep for the exam. Go through all of the problems at the end of the book to do well. Exams are super specific and the grading is awful. Don't beat yourself up if you get your first D on his exam bc 50% of your grade is the final. Avoid if possible, or be prepared to work hard with little guidance.",0
"She's a tough grader, beware of the 2 papers. The lectures are useless - short youtube videos that don't teach you anything at all. Class is useless, break out rooms for group activities to answer 1 question then debrief that 1 question for the rest of class time. Attendance is for marks. Get ready to read the entire textbook and teach yourself!",0
"An unmotivated lecturer as well as contradicting, giving off the impression that he doesn't know his material. It's especially annoying when a student gives a correct answer and he disputes it, only becuase he's looking for specific answers to his questions. Makes me worried for the paper to come up -> only thing to be graded besides exams",0
one word. horrible,0
"I have Dr. Sobel as a teacher in the early 1970's.  I worked my butt off, but got a B+ in his class.  He wrote a recommendation letter for me to get into NYU law school and I was admitted.  One semester in, the Dean told me that Dr. Sobel personally called him and that was why I was accepted.",1
Monica is a terrible professer. She cancels class regularly or has a substitute and ends every class early. Monica is not very straight forward with her expectations for assignments and the midterm. She takes forever to give grades back. I highly recommend not taking a class with her.,0
"Really passionate about african americans, he is a old school professor. I miss this class everyone in my class got along. Online quiz every week(easy if you have book) and a disscussion question. the book is mandatory , 1 research paper, not too hard. Do not take this class if you are not going to do the work.",1
Absolutely AMAZING teacher. Took her for both Intro to Education and Intro to Diversity for Educators and got A's both times. She's amazing and really wants to make sure you succeed. Great classroom discussions; she's able to shove tons of material in your head. I didn't even need to study for this class. 10/10 would take again.,1
"I understand both students and professors are having a hard time with COVID. But even now, this guy is still such a harsh grader and is still teaching religiously by the book, exceptions are very limited. Even if wifi is hard to come by, Zoom attendance required. Difficulty for exams and labs is ridiculous, pls cut some slack for your students.",0
"I've never gotten an A in math and I finally did because of David. He is by far my favorite teacher ever. Five chapter exams and final, let's you have a page of notes on exams and final. He's always willing to help and cares for his students. Really happy cheerful teacher and ahh just wish he taught stats . Thanks so much David you da best!",1
Seems great at first but is bizarrely spiteful when you least expect it and refuses to be proven wrong.  Has blatant favorites.  Watch your step around her and suck up as much as you can early on.,1
"I found he was condescending and I felt nervous to answer questions in case I was wrong. He will call on you during class to answer questions which makes sure you are always ready. Overall, I did not like going to his class but I did fairly well in the course. And, after starting a new French class with a dif prof, realized maybe he wasnt so bad..",0
"I took Dr. Knapp for several classes during my time at LBCC, those being two musicianship courses, three theory classes, and a music appreciation class. If I could, I very well may have tried to take him for each theory and musicianship class, he's that good. Knapp is a great teacher who can assign a lot of homework, but the homework really helps.",1
"Lipson is a great professor who has a ton of knowledge on the material presented in class. It is very important to attend class in order to do well on the tests. With that being said, his lectures and the application to current events is spot on and super interesting. Class was always fun and intriguing.",1
"Good class. You have to write a lot, and re-write, but if you do this you shoul dbe okay.",1
Not really his subject but filled in after regular prof left the country.  Was interesting at times and always helpful and honest about what he knew.  Will take one of his regular courses as soon as possible.,1
"Although professor Neely's online lectures were well organized and informative, he was very unhelpful and rude to students. Many of his responses to questions were very condescending. He was defensive of his lectures, and would condemn students for not paying close enough attention, rather than try to help them to understand the subject matter.",0
"Well, l if you take this professor's class, you will figure it out why.",0
"She never follows the rubric. Gave me a 57 out of 130 for ""not developing my thesis enough."" The only reason my SOC 112 class was difficult was because of her. Drop the class and take it with someone else. I was a 4.0 student before her. Now I have a 3.8",0
Lots of work for online class but she helps you so much to get a better grade. Literally got a 100 in her class. Really good experience. Be ready to work for your grade but know she gives you all the suggestions and tools you need to get that 100!,1
"This is from Longridge: ""Q: Is there a way to view my Final Exam to verify which ones I answered  incorrectly?  A: Your FINAL exam is a TEST and NOT a learning experience. As such permission to review finals is NOT given."" Her reasoning is terrible. She's not giving students opportunities to learn where they went wrong; she must be right.",0
"Professor Hawk is AMAZING! If you fail his course, it is simply because you didn't try at all. He allows you to think creatively and makes all of his students think out of the box. His lectures are always an eye opener.",1
"He doesn't give extra credit, even if you are failing. You ABSOLUTELY have to show your work on his tests or he marks the question wrong even if you got the right answer. You cannot use a graphing calculator only scientific. He goes through lessons really fast so if you aren't good at math, this is a difficult class. I had to drop his class.",0
Extremely helpful. Her main goal is to make sure her students know the work.  Will go the extra mile for you.  If you do a paper wrong she will send it back and explain what the problem is and allow you to resubmit it correctly (with a slight penalty). Her main goal is not the grade but did you learn the material and will go out of her way to make ,1
"I took Dr. Sinha's abnormal Pysch class and walking into the class I was so interested in it. She is literally absent from class, never sends weekly updates or emails. She is very strict of due dates. She never emails back, you might need to send five emails before she responds to you. She is a toughie and she won't budge for ANYTHING",0
Take him. He is the best teacher I ever had,1
"Assignments were easy overall. However, at the end of the semester, he changed his grade breakdown from what the syllabus originally said. His grading was really inconsistent and many students received grades lower than they actually earned. I would avoid this professor for this class.",0
"Dr. Bricker is the worse professor I've ever encountered. She has no respect for students, makes them feel dumb, and actually called our class of 120+ students ""stupid"" multiple times. She was the only teacher for this course, but if you can, DO NOT TAKE HER COURSE",0
"I took this class over summer and I do not regret it at all. With a quick 20 minutes every day, this class was super manageable for any type of schedule and was well-organized. The professor was extremely sweet and truly cared about what she was teaching. Highly recommend.",1
"If you have the option to take another teacher, go for it. She's unclear about what she wants due for class.",0
Super Easy. No midterm. No final. each week you will either write a comparative essay or take an open book online quiz. Easiest class in the world. I suggest him to everyone.,1
Awful this man is a terrible teacher. He acts like his students in an intro class are CPAs and know what they are doing. I will be lucky if I make it out of his class alive. If you get this man change out of his classssssss please save yourself,0
"Professor Kenneth Leung is a great professor. Class was never boring, always made us laugh. Homework was super easy and he was always willing to help students. HE DOESN'T LET YOU FAIL! If you are stressed, sick, etc, he will let you take the test when you want, where you want! I recommend the professor!!!",1
"Very opinionated professor, claims he is objective yet his comments are quite inappropriate. demands a lot without providing context. office hours are in the morning before classes (7 am)!!!",0
"He is hard, do not pick him.",0
Take this teacher at your own risk!! Day 1: 35+ students Day of Final: 7 students total. his teaching doesnt make sense and he Laughs at his own jokes. His class is based on  eassays. Students dropped the class because they knew he wasn't going to pass anyone.,0
"If you dont have prior knowledge of music technology, mixing, songwriting (apparently), or production, youll probably have to teach yourself the class. But, youll hear some great name drops!",0
"I never listened to any of her lectures and still got an A. However, this is because I solely relied on reading the textbook which was more helpful than her lectures. I also did the practice problems she gave before exams and listened to the attached explanations. Overall, you have to self-study and rely on yourself.",1
The other recent review is 100% correct. He doesn't acknowledge technical issues and is not clear about what material is on which quiz. The material is VERY disorganized and instructor isn't helpful at all. Either ignores emails/discussions or just responds that he thinks everything is self-explanatory. Many students post questions that are ignored,0
The lab was more straightforward than his class. Just take a prelab and show up for the lab. He is extremely slow at getting through students for grades so you might end up waiting the entire day.,0
"Read the book and memorize and you will be fine. It was a bit of a struggle reading his book, because it went on and on, but overall he was a great professor and I learned a lot from him. He was very nice.",1
"Jim is really nice and cares so much. But he doesn't really teach. He reads from the book and has you do activities from it. He has a lot of knowledge about social work, but only shared personal experiences a few times. The grade was a couple tests, book assignments, and assessments of a classmate.",1
"He teaches you useful things and if you have questions he will answer them. He thoroughly goes over things before tests (if class isn't understanding it he will push the test). There is a lot of homework, but you work on it in class if you need to. Useful real world material, he's funny and easy going.",1
"Definitely made the class interesting. Incorporates a good blend of modern and historical philosophy. The only thing that's a bit concerning is that he was really slow at grading sometimes. He hasn't graded anything from November (about a month ago), but I'm hoping he'll get it taken care of before the end of the semester in a few weeks.",1
Took this class during the summer online. Didn't require much of my time. Just be sure to start essays early. I found the essays to be the only difficult portion of this class.,0
"She is not helpful at all; Probably one of the hardest teachers Ive ever had. Studying, taking notes, and looking over h/w is not helping. I'm still enrolled in this class because I have no choice.  She does not give extra credit or curve your grade. Take another teacher if you can you will regret it unless you're good in math and word problems.",0
"She is my favorite! I have taken AP1 lab and micro lab and I feel like I learned a lot from her. Her tests are hard, but that only forced me to study harder and learn more.",1
good teacher,1
"warning, does a lot of activities in class to get students talking, but it is also completely expected when taking a language course. Be ready to be open and participate !",1
"Honestly, the way he presents the material in class makes it so much more interesting! Always keeps you entertained with his loud and dramatic voice, loved it! One page essays are due every week with lots of requirements to it and sometimes the TA's grade way too harshly. However, there's LOTS of extra credits and will help you get an A :)",1
"Dr. Schulhoff makes the class interesting and fun even though we were talking about a tough topic - race and ethnicity. There is one book review paper, weekly quizzes, and a final exam so not too much work. The lectures, readings, discussions, and films were really engaging. The material stays with you. Great class and inspirational professor!",1
take her. she is good.,1
"The worst I've had. She picks a couple of students in as her favorites, and it is disgustinly obvious who they are all semester long. She was my advisor and did not advise me at all - didn't have a grasp of the requirements at HWS. Spends too much time in the bars trying to be your friend when she should concentrate on being a better professor.",0
"""Ah, be careful!"" His accent had me terrified the first week. Very difficult to understand anything, in both directions.  He is Chinese(?) and spent many years working in Germany, so from time to time he'll abruptly shout mid sentence, which is hilarious.  He does get easier to understand. He is dope. Easy class, enthusiastic.",1
"Do not take PHIL1001 with Dr. Plecnik. He makes this class extremely difficult to do well in and grades very harshly (as seen in his free response sections on tests). Intense reading is required as homework everyday and then a quiz on it. His personality is decent, but he is far from a good professor. Strongly do not recommend.",0
"Extremely lecture heavy. 5 50 question exams. He offers limited extra credit. If youre going for nursing, this is the ultimate weed out course. To earn my A Ive had to take my own notes off the chapters, do lecture notes in class, read PowerPoint, watch YouTube - EVERYDAY. If youre just an average student, you wont pass this course - beware.",1
Tavss is an awesome professor. He puts a lot of time and effort into his lectures study guides. Do ALL the practice exam problems he puts online. The study guides practice exams are very helpful and essential to get a good grade. You can skip the book problems (not helpful) and skim the readings but COMPLETE ALL PRACTICE EXAMS ONLINE!,1
"He's very helpful and willing to work to help students understand.  He also teaches at Nimitz High School and comes to North Lake after teaching high school students all day, yet he is willing to do whatever it takes to help.  I sent him many weekend e-mails asking about math questions and he answered them at home.  I recommend him.",1
"Enseignement limpide et enrichissant. Un des meilleurs cours de science politique. Prof   très rigoureux sur le plan scientifique et méthodologique. Bravo, une perle ...",1
"Professor McDevitt is great. He teaches very well and goes over topics again that he thinks are hard to understand. His tests are tricky, you have to study. Easy homework. His labs are easy and interesting. And he has lecture podcasts in case you miss a class which was helpful! Solid choice for biology!",1
"I took Professor Jewell my senior year for Comp 2. She is an extremely hard grader. She assigns very long papers. She doesn't put your grades on PAL until the very last day of the semester, so I didn't know I was failing until about 2 weeks before the semester ended. She doesn't ever help out, and she's strict on attendance. She will drop you!!",0
each time I ask him about the class work. His attitude was so mean. I will not take any of his class again.,0
Let's be honest Robinson is a grrrreat person but a horrrible teacher. It is sad to say that someone with as much knowledge on the subject he is teaching NEVER teaches. We have to do these group projects and all this busy work which does not help you learn what Social work is. This is just a heads up take this class if your good at self learning.,0
lesley is such a cool teacher that is very helpful and encouraging to students.  Her and Brian are great photo instructors.,1
"Great Professor, the text book is a must, fun and interesting class",1
"Bioethics class I took in the summer. Summer classes can be tough since it is a 4 week class but this kind of hard was on another level. Weekly long readings, quizzes, discussion forums, papers, videos to watch. ALSO a group project, research paper, and reading a novel! All in 4 weeks! I work and have a life. Amount of work is ridiculous. AVOID!!!",0
She is great! Her exams require studying but she is super clear on what is on the exam. She doesn't take attendance. Just pass the test and you're fine,1
"Class is treated like a high school course. Very basic, could have learned everything from the text book.",0
Soh is a really great teacher and takes some time to get used to. She is accessible and will help you in any possible way she can. I learned so much from her class and feel really prepared with my lessons and knowledge of literacy. While at times the class dragged on the information was important and I wouldn't want to take it with another teacher,1
Not a difficult class if you pay attention and take notes. He is very funny and manages to tell stories that relate to what we are talking about. Very enjoyable to be in his class.,1
"Believe only the bad reviews, impossible to get an A, no makeup under any circumstances, narrow grading scale, doesn't give full points only partial and fractioned points ie 3.25 pts out of 5, focuses on irrelevant items on exams, lectures are weighted more than quizzes and exams. Shall I go on...? Avoid taking, will ruin GPA. Unhappiness :(",0
Expects perfection,0
Tough grader!,0
Fair professor that goes through most of the material in class if you attend. She will help you outside of class if you need it and she truly cares whether or not the students learn.,1
She gives so much homework that takes a lot of time for little points. She is also a very hard grader. My roommate turned in all the parts separately because there was no template and the professor gave her a 0. Her lectures also are long and boring. Her instructions aren't clear and docs points because her instructions aren't clear.,0
"Phelps is boring but so informative.  He really enjoys art and is knowledgeable.  He is funny in a sarcastic way.  Attend class, do your work, you will pass.  Lectures are long and boring and he says ummm a lot!  ",1
I found this class to be very time consuming. Dont expect an easy A. The book is boring especially if this is not your major. The online quizzes were annoying especially if you do them on your own.,1
"Love this teacher! He was so awesome made the class very enjoyable. I felt like I never wanted to miss a class. My advice to you is don't miss class because you will miss a lot. This class is not easy for people who don't understand logic like myself, but I sure did learn a lot from this teacher. He's always willing to help whenever your stuck. ;)",1
The best teacher I ever had,1
"this class is easy. I never showed up and almost got an A. there's lots of reading but you can skim through it and understand. I did not enjoy his class AT ALL, how much he talks about himself or off topic conversations in class is ridiculous and the reason why I stopped attending class. Basically taught myself everything I needed.",0
"No major issues, easy to understand, would recommend.",1
"I took Dr. Crumpler back in summer and fall of 2019. The class is made of him doing 50% of the work, teaching you the concepts in a simplistic, sarcastic manner, and the other 50% is the work you put into the class. If you don't read, do the work, and go to class, you will fail. He truly does care, but you need to put in the effort and the work.",1
"Her class helped me make the decision to become an English major. If you listen to her instructions (look at the information given in the course pack), go with the flow, actively participate every class, show that you care, actually care, focus on improving, and study the exact notes she gives, you can do well. The problem - students often dont...",1
"Only gave him a ""1"" rating because they don't let you rate ""0"".",0
"This class is frustrating because the material itself isn't difficult to comprehend but the grading is murderous. Exams with short time limits make up the majority of your grade, but little mistakes cost you so many points. McLeod is not very forgiving, barely curves, and is occasionally rude.",0
She is tough. Hard to pass her class. She does not tell you what to expect out of your speeches and expects them to be A+ material. She is mean and unpleasant to talk to.,0
currently enrolled in his class and the other comments under are really speacking the truth. Hes a great instructor and role model. NO book needed because hes kind enough to provide power point papers which have to do with the tests. He makes class fun when we talk about current or passed topics. TAKE HIM YOU WONT REGRET IT!,1
By far the worst teacher. dont expect to get more than 70 percent on the essays. Will literally mark you down for the smallest things. ,0
"The exams are all multiple choice, and they are the hardest exams in comparison to the other orgo professors. That being said, expect a fat curve at the end 10% for F2020. If you want to learn, take another professor. if you want to get a good grade in orgo, take jasmin!",0
Dr. Vohs is a great teacher. He does his best to explain concepts and make chem easy to understand. His tests are reasonable. He is definately the chem teacher to take,1
"She is a horrible professor, absolutely horrible. She tell you you're doing something wrong and will tell you how bad something is embarrass you in front of the class and not even help you to do better. She always brags about how much experience she has yet it doesn't show. I have never met a professor that almost every student has a problem with.",0
"She's funny, witty & caring like a mom, but is a hard grader. I think she's allergic to grades 85 and up. Class is not boring but limited to Canadian culture. Knows the course she's teaching but more on the Canadian field. She's not racist but sometimes her emotions are biased to side more with the white (caucasian) students. Loves group work.",1
I have had many tough professors in my college career but this man is by far the worst. His tests are impossible and his communication is subpar. The one good thing I will say is he knows what he is doing in the lab and can give some helpful feedback on how to improve on techniques. Other than that I would recommend taking another professor.,0
"I don't know what this guy gets out of ruining your GPA and making this class 100 times harder than it is, but he just loves it. Will not help you in any way shape or form. Worst class of my life.",0
scariest teacher ever. Don't even bother asking questions because she makes you feel stupid for even asking them. Her course is extremely challenging and she doesn't let you go to the bathroom.,0
"HE DOES NOT CURVE. 4 lengthy and involved questions on each exam and his partial credit is a joke. Not allowed to bring a formula sheet. The Class average was 40 both on exams before I dropped. He has admitted to having only two people pass before. He marks homework as ""ok"" easy padding to your grade,but it tells you nothing useful. Avoid.",0
TERRIBLE AVOID AT ALL COST!!!,0
"Excellent professor!  Clear expectations, provides study guides, notes and power points, if you study these you will easily pass the quizzes, there are  many opportunities for extra credit. Dr. Anitori keeps lectures interesting, he is funny and explains the subject material clearly with great examples. I highly recommend his course!",1
"Professor Mizell is more into current events than the actual material you need for the class. You might as well take this online before you take her because nothing you do in here is relevant to the essays you turn in. She's constantly wanting to start a debate. Also, she has never once replied to any of my emails. If possible take someone else.",0
"If you don't naturally have a ""logical"" mind, then you will likely not enjoy or succeed. If you do have a logical mind (you know who you are), then you will find it interesting and engaging. I found him to be a good communicator (with a similar sense of humor as me). He's clear on what will be tested on, and it's your job to practice it. Good prof.",1
"By far the BEST professor I have ever had. He is a very tough grader, and he makes you work for your grade. I passed his class with an A, and let me tell you I worked very hard for it. I learned some life long lessons in that class, and NO you do not have to be a poet to understand his lectures. He is an awesome professor! You will actually learn.",1
Great professor! Loved her class.,1
"I am shocked that this individual has a PhD.  She is completely unprofessional, lacks people skills, and struggles with basic grammar and spelling.  Her emails are riddled with errors.  The word I should always be capitalized, elementary 101.  I would not recommend her.  She would benefit greatly from individual counseling.",0
"Not the hardest class just lots of reading/ writing. Some of the material was interesting. The thing I disliked the most was she was quick to push her opinion on students. Rather then grading my writing, she would leave remarks all over my papers on how my views were wrong. You should get along with her if you are a socialist vegan.",0
"I think Mr Bannow means well, but he is not very helpful if you have a question. He horrible at explaining concepts at a basic level and gets defensive and angry if you don't understand. I have learned to just figure things out on my own once I get home! Do not recommend his class, unfortunately he is the only option at the downtown campus!! ",0
"Super easy, all tests are take home. No need for a book. Very boring class though.",1
"He would rather insult your writing than offer constructive criticism, which takes all the joy right out of creative writing. He forces you to write inside the box unlike better writing classes. His syllabus is hypocritical.",0
"There is no question that Dr. G is the best professor at the University. If you can't handle a heavy workload then simply dont take his classes. If you love the environment like I do, then the workload is no problem. I loved every second of the class, & I look for more classes to take with him every semester. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! (any class by him)",1
"Laura's class is extremely unorganized. She introduced a software that we were required to use a week before the end of the semester. On top of that, the assignments are tedious busy work that do not translate into additional learning. She tends to shut down questions when asked, so don't bother. She takes a difficult concept and makes it harder.",0
"Don't believe the hype. He turned out to be pretty average. Left-winged, Dependence Theory; same things you would hear in other classes. Lectures consist of him reading off slides 90% of the time. He tries to get input from the class, but the same 4 opinionated people, more than likely naive Freshman, dominate discussion. VERY DISAPPOINTING",0
"Very interesting professor.. He isnt the type of professor that makes sure you understand what you learned in class. Sometimes I felt as if his lectures go in one ear and out of the other. Your grade throughout the year is based on your ""portfolio"" which he skims through the hw you've completed and the corrections to the test that you WILL fail lol",1
"Chose this class as the class desc. made it sound like this class would analyze human nature and our relationship with the world. Class ended up being centered around sci fi media and indigenous studies, due to this being what dillon specializes in. confusing tangents, incomprehensible notes, laughs loudly a lot, confusing requirements & prompts",0
RUDE. Hard to understand she has a heavy Indian accent. AVOID THIS WOMAN.,0
"Prof. Dudley's class is hard, but it isn't really her fault. Marine bio just isn't as fun as it sounds. Attendance to class and labs is mandatory. The labs are gross. The class is easier if you do the reading. She's very intelligent and the tests reflect the lecture material. Outside field trips were boring. This class is loaded with females.",1
"I had her for financial accounting so I decided to make her for managerial accounting. That was a big mistake. Throughout the semester, she didn't teach the material and expects you to just study harder. The quizzes and tests are much harder than study guides. She is a nice lady and is willing to help. By the time the semester I was done with her.",0
"Wonderful professor. I learned so much. He uses many historical examples to drive the material home. He loves to post articles on TWEN which clarify and are very helpful (at least scan them prior to class). I can't say enough good things about Professor Haney. If you get a chance, take his classes!",1
She's monotone and she discourages her students. I failed a test and she literally emailed all those that failed the test to discourage us and how she thought we had no faith in passing. I'm not exaggerating. I wouldn't take her again. Tests are not multiple choice and her lectures are boring. You can ask for help but she isn't content when you do.,0
"Easy class and he managed to make something boring, fun. Our class got a ""Christmas Present"" which was not having to do the final exam. As long as you do the listenings and read the textbook (maybe 30 minutes of homework after each class at most) it's an easy A.",1
"Guttmann is a great economics professor that has been teaching for 42 years. He is caring of his students and gives online assignments weekly. Midterm, final, discussion board, and participation are grades. Makes you work for it but teaches a lot and I would definitely take him again. Take this professor because it makes you appreciate economics.",1
I dont recommend taking him online!! The semester is over in 1 week and I dont have grades for any of my paper projects and one of the tests that was taken on campus. He doesnt really respond to emails. Its a pretty easy class he just doesnt post grades so you dont know how you are doing in his class..,0
I took the professor's class online and loved it. There was weekly reading that was long but it was manageable if you kept up. The professor was very kind and responded to questions promptly. The class was fairly easy if you did your work.,1
"His assignments are not clear. He does not explain his grading, he simply assigns a number or in my case a letter grade with no explanation. He can be very slow to answer emails. He also has a lot of work that is outside of class interviews, community service, etc. that makes it very difficult for an online class.",0
She wants you to get a good grade. Lenient in grading and wants you to learn. Encourages in class participation and goes over material clearly before exams. Great prof if 211 is your last Spanish.,1
The weekly quizzes are unfair and nothing like the homework. You spend an average of 4 hours on homework a week. She is not a good teacher and doesn't explain the material well. Just a bad teacher. Avoid her unless you can teach yourself accounting and have a lot of free time in your schedule. ,0
"This woman is not organized at all BUT I wouldn't take any other English professor! shes always there to help and if you go to her office for help on a paper, she will fix the whole thing! the text book is mandatory for homework and in class discussions. she gets behind on grading so don't expect to know your grade until after the final.",1
"Horrible teacher.  I skipped 1001 because of my ACT scores, and I dropped this class right after midterms.  He gave me a 0 on m first paper because my criteria was not clear enough, and a 0 on my second paper because I used the word ""they"" instead of ""she.""  I do NOT recommend him to anyone.",0
"she is the worse teacher i have ever had, Her course material is unclear, she does not reply to any of your emails, she does not post anything that makes sense or streamlined with the material she gives. does not keep in contact or even post your overall grade. forget about extra credit, there is none,  she just throw things online and not clear. ",0
"Professor Lawrence is a very nice man and really cares about each student individually. Downside is his lectures can get a little dry (especially when the class doesn't participate) and he assigns a lot of reading. You don't really have to do it though - SparkNotes is more than enough. Easy grader. If you enjoy discussion/debate, you'll do well.",1
"Birx is one of the most remarkable teachers I've found at Canisius. He is betrothed in the material and the students. No matter the student or project, he was always able to find the redeeming qualities of a firearm and the areas where the student could push their work. On a personal level, Birx was one of my most influential instructors.",1
Ms. King was a really good professor she was one of the modern day teachers who gets the students and helps them out. she is one of the best professors at nassau. you just have to do the home work and a little bit of studying and you can get good results without any doubt.,1
"I loved this professor, although he does grade harshly. He is easy to see outside of class and truly does care about his students. He is funny in class and has homeworks and small assignments to bring up your grade if you do not do well on an exam.",1
"very rude professor, puts everyone down to let everyone know that she knows better than everyone else. Ever met a petty professor ? well now you have. the class itself isn't bad, but her manners are elsewhere. i don't know if shes going through a serious case of menopause, but she shouldn't have to take it out on other students.",0
"Dr. Ross is a really great professor. He is always clear in lecture and teaches the content well. Small tests are given practically every week, but this also means only two lectures per week. The tests are just one problem based on the content you have been practicing all week in class. Gives time to review in class before the tests.",1
"Not a nice person or teacher. Very rude and condescending, always felt like I was bothering her when asking a question. She was rude to me and other's the first day, plus very late for class.  How could they keep her on at school with the bad remarks, I have read while making my own bad remarks on her? I dropped out because of her.",0
"Extremely easy class like everyone else is saying. She really cares about oceanography and cares about students doing well. Attend all lectures, don't buy book, do all hw, go to dis for help. HW is hardest part of class, IMHO. There is redemptive HW to make up any missed points. All test material will be from lecture, so take good notes.",1
"Great instructor, explains things well, she let me re do an assignment for a better grade. She definitely holds the attention of the class and is really informative. I would take another class from her.",1
Prof. Browning is a true professional who has many years on the hazmat front lines herself. She will work with you if you let her. I would love to take another course with Prof. Browning at AMU!,1
He's a nice and caring person but his lectures were absolutely useless for even his own exams. They did not cover enough content for the textbook aplia mindtap quizzes either. The midterms and final exams(mcqs) had a lot of questions that were not covered in his lectures. Take another prof if you can Be ready to study from the textbook yourself.,0
"If you want an easy A, take this class. There are 3 tests and the final all of which are online. He takes attendance randomly 5 times during the semester. Get ready to be bored as he reads verbatim to the slides that he does post online. You definitely do not need the textbook, so don't waste your money. Easy A, decent professor, no homework.",1
The class was not difficult but it not enjoyable. This professor lectures and then the rest of the class time is class discussions. There is no book but long articles to read to online. She is confusing when it comes to homeworkclass assignments. There is a choice of a individual or group project.,0
"Reddy is an awesome teacher and is very kind and seems to enjoy biology. The class is fairly easy. Don't skip class because there's clicker questions each class (download the app). Also DO cogbooks because it's a lot of points! The tests can have tricky questions but just really study the lectures and cogbooks and you'll be fine! Easy A, good class",1
"I think this guy's a genius.  And he is one of the few professors whos jokes are actually really funny.  HE says a lot of real things as if he should have been a social worker, mentor, or minister or something. I felt him. Unfortunately he's a little stricter now that people tried to take advantage of his benevolence. not hard if you take notes",1
"She is an amazing professor, she doesnt judge anyone at all. she is extremely helpful and understanding. only wants the best for you. Workload in class is decent and at a steady pace. i guarantee you;ll love her by the end of the semester.",1
"Dr. Holtan is an excellent teacher! She's caring and makes lecture very fun and interesting.  There isn't a ton of homework, and I didn't open the book once so don't get it. As long as you take decent notes in class, and put in work on the projects you'll do great. The final project is really difficult though, but she helps you through it.",1
"She is rude when you asks questions, but I am not sure she realizes it. Does not review for exams, and there is no SI for Bio 2.  She does not make lecture very interesting and her Power Points are awful. ",0
"Worst Professor I have ever had.  I got an A- in his class but had to study every single day.  After taking final, I couldn't sleep for 4 days until I received my grade because the final was so incredibly hard.  Everyone came out of the final traumatized.  Unfortunately, CCNY makes this course very hard to pass no matter which professor you take.",0
"Seems nice, & is very funny, but assigns at least a 100 pages for class, and then will either spend 30 seconds on each case, or discuss something else entirely. She seems very unorganized with the material, and does not do a particularly good job of explaining what is right and what is wrong. She also runs out as soon as class ends. Hard to follow.",0
"I personally  liked his class! He uses the book a lot and you read about a bunch of different countries and cultures. His quizzes are over grammar, and I thought he did a good job at explaining grammar rules. He is a tough grader and his test are pretty hard. But an A is possible, it just depends on how much you want to work!",1
"All I want to say to other students please save your self. I am regretting taking her all my semester. She is judgy. Four philosophical response, Four essays, 8 pages long research papers plus 3 essays for final. Plus she is a hard grader and counting your papers words too. If you hate writing papers don't take her.",0
this man is amazing,1
Great professor! So funny!,1
"Most lectures are based off of the textbook but there are somethings in class that he brings up that may be on the test but is not in the textbook. He gives a study guide and if you ever have any questions about the study guide, he is really quick to answer through email. I recommend this class if you want to learn and also to earn a good grade.",1
This is by far my favorite French class! Her classes are always entertaining and she has some REALLY funny stories! This class will also help you develop your French exponentially! We write stories -not papers- and there are weekly quizzes that are rather easy if you study for a few minutes. I would definitely recommend taking this class!,1
So much homework for only 1 credit. I mean really. This class is a waste of time but unfortunately needed to go to a university. So yeah hated it.,0
"Prof. Powell is a decent professor but is a really tough grader. You could follow everything that he told you to do, tells you you did a good job, but will still subtract points from who knows what. The tests are tough and graded harshly so prepare to study. Very tough to get an A in this course.",1
"A LOT of hw and classwork, test was open note and project was over the course of a couple of months. If you can keep up for the first month the rest of the class will be a breeze. However, Morris is perhaps one of the most vanilla boring lecturers I've had. Bring earbuds to class.",0
"None of your exams and tests actually have reviews that correlate to the test. There is too many places where your work is such as owl, McGraw hill, and then on blackboard you have your lockdown browser tests and exams so everything is disorganized and very confusing. Overall, this was a super hard course so I withdrew, would not recommend.",0
"This guy lost my papers, and gave me an incomplete for the semester due to his mistake.... also very bias in his opnions - caused a lot of stress for no reason and didn't learn much from him",0
Smyth is extremely organized and is very passionate about his subject of expertise which makes learning it a lot easier. All of the assignments and papers directly relate to the subject matter. He encourages in-class discussion and is happy to answer questions. And dont worry- youll get used to the lisp. It adds character to his lectures.,1
best writing teacher so far! I love him ... his teaching style is really good! take him!!!,1
"Dr. Hollis is very enthusiastic about Biology, which makes his lectures engaging. His class is a lot of work with 3 assignments per week, but that helps to cushion your grade. His class requires you to be on top of your work, but he is very helpful  and seems to genuinely care about students and his class. DON'T SKIP CLASS. You will miss quizzes.",1
"Just horrible. Confusing, goes off on rants, awkward. I wouldn't recommend this professor to anyone. I can't believe there's such a horrible professor at USI.",0
"J564 was an interesting class and Prof Mcleod gives great lectures, but there is quite a bit of reading and the tests were pretty tough. There were 5 exams, several papers and also a group project. Also beware if you take this class online that the lectures are very long. Good class overall, but be prepared to but in a decent amount of effort.",1
"Take WRA 125 from LeBeau if you can!  He allows you to earn all points back after revising your paper!  The worst part is all the busy work... from the Reading Writing American History workbook!  Class discussions are pretty interesting!   I will be honest, I'm not the best writer but I should  end up with a 3.5 GPA.  Mid-term and final is easy!",1
"Decent professor, not too hard but not extremely easy. I liked the way she taught, but the department had control of what was on the test. Stupid, but still did well.",1
"This class is an easy A but I really cant stand Frazier sometimes. Hes rude and arrogant and he gets butthurt quick He doesnt like to take responsibility of his mistakes,when he does its snarky and shady. Discussions always go left because he interprets things weirdly. Quizzes have trick T/F questions but pretty easy. Exams are online though����",0
Expect to read about 30 pages of textbook before each class. Nice person but her lectures are really boring. She will talk about the readings for the entire hour and half while you sit quietly and try not to fall asleep. Probably should pay attention tho because the passages/sentences she talks about will appear on the quizzes every Thursday.,0
Professor Cain is terrible at explaining what exactly she wants in her papers and assignments. She weights the final paper the heaviest and does not give options on making it up. Thus you may be an A student but because the final is worth 350 if you do poorly on it you'll end up with a C. Its ridiculous. She often has an unpleasant attitude aslo.,0
"This class was not easy, but Patrick was a great help.  He is accessible when you need him, and his lectures are good.  Sometimes he writes sloppily on the board, but you can usually follow along.  I would definitely recommend him for upper level math courses.  He knows what he's talking about, and he wants you to pass.",1
she is unclear and always expect you do things at last minute notice like it is impossible for someone to make a good grade in her class,0
She is not clear on the homework assignments and when you ask questions it just becomes less understandable Also shes crazy about attendance. She is a good lady just not a good teacher.4 major assignments and mid term and final are take home & take 8-20 hrs its no joke. would not recommend. grades very hard and doesn't put up grade till weeks later,0
Great professor for a upper division class. However horrible professor for a general education course.,0
"Dan is the worst professor I've ever dealt with. He told my class that if we died, it wouldn't matter and people would get over it easily. Really disrespectful guy. That said, it was an easy A.",0
Good teacher. Very fair and helpful. Don't miss any classes and be on time or it will count against you. She has and likes good manners so behave yourself.,1
"Great professor. He definitely knows how to teach and is excellent at what he does. Obviously, as a student at an undergraduate/graduate level, no one should be going in expecting an easy A. You need to work for it, and he gives you a ton of opportunity to learn and understand the material since he wants you to learn. He is also very approachable!!",1
His background in history and his practical involvement in tough appeals make his insights invaluable.,1
"Professor Lhota is SOOO sweet! She will help you any way she possibly can, is understanding if you have to miss class, and loves to review your work and help you fix it. Easy A if you give it a little effort. One of my favorite professors at ASU.",1
"Dr. Kuss would be a great teacher if he could actually teach. He is a very intelligent man but he paces back and forth while lecturing, he mumbles everything, and he never looks his students in the eye. Worst lectures I have ever been through. You will need the book just to teach yourself all the material.",0
Extremely unhelpful and cancelled office hours frequently.  Tests were very difficult and had questions that weren't anything like our homework or lecture examples.  He used different notation and equations than our textbook which made following him in lecture difficult.  Doesn't post any lecture notes or solutions to homework or tests online.   ,0
"She tells you what she'll put on the exam, and her exams are easy.  Go to class, take notes, study some and you'll pass the class. Plus, she gives lots of partial credit on written questions. ",1
"I took him for computer illustration & desktop publishing my first year. He was very specific about details with everything you did right down to sketches. Then I took Graphic Design & it was better with giving us more time on a project. He is old so he is not up to date on things, if ur designs are advanced & new he will not understand ur concept.",0
"My class was Online, prof Conner's super caring , and she took time to assure my understanding. It would be better to work with her in person because at least the communication barrier isn't there. Do your homework, study, and call her if you have ANY QUESTIONS or concerns and she will definitely help you to pass !",1
"Started off interesting, but my attention span waned. He's a very likeable prof who makes some funny jokes during his lectures but I wish the class had more variety. It's just an hour and fifteen of him talking at you. Overall it was a good class, but sometimes it's tedious to just sit and listen and scribble notes down for so long.",1
"Terrible class. Prof is passionate about his own research, but is otherwise very monotonous and lectures regurgitate the textbook exactly - didn't even study lectures for exams, and skipped a bunch. Put in groups of 5-6 for projects that could have been done with 2-3 people tops. Most people just end up sitting around. Vague with instructions.",0
"Easy enough class, but all of the tests were coded incorrectly. The correct answers, which came directly from the textbook, were marked wrong on the exam. This happened with at least one question on every exam. I brought this up and she said she would fix this at the end of the semester but never did. There were 20+ missed points I should've had.",0
"The test have nothing to do with lectures. Test are all on the reading and they are not covered in lecture. Very rude and unprofessional. Laughed at multiple students who were having hardships in class. Calls out students during lectures, brings up their personal issues, and laughs. Not understanding at all.",0
"I failed the class, so I might have a bit of a bias. That aside, I found O'Leary's lectures very dull. He struggles with technology more than most and tried to stop students from using laptops for notes (we used 'em anyway). He moves through the material at a good pace but doesn't really explain much. The Tutorial is a must.",0
"The hardest class I have ever taken. Assignments take a long time to be graded. Insane amount of reading & writing. No extra credit even during Covid-19. Tough grader. time spent on the class  full-time job. Instructor seems approachable, yet openly mocks students in announcements. Would choose another Prof for the class. Horrible experience.",0
There would be time when she would tell a joke in spanish and laugh at her own joke and rest of the class would stare at her as none of us would understand what she is saying. Talks a lot about herself. overall she is not that bad you can survive if you do the homework and quizes on time and do well on exams.,1
"One thing about Dr. Desselle is she takes FOREVER to grade assignments, it's actually pathetic. However the work itself is not too complicated if you actually study like a college student and participate in class. My advice is too take note to complete and turn in every assignment on time. Study and turn in everything, you'll be fine!",0
Please do not take this class.  She is the worst!!! The information in the text book was slightly used in class!,0
"He's a nutty professor, but attendance isn't mandatory and we just watch movies all period. Its an easy A.",1
Worst professor ever. No one should ever take him. Couldn't teach to save his life. He doesn't even know how to use the technology at hand ie basic computer or projector. Only teaches for him to understand and no one else. Avoid like the plague. If you have no choice get outside help asap.,0
"His tests are based on lectures, and he'll explicitly tell you what questions are going to be on the tests and in what form (essay mc etc). Write down everything don't just look at the slides. He explains SO well and is so knowledgeable. Just be sure to take handwritten notes and do the study guides. He writes his own tests so they're not tricky!",1
"If you want to cover an entire chapter in an hour and a half class period and be quizzed over the material almost every single class, she's the teacher for you. She sits at the front of the class and lectures with a monotone voice so it's hard to pay attention. Since she covers an entire chapter in one class, it's hard to catch up if you fall back.",0
"He is very passionate about the subject, but absolutely NO help to you whatsoever. He throws curve ball questions in everything. He covers material in class, and then quizzes you on something completely different. Meanwhile a quiz can cover 7 chapters of content! Exams have some quiz questions on them, that may be your only help.",0
"Overall great guy. His grading is fair and you learn so much. He's clearly super invested in helping you become a better engineer, producer, and mixer.",1
He's a genuinely nice guy and he really tries his best to have his students understand the content! The exams were super tough but he gives you a bunch of partial credit if you just show your thought process.,1
Professor Mantell grades based on weekly discussions and the midterm and final. Her class actually stopped a month before regular classes ended. She is very nice and I would definitely take her again!,1
"Dr. Collins was great! I had her for PSYC 301. I'm by no means a ""math person,"" but she helped me to make sense of statistics. The multiple choice sections of her tests can be difficult, but if you study your notes, review your homework assignments, and occasionally read from the textbook, you should be fine!",1
The essays assigned are almost impossible to get an A in. The essay prompts are also poorly written. His expectation on said essays is very different from just about everyone's previous writing styles (which he will deduct points for).,0
"If your a sensitive person he will offend you let me start with that, but if your a fun outgoing person who can take some criticism and jokes take shawns class, he cares so much about his students and really wants to see everyone succeed, he can be borderline mean but he has the right intentions, to bring out the best in you. Also SO FUNNY",1
"He is the worse instructor I have ever had, he will not email back because it is a hassle. Doesn't really understand english and really don't think he knows anything about the powerpoints that he uses!",0
"I enjoyed the course subject, but Dr. Richardson is a bit difficult. Receiving graded papers can take upwards to 4 weeks. The grading rubric and feedback for the papers is vague making it difficult to improve from week to week. The group project assignments are tough to coordinate and complete in 1 week with the amount of research that is expected.",0
"Professor Rogoff is a very interesting professor in that she can be sweet, genuine, and good at teaching about the world of business, but the class itself can get easily boring and she does have a temper when it comes to cell phones. Do the work and show up to class and you'll do well. Hopefully.",1
"nice guy, easy marker.",1
This was an easy class thanks to the clear instructions given by the professor. I understood the material well because of the examples that were given out which helped with the exams and homework.,1
I would avoid taking Eric for MTH162. He gets off topic and then speeds through the lecture because he doesn't manage time very well. He assigns an excess amount of homework that you'll have a quiz on and expects it all to be done by the next class. It'll be pretty much a self-taught class. Good luck.,0
Dr. Currier explains a difficult subject very clearly.  This class does require you to study.   Attend class and take advantage of the extra credit and C should be easily attained.,1
"she needs to be more specific and get informed with the material she lectures, she reads of the powerpoint (every word of it), also she gives a study list for practical exams  just to use 25% for the test and the other 75% from notes,  she ask in the test  for  the most random things in the lectures,  ,IT IS JUST WHAT IT IS,,  ",0
"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!!!! She was terrible before the Covid-19 pandemic and worse after, she has heavy tests, high standards and isn't helpful when you're struggling and need help. If you take this class except to teach yourself, she isn't reliable or helpful at all.",0
"I came for the semester on exchange, and even compared to professors at my school, he is one of the best I have ever had. Made the class really interesting and I learned a lot. He's really nice and willing to help with ANYTHING. Take this class even if you don't have to fulfill a requirement.",1
"She is really nice!!  A stickler at first so that you don't step all over her but then she completely chills out.  Very helpful in office hours. She has amazing stories which she wastes class time to tell but she still manages to cover everything, and better than most profs.  Tests can be tricky but are fair.  She's great!!",1
"Loved his class, very well prepared.  The arrogance was just the touch needed to wake you up in the morning, very entertaining.  I would love to take one of his classes again.",1
"Dr. Ward had a tendency for arrogance that I did not enjoy. Our class would often become lost when she led discussions and have to repeatedly ask her to rephrase her prompts. To do well in her class you must come prepared, but the readings are fairly painless and tests fair. To do really well play to her political leanings, which will be obvious.",0
"Amber doesn't care about you., don't go in thinking she does. She likes maybe 3 students and HATES another 3. Just pray you aren't one she hates. Cause she doesn't even try to pretend.",0
"Almost 100% sure you will regret taking her. She is the worst teacher I haver had in all of my schooling. She doesn't respond to any of her emails or texts. She also grades with her eyes closed, she is very inconsistent and does not provide explanations. She will give you 100% on the first half of the test, and 0 points for the rest. Horrible.",0
amazing prof.. so understand and sweet... GIVES AMAZING LECTURE.. lots of experience in management and shares real life scenarios... even if this class was offered at 8am i would take it as long of prof cichy was teaching,1
I would strongly recommend taking a course with Professor Hesford. She is a very talented instructor and always accessible. The work load for the course was very reasonable and the assignments were creative and enjoyable. Lectures were informative and class discussions were very rich. Grading was fair and assignments returned in a timely manner.,1
Poor time management. (Waited almost 3 weeks for him to post an online exam.) Very wishy-washy on the material he was using. Added a required book to the class with less than a month left in the semester. Also tells lots of stories. Im sure hes a hoot at barbecues but theyre mostly distracting and rarely relevant to the question asked.,0
"Dr.M-H seems to not know what she is talking about most of the time and says ""Um"" every sentence. Considered a ""dr."" but students in the class seem to have more knowledge on lecture topics. Get ready to refer to the text when studying because class notes do little to nothing to aid test preparation. Cherry on top: Clicker attendance taken.",0
"Great classes, great instructor, very knowledgeable and caring...very hot!",1
"Her lectures provide almost no information on what is tested and the tests are almost entirely the textbook content so you will need the book. The tests are open book (can use your computer) and there is no final exam. Colleen is a really lively prof and lets you know what you will have to know. Always have your computer during tests, itll save u",1
"He rambles a lot and tries to be funny, but doesn't really succeed. Not the worst prof in the world, but i found his class boring.",0
Spencer has structured this class such that your grade depends on you knowledge of Accounting Vocabulary more than your actual knowledge of accounting.  So read the vocabulary sections and you should be ok...don't really expect to learn very much accounting though...,0
Not sympathetic to her student's needs or feedback. Her lecture slides are difficult to read and all look the same. She doesn't understand that this is a hard course & concepts are foreign to students and need to be explained in a way we can understand. Her final exam was ridiculous. Not a great prof :/,0
"John Fischer is a very well-spoken professor who teaches very difficult topics, my only complaint is that his tone is very monotone and his tests are long and somewhat difficult so be prepared to come to class, pay attention, and participate.",1
"Not a fan. The class does not encourage engagement and you don't get much from it. You can study 2 hours before test without any other work through the semester for your A. Frustrating, as even if you do want to self teach, the provided resources are hard to navigate and hard to understand. Don't take physics at MCTC.",0
"She does not communicate with students, does not give feedback, especially positive feedback. Will deduct points for ANYthing, and does not tell you much other than what you didn't do right. The topics and curriculum are very interesting but DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS. She is not a good professor at all.",0
"I took this class thinking she would be an easy grader but she isn't. You definitely have to work for it because she is very picky with a lot of things. Overall, a very helpful course especially if you are into research and stuff.",1
He is super clear on what he expects.  He gives you lecture notes to follow and the quizzes are directly off the lecture notes. Didn't need to buy the book. As long as you study the lecture papers you'll do fine on the quizzes. If you get an A on all your quizzes you don't need to take the final.,1
"Nice and enthusiastic, but also difficult and goes far too fast in lectures. There is also an unreasonable amount of online homework. ",1
Professor Van Horn's class is great! She is very thoughtful and helpful. Would highly recommend this professor!!!,1
Highly recommeded.,1
"Very friendly and kind, but one of the most repetitive and dull professors I've ever had. Even as an English major with a healthy interest in literature and history, I found his lectures to be insufferably tedious. He got wildly off topic and repeated the same ideas over and over again. The easy A is honestly not worth the sheer boredom.",0
"Attending the lectures is a must. Make sure you completely understand the material in the textbook. Class avg. for each test scores was 50-60%, I think the highest score I saw posted was 82%. Didn't seem to really care that the class was struggling. I wouldn't recommend him. ",0
"First of all, very funny! VERY VERY smart and always on top of things. knows his stuff. the class was very interesting and applies tolife. would take it over again. only thing is that his test are hard, make you think. they really take some studying but overall great class!",1
"His exams have nothing to do with whether you learned the material or not. He simply takes small details from photographs and picture captions and tests your memory, of 8 CHAPTERS AT A TIME!",0
"Smart,  but not the greatest at teaching.",0
"Get ready to read everything he gives you! Tests are for some reason very specific. You'll think you'll understand the concept, but the test will make you search the book for one specific detail. Not a class that i would recommend",0
Spent too much time in class trying to get other student's to participate instead of focusing on the ones who cared about being there and getting a decent grade. Most lectures were a waste of time but you couldn't miss class or you'd lose attendance points -- could cause you to fail class. Most content was in online portal and discussion posts.,0
"I took her class for the F/W 2019 year and dropped it because she refuses to use any technology whatsoever. If you miss class even for a valid reason such as a doctor's appointment, a family loss, etc., you're screwed because she doesn't use moodle and doesn't post any content online. She often said she never uses her work email and never responds.",0
"You will teach yourself in this course!!! If you want an easy class, do not take this course! There are three tests and you need to get 270 points total to get an A. Each weekly homework assignment takes 2-3 hours. He does tell you which problems will be on the test though and he lets you out early.",0
"Do all of your work, otherwise, you won't pass. Just like any other class. Accounting is not easy. Don't take this class yet if you're not savvy with Excel, she'll leave you in the dust. If you show her you're working hard, she'll be lenient with your grade. START THE COMPREHENSIVE PROBLEM EARLY (IF APPLICABLE).",1
"Years ago now... Had her for Shakespeare in 2nd + 4th years and Milton in 3rd year. Every time was roughly the same - regurgitate the ideas she gives in lecture if you want a good grade. Not a difficult concept when you think about it, but a bit stunting. 2nd year Shakespeare was the only course of hers in which I felt I had a little freedom.",0
"Professor Pilkington is very caring and always has a smile on her face! She is a great Spanish teacher and wants everyone to do well. Group activities help you get used to speaking the language instead of just writing or doing grammar. The activities are relatively simple but are helpful to do them. The class was fun and easy, so that's a win win!",1
"Constantly rambles off on tangents during lectures. Many of her diagrams made things more confusing. Changed the entire format of the midterm the week of, and instead assigned it for over spring break. Totally inaccessible out of class, never responded to emails, often waited until lecture to answer very time sensitive questions. Easy class tho",0
Her lecture was very confusing and she never had a class with us during the pandemic. She only post a recorded video on blackboard every week and expects us to fully understand the concept about this class. I literally learned everything by myself. She doesn't like students to ask her questions and never give out any solutions either. Good luck!,0
"Handouts are the study material for exams.  Field trips are a BLAST - you HAVE to love field trips to take ANY course with him.  Sample questions often show up on the exams.  Study, read, participate and ENJOY.",1
"Evil! Evil! Evil! She makes me hate spanish, we have no other alternative to her, which makes things even worse! She's mean and never really gives you an awnser. She expects people to understand the first time, and never has any patience.",0
Professor Rosenberg takes long to get things graded and would not fix your grade when there is an error. He will also not care about your grades which is the most irritating part. You should consider yourself lucky if he responds to your email but his responses are useless just like he is. Overall an easy class but a crappy professor.,0
"I took 27 and 20 from Thana. He picks good texts from top universities. His lectures are detailed. Best CIS lecturer in Peralta. He assigns homework that is too hard and there really aren't resources available to help the students. I teaches at a university level but we skip lab and don't have discussion, GSI's or tutors. He knows the material.",1
"CCT433 Sustainable Design was a great course. It was a lot of reading and writing, but it opened my eyes to a career as a sustainable design consultant. The prof even posted information about post graduate degrees and certificate programs at the end of class to help us with our future. Great prof, and don't miss the online lectures for an overview.",1
"This man is an awesome lecturer. Comes to class experienced and prepared. His exams are relatively difficult, but he gives students options on how difficult it will be based on how much information about it he will give. Ultimately, the final paper is the most difficult. He looks through it thoroughly. Make sure you take it very seriously.",1
"Pilkington is the best. If you have to take a math class, take it from him. His teaching style is very laid-back, but thorough. He grades fairly and is great about giving partial credit on tests and homework. He also gives lots of opportunities for extra credit. And I definitely didn't mind the view, either.",1
"He's a really sweet guy.  He really loves current events, so keep up on them and bring new develoments to old stories to class.  Don't bother buying any book except the one by Berridge. I only read that one and got As on both exams",1
"Pretty cool guy. Hard to understand at times, but he knows his material. Tests are fairly straight forward and is open book as well as open notes. Homework is only worth 10% so your three tests and final are basically your grade.",1
O chem isn't the most interesting subject out there. Nor is it one of the easiest. Dr. Kennedy tries to make the course interesting (as best as the material allows him) and is always willing to help out. He even started a weekly study session outside of class. Be prepared to study A LOT.  Ask questions. Your grade at the end reflects your effort.,1
"Johnston-Blair is a great person. She is helpful, funny, and accessible outside of class. She does LOTS of examples and thats how I learn so she was a great professor. Highly recommend, she breaks everything down so everyone understands.",1
AMAZING MAN TEACHER AND AWSOME IF YOU EVER NEED SOMEONE TO TALK TO. HE KNOWS HIS STUFF AND WORKS WITH YOU TO LEARN.,1
"If you want to pass, you will need to teach yourself. He is extremely smart, but too smart to be teaching lower level. He said our class was a disappointment. also, his study problems were easy and seemed to trick us on the test (Extremely hardunclear)",0
Dr. Mavica was great. As long as you stay on top of her lectures and do your Mindtap assignments you are set. This course was really interesting and I enjoyed it a lot. The textbook was very helpful for me on the exams as well as her lectures.,1
"Evan doesn't expect you to read unnecessary stuff, the readings are there for extra help. He does a good job teaching the material, it doesn't get really boring. The tests are easy, as long as you know the main points of all the lectures (he doesn't go into tiny details). Need to read a lot of articles, but if you come to class you are good.",1
"Lots of work, he can be difficult to understand. you really gotta learn to pass",1
"Glenn is laid back. Was graded by 3 papers, best 10 quizzes, and best 10 weekly paragraphs. Did assign weekly readings about the concepts but after a while It became easy to take notes on what's important from the text without actually reading it. Asks 2 EC questions per quiz and papers were easy to write.",1
I had him for Political Economy. He's a really sweet (and funny) guy and knows the subject really well. Sometimes he may be unclear because of his accent and because he digresses a lot. But overall the class is pretty easy. The tests and quizzes are SUPER easy. Read the book and take notes and you'll do fine. He's one of my favorites.,1
"I really enjoyed Harp; he's an engaging lecturer and he uses lots of videos/pictures to really help the content come alive. If you don't come to class +  don't take notes, then you won't do well because his tests are about 85% lecture. But, he wants you to think + if you want to do well and actually learn, you easily can. I'd take his class again. ",1
This guy is an amazing professor. He knows his stuff and he is very passionate for what he does. DEFINITELY TAKE HIM!,1
Great Professor. He understands that most of the students in this course aren't science majors and the course itself isn't that hard if you give a little effort. There is so much extra credit that lots of students end up with over 100%.,1
"Endless note taking, monotone voice, very little explanation",0
Among other half-witted professors this one likes to randomly add passwords to quizzes for no reason other than to make your life harder because it's easy to use someone else's work and throw your name at the top. Her videos aren't helpful and she depends on course simulations to teach because there's clearly a lack of experience on her part.,0
Professor Maher is by far the worst professor I have ever had at Missouri State University. He is not willing to help you in any way. Tests are completely short answer. First exam was 5 front and back pages of short answer statistic problems to do in only 50 minutes. Would NEVER recommend.,0
"Great professor with a great personality. He emphasizes learning over anything else. Attendance is not mandatory but there are ""pop quizes"" and in class assignments that can affect your grade.",1
Best teacher I've had so far! You don't need the book and neither does he as all of his lectures are from his vast knowledge of american government. Really easy tests and he clearly defines what is needed to study.,1
The nicest and best professor at Bentley.  So fun and you learn so much. You have to take him!,1
"He is a very nice teacher, always willing to stay late to answer students questions if someone dosent understand he would make sure you understand before he moves on. IF you come in late, leave early or dont come at all then he wont stop the class to get u caught up as its not fare to others. Stay late or go to the lab. Fare grader, good guy.",1
"He is a very helpful professor. We transitioned to zoom because of corona and he has been so accessible and always loves when you participate. He doesn't really specifically teach you certain verb tenses or things like that, but encourages you to ask him about them.",1
"Dr. Meyer's lectures are heavily focused on his personal life, trauma that he has been through and his accomplishments. He has a confusing mix of talking about the terrible things that have happened in his life as well as the things he has accomplished and is proud of. Pretty annoying to listen to, though he is a nice guy.",0
"shes not a horrible or lazy teacher and shes very respectful but she gives out A LOT OF HOMEWORK (not hard but time consuming) and it gets stressful at times, so if you have classes thats already a lot to handle, this class will add on to the stress.",0
DO NOT DO EXTRA CREDIT!!!!!,0
Be prepared to have your mind blown his lectures are so interesting and infuriating how nothing is being done about the problems in the world. He is very caring and he is always making sure were good for nothing is wrong. We only had to write two essays a midterm and final and group projects.,1
He is really cool and a way funny and helpful teacher. Easy to understand as well,1
"There's a lot of work to do in this class, but you'll be fine if you keep up with the work and the deadlines. The guy talks a lot but overall, chill professor.",1
If you aren't interested in History do not take this course. Too much reading to do especially if you have more important classes to worry about. You basically teach yourself which sucks because for exams she says herself that she's a tough grader. The review sheets are difficult to complete and memorize for the exams. Impossible course. AVOOOIIDD!,0
"I think he was very creative as a professor and assigned us interesting work. I learned a lot from him, however I found myself very frustrated with his personality. He has a tendency to be very passive aggressive and condescending towards his students. Overall, he gets the job done but I wouldnt take another class from him due to his attitude.",0
Excellent Business woman to model in the business world as well as a professor! She is straight forward with her grading and gives extra credit. Since this class is is a pretty simple subject she makes the assignments and exams simple too. She is just awesome and precious!,1
"Prof. Lopez was great! He knows what he's talking about and is very good with answering questions! He uses power points for every class and posts them up online. If you study from the power points you'll know exactly what's on the exam! Don't waste your money and buy the text book! If necessary just borrow it from someone, it's not mandatory!",1
"During the online covid semester, Laura was my most accommodating professor towards students. She was pretty lenient and understanding with deadlines. This was truly an interesting course and there were many areas to earn easy points in.",1
Great class! His lectures were easy to understand for a difficult topic. He gives attendance extra credit points on random days.,1
"Worst prof , incredibly difficult project he asks us to do without even teaching it properly. Imma drop the course smh",0
easy A just watch the lecture videos,0
"Dr. Fontenot has knowledge, but he doesn't share it. He easily gets distracted and rambles about unrelated content, which resulted in the class being several weeks behind. He is late to class all the time, he will not stick to the syllabus, is an incredibly harsh marker, and is rude to students. I would avoid him unless you want a hard time.",0
"the teacher has a heavy accent and bumble a lot. The only way that i pass that class was because i had already took calc on high school. I try to understand the way that he teach but i end up getting more confuse. If you choose to have this profesor, you will have to use the book for further understanding of the content. The test are really short",0
He just isn't a good teacher. He knows the material for Technical Theatre but has no clue as to what it takes to teach a class. He can be very rude and derogatory to students and doesn't understand how to teach in a way that students can understand. I didn't have a problem in the class and got out with an A but most weren't as lucky.,0
"The professor is the worse professor I have ever met. There's pretty much zero practical explanation of the material in class, and exams are ridiculously difficult- it's as if your expected to memorize every little tax rule and condition, as writing everything down on a cheat sheet using the textbook takes far too long.",0
Really a horrible teacher had to drop math 112 from winter term. This class she doesn't know the material at all and student ask her if she supposed to follow the math formula in the text book and then she get mad and yells as the student. Really a rude instructor and bad at teacher math course. Please avoid taking this instructor for math.,0
"First of all, I might say he's EXTREMELY attractive for a professor. Second, for a professor who's still in he really knows how to teach. His lectures are great and he's a really intellectual guy. Presents things clearly. 3 essays, 5 quizzes and 1 final although it takes him awhile to grade things. But they fairly easy if you pay attention in class",1
"At first, her class was interesting. But it became boring, and she gets off topic quite often. The class ends up being nothing but a debate room. People started skipping more and more as the days went by. She puts people on the spot, and don't expect her to grade you work right away. Overall, her class was so-so.",1
ONE OF THE ABSOLUTE BEST.  KNOWS THE WORLD OF ARCH VERY WELL.  KNOWS DESIGN.  NICEST GUY EVER.  WILL DO WHATEVER IS NECESSARY TO HELP THE STUDENT LEARN.  PROBABLY THE BEST AT CAP.  CAN'T SAY ENOUGH OF HOW THIS GUY HELPS YOU IN ANYWAY SHAPE OR FORM...,1
"I know Ms. Gershuni teaches many classes at the same time, yet she's very helpful, very nice, and very professional in teaching. She's definitely a wonder woman of TIM School. Basically, she has all the qualities that a college instructor should have.",1
"I loved Lisa's way of teaching, she is a professor that students wish all their professors were more like. Super chill and funny, yet engaging in her lectures. Her lectures are not posted online though so it is important to show up to class unless you have a friend you can borrow notes from. If I were a soc major I would take all of Lisa's classes",1
"Coach Milburn is a super nice teacher she is very helpful in many ways, not only does she give you lots of feedback on your homework but if you are having trouble with something you can email her and she will be happy to help. She also provides lots of extra credit opportunities to help you if you need it.",1
"Hamed is such a genius professor, he wants you to learn, therefore, his exams and homework assignments are very clear. There is no better than Hamed to teach DS412. take him you won't regret it. 3 midterms in total plus HW. that's it folks",1
He's a very good teacher. Grades papers harder as the year goes on but makes sure to help you get better at writing papers as long as you try to do better. Very helpful. I never worry about writing papers for classes now. ,1
"Doesn't teach, just reads off of slides. There are vague questions on the exams and he expects you to write down details that he never asked for. Do not take if you value your mental health.",0
"AMAZING PROFESSOR. we had to buy the online code,  that includes example on what the test is like. There are a total of 5 test. They are very easy!!!! if you are good with microsoft word you will not need to study. If you finish all test in a week you don't have to show up anymore. EASY A. TAKE HIM!!",1
"I hated this class with a passion. He is a cool person but I don't think he is teacher material, or maybe because he hasn't found his groove yet since he was a new teacher. The lectures dragged on, he would get off topic easily and we wouldn't cover all of the material before the tests. Easy A/B but be ready to be miserable.",0
"You will do well if you read and complete all assignments on time. Very helpful if needed. Weekly questions (5-7 ) and weekly quiz (20-40). Instead of Research Paper will assign Case Study, all information on how to complete is given, so nothing to worry about. If you do all assignments and Case Study you will learn a lot and get a good grade.",1
"He's very flamboyant, but his 12 step process is severely underrated. I pretty much finished my paper while other 221 professors' classes were just getting started with the rough draft (it was due right around finals week), which was great because one less class to worry about. I thought his grading was a bit arbitrary though.",1
"BEST GOSH-DARN PHYSICS PROFESSOR ON EARTH!!!! SIMPLY THE BEST!!! BETTER THAN ALL THE REST!! Homework  HAPPINESS, Tests  FUN FUN FUN AND EASY!!! EZ PZ!!! So put on a HAPPY FACE every time you are in the class! Study Study Study A'S!!!!!",1
This is easily the most boring class I have ever had. She teaches you absolutely nothing. The book we have to purchase is hers so she makes money on it and we are required to do workbooks (1-7 pages of homework) every class. This class is extremely time consuming and a huge waste of time. UI100 should be an easy blow off. Her class is the opposite.,0
"Very helpful, and gives out CANDY!",1
"Does not teach, you learn 100% from the Text Book. Unclear instructions.",0
Fun class and very casual professor Two papers and weekly responses enjoyable class Taking him for Comp2,1
"He talks about himself a lot, & his organizations. Seems ignorant and didn't spend much time teaching.",0
Great teacher! Very helpful. If you study the notes you'll ace the test. Don't need to even look in the book or read the chapters to ace exams. Start studying early for Lab Final. Would take a class from him again. Has funny comments during lectures,1
Nice prof!,1
She is one of the best professors I have ever had. She is very helpful and will go above and beyond to make sure you understand the material. Ask questions and be interested in learning the information. You have to study and read. She provides great notes for the entire semester and does outside study groups! Take advantage of them! Dont slack!,1
Cogan is a very nice guy.  I thought this class was lots of fun and he's an easy grader!,1
Honestly Im not sure if its due to the class having to be online due to covid19 but this professor is the worst Ive had. She doesnt care for her students and refuses to listen when they reach out about the course. She also refuses to help if it is past her bedtime or if it interrupts her time with her kids. We have families too ya know.,0
She makes class interesting. There is a lot of reading but manageable and she manages to make a boring story bearable with fun discussions. I have an A so I think she's a fair grader. ,1
"I started this ACCT class with the very helpful Professor Hegner. She had to leave halfway through the semester at which point Professor Skelly took over. He has wonderful stories that relate to economics and politics, both are not helpful to the number crunching of accounting. He writes illegible on the board and speaks in a low monotone voice.",0
"I loved McNiel, she made going to school very pleasant, I loved her class. She's super nice, funny and an educated woman. She is super understanding over people's fear of public speaking and helps you get through it, shes the professor you want for your speech elective credit",1
She's amazing! Definitely understanding and extremely smart! She's definitely helped me as a student. Show up to her class it's fun! And no final (:,1
"Dr. Vutha is an amazing professor. He is very accessible outside lectures and genuinely cares about your success. Do the homework, utilize office hours to ask questions, and the class will go well, thanks to Dr. Vutha.",1
"I took Professor Ford's MUS110 class just to earn the credit. I'm not a super big fan of music and I didn't think that this class would be that hard. For an elective class, there is honestly way too much work. You also have to be careful about deadlines or you'll miss assignments completely. It wasn't the worst class, but I wouldn't take it again.",0
"So bad, this guy doesnt know how to teach. Talks over you, when you try and ask questions he just talks right over you so you cant finish your sentence. Terrible teacher, not a real professor by any means.",0
"Very nice man, but this class was awful. He assigned YouTube videos instead of teaching and yet gave the hardest exams and homework I have ever had to do. Questions were unclear and made to trick you. He takes off an unnecessary amount of points for small errors. In office hours he is not helpful and says that it is for you to figure out. Run!!",0
"Confusing set-up. Sometimes it takes over a week, well over, to get grades back... and that is no bueno!! I would suck it up and take Jerry James, at least you will learn something in his course!!",0
David is an extremely intelligent and knowledgeable man. It is almost like being taught be an Elder. He speaks from the heart and has decades worth of experience to back it up. Many of these comments don't reflect his ability to deliver the course. People forget that he is there to provide you with knowledge and that it isn't a concert. Great class,1
I came in knowing a bit about stats then ended up coming out confused. He doesnt give any help. Email him he tells you to look at the module the book isnt any help he wrote it.,0
He isn't very clear on how he wants you to write your notices and be prepared to read non-stop. I do not recommend this teacher. Taught the class closer to a masters program than a gen ed for a bachelors.,0
"Her style of teaching is kind of scattered, so she's hard to follow at times. and she's very lecture heavy. But she's very knowledgeable and very sweet and the class itself is very interesting. Make sure to read the syllabus and keep track of assignment due dates!!",0
"Terrible professor. Assigns homework that isnt mandatory but helps your grade, then spends all of the class time going over said homework. He doesnt teach. Tests are super hard unless you know the material by heart (and great at it) BUT its probably the easiest class to cheat on tests. If you can find a way to cheat, take this class. If not, dont.",0
Not nearly as easy or enjoyable as some claim.  The homeworks are rediculous and unnecessarily hard.,0
"His lectures were pointless and he would often ramble, but I went to every one because his clicker points are extra credit. Other than that your only grades are 3 super hard tests. I thought this would be an easy natural science, and I was so wrong. He can be pretty funny, but it's not so funny when you're borderline failing cause he doesn't teach.",0
I'm a 3.9 GPA student and I've learned NOTHING from this teacher.. The only way I'm passing the class is because I bought the answer guide to the homework book and I've been teaching myself. He confuses me more than anything else.. Always correcting his own mistakes in class.. Horrible at explaining.. AVOID,0
"It is an online class.  It is only for those who are willing to work.  The reading is informative and the test easy IF you read.  The group work goes well if you have a good group and participate.  If you don't participate, the group will give you a bad grade.  If you're somewhat intelligent you'll do well.  If you aren't, you're out of luck.",1
"He is a very nice and kind professor. Very understanding and extremely helpful. If you have any questions, ask him in class or during office hours, he is always willing to help. Teaches from the powerPoints, attend class even though it may seem boring, it will help. He does examples and clarifies everything. My favorite Professor! Take him !",1
Very hard to understand when you have never taken a French class. Talks only in French when you have never heard it in your life before. Each homework takes about 3 hours and is very tedious.,0
"She is a dismal teacher- a combination of incompetence and apathy.  Never returned emails, changed requirements constantly with no warning, let the class know the criteria for grading projects AFTER submission.  I could go on and on.  BTW, she doesn't know her subject - I finally quit trying to dialogue as she just spouted her opinion as fact.",0
"I strongly disliked his class. It was super expensive ($40 textbooks for one or two classes). It was confusing and seemed to have no relation to the real world. I know less about political participation in the US now after taking this class, than I did before. But now I know a bunch of useless models of voter turnout.",0
Tough material however professor Moore tries her best to make it interesting! Do the homework and pay attention in class! ,1
This professor I would say is extremely difficult! She lectures the entire class period so be prepared. Her exams are very difficult and she does not like to clarify her rationales behind the questions. . My advice when preparing for exams are to do TONSSSSSS of practice questions and LISTEN to her lectures for things she put emphasis on!,0
"Very knowledgeable on what she teaches, but pretty poor at delivering it. Most lectures lacked anything engaging for students and leaved little room for effective note taking outside of jumbled analysis. On top of that, she and the TA are pretty harsh markers that don't like seeing anything but regurgitated, null information from lectures.",0
"He really makes you work for it but in an understandable way, He is extremely nice and helps throughout the semester to help you pass he's definitely worth taking!",1
She lectures off of notes everyday and they are so boring.  She is willing to help outside of class but it is so hard to learn during.  Take another biblit prof.  ,0
"Seeing other reviews that this professor is mean/rude; VERY TRUE! First time dealing with a prof like him, & its very disappointing. Guy sure does love the course & the course is loaded w work, but couldnt care less if you swim or sink. ENC1101 was a breeze for me, this class & teacher was just a nightmare.",0
Take Voice and Movement !!! It's sweeter than HONEYYYY ����,1
"Super nice guy who is clearly passionate about Black studies because he grew up in the 60s. The grades are done with homework questions (which you need the book for, hands down) and a research paper. He gives study guides for exams. I was the only Caucasian male in the class but he made me feel right at home and got me invested in the subject.",1
Sometimes rude to students. Not very understanding. Rushes through lectures. Doesn't always give students a change to speak in discussion.,0
"A great teacher...One will succeed like I did if you come to every class, do all assigned work and turn it in on time, and take note and study.  :)",1
"Blake goes out of the way to make sure his students succeed, always willing to work with students if he sees that you are putting in the effort. It's okay to miss a day or two, but if you slack off for a while it will take a lot of work to catch back up. Good lectures and a great instructor. Definitely recommend taking him at least once.",1
"Mr. Abutayeb was, and still is the worst teacher I have ever had. He kicked me out of the classroom because another person kept turning around and talking, then he thought it was ME he was talking to. I tried to explain to him the what happened, but he just called security on both of use. WORST TEACHER EVER!!! GOOD LUCK WITH THIS GUY!!!",0
Worthless.,0
Do homework. Show up. She's cool and hot! I made an A.,1
She makes learning a foreign language fun & interesting. I learned so much from her class through her teaching & study abroad experiences. I took an extra semester of Spanish just because she was the professor. She is AWESOME!!!!!!!,1
"I took this class during a one month duration during the fall. I can say Professor Lane is a great teacher. She is welcoming and likeable. She is fast with replies to emails, and gives great feedback and advice. There is a lot of work that is due each Sunday however, if you are mindful with your time then it shouldn't be a problem.",1
"I took Alex for Business Calculus and have only one this to say about the woman: I love HER as much as she loves CATS (that's a hell of a lot, people).",1
he is great...but he's kinda boring...it's hard to stay up in his class and he doesn't like cell phones out while he's lecturing...it was a great class though...,1
English is my second language and she was always encourage student to write any thing as they want. Not learning too much about essay writing skill however it's a good experience try the creative writing.,1
"This class is incredibly reading-intensive. If you have other difficult classes or are even slightly involved on campus, this is not the class for you. If you read, the weekly quizzes will be super easy. Your grade is reduced after 2 or 3 absences so be careful! This is not an easy class.",0
"Dr. Stephens's class was the hardest class I had in the semester. She doesn't know how to work a computer very well so her handouts are hard to read and understand. Her directions are unclear! It took me an hour just to comprehend what she was asking me to do and I still didn't do the assignment right, but neither did the majority of the class.",0
Dr. D is such a caring and funny person. She teaches in a way that you remember the material and is wonderful about helping if you dont understand. Such a smart lady but so down to earth.,1
I took him fall 09 and it was a great course. The readings were definitely interesting and he brought his passion and history to class. He's quite funny if you're smart enough to comprehend his jokes and his gotten a lot stricter than I expected but still a great course with him.,1
"Absolutely horrible professor. Completely unorganized, has no understanding of the concept of explaining assignments. Terrible at giving instruction and when asked for help, she's totally vague and doesn't help at all. Would NOT recommend this prof. Take another class.",0
"Probably the worst professor ive ever had, the class itself was pretty easy especially if youre a decent writer, however, this is the rudest least helpful professor ive ever had if you ask him a question, 9/10 times tells you to look at his garbled mess of a syllabus and goodluck finding it there most of the time",0
"Worst professor ever. Last time I remembered Im taking intro psychology not an English class. My English class doesnt even make us write as much as she makes us. The discussion feel like essays. She so picky with grades, takes off points for the littlest things. Doesnt even give you feed back. I will never ever take a class with this professor.",0
"took her for kickboxing, super fun. got a good sweat, she's funny and makes you feel comfortable. Lots of extra credit if you miss classes",1
bring a pillow....ZzZZzZzzzZz....1 group pres./1 individual/midterm/final thats his class...from what i rem. i had good power naps in his class.,0
"""If you don't read EACH chapter THREE times before the test, you won't get above an 80."" He's not lying, his tests are extremely hard and you learn 20 chapters in 3 short months. Your saving grace will be the MindTap homeworks and the business plan. Really passionate marketing guy, really hard professor.",0
absolutely hated her. An obvious failed screen writer who is trying to hard to connect with the youth. Class is useless and not helpful all we do is watch the behind the scenes extra features on DVDs. Would definitely recommend her as a professor.,0
"Dr. Osborne is a great teacher. The class has A LOT of reading, but other than that it is mainly just open discussion. It's honestly like a book club with an occasional test. He gives a few extra credit opportunities, but the rest of your grade depends on only three tests and one paper. Very interesting viewpoints on a lot of issues and a cool guy.",1
"Amazing teacher and woman. If you get her, you are a lucky guy. Just show up and show respect to her and you're in there.",1
If you are really good at understanding American literature and old English you will probably do good. But the majority of my class doesnt understand what the book is saying so most people are failing. He also gives in class writing assignments almost every week that he grades pretty strict.,1
"Do the prelabs and do them well because you will need all of your notes during lab. He comes off kind of mean and strict, but he just doesn't want anyone to get hurt in lab. Sometimes it's hard to tell whether or not he's being sarcastic because of the masks for COVID, but he knows his stuff. He has a ton of office hours, USE THEM!",1
"He is NOT nice at all. I am a student who attends class, but when other students are not there he will verbally degrade them, even when they are not their to stand up for themselves. Literally stated and I quote ""If your reviews of my teaching mattered, I would definitely be out of a job.""",0
"Honestly the best math teacher I have ever had. For Statistics she either handed out note outlines or we printed them out. They helped a ton. However, she can be a tough grader and will take off for small details.",1
"Andor is great and I really enjoyed his class. I wish he would show fewer films in class, though - I work full time and missing work to watch a movie was really frustrating, especially when it was on youtube and could've easily been just watched at home instead of wasting valuable class time. Not a very challenging class, but a fun one.",1
"He makes the class interesting and does not present his personal biases, which was refreshing. He is kind of goofy and fun. The only con is that he docks a point off of your attendance grade every time you are late or absent. I was always 5 min. late, so my final grade was a B even though I got A's on all the tests.",1
"DO not take her online course. You have to buy an expensive, confusing online textbook to use for the 100 question midterm and final. Wasn't helpful when I emailed questions, wouldn't take again.",0
Do not take this class he is so hard to understand he has an accent. He is also old so he is sooooo boring I had him at 8am and I could not keep my eyes open.  He also does not teach so well . Many test,0
Bob is wonderful and he provides lots of extra credit to help get a great grade. This is a fun and informative class.,1
"So, any good comments must have been writtenby this prof; clarity is absent; speaks in phrases, not sentences. There is no cohesion. Should be a libray science instructor or a scheduler for author appearances at bookstores. All her classes are EXACTLY THE SAME! DOesn't anybody check what goes on at ECSU?",0
"This professor's office hours are extremely limited if you are looking to get extra help. However, if you somehow track him down for extra help in this course, you will not feel respected for he had uncalled for political jabs and degrades your work and thinking process.  Prof. Rogers clearly does not believe in the success of his students.",0
"Well, she speaks French with a bit of an accent.",0
"His exams are hard but he's such a nice person ! If you go to his office hours, he'll dedicate his time to make sure you fully understand concepts.  He really wants you to do well and wants you to get the most out of his class.",1
"Six tests are given through the semester. All tests are free response, but he does provide prototype exams that are very similar to the tests. Also he assigns 4 take home papers that are worth the same amount as test and are somewhat easy. If you pay attention in class and do the practice exams you should be fine.",1
"I did not like the way Dr. Daigle taught. It wasn't helpful whatsoever. She seems like a nice person, but for me, her teaching style didn't fly.",0
"Temple expects students to know really difficult proofs. He can't explain anything to save his life, and his class is awfully managed. He says he's going to cover one thing in the syllabus, and ignores his plan in lecture. In discussions, TAs cover completely unrelated material. This is why professors should not have tenure.",0
"I was a bit let down by the teaching style of this professor. She presented math in powerpoint slides so it was very difficult to grasp the concept. We did not work through many examples in class, so I had trouble with doing the problems at home. Her tests are take home, but the problems are much harder than what she goes over in class.",0
Wonderful professor.  It is obvious that she has a passion for the material and her students.  She is now one of my advisers and she works very hard to help me out.  I value her opinion and would recommend her to anybody.,1
"He is such a great professor. Always pushing his students to do better. The lectures are pretty boring but don't get me wrong , he is still a good teacher . The quizzes and exams are material straight from the book so make sure to study .  He makes it clear to the students that he is always willing to help as long as you are showing effort",1
"She is a terrible teacher for physiology. She was forced to give everyone curves because her tests were always terrible. She goes way too fast, cannot explain anything, but she does try to be nice. Her grading is just....bad...half of the time she doesn't even know what she marked you off for. Avoid her at all costs!",0
"As obviously smart as David is, he is a terrible prof. His lectures are all over the place and completely disorganized. His voice is monotonous and he mumbles to himself a lot - it's incredibly difficult to pay attention to.",0
She was not followed the syllabus and not clear. She is just not a good teacher. She does not explain things well. --not recommend,0
I hated this class. I took this while also taking 300 level english classes for my major and this class was by far the hardest. She assigns way too much work and expects way too much for a 100 level class. Attendance is mandatory and class is dull and useless. I don't recommend her at all.,0
"I am taking Physiology with Thad right now, nearing the end of the semester.  He has a good sense of humor and makes this hard class much easier to understand.  He enjoys what he does.  Grading takes a while sometimes because he is a business owner by day.  That's ok with me, because he is pretty lenient and I appreciate that!",1
"She is very rude. This class is boring and she doesn't answer questions when you ask. She gives smart remarks.  The work is not hard but she treats everyone like they are 17 and I am not.  If you can handle a rude teacher, the work is fine. Pointless though.",0
Sooooo sweet. Her accent is intimidating at first but you get used to it. She wants you to do well and usually teaches concepts pretty well. Not a very tough course and worth taking.,1
"Ken is a great person who wants the best from his students as well as himself. He is prepared for class and his teaching is clear. Its not a dry lecture class becuase of in class group work and worksheets. Ken is very helpful, making sure students are tracking with him. I highly recommend him especially if you've never taken accounting before.   ",1
New nothing on the topic before coming in but was interested. I think he was able to work with all levels on student expertise. Assignments were interesting. Schedule was good. Loved the course and professor overall and would definitely recommend.,1
"She is a good teacher because she knows the material well. Assignments can be confusing because she makes a worksheet for each concept, but not all of them are graded. Online assignments are on entire chapters so don't wait til the last minute. Make sure you know what to study and ask questions before tests. She had very few office hours available.",1
Good woman...bad course...bad teaching style,0
Dr. Wisner was the the best professor I've had thus far during my college education. I am definitely going to take  English 1102 with him,1
Doesn't actually teach the material. Just reads over her slides and expects students to get it right away. Does not seem to put a lot of time into this class. Generally nice person but it seems like she has other things to worry about other than her Soc 201 class.,0
Dr. Hadavas was a very tough teacher. He would get upset when the class could not answer questions in class. His tests were super hard and cumulative final with 20 questions. Make sure you have at least 4 hours outside of the class to study for his class. Also lazy when it came to helping students.,0
"I love Mrs.krafcik best teacher I ever had for a subject so dread full,but she made it interesting and simple to understand ""Commas"" her favorite;in addition, to complete thought.",1
"Do not take Spanish 101 (5 week course). I get its suppose to be a lot of work because its cramped but Id recommend if you have to take a language, save it for the reg semesters. teacher gives out an absolutely insane amount of work.. everything is in Spanish.. even expects you to write full convos in Spanish by the first week. No Beuno! Lol",0
"He is awesome.  Very enthusiastic about the subject and gets the class interested, too.  He is very funny and tells good stories.  Not uptight at all.  Very laid back.  I don't like Math classes but he made Calculus (normally a very painful subject) enjoyable.  Take him!",1
"Dr. Nolan is amazing! She is very enthusiastic at lectures. Her study guides are clear and are 100%relevent to the exams. Even though class isn't hard, you will learn a LOT with her. She's soo sweet too. Don't be shy to approach her.",1
He is awful,0
This was an easy class. As long as you do the work you will make a good grade.,1
"Dr. Goodyear was definitely a challenging professor. If you differ from his view he will try to belittle you in front of the class. When his beliefs do not align with scripture he does not engage in meaningful conversation but instead shuts you down. In addition, two tests dictate 50% of your overall grade and 11 essays decide the other 50%.",0
"I definitely do not recommend this class for anyone who is not advanced in math. i thought i was good at it, but his way of teaching is very odd & not easy to understand for most people. He flies though the sections & expects you to be experts on things, but was otherwise helpful during office hours. I dropped along with most of the class.",0
"I do NOT reccomend this teacher. His Biology 101 class is one day a week, and you have THREE quizzes every class. He is unorganized and someone else comes up with his tests, so he has no clue what will be on them. He gives no study guides or extra credit. My friend missed one day of class and his grade went down TWO letter grades. No leniency!",0
"In this class, you need to take notes. They need to be thorough and specific. If you're willing to put the effort in the class, Matlack will reciprocate that. It is an interesting class, but if you do not take diligent notes, you will not do well on tests and quizzes. Also, he does not post grades on Blackboard all semester. ",1
"Probably one of the worst teachers iv ever had. Currently taking this online and am struggling. No guidance whatsoever. She does not seem like she wants to teach. When you ask a question there is always an attitude. Very lazy. Seems unhappy every time she speaks. There is no lecture, you teach yourself. Same for lab, its a joke. Dont take her.",0
"Allen is a cool guy, lectures really boring though he just talks the whole time hoping somebody will ask a question. Gives a few exams that are blue book style but pretty clear and fair. Assigns four books but I doubt anybody reads them he explains them in class. Decent class for a GenEd easy A.",1
"The tests DO NOT match the reviews. If you are taking this class as a requirement and know most of the material already, it's straightforward (tests/hw only). He doesn't ""teach"". He works out a problem of every kind in the chapter (whether you need it on the test or not-overload of info) . He does this quickly & with no patience for questions.",0
Avoid. You may be on her spit list before you even set foot in the class.,0
He just doesn't care if you do not do research! need many years of work experience to take this course. Worst part is his midterm which was a 8mb project with no guidance just throws you in the middle of a random project and expects you to refactor their code without any guidance or system knowledge. I Think he is only a inventor that is it!,0
"Fair, enjoyable and nice. Prof. Wiebe is an alright prof. He explains things clearly and he doesn't assign Too much reading (though there is some for every class). He's good. Sometimes, he doesn't tell the class things until the deadline's getting kinda close which is less than great, but he's not The Worst for that.",1
"At first, the lectures are intimidating as you try to keep pace w/ Prof. Raphael's chatter.  Moreover, Prof. Rapheal asks questions that are easy to catch students off guard.  His attempts at humor are awkward but all in good fun.  Not exactly receptive to questions but a nice guy nonetheless. Exam was fair, if not easy and straightforward.",1
"Awesome teacher. Inspired me to switch my major. I never leave reviews but I will for Prof. Richards. He's a ""funny guy"" and also a ""bro"", but at the same time a respected teacher who knows what's worth teaching and what's worth skipping. If I could only take accounting classes from him, I would.",1
"He flies through the lectures and talks to you like youre stupid if you ask how to do a question in the study guide, which is pointless to ask because his tests are nothing like the study guides. All of his exams feel like hes trying to trick you, because he is. He acts like all of his students are in grad school with him.",0
"The content of the class is not difficult. However, instead of teaching the basic concepts, he mostly uses his example problems and goes off on useless tangents, which only leads to class confusion, which leads to wasting time answering questions trying to justify himself. He never uses the book, but to get an A, I'd recommend reading it.",0
She flows with how fast the class comprehends rather than working with an individual. She's very personable though so if you have the time to commit it's a wise decision. If you're pressed for time and don't have experience with German you might be in rough shape.,1
Prof Rogoff is most likely a nice lady.. outside of class. Her class is extremely redundant and all over the place. Half the time it is extremely difficult to understand what it is that she is saying.,0
"Four 500 word writing assignments and four reading quizzes (the syllabus says what article they're on). Midterm/Final: She gives you 12 questions a week beforehand, the exam has 6, you write about 4. She's clear and thorough, no rambling. GO TO HER OFFICE HOURS FOR WRITING. Most my class tanked the first assignment, the rubric is unclear. Cute too!",1
"He is a very monotoned speaking guy. He  talks constantly about the same thing without telling you what it means, or if its important. He will tell you you are wrong very rudely if you attempt to raise your hand to answer, yet gets mad at the class for not raising their hand and answering. He is very biased on the way he teaches. Don't take him!",0
"Does not read discussion boards, so unsure as to how the grading works",0
gives little to no instruction on the labs you are doing. extremely tough grader. I will never take her again.,0
This class was awful for an online class. Lots of assignments and discussions that took weeks to grade. Lots of them were assignments that provided little to no help in actually learning the content. Felt relatively hard for a non biology major class.,0
"Very funny, gets you interested!",1
"I took Math 1000 online with Danny Dyer and he literally did NOTHING. The TA's marked assignments in their own language and they offered no clarification nor did he. He used someone else's lectures for the entire course and always took at least a week to answer emails, which isn't helpful when the assignments are released 4 days before they're due.",0
"I took this class to fulfil my history requirements and Prof. Liebman's class is perfect for it since it's easy and no final. You do have to submit homework every week and do 2 papers though. She does tend to go offtopic a lot. If you want to learn, it's better to take other teacher however if you just need credit and easy A, get her class.",0
He is a really good teacher. He cares about each student and makes sure each student understand what was taught. We were lucky to have him as our teacher.,1
"He is so disappointing. I used to love this class, and I was among the best students in his class; but now I have the worst memory in my mind. I don't want to say more about the bad points you will encounter if he would be your teacher, but you will be disappointed.",1
Good Professor,1
"Page is SO knowledgeable! She shares so much insight. You will learn so much every class. There are lots of projects and assignments, but you learn a ton!!",1
Gives out a lot of work. Super heavy lectures. Monotoned. Class feels super long. Doesn't take time to know students. Very dull teacher. No motivation.,0
He teaches a class on how to teach and he totally sucks at teaching himself,0
"Best chemistry professor at UMD. He can seem condescending in office hours but it's bc he doesn't re-teach you anything, he makes you figure it out which can feel stressful. He follows the textbook but I never opened the textbook and got an A. Just know everything in lecture very well and do all practice problems over and over and check w/ him.",1
"Would NOT recommend taking any class with Eric. He does not teach well, few examples, would rather talk about off subject topics. He will grade you well if he likes you as a student, otherwise you fail. One of the worst professors out there.",0
"She is more of an English teacher than she is music. If you occasionally mistype something, I would not suggest this teacher. I tried reaching out but she rarely responded. When she did, she always had an attitude.",0
"Dr. Sweet-Cushman the lecturer and mentor is amazing. Dr. Sweet-Cushman the grader is unforgiving. In order to get above a B- you have to perfectly meet all requirements outlined on the rubric and then ""provide further analysis."" Your writing style becomes conditioned to quantity over quality. She likes when you relate topics to recent events.",1
His grading system is extremely frustrating.  He grades harshly with no feedback to give you room for improvement next time.  His grading system is ambiguous  and inconsistent.  The works studied are borderline X-Rated.  He specifically tells you not to use any outside research.  You must accept only his interpretation of the material.,0
"I had Jorgen for an upper division metaphysics class and it is the most rewarding class Ive ever taken. He consistently raised the bar and helped me achieve what felt impossible every week. It was tough, rewarding, and I left a better philosopher and student then when I came in. Hes very accessible and really cares about student success.",1
Nice professor. Class is easy but its too long that its boring.,1
"Amy is amazing teacher, is fair with her grading. She asks for you to be present for the online discussions; however, if you are unable to attend she will post the discussion for you to listen and then make written description of what was talked about. I really enjoyed doing her class and I would take her again.",1
"Fun and funny, very helpful, lots of office hours.",1
"Costa ended up being a better professor than I thought. He's incredible at explaining, and ensures that you understand everything he is trying to tell you and he's also very open for questions. Homework is brutally graded by the TA. A midterm and a final, both medium-hard difficulty. However, I can definitely say he himself is a good professor.",1
Very hard and extremely picky instructor. Student be aware!,0
"You will not pass the tests if you skip class or don't have a friend that takes good notes to borrow from. Crash Course videos are good for rounding out understanding of the ancient philosophers near beginning of the course. DO THE READINGS, at least skimming and/or annotating. Go to the breakouts and ace the weekly quiz or it will sink your grade.",1
"I took Prof. Pilla for statistics which was a 6 week summer course. I was really nervous to take this class but Prof. Pilla made it worth while! He is super nice and always willing to help, he does not believe in stupid questions. Before moving on to the next topic he always makes sure everyone understands the material. Highly recommend!",1
"Class is easy, but boring.  Tests are really easy.  Lots of PowerPoints and movie clips. He does not get to know the students so do not be surprised if he has no idea what your name is until the last week of the semester.  He does check attendance daily, and if  you miss 6 days, you lose a whole letter grade. Miss 9, you get a D, miss 10 and FAIL!!",0
"The 8wk summer virus sess. experience lacked cohesion. Often I found a disconnect between the lectures split between 2 different professors, vs. the classwork + hw. Got a standoffish vibe when contacting prof. silva for help. Canvas poorly structured, terribly organized and like some mention, there are a lot of assignments. The most I have seen.",0
"Nice and chill professor who made sure his students were engaged in learning German. Homework was due every class, but it was very easy. As long as you participate in class, you'll do fine.",1
Really helpful,1
"She's really passionate. Although, her lectures can be confusing at times. Pay attention and go to office hours, always helpful. Her tests aren't hard if you study a lot, go to review and her office hours. She's really nice.",1
"He was absolutely horrible, hes rude an mean, he threatened to grade our final assignment harder if we attempted to do part B of the exam if we dont understand it.",0
"I dropped his course when he told a story about kicking a student out of his class when the student didn't understand the course work. H also spent half of every class talking trash about the students who don't read the book. This was meant to be a warning to get students to read the book, but I was paying to be taught, not to listen to his rants.",0
"don't take this class with her.  She is out to fail all nursing majors and to crush your dreams.  Also, she was never a nurse herself - only her MOM.  How can she judge other nurses....",0
Take his class! Tony is an awesome professor. He makes the class fun. Most test are on lectures so take notes!Easy assignments and test. There is a research paper on a gang (not to bad.)Too bad he only teaches one class.,1
"Professor Noland is by far the best professor I've had in college! Her personality and sense of humor make it easy for you to be comfortable in arguably one of the most uncomfortable classes (public speaking). I've never liked public speaking, but her feedback and welcoming classroom environment made it easier! Highly recommend!",1
"Bullock is a really good guy. I like him a lot and he tries to keep the class as interesting as possible.  Although it can get boring at times (2 hrs), he is very entertaining and fair. He gives out a fair amount of homework and is a fair grader. He is pretty cool and he's sung to us in class and acted out scenes from history. Take his classes",1
"Une vrai Joke, y connait meme pas sa matiere.",0
"This was an 8am class, but she was one of those teachers who reads the powerpoints to you. The material seems common sense, but when you get the exams, they are tricky and ask random statistical questions. The first exam average was a D that had to be curved 20 points. The worst part of the class is that you are required to take ""clicker quizzes.""",1
"Only thing I really hated about having her as a prof was that she didnt let us have laptops out during lectures. Overall as long as you pay attention in class and MEMORIZE the study guides (they're basically the same as the tests), you'll do fine. She's not a super hard grader on papers but she has a lot of little things she's picky about.",1
"Truly one of the most boring classes I have ever taken. Not completely horrible, but I'm sure everyone would just zone out or do other work in class and then just read the textbook before the tests because her powerpoints are useless. Get another professor if possible just because her teaching is so boring.",0
"Marek has a very successful engineering career and he has a very wide knowledge of the industry. But when it comes to teaching, HE IS TERRIBLE. He gives you general information about very specific stuff - and he expects you to know everything. His marking system is unstable and unfair. Lack of clarification is his the biggest problem. 3/10",0
"Very kind, helpful, and smart. Sort of shy, but a great and passionate teacher. I learned a lot from her. She's tough, but that's because she is so into the subject. You can tell she really loves the books we read - and we read MANY, MANY books. (But they're good!)",1
"Great teacher. But, you shouldn't trust her. Be cautious when approaching.",1
"I dreaded this class going into it, but his enthusiasm made me enjoy it.  There's a lot--and I mean a lot--of work required for his class, but, if you do it, you'll do well in the course.",1
Tough grader. Rude. Stubborn.,0
"Just don't. She made the class WAY more difficult than what it should have been. She went on the most random tangents I've ever heard, fussed at a student who was two minutes late and told them not to knock on the door if they wanted to enter (I know right?), and was just overall a little off. A plus is that she was always available if you needed.",0
"Dr Hart was the worst teacher I had in first year. Lectures are useless and very unorganized. She touches on topics briefly and expects you to know the rest from the text. Her exams are confusing and taken fully from the text book. The only redeeming quality is her enthusiasm. There are great BIO profs at UBC, so avoid Miranda. Your GPA will drop.",0
"He was a very good teacher with this course. He gave us topics for essays that really make you question your own philosophy, some even made me change my mind. Very interesting course with a manageable workload as well! I highly recommend.",1
"Nice, funny, super interesting lectures, but exams are a total guessing game.  However, everyone is pretty lost and he does his own sort of curve.  The project is extremely tedious and kind of disorganized. His disorganization is what makes it difficult, not the material.",0
"The class isn't super difficult, if you put in the effort. He's really happy about helping to understand the topic and willing to meet to answer questions. One of the best professors I've had for Fin 4410 and Fin 5250",1
"I took this class because my aunt (who is younger than me and much smarter) took it and recommended this professor. When I took the class the teacher never had time to talk outside of class and would always tell me to go to the mathlab. He gives tons of tests, 1-2 per week and goes EXTREMELY fast! Math isn't my thing and he did not help!",0
"Steffens related world issues to whatever we were learning in econ that week. I found it to be really interesting and she did a really good job explaining everything. She also offers a ton of extra credit. My econ grade wasn't too hot at first, but because of her journ. portion of the class, i just raised my grade tremendously",1
"Dr. Oks was a really nice guy. If you went to his office hours he was very easy to talk to and was very willing to help. However, in class, he never explained anything very well and would only flash typed examples of physics problems on an overhead and then removed it promptly. Only survived by using old tests. Never learned a thing.",0
The reviews below are true. Her exams are definitely hard but overall her class isn't that bad. She is very understanding and nice. She allows cheat sheets and the best part is she SCALES! Her exams are hard but she scales them big time because nobody did well. I think she's reasonable. Hw takes a long time but thats Finance in general.,1
I loved this teacher. The assignments were super awesome and all of the essays were of our choice. We learned about media and I wrote about silly things like Jersey Shore and Famiy Guy. She was the best English teacher I've ever had. Highly recommend.,1
"You can really tell he cares about his students. I liked the lectures a lot. There are reading quizzes but he sends out the questions on the quiz before the class so they are pretty easy to pass. Emails back quickly and gives good feedback to any questions. There are three papers, but you can have him check it before turning in. Midterm and final.",1
"Professor Shine is an amazing professor. The class is basically all reading with no homework. The reading is tough, but he explains it very clearly for anyone to understand. Their are two tests; a Mid-Term and Final, which are both take home essays. If you take plenty of notes and you'll do well in his class.",1
"So far throughout my academic career this is by far the worst professor I've EVER had. DO NOT TAKE HIM! He targets students who slightly question him in class. When you ask about your grade in the class he won't tell you how you're doing, he doesn't lecture clearly in class, he's petty. This isn't a challenge, its impossible. Don't waste your time.",0
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS ONLINE OR OVER THE SUMMER. Every three days you have to read a chapter 40-50 pages long. Lots to take notes on (2-3 hours minimum) Then you have a quiz that can take up to an hour - with 25 multiple choice and 5 longer answer questions.. You have a fill in the blank exercise as well and a 1-2 page reflection for each chapter!,0
He's extremely condescending and you will not be respected what so ever in or outside the classroom. Often embarrasses and shames you in front of your peers for just asking a question. Mathematical errors happen more often than not even on study guides and tests.,0
"Great professor, great lectures, and relaxed atmosphere. take notes, you do not need the book if you have a classmate that lets you look at theirs when you need to. I bought mine from the school store and I can say it was the worst investment ever. Only negative is that he grades until the end of the semester. I guess that keeps you on your toes.",1
Absolutely fantastic teacher. Takes a genuine interest in his students and always makes himself available. I've never been one to meet with my teachers but I have kind of adopted him as my adviser. A+,1
"Although he's not very clear with his instruction, he's an easy person to approach and he takes the time to clearly explain things if you ask him for help. The class is long but managable.",1
This professor is really tough. His grading criteria is unclear and he grades harshly. He expects you to take literally everything from his lectures and spit it back out at him. Do not take any of his classes unless you feel like making your GPA drop by several points,0
"He has a thick accent and is hard to understand, especially when he is rushing through the chapters to get it over and done with. I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND HIM. Dr. Ba is a knowledgable man and knows his stuff BUT he is deff not the one to teach.I might as well have taken a hybrid class.Also don't be surprise if he gets fustrated if u ask questions",0
"Meyer is arrogant and pompous, he thinks he is God's gift to philosophy and his word is gold. He constantly deviates from the schedule and dominates all conversation and tries to belittle anyone who disagrees with him. He uses class as a forum to disseminate his wacky secular progressive political dribble as well as impress any somewhat cute girls.",0
"Overall, lectures are really boring, quizes are fairly easy if you watch the boring movies, essays are ok and no makeup or extra credit. Rather take a different class. Dont take this class unless mandatory.",0
"I'll admit, the subject is tough and not that interesting if chemistry isn't your thing. However, I do feel that Dr. Miller is there for his students and genuinely wants to help. You can't just sit through the lecture and expect to understand everything right away. Studying on your own time + coming to lecture works. ",1
"WORST TEACHER AT NASHVILLE STATE! Doesn't enter grades at all, claims he only gives a final grade and you are suppose to keep up with your own grades to know if your're passing. Takes the fun out of art! Does the same thing every single class!!! He talks with terrible language and bad body language and uses profanity, which is so unnecessary!",0
"I took this course online, and I'm usually fine in online classes. This teacher takes a long time to grade assignments and doesn't always unlock the new weeks assignments right away. She responds quickly to emails. I love history but this class was kind of boring. It's not that the information itself is boring, just the way it was presented.",1
"Dr. Boden is the only reason i use rate my professor from now on. taking his 100 level class was a great challenge and even though many hours were spent doing homework, lab reports, tests, quizzes, and taking notes i ended receiving a C for this class. never had participated in such a hard 100 level class, no extra credit avilable. not recommended!",0
Horrible,0
"The worst ""professor"" I've had at UConn. Unclear expectations, no real lecturesfocus during class, nonsensical exams, rude attitude towards students, not conducive to learning at all. I gained nothing from this class, because we were not taught. The department should totally rethink her employment, as her students will graduate knowing nothing.",0
He is one of the best professors I have had at TCU. Lectures are easy to understand. The materials definitely helps you a lot in practicing. He's hilarious and makes classes very relaxing. Just take him.,1
agree great prof.,1
"Homework problems were way more difficult than exams, but exams were not easy either. Wang does a nice job with this class because we actually see applications of statistics to electrical engineering. Homework sets often contained MATLAB, and it was good to see the material from that perspective.",1
"Weil is a terrible professor and really is not a teacher. He's a bully and gives zero feedback on papers. Watch your word count, yes he counts words and doesn't read your content of your assignments if they don't have enough word count. He's pompous and ego driven (his ego) BEWARE of this professor and do NOT take him for a class!",0
"WORST TEACHER EVER. He is a horrible teacher. My friend did better than me and he never went to a single class. Not only that, he's a prick. My friend and I both tried e-mailing him for our grade breakdown, I didn't get one, and his grade was changed for the worse. He even admitted to making the test differently than he teaches. Just awful.",0
"Ms. Clausen was a really good teacher.  She knew the stuff very well, she's not intimidating and very approachable which is great for first year classes.  Class was good but got better when she started using power points, she really listens and cares.  Take her.",1
"If you only take one history class at LSU, I recommend Dr. Marchand because you will pay attention to her brilliant lectures and look forward to coming to class. She is incredibly caring, helpful, and brilliant; you might turn into a history major after taking a class with her. I wish I could have taken more classes with her.",1
"Avoid this man at all costs! The exams are 8-10 multiple choice questions with at least 8 choices per question, so there is absolutely no partial credit, even if you do the entire problem correctly and just make a miscalculation.  His lectures are boring, his explanations are complicated, and he doesn't seem to care very much about his students.",0
"Didn't really like him. I'm minoring in history and am really passionate about it, but it wasn't really engaging at all. lectures were really boring, LOTS of daily HW. gave us a great outline for the midterm though, without it I would've failed. he's a sweet guy, but I wouldn't take it again. many like him though so who knows. kinda dryyyy",0
"I took his class because I had no other option. This professor does not help you at all and expects you to do things by yourself. He does not teach any programming expects how to calculate sum of two numbers and basic stuff. He makes alot of mistakes and says, "" I am not like other profs whk prepare their lectures at home. I do everyrhing here.""",0
Very patient and will allow late work,1
"He has some good lecture notes, and this is the only good thing about him. If you think you can learn Matlab, latex, or maple with a book by yourself, don't take the class. If you need someone to teach you, find someone else.",0
Worst class I have ever taken. I would not take another class from him in my life. ,0
Prof Partovi is a very knowledgeable lecturer and can be surprisingly witty. Can come off as intimidating but really cares about your learning and success. Good use of media in lectures. Be warned: he has terrible handwriting! Heavy reading but not impossible. Participation in class is required. Was patient and accommodating during Covid-19 crisis.,1
"The class and material itself was interesting, but she is a very harsh grader. She expects you to know how to write a philosophical paper on your first try (for this paper the highest grade was a B-). She is unclear and gives a lot of papers. Not to mention you cannot read her small amount of feedback because it is illegible. Not worth it.",1
Feminist theory is undeniably a difficult topic.  Prof. Shaw makes it understandable without oversimplifying it at all.  She is a hard but fair grader.  Overall a great professor.  Made me think critically.  I learned a lot.,1
"Read the book and discuss, that's half of the class. (I used an older edition and one chapter was different, so be careful) Participation is the most important thing to pass, so don't forget to reply! I really enjoyed the assignments throughout the class because they were all unique and different. Learned a lot about communication. Grades are fair.",1
"Darin is the worst professor I have ever had. He never gave me any feedback on any of the work I did, which makes it hard to do well on tests if you don't know what you got wrong on HW. Very confusing, never made anything clear.",0
She is really disorganized so the syllabus is mostly useless. No one ever knows what the assignments are or their requirements or when they're due. A lot of class time is wasted and she doesn't usually seem prepared or to know what's going on. She also never answers email. However some of the activities are fun and she is a pretty fair grader.,0
I looked the most forward to attending because I learned a lot and it was 100% worth my time. He is a very kind professor who enjoys actual discussion and it never felt like a lecture and more like a really open conversation (I was in the honors with 20 people). The tests were never as hard as I thought they would be. Fun and enlightening!,1
"No book is required. There are small assignments and a lot of experiments to complete with your group in class. Get with a good group! She is very knowledgeable, relatable, and understanding. She is not great at responding through email, so it is better to ask her before or after class. I would take her again! Extra credit is offered! Take her!",1
Dr. Bachman is a pleasure to have as a professor. His lectures are so thorough and there is an emphasis on the intuition behind the mathematics (because the rigor will naturally follow). He's the ONLY professor I've had since we've gone remote who actually puts in the effort to teach. That's saying something about the state of the math department.,1
First let me start by saying this professor wants you to think in his frame of mind. Many classmates would not participate because he would shut their answers down. Repeated himself quite often. He also will fail you if you miss 2 classes. He was aware of situation and went back on his word and failed me anyway with no explanation stopped replying.,0
"Not as good as other reviews say but is the safest bet to pass statics. Quizzes every week, exams are hw problems & in class ex. Class time spent doing ex. as he walks around checking, group activity & working on the board. you cannot cram the night before you WILL FAIL, go to tutoring his lectures are vague. Gives partial credit on exam problems.",0
You hardly have to pay attention in class in order to get a good grade: everything is common sense. Lockhart is a really nice professor and he is really funny. I enjoyed the class a lot. ,1
"Professor Callaway is knowledgeable about the Old Testament and the kindest professor. Learned a lot about the OT that made the class really interesting. The microtheme grading was pretty fair in my opinion, and both of the exams have a study guide identical to the test. Would highly recommend especially for a core requirement.",1
Prod D gives a lot of assignments but if you follow instructions you'll do fine. Pretty interesting for an 8 am. Really helped me improve my writing as a freshman and I gained a lot of perspective on American politics.,1
"Oh my word, never had a more BORING prof! I could barely understand him 1/2 the time. However, if you study his printed notes you do fine on the exams.",0
"During her lectures, she would speak unclearly and move at her own pace. Yes she waited a few seconds, but always hurries to the next problem. At the end of the day, I would have to go home, view examples from the mylabsplus, and teach myself. She is very cooperative and polite though when you are speaking one on one with her.",0
Very helpful and very clear,1
Class has no structure. He comes in with a vague idea of what he wants to teach and he goes all over the place when he starts teaching. Writing on board is all over the place and it's difficult to understand and follow. Has a lot of proofs that he explains once and himself didn't know what was going to be on the exam. Expects us to upper div math.,0
She doesn't help at all. No extra credit. I was going through some personal issues and I explained and share my personal issues with her and why I wasn't doing well and she still didn't help. No compassion. Not nice at all.,0
"This professor is hard. You need to read tons of readings and articles prior class otherwise you have no idea what is she talking about. Participation is extremely important, she makes marks on her attendance sheet every time you participate. Her exams are tricky and confusing. If you want to get an A, then don't take her.",0
"So this professor isn't great by any means. Yes, he is kind but only in person. I take online classes because I work a lot and I had to go see him if I had a question because he is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE at responding to email. I never received an email. He also didn't start grading until the quarter was practically over. He contradicts himself.",0
Very difficult. you will pass if you memorize the book. Quizes are online and can be taken open book. She talks very fast but if you record her lectures and listen to them it will help a lot. I got a B in her class because of my recordings and trying to memorize the book. her assignments are super duper easy except the research paper. Hard Course.,0
She is actually really good when it comes to teaching the class because she did live in spain (and always talks about it) but she is always there to help you if you don't understand. She does go over everything on test and there is a self test in the textbook. She can be unclear sometimes I will admit but it is a very easy class. I recommend her.,1
Acts intimidating to the point where some students droped his class. At the first class he made everyone question their decision to go to UFV. Extremely condescending to the point of being rude. If the english is your second language I definitely do not recommend him.,0
"Dr. A is a very nice man and I have taken several of his classes but, unfortunately, his teaching style does not suit me.  He explains math with words instead of examples, which is difficult for me and many others. This comment is coming from someone who earned A's in the entire Calculus series.  Avoid his classes if you are a visual learner.",0
This class has been the worst class that Ive ever taken Prof tests on the concepts he barely spends time explaining throughly you are essentially on your own when it comes to tests. The labs are also bad he expects you to know all the lab material and literally comes into lab just to ask you questions and if you dont get them he roasts you.,0
"Great music teacher, I don't know how he isn't famous.  From beg. to advanced, don't be afraid to take this course, music major or not.  He is helpful, only a few oral tests, but you'll learn more than you can imagine.  I learned more in 2 semesters on guitar than I have in 4 years.",1
"It's hard to pay attention but try. Generate class discussion amongst your peers, otherwise it'll feel like you're being strung out and left to die of awkward boredom.",0
A very clear professor with very good powerpoints for every lecture. Takes attendance and participation matters. Tests are fine provided you thoroughly understand the book and powerpoints.,1
"I had to take this professor several times unfortunately due to my schedule, I've never seen someone who relies so much on Masterclass to teach his own class. That's all you're gonna get and occasionally him praising himself about why he's the best professor ever and how many awards he's gotten whenever a student tries to disagree with him.",0
Good at presenting concepts clearly in class - especially grammar. gives good feedback as well on exams. Wish we had more communicative activities though. Helpful and doesn't make you feel bad for asking questions.,1
Attendance is mandatory. Class wasn't bad the tests are just extremely hard compared to what you learn in this class. Wasn't the best at answering questions or helping you out,0
"I passed this class, with little to no help from adam. He speaks in monotone, is extremely difficult to get a hold of, and is extremely vague with his explanations. i tried going to his office hours, but both times he was not there. homework every night but thats expected. Good luck!",0
Online course was extremely difficult. Dr. Melendez was not available for any study sessions or help. No video lectures or meeting. He would unlock the week's chapter and you were on your own. Took several days to respond to emails.,0
"Yes, she's a great human being, but she's arguable the worst professor. She does not stick to the syllabus at all and is the most subjective grader there is. She doesn't allow for any creativity because it goes against her beliefs which I think is counterintuitive to an ethnic studies course. Almost impossible to get an A in unless you are her BFF.",0
"He literally gives you every answer to the tests. Grading is just 6 tests and go to 2 orchestra concerts. He's very... eccentric. Talks about political issues a lot, which I think is more interesting than music anyway. I recommend him. Do not get the book, it's a waste. Just buy the online access code.",1
"The lectures were SO boring, and class participation was essential - unfortunately, Prof. Cividanes has no idea how to properly foster participation, instead asking questions that were rhetorical or so random that we were at a loss. Expect a lot of work on Latin America (where he's from) He didn't even MENTION foreign aid until week 6.",0
"Great Professor.  Don't miss class.  Gives study guides for exams.  Really down to earth, and tells it like it is.  If you need a psych class, take him.",1
"He is a bit odd and can be boring at times.  Throughout the class, we hardly talked about our assigned readings and the class was set up ""seminar"" style.  He is willing to help you if you talk with him, but you have to want to help.  Attendance is mandatory and the repercussions are 2% off your final grade. Overall, he is an okay professor.",1
"Got to be the worst professor at PCC. His lectures are so boring, I would actually find it more entertaining to watch paint dry on the wall. And his tests are ridiculous. I feel bad whoever is taking him next semester, they don't know what their signing up for - AVOID this guy.",0
"She is a nice person but I found her ineffective as a prof. Very confusing, as she seems to go in circles with her explanations and will never give you a straight forward answer. I highly recommend the textbook as that is the only way I learnt anything, I taught myself the entire lecture. She was defensive when I voiced my confusion. Unapproachable",0
"This class was a struggle for me. Be prepared for a lot of homework (20 hours a week) and lot's of quizzes. Professor Flahaven knows a lot about what's she's talking about but it can be hard to get help or her to share her knowledge. While I think she is a good person, I would never want to take a class from her again.",0
"the worst class i have taken at oberlin.  wow, so painful.  i got As on all my papers and a B+ in the class... she just overlooked it.  said nothing that i couldn't think up or read.  not a fan",0
"She is so well known for her love of the LGBTQ+ community that even people in Africa have heard of: ""The Great STINNETTE"". Her ability to keep up with the times, and her academic professionalism (the way she teaches by using YouTube videos is inspiring) keeps me wondering how the world could deserve someone as dedicated as her. Chirp Chirp, Torian!",0
Great professor to have.  Explains everything really well and will even explain it different ways if everyone in the class does not understand fully.  Follows the syllabus directly - well organized and thorough. Definitely plan to take him again. Nice that he is a working paralegal to share experiences.,1
"She's an interesting professor and it is an easy class. You'll have one or two easy papers, and a few take home tests/quizzes. if you need a Cross-Cultural Perspective credit and want a A to boost your GPA, take this!",1
this teacher is okay. After the first test i realized showing up for her lectures was the dumbest thing i was doing. The test are 100 % based on you knowing the terms and identifying them in scenarios. What she talks about in class is so off topic and her slides are generic with no definitions or key notes. They will not help.,0
Very boring professor who seems to drag on lecture as everyone falls asleep. Does not seem to care about students or their situations and is not very helpful in person individually either. Would try to take another professor.,0
"This class is a class that shouldn't be hard, but professor hill made it almost impossible. She was never willing to compromise or help you out if you were struggling in the class. Doesn't allow any extra credit and has no exceptions. Only way to get a good grade in this class is to study the book a ton and pay attention in lectures.",0
"She messed up point values for assignments alot, and emailed us about eight times a week. The hardest part was the class time was pointless but she took attendence, and you lose 5 points everytime you miss class.",0
"Madness. This teacher took an incredible subject such as ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY and made it mind numbingly boring. Shes an incredibly nice person and she means well, plus her kindness can not be over stated but this class is SO BORING.... it should be a class that stimulates a psych student to thirst for more!!! But, I regret taking this teacher!",0
You will read 4 books for the semester over 400 pgs and then take test on them. Very blunt teacher.  Absolutely no phones what so ever. Get ready to listen and participate.,1
"Professor McEvoy was a fine professor and made lectures interesting with debates and movies, but she's a very strict grader. You're only graded on 3 assignments that are each 33% of your grade, which is very stressful. Not the right professor for people that can't handle pressure.",1
"There were discussion boards and chap. tests which were stupid! He'd take one tiny thing from the book and make it a test Q., instead of asking a question about a concept. I didn't like how he structured the tests, but if you have the book w/you, there's no need to read the chap. beforehand 'cuz you can just take the test w/out reading the chap.",0
He's very repetitive with notes. He also requires you to buy the textbook which is not necessary at all. We used the textbook once to do a homework assignment and that was all. He will give you review outlines for the two test and final and they clearly tell you what you need to know. Do not miss a single class.,1
"Dr. Currier was an amazing instructor for Micro lab.  I wish I could have had her for lecture also.  She was very helpful & always willing to answer any questions.  This is a tough class, but she made it much more manageable.  I highly recommend her for Micro as it is a very tough class.",1
"I loved him! I was in the honors section, so he was my discussion leader and i got to know him pretty well. He's such a sweet guy, bought us all coffee the first week of class. He really cares about his students a lot. He has a lot of real world experience, brought in guest lecturers and we watched films. it was a great class.",1
"I had Mallinson at CUI for philosophy. He is always so enthusiastic about the topics However, he gets side tracked easily. I attended every class and didn't read any of the 5 assigned texts and still got a B in the class. Tests are easy if you MEMORIZE ANSWERS TO THE REVIEW GAME!!!! make flash cards of them if you want an A",1
Awesome! Easy! All his tests are half take home essay questions and half in class multiple choice. (Even the midterm and final) He lets you use your notes. The questions are exaclty from your notes. There is no excuses you can get an A easily! TAKE HIM! He made my life so much easier for me this quarter! He is funny too. Taking him again winter,1
"I really enjoyed his class. It's very informative and thorough, knowing his material inside and out.",1
"The most boring class I have ever been in.  He goes in circles when he speaks (which is always in a monotone). He is older and tends to forget what he was saying leaving your notes incomplete with major holes in them.  90% of the students dropped it, I think an online class would be easier as you are teaching yourself either way.",0
"A piece of cake! May God bless her soul, she is the BEST professor ever. All online classes should be like this, short and sweet! TAKE HER!",1
"He glosses over a lot of basics, but he's happy to explain if you ask.  He tries to keep lectures down to the bare minimum, so definitely ask for more explanation if you need it.  He is extremely clear about what he expects to see 'show your work' wise on tests and quizzes, and he isn't too nit picky.",1
"He makes learning about A&P easier, his lectures cover pretty much everything. He is always available for office hours, and has SI 2+ days a week. He does have an accent, but I could understand everything just fine. He has always been helpful and is great at making sure you really understand the material. I would take his clas s 100 times over!",1
"Will is an amazing teacher! He really connects to his students and wants you to succeed as much as possible, but he'll put in the work when you do.",1
"Extremely intelligent in this field, but impossible to access outside of class. As someone who had class during his office hours, I emailed him several times this semester to set up a time to meet or just ask questions and never received a response, and he was always the first person to run out of the class room. The GSIs graded extremely unfair.",0
"In the middle of a worldwide pandemic this ""teacher"" was nothing but rude and unprofessional. Would definitely not recommend.",0
"Funny guy. Did well in the class, but overall, I don't like him as a professor. He's rude when you ask questions, gives lots of examples but somehow manages not to actually work an equation, won't work with you AT ALL on attendance. Idk I would have probably taken someone else bc I basically taught myself with Kahn academy to do well lol.",0
Worst teacher ever.  He is very hard and people drop out like flies every class.  You will want to burn this man alive after you've had him.  DO NOT TAKE THIS MAN'S CLASS!!!,0
"Honestly it was more the class teaching him. Hes pretty old and gets things confused. He does give you good tips and shows how things are done, but he says he gives points for setting up problems on tests and he doesnt. If you dont do great on a few things, scores make you fail.",0
"Great professor, detailed intro of the business and very relatable. Easy class and it was a fun experience.",1
She is such a phenomenal professor! She actually teaches you and wants you to get an A. She always goes over every lesson as much as you need in order for you to understand. Wish i would've taken all my Spanish classes with her. HIGHLY recommend taking her.,1
She is the best math professor hands down. Enjoyed her class 100% and she is passionate. Put in your part of the work and she puts in her part of the workeasy A. Do the homework.,1
"Absolute worst professor at the university. Do not take him unless you can teach an entire course to yourself, otherwise, you won't pass. Over half of my class dropped. Will literally call you dumb to your face if you ask for help. AVOID",0
"I think hes very entertaining, some what ""out there"" but i think hes fair and wants everyone to succeed.",1
Ms Gray  is a wonderful teacher.  She makes class interesting and fun.  I looked forward to each class I attended and was very depressed when it came to an end.    As a returning student  my experience was so positive I plan to continue taking courses at U.S. I.  I hope that I am fortunate enough to get another teacher with her knowledge & caliber.,1
"She does not teach well. If you can not learn on your own, do not take this class. Also, she is not good at helping when you need it.",0
"What a terrible professor. He rushes through his lectures. We have class Mon and Thurs 8:30-9:45, and this fool always ends it right at 9:30 and relaxes the rest of the day. Tough grader and expects answers in a certain way. Definitely the worst professor I've ever had. Worst part is? You have very few grades. Only 6 hw assignments and 4 exams.",0
Professor Bordowitz is a really nice guy. He usually is in a good mood and will make corny jokes. It's kinda interesting to hear what he has to say. I worked hard and he helped me whenever I needed his help. I recommend others to take him. I took him for WRT101 and got an A and I am taking him again for WRT201.,1
She has weekly quizzes and 2-3 papers throughout the year. As long as you at least skim the reading and pay attention in the lecture you'll be okay. She is really passionate and wants you to participate but you don't have to. I think she is a solid choice for the English gen ed,1
He does not appreciate questions and is very condescending. He promises extra credit but he does not actually put it in the grade book. He does not like enthusiasm for the material so its best to just show up and lay low.,0
"Simply the best prof you can ask for when taking a difficult course like AP. Excellent at explaining concepts, organized & funny! Has open lab 1X a week to help w/anything. Lots of quizzes & exams but it will work in your favor. Tough course for me but did well thanks to this prof. Shes also a real gem of a person. Wish she taught AP 2.",1
"Lectures were super boring. In the beginning of the semester, I went to every class, but once we started going over the parts of a computer, I didn't bother. Definitely show up to the lectures about Excel and Access though. The homework and exams are all open-notes. Just search up the questions and you'll find the answers.",0
"I took him for Algebraic Concepts. He has a strong Korean accent. Math is one of my strong subjects and I got an A. I taught myself everything through the homework. If you are not good at math, I DONT recommend him. He doesnt use the textbook but he does you mymathlab which is a good way to learn and teach yourself material. He wants you to succeed",0
"Stay away from this ""professor"" if you haven't had any education regarding Computer sci prior to enrolling this course. Secondly, get ready to put in the work, literally, you're going to depend more on the book, and other resources before the prof. To conclude, this instructor is unwilling or unable to adapt to provide proper teaching. Good luck.",0
"Had him as a teacher for Taxation, a hard subject.  Would not trade him in for another teacher.  He was clear and concise in all his explanations.  Wasn't thrilled with the partner assignments but that was no big thing.  He knew what he was talking about, how to explain it and how to get people interested in what he was saying.  Made taxation fun.",1
"He is by far one of the worst professors at Macomb. No extra credit, no help with homework, not willing to answer questions that expand on his lecture. He stopped giving feedback on homework after several students hadn't done theirs, so he took it out on everyone. No one can keep up with his workload. I ended up dropping and trying again.",0
Does not teach to the level of the test. Teaches students how to do a level 3 problem and tests are level 9 problems. Has vague review guides that are pretty pointless. Quizzes you on new material right after you learn it in class. Never lets class out early.,0
"This guy is BAD, had him Freshman year. He couldn't make a clear presentation if his life depended on it. He won't help you out at all and if he does he'll make you feel like a retard. I asked him a ques. and he told me to drop the course! Worst prof I've ever had at Behrend (and I'm a Junior).",0
Had her for both Writing 101 and 102 because she is very structured in assignments. Turn in work on time and participate and your grade will reflect it.,1
I would never take her class if I didn't have too. She's not very student friendly and she doesn't pay attention to her students. She's cuts you off during presentations. Theres more homework in this class then all four of my classes combined.,0
"Professor Douglas is great! A little hard to understand during lectures and his illegible writing doesn't help, but overall he is positive, funny and knows his subjects well. His lectures are note based so if you don't like writing copiously avoid his classes otherwise I would highly recommend him!",1
"Took this class over Spring 2013 semester. This guy basically takes what another instructor does and tries to teach it. Automatically get an A if you try. I would turn in projects half done and still get A. If you are looking for a great great and no idea what is being taught, then this is the class.",0
Professor Khan is a great teacher. She gives writing assignments that are not difficult to do and many of them are interesting. Tons of group work and opportunities for extra credit. She is caring and understanding and brings goodies (snacks) to class. Do well and keep up with assignments and you'll get an easy A. I would definitely take her again.,1
"Dr. Vetter has honestly been the best professor I have had so far within the Computer Science curriculum here at UNCW. His lectures are phenomenal in detail, and he rehashes over everything to make sure his students know what to do. He really cares about his students' success, and his grading policies are fair. He's the best professor for Networks.",1
"The worst class I took at the JC. The time spent in his class and writing assignments are soul sucking. He barely reads the essays and doesn't read the journals assignments at all, but expects students to follow a strict format that gets graded based on his arbitrary observations. Even getting final grades has been frustrating. Awful class",0
Be prepare to participate.... he takes participation very serious. You get a grade every few weeks for participation. Do not miss class because he will take points off. You need the book for the class. He is very passionate about what he teaches.,0
"She is a good and incredible teacher, she is very weird but cool and good person at the same time. You would love her.",1
"DO NOT take her class. She makes it very difficult. She gives too much work, so if you do plan to take her, take her class by itself!! She doesn't explain things she just simply reads from the powerpoint.. and when you ask for help on a lab she tells you to refer to you lab partners when the whole class don't even understand what to do.",0
"I have to agree with some of the criticism here. Incredibly intelligent (seriously - very sharp), but if you want to witness an academic cult of personality at its most grovelling, take this class and watch how people who disagree with the professsor (there MUST be other poets than Holderlin and Rilke to examine) get eviscerated.",0
"I heard good things about Raphael before taking Con Law with him this semester... but have not experienced said good things. Probably my least favorite professor I've had; cold calls about things outside of the case (American history questions, for example), lectures without much discussion, and seems like he enjoys catching students off guard.",0
Save yourself she will mess up your average.,0
"Horrible teacher! She doesn't know what she is doing or teaching. So confusing on what she wants to teach you, and the material that is on the tests are not what she tells you.",0
"Very helpful instructor! Definitely recommend him because he goes step by step. He will also teach you some very helpful short cuts. He also cares very much for his students, and I think that is super awesome! Definitely take him!",1
"This professor is the most unattached being from her students, she don't answer emails. BUT the one time she did she was sweet and her class is also very easy. The material is super interesting and you NEED the book, the book is really interesting I read it for fun. Other than that there are 4 tests (cake if you have the book)",1
Prof makes an effort 2 teach students. Do all the extra credit. Study & follow reviews n & out of class. Go 2 weekend study sessions. Dont miss class. If u do that u will pass w/a B.,1
Brittney rocks!,1
"This woman is the devil.she gives no help. If u ask her what u did wrong her reply will be something ""like u don't listen or NO"".. All she dose is talk about herself. And expect you to know ever line of ever poem or story. I wrote a 8 page paper for her and she gave me a 58 on it and told me that was being generous. I asked what I do wrong her reply ""what didn't you do wrong now get out of my office"".. The lady is hart less.. Take her if you want a F-.",0
"Phil. of Religion. Interesting class. Prof. Shartin was out about once a week this semester, I don't know if that's normal for him. Reading was minimal, papers were hard for some students, but he allowed rewriting. Super nice guy, really wants you to learn something in the course. I'd take him again in a heartbeat.",1
"This isn't my hardest class but I'm failing it. I suck at math and I know it, yet I can do molar conversions in chemistry and have a difficult time understanding stats. She sucks at this. Don't take her unless you like teaching yourself. Never gives any study guides for exams and there's a quiz every week. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS YOU WILL FAIL!!!!!!!",0
"No joke, had a quiz every single class. Each night we had 2-3 readings, normally about 15-30 pages each. They're also over incredibly absurd topics like devil worshipers. This was my least favorite class at TCU so far.",0
She did not help this class at all.  Do not take her online.  Did not grade assignments or respond to emails.,0
good professor. easy class. you do have to read and participate though. if the class participates she excludes the final. I would highly recommend her.,1
"Talks entirely too much during class (especially for a 400-level one), talking points are incredibly repetitive, extremely flaky.  He does have extensive and interesting knowledge of critical theory, though.",0
Very funny professor. He is very knowledgable and the notes he makes are very aesthetic. The notes themselves make you want to be good at calculus. The extra revision sessions are a great asset. Never leaves you hanging. Answers all questions in lectures even if youre interrupting the flow,1
"Good guy. Very helpful. Moved a bit slow, but made sure everyone understood everything about the material. This class is not as scary as everyone thinks.",1
"This prof is very intelligent but is VERY condescending.  He knows how smart he is, but does not simplify his thoughts for his lectures.  Nearly everyone I knew was frequently confused by his lectures.  I will not take a class with him again.",0
"Prof Hasheminia is simply amazing. Because of him and DS 412, I switched to DS major.",1
"Definitely does assign A LOT of reading (20+ pages per class) however, i read maybe twice and got an A. The only major grades are the midterm, final, and research paper. She gives you a list of all the terms you have to remember as well as the possible essays and its a lot to memorize but it can be done. She offers a lot of extra credit.",0
"Did not enjoy class, talks about theory and derives equations rather than doing an example.  Tests are on applied problems, not theoretical.",0
"I had her for Trusts and estates. Just meh... I heard good things about her and she was okay but I wasn't super impressed. She is to the point, which I like, but then sometimes doesn't actually answer your question or tries to make you feel stupid for asking something.",0
"Great teacher, id recommend her!",1
"Short papers, blogs and a 4-5 part final paper.  At least 2 of these are due every week.  She's not clear on answers. Open book tests but she takes so many points off for everything else that it doesn't matter. Expects very detailed everything but never gives an example of what she wants and you lose an incredible amount of points for it. ",0
"It seems most people have given up on him. Class is 16/35 full, people keep dropping out, and in the online lectures you'd be lucky to find 9-10 people attending. That should tell you everything about him. Listen to these reviews people.",0
Lisa assigns assignments with little to no direction. She requests that you go to peers for help instead of her. She grades tough- you get a C for doing exactly as she asks; you must go above and beyond to get any higher.,0
"Worst professor Ive had. The first two classes were fun, yet Philip Brown is completely scatterbrained, and never stays on topic. Hes inconsiderate of your emails. He barely gives you homework, and when he does its not related to your tests. He doesnt clearly outline testing material. Tests are nitpicked. Too fast in lectures, you cant keep up",0
Mr Boehm is an amazing teacher. He is strict on grading papers because he wants his students to succeed. NOt to mention he is so good looking. :),1
Very easy class. The assignments were helpful to understand the material. He gave us a lot of practice tests with questions very similar to the ones in the actual tests. Do the practices he assigns and you'll get an easy A.,1
"Dr. Schore is too phenomenal to not take. Just look at his review, all excellent reviews. His lecture are the most clear Ive ever taken in Davis. I even recommend you to take his 118A instead of 8A since he is sooo great. Learning will be fun for once if you try his class.",1
Horrible I had him for calc III and almost our whole class ended up dropping b/c he was so bad...then i took atif and rocked it,0
"In this class, Andrew talked at us for hours with little class discussion. He chose the theme of Secular Existentialism as a discussion point for all the poems and books. It was depressing. We were not allowed to use outside sources and could not write about anything he hadn't said in class so we weren't able to have different thoughts from him.",0
"She does not like to teach, every class is review. She rather give tips and then expects you to pass on your own.",0
"Nuchereno is a very caring and educated adjunct professor who is very accessible and is very fair. Her grading criteria is obvious, and the material discussed in class is relevant and understandable. Her lectures are relatively entertaining and she's never too busy for questions. She's always available for office hours, but not really by email.",1
"Super funny guy. There are random in class assignments so its your best interest to show up. 2 test, 3 quizzes, 5 assignments. 10/10 would take again.",1
Prof. Zeman is one of the best professors I have ever had. If you study her power points you will get 100 on every test. I did and I just followed the power points. She explains everything and if you did not understand it she will explain it again. She is sweet and funny. Do yourself a favor and take her!!!!,1
Do not take Casey! Hardest class I have taken. He wastes times by making you do worthless video notes before each class which don't even effect your grade. Theres to many bad things to say about him then good so I'm stopping here. DO NOT TAKE!!,0
"Really good professor. It's kind of an interesting class and she posts handouts on the website before lectures, which makes note-taking a lot easier. She is kind of absent-minded, though, especially with the electronics in the lecture hall. But overall, straightforward class and with a litte bit of effort, you should do well.",1
An easy class to pass but you have to watch out for mood swings. Saw her yell at a student for asking a question. Major attitude problem. Surprised there arent more reviews reflecting this. Probably because her class is so easy.,0
"Dr. Spiczak is genuinely such a smart man. That being said, he struggles interpreting the information to students in a clear and orderly manner. One - on - one he is much easier to understand, so I'd make sure to check his office hours. He's a very generous grader, the curves on his tests and overall class is favorable. ",0
"I took Ancient Law and Politics and Ideas in Antiquity. The lectures are great, very informative. Let's you gain an open perspective. I highly recommend this professor. The books that he recommends are really good.",1
"I took him for Calc II, and would not recommend him if you're going on to take Calc III. I need Calc III and I do not feel prepared at all. I taught myself almost everything I learned in this class because he does not give good lectures. Not many notes, lots of example problems.  If you end up taking him, read the book before going to each class.",0
Awsme prof!Vry hlpful!she warns u 1st day of class that a lot of it is on u to study. she's not a magician!she really tries to help u get a good grade and provides review but u have to study!it's a bio class n this is college so what do u expect?Hole's pre/post tests=best friends4lec exms.practice labs everyday!no joke!put in the wk u will succeed!,1
"She is really nice and sweet and tries her best to explain things! There were connect assignments, 3 exams, and 1 speech. She also gives out extra credit. I would definitely take her again.",1
"There are assignments due for each class, they usually are pretty short though. Sometimes her grading criteria is unclear but she is willing to work with the students to change. There is A LOT of small group work so be prepared to meet EVERYONE in your class because she will make you work with different people multiple times in one class period.",1
"He is a really nice guy and really willing to help, but he's just not a great lecturer/teacher. Class will bore you out of your mind, I mean it is tax, but all he does is read from the powerpoint. One of the only reasons I got a good grade is because of help from the TA. They are going to completely revamp the course soon, so maybe wait to take it.",1
"Saralina is such an energetic and positive person, but in a very inspirational, not annoying way. She's always doing everything she can to make class fun and to brighten people's days. She made class fun to participate in, and was always available to help with assignments. However she isn't very responsive to emails so maybe try seeing her inperson",1
Best professor ever. She was funny. She made the class interactive by telling personal experiences,1
"Not a bad prof, not a great prof.  Doesn't understand when someone asks him to slow down, because they can't take in the info on a lightning fast pace.  Fair in marking.  Overall, a 'fair' professor.",1
Do not take this class Find another teacher. Id rather take an 8 am then taking an 11 am with her. She is one of the worst graders I ever had. She is so tough on students and will give an F if you are a few sentences away from the page requirements. Find another teacher because she is very annoying and unhelpful. No good feedback and no 2nd chances,0
"I wish he taught more classes!!! Great instructor! Really seems to enjoy teaching. Weird sense of humor, but over all a great guy.",1
"Caffeine pumped lectures: Often critical,interruptive, all-knowing, world-travelled, published, but interesting. He's hard. Tests are all essay. Papers can be intense with Yonn. Talks with students outside of lecture isn't his thing. Book all office hour appointments through e-mail. No phone calls either. Schedule extra time. He's fast so-keep up",0
"Anne Paulet pretty much just reads from her slide notes the entire period, rarely taking a break to answer questions or have a class discussion. She assigns WAY too many group projects that require a LOT of time at home to complete. I feel like I could get the same education by just reading her power points at home. AWFUL TEACHER.",0
"No textbook, just a link to papers he's written about sociologists. Multiple choice questions are really just papers written in response to his writings. A paper a week plus extra book reports. Not engaging, treats you like a child & makes comments if you don't have prep notes for his papers that are written more suitable to an upper level class.",0
"The course material was nice, but she did not reply to any emails I sent her over the course of the semester. I sent a few with important questions. There were two assignments (35% and 50%) and weekly self-made multiple choice questions to do. She is a tough grader and does not offer feedback which was frustrating. I'm sure it's better in person.",0
"She likes to see students suffer.  Laughs when we mess up, loves to correct us in a way that makes her answer obvious, even though it's not.  Gave us last semester's final for us to study for our final...it was nowhere close to the final she gave.  She asked us things we'd never practiced.  Ok teacher, fun, but an arrogant, demeaning grader.",0
"I am shy and i was not comfortable asking a question during the lecture. I went to him after class and he yelled coz ""i should have ask the question when he was talking about the subject"". One of the prof who made me hate chemistry. York doesn't to consider bad reviews to improve students' experience. The other bad exp is Carolyn Hempstead, lol",0
Offered help when needed during office hours.,1
"For those of you who are English and Non English Majors, I strongly recommend you take this class. English 111 is not as hard as might you think. You will write 4 essays and to listen to powerpoint each class. Yes you need textbook. Can be a little picky while grading essays. There are also no quizzes, no tests, and no finals.",1
"Amy was GREAT! There was a lot of writing to do in this class, so be ready for it. The teacher really cares and wants you to do well. Just keep up and turn in your work and you will do fine.",1
Very helpful and patient. I would highly recommend him esp in a face to face class.,1
"Like others have mentioned, the material itself is easy, but she made it really hard by giving a ridiculous amount of homework, with mandatory attendence of lectures, tutorials, and weekly quizzes. This is not high school, and learning should be independent at unviersity. Students should have right to decide which learning style best suits them",0
"She does not teach nor lecture labs are a joke , Im seriously pissed I picked this course with her, its overwhelming like its your only class , each chapter homework question are 100+ she has you doing 8pge summaries for each chapter . 1-8 and then you have labs and TEST !! DO NOT TAKE THIS LADY, this is not my 1st year , but she is the worst!",0
"Kelm was one of the best Spanish professors I've taken from. I found the assignments clearly planned and understood what was expected of us. He gave concise and funny lectures and I always felt like he wanted us to do the best we can. He was very receptive to questions. Grade comes from online homework and chapter tests, no cumulative final.",1
"One of the worst teachers I have ever had. Never trust the study guide. If he says something won't be on a test, expect it to be on the test. ",0
"I wasn't sure about taking an online class, I never have before.  And I was also pretty nervous about taking a philosophy class, it seemed pretty hard to me.  But Matt made it SO interesting!  I looked forward to his lectures every week and have expanded my mind so much.  And as long as you keep up with the work, easy A. Best teacher at Oakton.",1
"Hard to take notes from his jumbled mess on the board. He doesn't answer questions thoroughly. The Mrs. even complained about the way he tried helping her with the PE exam. His final exam was impossible. Be sure to just make a really good reference sheet for tests, and try to do the homework.",0
"He seems to be a good guy and he is passionate about the topic but he jumps around so much in lectures and gets so off-topic that it's basically impossible to take good notes. His tests are really hard and encompass things he didn't really go over in class, so you have to read the textbook.",0
"Professor Dynes has been one of my favorite professors at BYU. He is empathetic, engaging, and finds unique ways to apply complex topics to everyday scenarios, making the content of the class accessible and enjoyable. He is simply a good person. The reading and lectures are imperative to succeeding in the course, but dont let that dissuade you!",1
She never replies to emails,0
"For an intro class, he does a good job. The material is not to hard and he goes through it enough times in class, and call you out, to make sure you get it. Attendance isn't mandatory but if you go to class, it will seriously make the class an easy A. He isn't boring and isn't mean. Overall, pretty good deal. ",1
Take her class!!! Easiest thing you will do. The whole semester we only had class like 10 times. You really have to try to fail her class.,0
"this must be her first semester teaching advanced convo, the class structure is not helpful and the presentations are the most terrifying assignments ever.don't be fooled! french convo may sound fun, but i have never felt more discouraged about learning french.",0
"Worst finance Professor at Salisbury. Class isnt too boring but you will not learn anything. Each test, more than 90% of the class did not finish on time. He says lazy things like how him grading your work makes him deserve teacher of the year. Do Not Take him.",0
"Literally the best professor in MDC. No doubt about it. I've taken both german one and german two with Herr Morales. It is with him that I have realized that loving an afternoon class is possible. If you really, really want to learn either german or any other language that he offers teaching for, be sure to take him! Herr Morales is simply THE BEST",1
"Just take class with someone else. If you have children, a job, any other responsibilities, if you have any form of ADD/ADHD. You will fail. The amount of information your expected to absorb and retain is unreasonable for the time frame. The amount of writing is ridiculous. Lets face it, your not at Harvard its GCTCS. She doesnt act accordingly.",0
"Olzman's class is the only class I look forward to and I'm not even a COMM major. She challenges you to become a better speaker and performer. You will dive into your identity. You must come to class and she is easily approachable to speak about anything. Highly empathetic, hilarious, and one of the best professors I've ever taken. Highly recommend",1
"As a whole, the class was very disorganized. I honestly didn't know what my grade was for most of the semester. She wasn't very helpful during the semester. On hard grammar topics, she would literally spend a day on them (which doesn't make any sense). I can't recommend her as a prof.",0
Why are they still letting this woman teach?,0
"Sam is a super cool guy, definitely take this class if you're looking at it to fulfill your gened requirement. There are very few grades in this class, but its so easy (I ended with 100%). For the few assignments we did have, he had a clear rubric & grading instructions on canvas. Sam is an inspirational guy and is passionate about music, TAKE HIM!",1
The journalism section of Econ 1051 is a COMPLETE waste of time.  She expects people to participate in a giant lecture and she talks about subjects we haven't covered yet.,0
Boring lectures.  Assignments are VERY unclear.  She busted 1/3 of my class for plagerism on a website we built so make sure you document your sources.,0
"Come to class, do all homework, and ask for help if needed, you will receive a good grade. He is so understanding and caring. His lectures are very useful, and you will get the best grade if you understood lectures and homework.",1
she wants things done her way or youll get a low grade.,0
"Extremely clear, concise lectures. Laura is always willing to help her students succeed and is open minded. She is an absolutely fantastic professor and a true asset to the TIM school. UH needs more professors like her.",1
Awful. Grading is way too tough. He thinks hes teaching at Harvord. Didnt care when someone called him out for being unfair. Accused me of plagerism when I only used my own words in a paper. Never posts online. Expects you to have Einsteins memory skills with his pop quizzes. This professor is the worst ive ever had.,0
Dr. Lyall is a MUST take! Hes one of the best professors I ever had. I enjoy going to this class and never missed one. I learned so much from this class. Hes truly one of the best professors in the Psychology department. Two required videos and weekly summaries. Test are very easy he prepares you!,1
This professor was a tough grader and very specific in grading . She took a long time to grade assignments which made it very frustrating. When asked for help she forwarded general information to blackboard as oppose to specifically answering my question based on my work. I wish I did not buy the book as well as more of her study guides were used.,0
"She was  a good teacher. Used to go around class to check whether students were doing in-class assignments and help us if we had any questions. Never used the book. Her accent was a little distracting at times. I took her in the summer and got A, but I also had a good background in calc.",1
"Has written books on AutoCAD. Knows it inside and out.  However often rambles in class about it and is not organized on due dates.  We have ""exams"" that have material we've never covered really. Very interesting subject and tool but he returns drawings with inconsistent grading and feedback. More clarity and this course would be legit.",0
"professor lacked quality teaching skills. more reading and papers required than english majors. You cant reach her outside of class, she doesnt respond to emails. also, dont expect her to post anything in a timely manner or when she says she will.",0
good teacher. exams are easy.,1
"Very easy to follow his notes as he writes on the board. Unlike other math professors, he takes he's time and you won't need to ask him to slow down. He has written text books in the past, and it shows through his teaching methods. He even shows compassion for his students.",1
"Dr. Johnson is an excellent professor and is super accessible. Her lectures are all power points which are on blackboard.  She takes attendance daily, but you're allowed 3 excused absences.  Pay attention and prepare for the exams and you'll be golden.  Your grade reflects attendance, midterm, 1 paper with 3 options, a final, and weekly quizzes.",1
Very nice professor and wants you to succeed. Make sure you understand coursework and do recitations and homework.,1
"Professor Hahn is one of the best math professors at Duke. She never tries to be esoteric and is always about helping her students. She is extremely friendly and helpful in her office hours, not to mention she is hilarious. If anyone is interested in Math 221, I recommend taking it with her. I am glad she is teaching Math 401, next fall.",1
Not very clear with paper grading(even if you follow what he asks for). Reading quiz every class so make sure you read. The readings were interesting but there are easier options out there. Don't take unless you have to. Attendance is mandatory cause of quiz and participation grade. Tough grader.,1
"Dr. Spiczak is interesting to listen to, but that's about it.  He is very enthusiastic and smart, but he treats a generals level class like a graduate level.  His class is very hard and he tests on obscure facts from the book that we don't discuss in class. Nice guy, bad teacher",0
"Disorganized instructor. Her French sounds bizarre, with a strong English accent. Relies too much on the Internet. She shows up late to class way too many times. She does not seem to remember to return marked papers. I can't figured out what or if  we learned anything in this course. Never again with this instructor, not recommended!",0
"I definitely won't recommend to take his claas. He's boring, mean. He won't even let you drink water in class or put a hat on during icy weather. Your grade based on 4 exams. Pass 4 you pass the class, fail one and average on three you'll fail the class.",0
"Class was extremely difficult. Attendance is not mandatory and really does not help much other than that he might touch on a couple of conceptual points that may or may not help. Most of the learning needs to be done solving the book problems (Do as many as possible, not just assigned ones). He curves a lot but still easy to fail. Tough subject.",0
"While he is very intelligent, if you are the type of learner who needs more explanation, he's not the professor you need. He explains the math problems by the book without further explanation. This course is fast paced and will not slow down for those who learn slower.",0
Whitney Court is a brand new professor. She has a great sense of humor and makes lectures interesting and light. There is a lot of assigned reading which you can get by without doing. She makes study guides for each exam which is incredibly helpful. Study before the exams and you'll be just fine.,1
"Awesome teacher, learned a great deal",1
"Gabe was an awesome professor, he works very well with athletes. I am trying to write for the school newspaper next year just because he is in charge of it. I disliked writing and english before taking his class and now I thoroughly enjoy it.",1
"Dr. Legg was my favorite professor at of all the professors I've had. He relates lectures to real life instances, which have really helped me in my career. He's really knowledgeable and funny and has a lot of interesting stories. Tests are a little challenging, but he usually gives extra credit, so do that and you're good. Definitely recommend!",1
"Dr Arevalo is an amazing professor and person. She genuinely wants students to do well and is always willing to help with things you dont understand. 104 is definition heavy, and many parts of it are very similar and hard to differentiate, so you MUST pay attention in her lecture. She is great at getting you to understand and explaining for clarity",1
"She's just not a good professor. She curses a lot, assigns weekly homework and there's A LOT OF reading. She also wants you to go to libraries to borrow books to read a few chapters for class and return it. She's also a very tough grader. She doesn't really help students much and makes you feel dumb based on questions you ask her. DON'T TAKE HER!",0
His exams are fairly predictable but he is a total male chauvanist.  Doesn't think girls have any place in geology... or the world for that matter.  avoid at all costs.  he's been around since the university opened.  hopefully he'll retire soon,0
"The questions are confusing, the reading material is absurd, and the professor is extremely hard on grading. If you don't answer one part of the 2 or 3 questions it shows drastically on your grade.  Don't take this professor unless you're prepared for a stressful class andor major headache.",0
"during my course the professor required quizzes on a weekly basis which is an accelerated rythm, it prevented me from fully assimilating the chapters and since i had classes twice a week, I couldn't accumulate good grade due to almost 8 quizzes one midterm and one exam . we all know the law of large numbers however we don't need extra pressure.",0
"You can try to work your way out through a problem, but you'll be told to read the book when you asking for help . If you did not get above a B in calc 1, you will struggle, and he has no shame in boasting that he's an inefficient professor.",0
Grace Deason is the beast professor I've ever had. She is hot too! Also.. she gives the cutest examples in class.,1
"This professor just reads off of her slides and goes through them really fast. She rarely participates with the class. She DOES give partial credit on exams which is, I guess, a plus. If you miss a class don't worry because she posts her slides on blackboard. She gives study points that don't really help and she's terrible at explaining things.",0
"He tends to be sarcastic and sadistic, including when giving students feedback in front of the class. His instructions were sometimes unclear. When asked for clarification, he can be quite mean. His criteria for speeches sometimes seem to reflect his personal interests, and he sometimes gives contradicting parameters.",0
"He's the sweetest prof ever but i never knew it'd be possible to be this disorganized. Don't be surprised if he does lose or misplace students' marks and documents frequently. Took his class because people say that its an easy A if you put in the work and do his practices problems. However, over half of my class is failing his course.",0
I would NOT recommend taking his class. Maybe the first two days of class is good only. If you make it to class 4 minutes late you won't be able to get in. Which he has just arrived 2 minutes late. Tough grader. Doesn't give feedback on essays. Expects you to know your errors. No enthusiasm. Lectures feel like you'd rather be somewhere else.,0
I had to choose 1 Star because 0 wasnt an option he is not clear at all and the professor has to many returning students and you would think the college would notice that. He stumbles himself on questions from the textbook and doesnt care if you fail the class or not.,0
Doesnt explain things very well...,0
"I have taken this professor multiple times and have always loved her. She cares for her students, knows her material, and gives great feedback on papers. Much of her assignments are just for class participation, but they do require reading the textbooks. The rest of her homework is few and tests (3-4) are spread out.",1
"great lectures, really knows his stuff.  to do well on the tests you need to come to class, take good notes, but you get outlines for each class that tell you everything you need.  do this, and the exams are a breeze.",1
Wonderful professor. Highly recommend.,1
"HE DOES NOT TEACH THE CLASS! Pro. Silva had us watch his or his wifes lectures on YouTube. THIS CLASS WAS DIFFICULT! 277+ assignments for a math class... Tests were scary. He has a thing about cheating (he cut someones index card because it wasnt the ""correct size"". Honestly I would take a different Professor all together. Not sure how I passed.",0
Shawna is really nice but is completely inaccessible outside of class nor does she (or the TA) respond to emails. The group project is terrible  if you get stuck with a bad group ..... good luck Charlie :-) super easy but disappointed overall since I was really looking forward to learning about US policy from a current mayor,0
"Prof. Earp was the worst professor I've ever had. I came to class stressed, crying before I came in. I dreaded going to class. Looking back, I wish I would've never taken this class. I regret it so much.",0
Ms. Meyers was an extremely rude teacher.  She made me less motivated to learn and attend her class because she always had something negative to say.  She also made the material seem way harder than it actually was.,0
"THE WORST PROFESSOR AT ASU!!! He didn't care AT ALL or make ANY accommodations for me when my good friend passed away during the semester. He is cringy to watch and thinks he knows everything. He gives no rubric or direction, yet he grades super harshly.",0
I loved Professor Okada! Hes so kind and very nice to everyone. Ive attended every lecture and every homework and exam grade I got A. Some parts of his lecture is kinda tuff to understand but as long as you keep up with the homeworks you are fine! Professor Okada makes sure you understand as well always wiling to let questions asked in the open.,1
"I wish I knew of this site before taking this teacher.  She is often late for class,  late returning assignments, totally off schedule, lecture has very little to do with English or readings.  Not very personable. Loses your assignments, extremely disorganized. i would not recommend her.",0
"He takes off points on tests that are unnecessary. I took AP Calc in high school and received an ""A"". I thought this class would be a GPA booster with Orgo and A&P however I had worked more at this class than anything. Don't take him for calc. I got an A- in the course however I think this was VERY unfair for the work I put in. He is so awkward",0
This is a french oral class and I am quite disappointed with it. Juliet is a very nice person but the oral class is not strictly formatted and there is hardly any french conversation and activities done between students to help improve their french. The course is quite boring and not worth taking. ,0
She is a great teacher as far as subject matter. But when you try to talk to her if your having trouble she isn't as helpful as she could be.,0
Doesnt provide help and your whole grade is based upon your test and quiz scores which she doesnt provide much help with. IF YOU HAVE TO TAKE THIS CLASS CHOOSE ANOTHER TEACHER. One person in my class got an A 8 people had Bs and the rest failed. More than 60% of the class got D's or F's. Bad teaching. she ruined my college career,0
"I really liked the content of the class. It was online but she was really nice to us because of coronavirus. I had to move and there was a lot of stress, plus I had other work and class demands that piled up. She cared about us and went out of her way to adjust the class to minimize stress on us. I appreciated it!",1
"He is honestly one of the smartest profs I've ever taken. He is an awesome instructor. Exams are fairly challenging and you have fifty minutes to answer roughly around 5-8 short answers. However, I would not recommend taking this if you are a freshman and are taking another science course. I did that and I awfully regretted doing thistake it slow!",1
"Good professor, very respectful to students and understanding if you have a situation. Clear grading system, very lenient as long as you do the work and put effort.  Besides certain fundamentals theres no 1 way to do the diagrams and the professor takes that into account. 4 Ind. Assignments, 1 Midterm, 1 Final, 1 Group Project. Would take him again",1
"Lectures were always interesting and I always left feeling inspired and deeply enlightened about American literature. So while Dr. Nelson is a great teacher, he's not a good professor. Very unapproachable, impersonal, can be rude, comments on papers are not very helpful, and he is an incredibly tough grader. I'd be wary about taking him again.",1
Mary Elfring is okay. She often will bring about current events which can be quite uncomfortable in my opinion. She gives more attention to certain students who talk more which is not right. Her classroom environment could be improved by allowing for balanced classroom discussion.,1
"Trina is a solid choice for 130. I would not want her for 151 or 152. Her class, with exams and quizzes included, must have around 120 assignments. It's unreal. Most of them are quick and easy assignment, but she still grades them like her life depends on it. You will be prepared for Chem 151 when taking her though.",1
"She expected you to know everything, but taught you nothing. Lovely lady, but terrible professor. Avoid her at all costs unless you want your GPA to drop!",0
"Marni is by far one of the worst professors I've had in a long time. Her accent is hard to follow, which is understandable since she is foreign. However, her poor grammar cripples her ability to teach. Her lectures are so poor in fact that I had begun skipping lectures and teaching myself and my grade dramatically increased. If you can, run away.",0
"One of the rudest professors I've ever encountered. Felt like if I didn't understand a part of his lecture, I couldn't ask a question or else he'd be ill-mannered about it. Always seemed knowledgeable about the subject, but was never approachable about the content. I'd recommend taking his class as a last resort if you want to learn the content.",0
He is a very good teacher overall. He explains exactly what to do in the lab. He is a little strict with grading lab assignments and quizzes though. You must be very specific and accurate. It is easy to do well though because most things you can look up online if you do not know the answer off hand for the lab homeworks.,1
Dr. Borglin is amazing. I was extremely nervous to take a science class but needed it for my nursing major. She took time to explain things to her students and would try her best to help and accommodate her students in any way possible. Only down side is that sometimes she had a hard time explaining some material and you have to figure it out urse,1
"Sign language is a great language, but this Professor makes me question if I should continue with studying it. She has temper tantrums, extremely impatient, and will put down students when they have a genuine inquiry to further their learning. It is taxing having to come to each class and have to feel like you are not good enough for sign language.",0
"He was not clear on what he wanted done, therefore the majority of the class including myself kept getting bad grades. Then when you would try to get a hold of him he would not respond in a timely manner nor answer our phone calls. Do not take this class with this professor unless you want to fail.",0
Genuinely caring professor- the best :),1
"The only thing that would be done in class is lectures and watching historical movies, while the homework was essays and discussion board postings vaguely about the topic we covered that week; the essays were barely looked over and only if it followed his version of Chicago style. Taking notes were only necessary for the midterm and nothing else.",0
"Great passionate teacher. You respect her and do your work, things will go well.",1
"I dont even think this guy knows what hes doing in this class. He doesnt give out syllabi. He is unorganized and he mocks students in front of other students. Even worse, he is the only professor to teach this class. If you can help it, dont take this class.",0
"His teaching style is not easy to adapt to. The concepts in the class are drowned out by his example problems and poor explanations. The guy ""teaches"" coding and algorithms yet doesn't have the ability to operate his laptop (which uses Win '98...).",0
"WORST CLASS EVER. You will study all semester long and still struggle. Awful tests, easy quizzes, busy work assignments. You do not even learn the most important part of the course until the last week of class. ",0
"Honest review here, Professor Fels is such a Fels. She has no idea how to teach this course because she's a researcher. She brings in guest lecturers that think we're high school students. Our exam was to write 15 pages of complete BS with questions that makes no sense. It Fels good to finish this term cause I can't stand another term with her.",0
"One of the best teachers to date! He will not coddle, he shoots straight, and you will be rewarded accordingly for your effort. Be ready to work, research, and do exactly how what he wants. Make the effort and you will be rewarded; even if you can not see the light, ask a question after question, get help and you can be successful in this class.",1
"This class is kinda meh. It's not hard, but its also not interesting. There are a few group assignments and a final group project. If you ever took Quant methods in Psych or Statistics for HRM, its basically the same course. I would recommend taking a more engaging/interesting elective than this class, but this class isn't hard if you do",1
If you can avoid him please do. He takes forever to grade work and his feedback is not very meaningful or insightful . He does not respond to emails in a timely fashion and if you are lucky to get a response its a condescending one.,0
"This guy is awful. He is not too smart. His writing looks like he is hadnicapped and he cannot spell simple words. I question how he got hired and how he has a college degree, but if you look at his university page you can see where he got his degrees. Not impressive. Take this class with someone else that is actually educated.",0
Don't waste your time going to his office hours. He won't hep you and will tell you to learn  it yourself. Better off memorizing the textbook than doing his assignments. Will tell you to drop out if you don't pass the midterm (over 55% will fail it). Breaks the rules every year.,0
"Dr. Dudley is one of the best teachers I've had. His class actually inspired me to change my major to psychology! He makes class super interesting with stories and jokes (that are actually funny), but stays on task. He covers everything that will be on the test really well in lecture, so make sure you come to class!",1
"Class is disorganized and doesnt have clear expectations. Lectures are long, boring and not organized. Doesnt have the ability to connect with any students, and often asks questions that only he knows the answer to. If you think you know the answer he probably wont accept it. Noticeably annoyed  when answering any students questions.",0
"Super easy class! if you just do the assignments, a guaranteed A+. He's super chill and has good stories. The class counts for an art credit so i would definitely take this even if you don't like writing (it's not that much) Only allowed 3 absences so use wisely and expect homework a couple times a week but they are basic readings",1
This class is horrible and should not be taken by anyone other than insanely intelligent Science students --not Arts/Social Science friendly!,0
"There is not enough words to describe Prof. Hasheminia. If you in love with Maths and Statistics, you will definitely enjoy his lectures. He makes the most comprehensive topics so easy to understand! He made the whole class to laugh at every lecture. But you also need to work hard in order to get a good grade. tips: read a book and do the homework!",1
"She's very helpful and gives good advice if you ask for it and confront her. She tends to use up every single moment of class time, even if it is less then necessary. She can be very understanding and patient when you are the same with her. Some of the projects, AKA the presentation, are somewhat irrelevant to the course - A+ preperation.",1
you should  see that clear in  the class,0
"Just a terrible course with a terrible professor. Find another course to take or youll regret it. Poorly put together poorly executed, you have to teach yourself. Nothing gone over and lecture is on the tests just a waste of time.",0
Don't take this class from him. You will have a very hard time understanding him. He doesn't explain good to questions. We doesn't review the examples on the book and most of his reviews for the test didn't help me it all. He does have a heavy accent. I'm not racist but he needs to improve his teaching skills.,0
"shes amazing! i have taken spch 2 other times b4 her class and failed but not with her. shes just an awesome teacher. she kept me intrigued all semester. her speeches are easy, there's 4 of them. she understands mistakes occur so that makes it less stressful when giving speeches. totally recommend her!!",1
"If you're a disorganized student, this professor is not for you. She is very clear about her expectations, she is very understanding and have great concerns for her students. She do not tolerate lackadaisical behavior, she motivated me. This professor  wanted us to know the work,  gain an education, not a just a grade. I love her teaching style. ",1
"Worst English professor at the jc. Unorganized, not clear when giving directions. His essay prompts are nonexistent. ",0
This was the first class in college that I have ever flunked a paper. The writing lab stated they were able to identify no errors prior to turning in the paper.,0
Needs to repent...very creepy..lots of perversity going on there,0
"NOT an easy A kind of teacher. He will make u work 4 it! I got an A (thanks to xtra credit for perfect attendance). He gets frustrated if u question him too much or argue with him. My advice? GO TO TUTORING, stay quiet in clas (unless u have right answr) , good attendance  xtra credit, DO THE HW wa tutor!! He doesnt grade it, but it will help u! ",0
"Very cool guy. This course really should be longer than just one semester, but he does a good job at funneling the exorbitant amount of information into the student's brain. Also, he showed ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" during the final exam.",1
"Easy way to fill quan requirement. He's a CPA, so he knows what he's talking about, but doesn't teach the class very well. Just reads off of powerpoint, shows out of date videos on Fridays. Easy multiple choice midterm and final, minimal online homework, 15 worksheets due at end of semester. EASY!",1
"Favorite professor in the Chem department. You can tell that she gets excited about what she teaches and that she has a passion for it. She is helpful if you go to see her, but still wants you to try to figure it out yourself. She is very kind and understanding, but straight forward and doesn't sugar coat things. Her tests are very detailed.",1
"I have had Professor Sumi for financial as well as managerial accounting. I am an Automotive major and these were required classes. Sumi is hard for those who do not come to learn, she will not take disrespect but is one of the nicest people out there, she makes me understand accounting through industry related problems. SHE FORCES YOU EARN IT.",1
"Stevens is a solid engineering professor. He has a tendency to speak in a monotone, but he does try to insert some humor into his lectures, and he knows the course content very well. Spend some time getting to know him, and you'll be well rewarded.",1
"DO NOT TAKE her class, her test has nothing to do with lecture. ",0
"Terrible teacher. Gets off topic during lecture, and highly subjective grader. By the end of the semester the teacher did not input at least half of the grades i received in the course, only the final letter grade two weeks after taking the final.",0
Doesn't know how to park at Tim Horton's TOTAL FAUX-PAS!!!,0
His teaching is just terrible. I pay good money for this class just to sit in here and be confused for 2 hours. His accent inhibits him from giving understandable lectures and he gets an attitude when you ask him to repeat himself. DO NOT TAKE HIM. EVER!!!!!,0
Terrible person. lot's of HW. Does not explain the materials.,0
"To be fair, Partovi is very knowledgable and many people really do like him. However, you should expect 100 pages of reading a week, an amount of rudeness, and a final that will consist of writing a 12-15 page historiographical review of the scholarship relating to the topic being taught. Keep in mind that this is a lower-division undergrad class.",0
"Very unclear on expectations and takes forever to grade things. By the time she tells you that you did something incorrectly, you've already turned 2 other assignments in. Acts in person like she is laid back and an easy going instructor but she's not. She's very picky and will pick you apart.",0
"Im surprised I don't see comments about how inappropriate and problematic this professor is. He talks in circles and his lectures become redundant after week two. He uses awful examples in class to explain his points. Most of his examples are centered around race, politics or class. He also likes to talk about sex, how did we get here again? AVOID.",0
"Scott is very smart, but too smart to teach. He just doesn't explain things well or clear. If you are strong in math you'll be fine but if you need things explained I would look for a different professor.",0
"she's the sweetest lady but gives way too much hw, up to 13 assignments each class (2 classes/week). translate and read stories before class. no textbook, she gives you pdfs. only a few quizzes but they're very detailed (sometimes things she never taught) and tricky. she's super nice tho, tries to make class fun so we're not bored. i learned a lot.",1
Li Liu is homework heavy and her class is incredibly boring. It does feel like a chore and attendance is mandatory for a good participation grade in the class. 10/10 would not recommend this class.,0
His lectures are really dull and he is very unclear in what he wants on his essays. He asks many difficult strange questions to the class and expects people to know the answer. I would not recommend. ,0
"Interesting topic, but he makes it boring and even more confusing. Gives no feedback. Assignments are crammed and confusing. Does not help. Assignments will take forever, but only worth a few points. Avoid at all costs.",0
"It is her first year in San Marcos. But man, do not take her class. She is unorganized, all over the place and confusing. ESPECIALLY if you have a job, she makes you go out of your local area for credit. Her test? do not know where the questions come from because there is no textbook or lectures in this class. Waste of my time and money.",0
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! His teaching methods and the readings are simply anti-academical. He will give you give you ridiculous quizzes like, 'learn how to draw a map' (!) You end up spending a lot of time on memorizing insignificant details that you will never again need in your academic life!",0
Online homework and lots of it. Tests have too much material on them gives review for them but they are not very helpful. Class could be easy but she makes it hard.,0
"Don't buy the book; he will give you the notes in class. Three quizzes, midterm, final, 2 pg paper & 5 pg term paper. You will need to memorize certain words for the exam; some concepts are going to be used in subsequent exams. He is really chill & brings snacks when you watch Presumed Innocent in class. Easy A if you study for exams!",1
He is not very nice very insulting and makes rude comments,0
Although he like to put many conceptual questions on tests but definitely worth it taking his course as you will definitely learn something,1
"Somewhat easy English 101 class.  Very sweet lady, very flexible, and willing to help you outside of class.  Lots of time to work on papers and not super difficult.  What hurt my grade was participation so make sure you do the correction/review paper WS.  Greet choice and genuinely wants to teach students and help them to become better writers.",1
"Taking a class with Dr. De Vos is like being held hostage by a narcissist. He only likes to lecture on Freud, Buddhism and himself. Work on the study guide during the lecture and you should do ok.",0
"Very nice professor. Exams cover what is discussed in class. Some group projects, graded somewhat leniently. Very experienced in the health field, I enjoyed her ethics class the most.",1
He's boring and monotone whatever you do DON'T BUY  THE BOOK!!,0
"Like the speed he teaches,  is slow enough so you can understand well. But his class lectures are super long.",1
Makes the lecture fun and interesting. Prepares you for exams and assists with Mikes Bikes. super laid back and here for your success. 10/10 would recommend!,1
Horrible. She is hard to understand and her grading is ridiculous. She has no sympathy and does not care if your not doing good. Barely gives any practice problems. Grades after the curve were still in the 50-60% range. Avoid at all cost.,0
"Bad teacher. very smart and was passionate about science and research but just not good at teaching to students. there were a few presentations and he graded so harshly, couldn't get past a high B no matter how hard I tried on them. Wasn't difficult material but he made it difficult",0
Weeks will go by before you get your graded work back & then w/no clear guidance as to what you did wrong/how to fix it. Syllabus not clear (but in a late graded paper she stated she will not READ anything with more than 200 words). She set up a MTG & didn't even show up on time. She is rude and extremely short when speaking to you. I rate her F+,0
"This professor tries to make sure that you understand the material. However, the homework is harder than it is on the quizzes and he gives either 2 or 1 chances on the homework. As long as you don't skip class too much and you really focus on the lectures and you know the material from calculus I really well, this class is not too bad.",1
"Dude is a legend at PSU. He is super caring and lays everything out for you in Canvas. It takes work to get an A in the class, but it's super easy to pass as long as you do what he tells you. He makes some really funny offhanded comments in class, so watch out for those.",1
Outstanding in class and out,1
"His course is decent and not too difficult but his entire blackboard is super unorganized, making it difficult to follow when certain assignments are due. Hes very particular on grading papers and gives feedback, however what he expects on the papers isnt clear, its confusing and exhausting. I wouldnt take him again.",0
"He's an awesome professor, he's just kinda, the chem professor version of a football coach. He does post his lectures online, but I would suggest being there since sometimes stuff doesn't make it to the online version.",1
"Josh was a really cool teacher, and I enjoyed taking his COMS 131 class. I'm not exceptional at public speaking, but as long as you show up and make your best effort, you'll do fine. The midterm and test final are super easy. Most coms classes offer extra credit for research surveys, so definitely do those.",1
dont take her she thinks this is a history school. fuller was the best bro whatever happened to that guy,0
"Dr. Lyons is a very nice prof, but her lectures were dry. She is extremely intelligent and well spoken, but the lectures were hard to pay attention in. The lectures don't prepare you for what is going to be on the tests. The tests were all MC and written, and there was no way to know what you would be hit with on the written. Not the easiest class.",1
"Professor Drake clearly knows what he is talking about and conveys most of his ideas clearly, I have a few complaints. He spends far too much time referencing things from other courses and works not pertaining to the course, it is easy to get confused if you haven't taken his other courses. He assigns more reading than every class I took combined.",1
He tries to make everything very clear. The papers he picked for the class are worth reading. Learned a lot about the topics.,1
Dr Borglin has extreme difficulty breaking down and building up on important concepts. She jumps from one thing to another without explaining the first one. Her inability to break concepts down and poor organization skills is a major reason why I struggled in this class. I got paid with an A but it was all through my own effort not hers. ,1
"Avoid if possible. Homework is long, boring, and miserable, if you can even figure out what your homework  is. Lectures are repetitive but not horrible. Essays and tests are difficult and tedious. You will read and read and read, and when you are done reading, you get to read even more.",0
"This was honestly one of the hardest classes I have ever taken in my life. His tests are extremely hard, and the Excel chapter of the course was the hardest test ever. All in all he is a great professor. He offers a TON of extra credit, you even get extra credit by participating in class. Just know that you will have to do a ton of outside work.",1
"Do not take this course if you are not extremely, wholeheartedly, 100% passionate about this subject. Dr. Boden pushes his passion on the subject too much, causing for way too much information, homework assignments, and overall workload. All of his assignments can pile up easily if you're not caught up with the class. Watch the lectures and read!!!",0
"Very tough grader and very slow when it comes to getting a grade back from her. Not sure whether or not she should be teaching as she never says anything important. Also, don't skip class it counts against your grade if it wasn't for that I wouldn't attend class.",0
very interesting class and material. weekly quizzes to make sure you read. no attendance policy but she makes sure your grade gets docked when you arent there by having assignments due when there arent quizzes. she is probably my favorite psych professor ,1
"She is horrible. I would not take this professor even if it means waiting a quarter or two for the right professor. She is rude, unhelpful, answers students in a pretentious manner, and seems like she could care less for the students. I genuinely do not like her. ",0
"Okay I took his class Summer of 2019 and can I say he is probably one of the best professors Ive taken. He gives you a quiz every day based on his lectures and notes, and usually theyre take home quizzes. His final is an 8 page paper but he gives you plenty of time to finish. I truly enjoyed his class due to his intriguing lectures and lessons.",1
Worst professor ever. I did not learn a single thing in that class and he was rude! Do not take his class if you want to learn.,0
HARD!! Dont do it. So hard. Thats honestly all. Hard.,0
"His lecture was heavy and did not help my goal to earn from what I've learned in his class. His office hours were a time conflicting with my other class. I asked him to meet at a different time but he refused it. Nothing on the test looked similar to what I've reviewed. Overall, he won't affect me anymore. I will do it better this summer school.",0
"Marks was always willing to answer questions and explain things over again. He's a super understanding and laid back guy, but still a really effective prof. Definitely recommend.",1
Random speeches about nothing. Unclear grading criteria. Lecture has nothing to do with the material. Calls out students randomly.,0
"I'm in professor Hartman's math class and all we do is get on the computer, on this website call Aleks and do work on there. There is so interaction with the class, no blackboard work or powerpoint and no text book. Please do not take this professor class you will be learn nothing at all.",0
Professor Sheehan is simply a very dull teacher. This was probably the most boring class I have ever taken during my college career and I would not recommend it if your looking for a good interactive geologic experience. I really enjoy geology yet this class was brutal to sit through the lectures(Online format). Very easy A though.,0
"I have never, in my life, taken a course I didn't actually learn anything in: until now.  She is extremely misinformed in the world of healthcare.  Of all the non-truths she told our class the best one was that everyone should buy their own malpractice insurance because employers don't provide it.  WHAT? Ultimately - she's just pompous.",0
"I don't know enough about Poole's teaching methods in-person, but online they were really poor. Two lectures split into a mandatory ""active learning session,"" and the other a link to a 10-20 minute long Youtube video. It was very disappointing because the topic of the class was so interesting, but it was difficult to learn with her teaching method.",0
"Really good teacher.  Talks about a lot of unrelated things, but at least it keeps the 2 hour long class interesting.  She is really good when it comes to translations. Highly recommend her.",1
Hes very laid back but irresponsible. He lost my test that I took and made me retake it on my own time. Just frustrating,0
"Dr. Sullivan is a nice person, but just not a good prof. His expectations are too vague, he never responds to emails, and his lectures are incredibly boring. He only grades you by two exams and a four-page paper (and on a HUGE curve). The only reason I took this class is because it was required. I wouldn't take him again.",0
"Biggest gripe is a lot of reading and review for few questions, and those questions are vague and easily mixed up. Retaining 75 pages worth of reading on a very broad topic such as communication, and quiz/test questions are barely about main points or topics. Would not recommend this teacher for this class.",0
"She made my first year at York very easy. She is a very kind person, and a great lecturer. I loved her teaching style. She made a 9 credits course a breeze!  I would recommend taking courses with Dr. Valeo.",1
Dr. Peruyera is by far one of the best professors I've had in Miami-Dade. He is very clear when teaching and gives a lot of life examples that help you with your tests. He truly cares about his students and will go out of his way to help his students succeed in his class. I truly recommend him.,1
"Don't recommend taking her. Reads straight off the power point, doesn't give out study guides, isn't helpful. Your grade is pretty much based off your test grades, if you can pass the tests you won't pass at all.",0
Rombo is a very nice person but a poor teacher. She is very knowledgable but is not very good at explaining the concepts. She gives study guides but be prepared to study 2-3 weeks before an exam because they're not specific or accurate to what she says in class. Her lectures talk in circles sometimes and we spend half of class talking about nothing,0
Alot of busy work but extremely helpful when you have questions! Must study hard and always use to the study guide  for tests if you can!,1
"Great down-to-earth professor. Lectures aren't ""mandatory"", but he uses clickers so you answer questions throughout lecture, however your answers aren't graded based on correct/incorrect, it's simply counted if you particpated or not which counts toward your overall grade. Online weekly quizzes (Easy As). Exams are easy too if you attend lecture.",1
Least organized professor or academic advisor Ive had in my three years at MSU. Would not recommend to anyone. Never responds to emails. Irresponsible and lectures were basically useless in teaching me anything other than whats happening in her life not the course. Truly sad the lack of care she gives in teaching class.,0
"Nice lady, but i didn't think she taught very well when it came to Math. I'm taking her again just because her time slot fits my schedule but i would much rather have someone else that fit my learning style. On the nicer side, math is math so if you dont learn from the teacher, maybe youll learn from a tutor. Best of luck! She's very nice though.",0
"Pretty thick accent, but if you listen, you will learn. You will get a study guide with several essay questions and roughly 20-30 individual identifications. On exam day, you randomly select a paper with one essay and 10 IDs, so make sure you know everything!",1
"It is really easy get A !!! He is a great professor and always helps you. I totally recommend you to take this class with him. If you practice the quizzes and trainings, you will succeed in this class. Im gonna take him again next semester .",1
Interesting class but alot of work. You have a TP and a quiz every week. Content was interesting but there is a lot to do.,1
Best professor around! His philosophy 101 class was my favorite class. Cannot not recommend anyone else but him.,1
"Yells if you ask ?s get confused & ask a question. Wants references but tells you to make info up. Demands you to spend outside money on a suit and counts off even if you can't afford it. Waits until the end of semester to pile on so much work she can't keep up .Never gives feedback, even though that is supposed to help for the next speech/project",0
Very tough grader. She will fail you for very little things such as format. I would not take the class again. There are weekly blog posts and quotes on top of essays and readings. She does offer help outside of class and she does offer extra credit which is good. I would say around half the people dropped her class by the last drop date.,0
"All info is presented and you have 2 months before things are even due. No interaction until something is graded, and she grades on technicalities, not if you even understand the materials. She comes across really pretentious and condescending. Exam questions are based on YouTube videos. Honestly this class is hard to pass and I have a 4.0.",0
Took IDIS304 online. Very straight forward and easy. Not time consuming at all.,1
Professor Bakewell is one of the most positive and motivational teachers at Rhodes. His passion for teaching and the Classical Studies is contagious. He is invested in making sure absolutely everyone in the classroom is on the same page and goes the extra mile to help you feel at pace and comfortable in the class. MUST TAKE PROFESSOR AT RHODES!,1
Dr. King's class was horrible. He literally doesn't lecture about the material but rather posts various documents and makes you hunt for the information you need. Very unclear expectations about what he wants you to learn. When you do ask for clarification in class he hardly ever answers the question and just puts you in groups to figure it out.,0
By far the worst teacher I have ever seen. Always late and constantly making mistakes on the board. Take it with someone else and save your GPA even if it means being a semester behind. ,0
This is probably my favorite class to go to this semester. I did not enjoy calc at all in high school but she makes everything so easy to understand. She is very knowledgeable and cares about creating relationships with students. She explains things clearly and will take the time to go over any questions that we have. Love taking her class!,1
"Claudine was a wonderful instructor! She gives clear expectations, is easy to communicate with, and genuinely cares about her students. She loves mental health and it's easy to see. You'd be lucky to have her!",1
"Mme Anthony is an amazing teacher! Yes, she makes you work for your grade, but with that being said, she genuinely wants her students to learn and to succeed. She is very organized and clear in what she expects from you. Her assignments are interesting and enjoyable; I would take this class again!",1
"How this woman teaches is beyond me. Knows the material but is completely useless attempting to convey the knowledge to students. Reads off slides (info directly from book; created by TA) entire class. Takes attendance. Homework is meaningless so long as you make an attempt as she doesn't check it. Do the HW, know review sheet, get a good grade.",0
"Sullivan is a great professor to learn from. He has had first hand experience in the field, and can provide great insight on his lectures. ",1
"he is not very good at explaining the material.  gives chances to ask questions, but takes the whole class time to try to explain, and you still leave confused.  he does assign homework, he will check it all before the test.  doesn't grade for right or wrong answers. if you take this class be ready to learn on your own.",0
"Stunning and electrifying lectures. Very easy tests if you show up and take mild notes. Very interesting, understanding, and generally cool guy. Don't make the mistake of taking a different professor. He is the best.",1
very difficult for a 100 level class..he tells you too much material to study for the tests so its hard to know what to focus on..he says test will be on chapters 1 to 5 but then there is only 7 short essay/questions on the test..he also does not care about his students succeeding or not..if all you need it for is a gen ed..go somewhere else,0
Great teacher and cares about his students. Does not give extra credit but gives you clear instructions on what he wants to see in the essays you must write.,1
Daigle's microeconomics class was very difficult for me. He's not a good lecturer. He mumbles a lot and doesn't want to explain things to you when you ask him about them. He is quite sexist also. His tests are very hard and even with a curve applied. I got a's and b's in every class but his.,0
I took his ESOL level 3 class for my writing and reading. The lectures was amazing. It was easy to understand what he talked about. My writing skill was improved a lot thanks to him. I strongly recommend this professor for all students,1
He is the best Math professor iv known so far.,1
Dr. Bulinski is very smart and cares about her students. Her lectures are fun and she's very engaging. We went on field trips that were very fun as well. She's a great professor and easy to work with outside of class too,1
Great teacher. Really thoughtful! Encourages students to do best work but also very patient with learning process. Has a linguistics background which helps A LOT to understand the language. Highly recommended!,1
"This guy's pretty boring and isn't very good at teaching. He flies through chapters but highlights what's going to be on the final for the most part. If you want to do well, you're gonna have to study a lot on your own. The textbook is your best friend but he definitely isn't!",0
One of my favourite professors of the program. Very knowledgeable and interactive.  A highly recommended prof.,1
"he doesn't care he put resp. on his TAs.  TAs are not helpful. He is unorganized.  His lec. notes don't have title and are bad hand writing.  The TAs were not helpful to answer the questions and hehimself does,t care to listen.  At last some TAs curved and some didn't.  If you don't have to don't take this class. It lowers your grades and takes tim",0
"awful professor. if you are not white, heterosexual, and Christian please don't take this class. she will completely ignore the book and give you information based on her personal views. I've almost had to get up and walk out of class based on her remarks. class time is spent expressing hate and no actual learning. please do not take this class.",0
DO NOT TAKE THIS TEACHER IN THE SUMMER. Dr. Irvin Lawrence does not care about his students. He ignores email and confuses people on when things are due. This professor gives at least 4-5 assignments that are due every night by 11:59pm. If you want your life to be consumed by a class by all means. I do not recommend taking his class online.,0
"Mrs. Johnson is my absolute favorite professor so far! She is kind, fair and charismatic! Her tests are pretty long, but the class itself is so interesting! Amazing professor all around! I strongly recommend her to anyone, especially anyone interested in social work. ",1
"Llaneza is a nice person.  There is no doubt that he is a kind individual.  But his instructions are hard to follow sometimes.  He expects you to read a lot, too.  If you hate to read, I would not take this prof. if possible.  His tests have questions that really come from nowhere, too.  The labs are helpful.  Only take if req. by major, I say.",1
"Professor Lusk is amazing. If you have to take psych, take her. She is so funny and she understands that students have families, jobs, and other commitments that interfere with school. Very understanding. No quizzes, only a few tests and projects that aren't hard if you read the book. Great educator! ",1
Teaching the old fashioned way. Gives you lots of foreground for your studies and still makes it challenging.,1
"He told us on the 1st day of class that he was lazy. What kind of a teacher tells you that. He gets mad when the class did not get what he was teaching, and he even used very BAD words in class. NOT COOL!",0
"I've taken all of his music courses, and he's my thesis advisor, so I'm a little biased.  However, he's amazingly knowledgeable about nearly any topic you can think to talk about, he's clear and informative, and very helpful and friendly.  He loves his work, too, which is very important.",1
Didn't learn much. Wasted time about out class topics.,0
You use the textbook a lot! Teacher does not put in as much effort as the students. Teacher uses the excuse of forgetting to grade assignments or is busy. The syllabus is outdated along with written assignment requirements. It is the last week of the semester and this class is still waiting for feedback on their final assignment.,0
"Great class. Very sweet guy. He wants everyone to succeed. Lectures can be boring, but sometimes he is funny. Take his class.",1
"He can fall behind pretty easily. He has changed test dates and assignment dates time and time again. His webpage for assignments is outdated, which has caused confusion for us. He is very knowledgeable on the subject however.",0
"Dr. Vohs is a great professor. His lessons are clear, to the point and prepare students for his tests. Don't expect to just slide by without doing any work, but if you so much as show up for class and pay attention the class will not be too much of a struggle. Tests are cumulative.",1
"He gives way too much work for his class, is a very hard grader, gave two midterms, ended up with a crappy grade. Equivalent effort would have resulted in passing two other courses with an A+.",0
Awful grader. Even if you got every answer right she can still take points off  for millions of reasons. She made a lot of mistakes in class but she wants you to be accurate as a machine in the meantime. In order to get a perfect score you have to split hairs on every question even if it has nothing to do with math.,0
"He expects way to much from his students, doesn't give us guidelines of the course and whats expected of us. He's tries to be funny and mean (which he is) but then in turn it makes students scared to ask questions, then he gets mad and yells at us that we arent asking questions. Buddy curved our midterm form 23% to 46% ... he will give everyone F's",0
Dr. Harris was an amazing professor! He makes the lectures more interesting and the iClicker questions were a lot of helpful in the class. All of the work in the class was online that way it will make things much easier and more time to work on your other classes and still pass the class.,1
"The class should be easy if you study with a group. He might be good at teaching CS, but he is terrible at teaching math. He consistently misuses definitions and gives handwavey solutions and proofs. If you ask him questions in office hours, he sometimes gives you the wrong answer, so beware. Easy pass, but don't expect to learn rigorous math.",0
"never on time, frequently misses classes, not helpful, very angry person, at times she is irrational",0
"This class is easy, just speak up during lectures, online quizzes are easy, essay is easy, you need to prepare for exams but they are not super hard.",1
"Had a bit of a problem with this professor,  I am slated to walk across the stage and get my diploma in 5 days, and the man still has not graded any of our assignments....  I will give credit where it is due, he is very knowledgeable, and intelligent.  But a poor teacher, he slacks very hard and just curves the final exam and passes people.",0
"good teacher, helpful dept head",1
"This guy is the most dry, boring professor I have ever had. He makes me dread going to a class that is supposed to be more interactive and hands on. He has 0 personality and speaks with the same monotone voice the whole hour and a half. Zzzzzz...",0
"Like below, nice person, god awful teacher. Although she is willing to help when needed, she's not clear on anything during class. The subject is hard enough. The first test she gave a sheet of about 200 anatomy terms to know and about 30 were on the test, its like that for every test. Waste of time studying and guessing whats on test. FRUSTRATING",0
"He is very knowledgeable about film, interesting, and funny. This is my second time taking him and i would take him again if i could. I would take him and film criticism over burns and film history any day. He wants you to read the textbook but if you take good notes it's not necessary. This is a great class for electronic media majors =]",1
nice pro,1
"She is an awesome teacher. Designs her class without tests. Just makes sure youre always present and have the notes done. All her class is on is discussions of the chapters. She calls on you and expects you to answer and if not then you get a zero. Shes super nice, but i hope you like to talk.",1
"This man is absolute trash and just always makes things horrible. He doesn't upload his work on time, gets angry at you for doing the work, doesn't care about what he's teaching, and is so self-absorbed and rude. If you have his class drop it and get someone else. Trust me I thought it wouldn't be that bad but he is the WORST.",0
"Don't listen to the person who rated her a 4.0. Thats a good one, lol. If you really want to know how she is, she will grade you on stuff that contradicts what her rubric says.",0
Interesting guy with good lectures and a good sense of humor.,1
His lecture is so boring but his tests are pretty easy. I just study at home on my own and get A+.  I would say that take his course if you want to raise your GPA.,0
Hard to understand thru his heavy accent! Very difficult.  Had to drop the class halfway thru.  :(,1
"Super nice guy, but not super good at explaining things. Always does a vote before class for lecture or for problems... PICK PROBLEMS! All the tests are on actual problem solving and not generic concepts. Constantly practice them. Practice assignments greatly bring up your grade. They're weighted more than the tests I swear.",1
"Takes a long time to grade assignments. Very vague prompts for assignments and discussions. Doesn't seem to actually be aware of what is required for the course. Really wants use of references for homework, even though questions come straight from the textbook, will mark off points if not used. Overall, the class is easy so its bearable.",0
"Would ask questions in class/during test and he would say ""I didn't write the powerpoint"" or ""didn't write the test"". Skips through powerpoints all the time. He just doesn't teach well. Obsessed with teaching JMP software but you can't use it for tests?? Nice guy but not a good teacher. AP Stat is only reason I understand the class",0
My 2nd class with him (first was 252).  Very tough grader but delivers the goods every time. Take anything neuro from him if you can.,1
"In lectures he tells you exactly what you need to know. There are quizzes after every chapter, they're easy. Then the test are exactly what he teaches. He post that problems to do in the book to if you want to review for the test. Barely gives homework and extra credit. Go to class, take notes and you'll be good. Would take him again if I could.",1
"Spends a majority of the class ranting on about his own personal opinions and beliefs, has ZERO written explanations on how to do well in his class, will grade poorly for doing anything outside of what he demands but wont tell you all his demands, insulted every member of class no matter skill with no instruction on how to do better. Condescending.",0
Professor Crowley is really good. Only those students that say she doesn't teach obviously don't go to class and or don't pay attention and try to focus on their phones. She's got tons of field experience actually doing mental health counseling. She just doesn't lecture theories she's lived it. Very good class!,1
"Terrible teaching ability, nice guy, but the class was a huge frustration, I learned little and there is no lecture just presentations, he needs more organization and teaching ability, he thought he was making the class easy but was making it more difficult.",0
"This was a terribly easy class. All of the exams were open book and really, that gave no incentive to actually learn any of the material. Ultimately, this class is what you make of it. If you really have the time to learn the material, go ahead! If you already have a heavy schedule, you can still very easily get an A with literally no effort.",1
"She doesn't reply to emails, when she does it takes days for a reply. Instructions are sometimes unclear, a lot of confused students in the class. She makes you do this practice quiz thing weekly, it is sometimes over 150 questions. Then there are actual quizzes. There is also a weekly forum. Nonetheless, if you do your work you will get an A.",0
"Mr. P was AWESOME! This was my first time taking an online class, and I thought it was going to be a nightmare. Piluso is a really cool and down-to-earth professor who is willing to work with his students to ensure their success. The assignments are easy yet thought-provoking. His only goal is to help you think and expand your reasoning and views.",1
"I loved his class! Great lectures, easy assignments. The tests were online, open book and open notes. If you listen to the lectures, and read the chapters, the exams are an easy-A! He gives extra credit to replace your lowest exam score, and the online discussion board is a grade booster. My class loved him, if you are in college to learn take him.",1
"Excellent blend of lectures, reading, templates and industry professional guests. He is very helpful and provides excellent templates for budgets and schedules. It's sometimes unclear how to get to the data you fill in to the templates but he will help you! Group projects may drag you down in grade or make extra work if your team is lame. Good guy!",1
"Surprised to see that Bernadette gets low ratings! She was responsive and easy to understand. I took this class online. Once a week there were clear assignments and an exam. This class was a late start class, so it is a lot of information in a short amount of time, but I earned an A grade by completing all assignments and using the text.",1
If you like to read A LOT and be bored and confused. Take this class... I love Philosophy but she gives us complicated readings and even though she goes over it in class it's confusing and SO boring... Hardly anyone comes to class either. Shes a nice lady though? =/,0
"This was the first semester she was trying out a new pass/fail grading system (spec grading) and she provided plenty of information in the syllabus/articles/in class on how she was grading. It overall made it easier to get the grade you wanted, however, she wanted the hw/projects to be near perfect to pass which could be frustrating",1
Had a 79% and she wouldn't give me the B-.She's a critic of everything you write.Very intimidating.One of those type of professors that you wish you never had.Unfriendly.Just plain simple t-e-r-r-i-b-l-e.,0
If you want a easy A take this class. No lockdown browser. All test and quizzes on canvas. 3 test 4 quizzes per test. Easy class pick this professor,1
"Tanoukhi is hands down the most amazing professor I've had. She is extremely philosophical, but that helped change the way I approach literature. She is the most intelligent professor I've ever seen, and her lectures are never boring. I may be biased, but don't listen to the negative reviews. Take a class with her. If you work, you won't regret it!",1
nice person. frustrating methods of teaching and returning graded work. one hand in assignment and quiz a week that is all for points. haven't gotten most stuff back. tries to be nice to students when they don't understand but really just embarrasses them. take shaw instead.,0
I was a Paralegal Studies major when I took Dr. B's class and the way he taught got me interested in history. He's the reason I changed my major. Taking another of his classes and will take more. He is an amazing font of knowledge. It flows freely. He answers all my email immediately and is so much fun. He makes history a joy. We need more like him,1
Peggy is passionate about what she teaches and encourages classroom participation.  This helped me learn the material quickly and how it can be applied in 'real life'.  I love her style.,1
"Shes definitely not the most organized or on top of things (which is fair given how busy she is) but her class is very interesting. She has great experience in public health and her lectures are interesting. She wants you to learn and is very straight up with her expectations. If you reach out about an extension or extra credit, she is willing.",1
always available for extra help and she is a great motivator,1
so glad she isn't teaching statistics anymore...,0
"Funny teacher, if you go to class and pay attention, it shouldn't be hard. If you are shy or quiet or late, be warned... she will tease you in front of the whole class.",1
"Sam was the best professor I had in my first semester of college and I wasn't even that interested in the Linguistics department. I'm a film major, but Sam's energy and passion about the topic made it much more interesting to learn about and go into more depth. Would love to take another class with him",1
Worst teacher I have ever had in my whole life. I tried so hard and went to ever class plus his office. He didn't help me at all. I passed the class but didn't know anything. I am now having a rough time in my later classes. I would never take him EVER!,0
"Yonn's lectures were interesting and I liked that he was open to debates and questions. He's funny and was easy to talk to. But, this class was hard because he expects you to already know about sustainability and other SUD stuff. He also never tells anyone what their grades are, and leaves you find out at the end of the quarter.",1
"Meyers cemented my choice to be an English major. She is incredibly insightful and cares to learn about contemporary opinions regarding the aged works we cover. The midterms and papers are straightforward and we are prepared adequately for them. Don't miss any readings, take good notes and you'll get the A. Best professor for the material!!!",1
"This professor spews his personal political beliefs and shuts down any students who has a differing opinion. By the end of the term no one would participate in class discussions because he made people feel their opinions were wrong and called them racists, and HIS opinions got more and more strident in favor of nationalism.",0
"She's extremely kind, outgoing, and inspirational.  She is very passionate about her field and is always more than happy to help. Literally one of the best professors i have ever had. The one critique i would have is that she can wait to put things off until the last minute.But if you point this out to her, she will fix her time schedule.",1
Overall I enjoyed this class.,1
This class is ok but make sure your passing those test! cause if you don't you would probably fail. I think that her 5 step plan doesn't make any sense.,0
"Reads directly from the slides, few relevant examples, too many assignments",0
"Matt Rand  is an amazing professor. His lectures include powerpoints and a bevy of different things to entice students. He is always willing to answer even the most outlandish question. His major works deal with animals so expect connections, but they will be class orientated. I would love to take a class by him again.",1
"While he may have +40 years of math experience, his teaching style is if he says it you should understand it.  Further, if you ask questions his answers will include a hint of you learned this in an earlier math class. He goes really fast. In class assignments are developed by him with errors and his problems don't lineup with the textbook.",0
"Dr. Arevalo can neither teach nor speak English sufficiently to make herself understood.  She spends most of class mentioning most of what we will talk about, then rushes through what the students need to have explained to them.  Her tests do not reflect the information she teaches and are worded poorly as she does not have control of English.",0
"I was nervous going into Behavior Stats or PSYC 258 at Miramar College. Never had a solid foundation in mathematic, however Professor Lawson does his best to give everyone a shot at moving forward from PSYC 258. You will have to do your reading on the Chps. however he gives you in depth info on what to expect on the test and reviews every chapter!",1
"I took it online but ended up dropping her because I just couldn't take it anymore. There are three exams and 5 HW. A ridiculous long project plus you have to do peer feedback for EVERYTHING. All material comes from the book. Meaning she hardly contributes anything original, even the powerpoints come straight from the book. Lame and boring.",0
"Ms. Moody is a great professor and really does care about her students. She just wants to see you succeed, so come into class with a positive attitude. The A is literally spoon fed to you as long as you come to class, follow directions on all assignments, and do your cultural events well ahead of time. Lastly, she teachers this class for free!",1
This was the best online instructor Ive had to date. Mr Hebert is always available and answers questions no matter what time of day. I would recommend this teacher for all online classes.,1
She was helpful but she made the class too hard. Has been known to yell at students and make them feel stupid! Sweet outside of class! Just a hard language and a hard class. I dropped it and took sign language (recommened),0
"Gives back hw months later and its all 50% bc he wants a specific way and never tells you or shows you. Exams are open book but you can get points taken off every little thing (lines, misspelling, conversion). Very old school and hard to get to because he has a hour long wait in his office because he cant communicate with students. miserable exp",0
Slides are all over the place. to study you need to read which is a pain because his notes jump from chapter 1 to 14 without even clarifying. doesnt help at all when asked. dont recommend taking him,0
"Dr. Hinton is funny and kind and always keeps the class hyped but she messed up my grades and I kept checking them but she didnt put them in until after grades were due and I was supposed to end up with a 89 B but somehow I ended up with a C on my transcript. If youre going to take her class, CHECK YOUR GRADES WITH HER TO SEE IF THEY ARE CORRECT",1
"Bude is probably the worst person to be in charge of a whole major. Her directions are very unclear and she clearly does not know what she is doing . Her work is all OVER the place. She came in to our SL to introduce a paper, she came in with parts of her power point missing so she edited while teaching. Also her English is TERRIBLE, she needs help",0
"After a hard exam 1, he made some fair changes to other exams and the final. With any PHYS class, you can't just do the bare minimum and expect to do well. He provides ample practice exam questions and Q&A sessions, although I didn't utilize the Q&A much. Do well in studio, study the mistakes you make in solving problems, and you should be fine.",1
I will never pick this teacher again. Makes things more difficult than they really are. Places doubt in students instead of encouraging them. Adds more stress to lesson plan than there should be.,0
"Dr. Carter has been through a lot this semester and he still came to all our classes with a smile and was always prepared to discuss the readings even when people didn't read, and he always showed understanding for what students are going through. He is such a committed teacher and kind person. The class ha a lot of reading but the papers are easy.",1
"Ken is a fair teacher. He is very clear with his expectations. There are quizzes on a chapter reading each class, but it's usually common sense even if you don't read (not that I would recommend that). His lectures are a little basic, especially if you've freelanced before, but he offers good insight and is available for help. Easy A!",1
Colleen was AWESOME! .... I still remember the Philosphy discussions.,1
"Great class! Everything applies to your everyday life! There were lots of assignment and quizzes, but most only took 15-30 minutes, so really no too hard at all.",1
"I could see how some people might dislike his style but he suited me fine, very encouraging to students who have difficulty vocalizing in class, never high-handed about attendance or work, very up-front about expectations and very relaxed in most other respects. Should've taken more classes with him and Harlan",1
"Horrible professor. Took him for Fall 2019 Understanding Peace and Conflict. Do not take this lightly, do not take him. He is a good teacher but he grades your tests (all of your grades are tests) like you're supposed to be in a doctoral program for peace and conflict studies. DO NOT TAKE!",0
chances of passing depends on how many lectures you show up/pay attention to. exams aren't too difficult. get ready for in-class discussions with random people.,1
"Ok, I am an IT major.  I am taking CIS at the same time as PPS and what I am learning NOW in PPS, I had to teach MYSELF for the beginning of the year for CIS. A great Professor tho. I know him a little better because he stops by Laptop Central often.",1
"It's always nice when you get a teacher who is obviously experienced in their field outside of teaching, and professor Dudley is that. The only negative that I've experienced in class is that labs usually have a long block of explanation that is only done because not everyone in the class reads the directions beforehand. The dissections are smelly!",1
"i'm sure i would be more engaged in the class if there was a child in my life and i had a vested interest to pay attention. the class felt disorganized, crowley just took her notes and wrote them on the board. low discussion/interaction in class, so it's very easy to fall asleep in. 3 tests, 1 essay. take for reqs, not to learn c&a dev.",0
Her class starts with meditation and ends in fulfillment. She inspires you to read and ensures your participation through online and in-class activities. Her projects prepare you for upcoming challenges. The 5K you pay for her class is easily worth 50K in uni itself and over 500K in career. Money can't buy you a better class and a greater mentor.,1
She is very straightforward with what you need to know. Just study for the exams and attend all the lectures.,1
"This was my third time have Professor Williams. I knew what to expect in his class. SF 341 was my favorite class. I recommend it. You learn about Airport Management, Airport Security, Airport Safety, Airport Inspections, How to run the Airport, and most importantly keep the Airport Safe. If you take this class, study! study!! study!!! Always helps!",1
Prof. Rich was the most down to earth professor at York I've met so far. Very approachable. Very funny. Lectures are fun to attend and material is presented and taught in an engaging way. A grade of 'A' is achievable through use of textbook for exams--READ WHAT SHE TELLS YOU TO. Lectures will also be on the in-class tests.,1
"One of the most useful classes that I have taken for my major. Gives a great overview of everything you need to know about HR, very interactive lectures. Quizzes/tests aren't bad, straight out of the book. Other assignments include mock interviews (very helpful IMO) and a career assessment. Loved her, she was an awesome professor, would take again!",1
"My GPA was a 4.0 until this class. This woman is ridiculous! I received a F for my milestone 3 for my final project. She said I needed to use parenthetical references which I used 8! One solution for bullying I used for the anti-bullying campaign and she said it doesn't tie in! Um, what?! If you are unlucky enough to get her, change that course!!!",0
"He's a great teacher.  Very laid back and easy going.  He gives pop quizzes every now and then, but they aren't really a surprise because if he gives you a reading the class before you can count on maybe taking a pop quiz. Even then there's a 50% chance you want have to take it because he makes you roll a die to see.",1
"Kim excels at teaching the subject matter in an efficient, yet introspective manner, making him pretty inspirational. He is also extremely understanding of other student's circumstances, especially considering 2020. Ask, and you shall receive. While quite serious most of the time, he's got rare moments of humor that nobody sees coming. real legend.",1
Took Art Appreciation Summer 07-Loved it!!  Very interesting -Excellent Professor.  Would highly recommend Professor Manley for this class.,1
"Super hard to get help on anything. When I reached out for help because I was confused, she ignored the request. She makes you do all the work when there is a technical issue.",0
"Professor Lee is a great instructor, she teaches well to where the students understand. she gives extra credit assignments to help improve grades. Which helps students that are struggling.I do wish she was available to tutor outside of class it would be helpful because her style of teaching is understanding but some students need extra attention.",1
"Such a cool, interesting, and fun class! One of the best and most intelligent professors I have ever had. You have to learn a lot to get a good grade but her lectures are so great that it makes learning and processing the material really easy since she teaches it so well!",1
"Terrible prof. I think she felt embarrassed after she gave me a c- on a paper when I told her all my other 3rd & 4th yr eng profs have given me A's. She also gives multiple choice tests. This is a joke. If you value how other msvu eng profs teach, stay away.",0
"Horrible experience for Summer Online. Switch to Canvas made everything haywire, but she's really disorganized and seldom emails back. I basically taught myself English 5 with help from LRC English tutors. People in discussions would knock people's writing and it got really ugly and miserable due to total lack of oversight by the teacher.",0
"I had Tucker of 101, 102, and Brit Lit. She's an average teacher. Kinda mean but just go to class and pay attention. Her tests are kinda hard. She's very liberal. Kinda boring sometimes.",1
"She is one of the best instructors I've had! I highly recommend taking her class!! Her class is interesting and very educational, I learned so much about communication. She cares about students and always gives great feedback. We had small group conversations and then shared with the class, so we got pretty close with each other.",1
"Don't expect any of your papers graded and have feedback provided; It takes her about 2 weeks to grade things and by that time you'll of already had another 3 essays due. Its absolutely frustrating, on a regular assignment you'll be waiting to get you're grades back for about 5 other things. Avoid if possible.",0
"Do all the readngs, be on time, and participate.",1
"ECE 241 is an intro class for Computer Engineering.  Meaning that nobody knows anything about computers in general.  From the first day, Dwight spoke to us as if we already knew everything we needed to know about Computer Engineering.  That put us in mass confusion.  Not to mention that the labs took three weeks to grade.",0
"Unfortunately, this is just a terribly made class that has seen little improvement in the years that it has been offered. McEntie isn't a bad instructor, but his lectures are boring and lots of filter talk. The textbook is not extremely helpful either. I wished they could use articles online since that has helped me much more. Hard class for a 100.",0
"Her exams were pretty difficult, but she's a really good lecturer and a really fun and helpful person in general. She also gives some pretty good extra credit. I took her class during covid, so i don't know if this is usually the case, but i didn't find the textbook very helpful. Usually all the stuff you need is in her lectures.",1
"She's very amusing, knowledgable, and overall just a great teacher. ",1
"He has life/work experience that applies very well to the class content! Encourages discussions and questions, which makes the class engaged altogether. The workload for this course is very reasonable so if you're a full-time student and/or working at a job, don't be strayed away! This class is THE BEST, the professor could not get any better.",1
Tom is by far the best teacher I had at UNL. He cares about your future and the class has helped me prepare for my career. Definitely try to meet within at least once throughout the semester as he is very knowledgeable and can help you with almost anything. Very inspirational class.,1
"The class is out of 100 total points. There is basically a paper due every other week. You end up reading the entire book, page for page. By the the hardest class I have ever taken. If you miss an assignment you are screwed. If you can take this class with another professor, do it.",0
"The ""professor"" was absolutely terrible. Nothing but simplified lecture straight from a power point. When asked anything, her only response was to look through the power-point. When asked if she could demonstrate the MMC, she replied I don't know what that is"". One project toward the end of the year accounted for a large majority of our grade. F-",0
He is a nice guy but he is SO BORING! I feel like stabbing myself cause he's that boring! I was so excited to take Hinduism but all he talks about is Buddhism! He doesn't use the textbook at all. His test and quizzes are easy. Do NOT take him if you want to learn about Hinduism cause you won't! DO take him if you want a good grade for credit hours!,0
He's horrible. He's hard to understand and when you ask for help he just shoo's you away. He's all over the place during lecture and the problems are always unfinished.,0
She was very clear with the material and is an easy A or B if you just go to class do the homeworks. ,1
I took her class online and she took forever to get back to me for any question. The tests are unnecessarily difficult and so much information was poured down our throats for no reason because a lot of the information was not on the test. Would never take again.,0
Do NOT take his class unless you are looking to be stressed and fail. I am a hardworking student and complete all my assignments yet that doesn't seem to matter. He yells at you or makes a sarcastic remark if you ask a question even when you go to his office hours he makes you feel dumb too. Just do yourself a favor and don't take him!!,0
I would not recommend taking an upper level class with him. He changed the grading scale in the middle of the semester leaving many students in a very bad situation. And he goes over the material way too fast and his exams were extremely though. So were his HW's. Gets very offended if a solutions manual is consulted for help on homework problems.,0
"hard teacher, looooong powerpoint lectures guys a genius so i guess it just comes to him while the students blankly stare at his examples as he zooms through them. one midterm and a final. tough class make sure youre a math wiz and quick learner",0
"He explains everything in a way students can understand, but requires class participation also. The written assignments (there were 10 of them) are extremely difficult.  It is totally possible to receive an A in the class, but you're going to have to work hard for it. I learned so much in his class and would take him again in a heartbeat.",1
"Professor Lang is very down to Earth. He is helpful and also makes ""earth"" jokes throughout his lectures to keep students interested. He has his own lecture notes that he goes by rather than the textbook. He gives study guides to help prepare students for his exams and pass them. He also gives extra credit throughout the semester. Great Professor!",1
"DJB is kind, welcoming to questions, and gives great examples. Beware of cold-calling. She told funny stories about her husband relating to accounting. She really knew her stuff. She recognized me outside of class despite me only going online and said hi. Tests are hard but doable. Do not underestimate them - they are much harder than homeworks.",1
alright,0
Always willing to work with you to help reach your goal for the class. Super laid back & he can make the class enjoyable at times.,1
Omg!I have lots of things to say here!He is the worst class ever in my life!It was horrible!He is very unfair and he expects his students to be professional!He is not helpful and his explanation is difficult to understand!He should know how easy other lab class was at least!It is very unfair!I really hated this class!he is hard grader. Very bad!,0
"IONASCU CARES ABOUT HER STUDENTS SO MUCH. Honestly, she really invests in us and is willing to go the extra mile. She's a solid teacher, and you will not have to read the textbook if you pay attention in lecture. Homework is online and fairly light, and her tests are straightforward and only cover material from lecture. Take this professor!",1
Dr. A is a good teacher. He is dogmatic about some things that seem trivial.,1
Professor Abdo is very passionate about her work and it shows in the feedback she provides her students. She never leaves her students in the dark and when she says she'll do something she does it. In this class you get what you give.,1
"Very, very hard class. Prater expects a lot out of you. You will learn more in her accounting class than any other teacher. You have intense homework assignments but they will prepare you for the exams. There are a lot of opportunities to bring your grade up with in class assignments.",1
"La Profesora Fletcher, I can't say enough nice things about her. She has a great sense of humor and is an extremely talented teacher. She is also very helpful and cares a lot about her students. Spanish is easier for some and harder for others, but if you do your HW you will earn an A. Take her class!!",1
"so boring... the only teacher I ever had who made us buy a book he wrote.  prof really comes off as a hack... many students slept in class, and he let 1-2 kids dominate discussions (pushing their agendas).  Really not worth taking",0
"Uchida was one of the best teachers I've had at BSU. She teaches in a way that complements every learner's capabilities and was very open to questions all semester. When I needed help, she was there to tutor me and my classmates. I can honestly say that I would look forward to her classes everyday and know that I would learn something and get it.",1
She sucks a lot. Do not take this class she cannot teach and is confusing. Be careful as she expects u to write like u were in college for years.,0
"His grading and homework is straight forward, but its gets boring often. ",0
"He's super passionnate about what he does and he cares a lot about his students, just make sure you pay attention in class!",1
"Worst professor I have ever had, do not take her course. She added no value to the course and I was required to teach myself the material. Some constructive feedback for her, spending the entire class going through problems without any lectures over the necessary concepts is not helpful and only causes confusion. Please add lectures to your courses",0
"Unbelievably rude and unapproachable professor. Claims he wants to quit his job because his averages are so low.. but doesn't try to change his methods. 10 people dropped his class in the first three weeks. Makes unnecessary rude comments about not caring if you fail. Also, he only knows how to answers questions and does NOT have a proper lecture.",0
"I like Coop as a person, but his lectures leave a lot to be desired. As an engineering student, I don't really care about the theory behind the math, I want to know how to do the problem and he wasn't very effective for that. Overall, wouldn't take him again.",0
Dr. Meehan is one of the greatest professors I have ever had. I took History and Systems with her and she makes it extremely easy to do well as long as you carry your weight. She is understanding and if you are having a problem you just need to talk to her and she will help you. She makes it easy to pay attention and provides everything you need.,1
Best english teacher in ASU.,1
"Prof. Zaitsev is excellent. He is very knowledgeable and always answer your questions. He explain with details and with good examples, but in order to pass you have to pay attention in class, and read the material. The tests are multiple choice but you definitely have to read. His classes are amaizing and fun. You will learn a lot.",1
Mr. Tyson carries an extremely boring classroom. His prezies are not helpful at all. You need to be ready to put in effort outside of class by reading the textbook and interpreting it. Tests are tough and the questions are weirdly worded. Probably the hardest course I have taken at Missouri State.,0
Awesome teacher!! Professor Gordon does a great job of making sure everyone understands the material. She's funny and keeps class entertaining. Would definitely take her class again!,1
You will lose your mind if you know zip about computing science or programming and attend his lectures. Prepare to study a lot outside of class to understand the material.,0
"I would say he was a good professor, he tried his best. We had many tech problems but he was not to blame. There were just 3 exams and no finals. He did offer EC bc the students asked for it. The exam are not to bad if you study and watch his lecture notes with reading the textbook. exam was taken through casa",1
"Horrible?Too tough?There's a hellofa workload but rise to the challenge& you'll increase your asl skills& learn more about Deaf culture. Isn't that the point? Her criticism is constructive, and she knows what she's talking about. Put your pride aside, cause you don't sign perfectly and it gets a lot harder from here. Be an adult&you'll be fine",1
"This is a very easy class, but her workload is just way too ridiculous. I wouldnt take this class unless you prefer lots of practice and long homework assignments. Taking it with her was my second time taking it, and ended with worse grade than i did than the first time.",1
"I failed to see any practical value in having us ""simulate"" the activities we could use with our students, most of which revolved around the Consumer Gaze, which I do not use because I find it to be very high school and not exactly intellectual. Also felt Wendy had pre-packaged responses to any comment, so challenging her is out of the question.",0
"Professor Brown is amazing!! The workload is heavy but his lectures are so informative & you can really tell he knows his stuff, so even though there's a lot, I respect it. He's been really forgiving about grading during COVID. He even made us an all-black artist playlist in honor of BLM. I'd recommend him to anyone. You'll learn a lot from him.",1
"If you enjoy being tested on material not covered in class, go ahead and take this class.  I don't so I dropped it.  Worst teacher I've ever had, if you see this mans name, get as far away from it as possible.",0
when students were dealing with bad wifi or other issues she would laugh in disbelief and thought it was convenient but when she would have technical difficulties it was all okay.. How is she a dean if she doesn't empathize and holds you accountable for problems out of your control?.. I would not take one of her classes again,0
Our semester completely fell apart due to COVID. How do you reach a professor who never responds and is never on campus? Dr. Wigginton does not respond to emails or voicemails. Her expectations are unclear and she enjoys taking points off for reasons not provided in advance. Just plain rude.,0
"As a person, Hoffman is the best guy out there, but as a professor he is just extremely hard. Lectures are easy to understand, but his exams are no where close to his practice problems. No extra credit, no homework points. He solely grades you on your exam grades. 6 exams in total and your grade is based on total points you receive.",0
"Started on Ch. 9 on the first day in a difficult subject for first-level math (complicated statistics). No intro, nothing. Horrible, said on first day she didn't care if we ever got sick and to not ""bother"" her with emails. Withdrew within the second week. Waste of time",0
I was in a class of 20 people and only 8 showed up everyday. I missed some classes but completed all of my work and when I went to turn it in she told me to just not finish out the class and stop coming. She refused to pass me even though I did all of the work! She is too tough of a grader and you never know what she wants from you.,0
"Sara's class is one that should be taken with caution. Don't let her humorous attitude fool you into thinking you're going to get an A with ease. She will push you to be your best but at the same time will expect you to have a professional (and ""perfect"" ) approach to everything. Utilize your time wisely and be prepared for a rigorous work load.",0
"Don't get me wrong this class is not hard at all. If you do all the chapter reviews, online quizzes and papers you will get an A in the class. The midterm and final is easy. I never went to class because the professor was mono tone and not engaging at all.",0
Prof. Kim decided to make it so that the only way to view his lectures was to see them live. If you are an international student do not take this class due to time zone problems. If you are a domestic student still avoid him because his refusal to upload is a clear sign of being an egomaniac who demands your presence to pad his fragile educator ego,0
"By far one of the worst and rudest profs that I have ever taken. Does not keep office hours appointments and is very condescending to anyone who isn't a scholar in calculus. Lots of homework and grading on ""major"" and ""minor"" exams is beyond confusing. Does belittle students during class if you ask a question.",0
"BY FAR my worst learning experience at Humber College to date. This instructor was an absolute embarrassment to Humber's reputation, and should be removed from the faculty immediately. Only showed up on time for 2 out of 15 classes. When he did arrive he was arrogant and demeaning. He made me feel dumb for asking questions. Unprofessional bully.",0
Has no grading criteria at all so there is really no way to know what grade youre going To get on an assignment. Pop quizzes are given randomly and marked hard. Assignments are all very similar. PowerPoints are full of grammatical errors,0
"This professor is my favorite professor I've ever had. You do get homework every week but it takes maybe 10 minutes, his exams are easy as easy can get (he goes over the entire exam the class before) and there is no way you'll fall asleep because he constantly keeps your attention. I adored his class so much, I took this semester his Into to Anthro",1
"God awful professor, he cant answer a question straight forward for his life. Every time you ask him something he gives you more than his life story and then doesn't even answer the question. He is absolutely unorganized and every time he opened his mouth i cringed at the thought of what would come out. Would not recommend him to anyone. ever.",0
Kelm really doesn't care if you pass or not all of his lectures are done through online videos and he does not teach in class. He simply goes over questions that students have. He assigns a ton of homework so I recommend only taking him if this class is your main focus.,0
He is a terrible professor. He has papers throughout the semester. He is the hardest grader I have ever seen. I reached out for help and he basically told me to drop the class. His exams are difficult. He makes everything difficult. None of his feed back is useful at all. I WOULD NOT take him if i was you. He is a nice guy. Just a poor professor.,0
One of the worst teachers I've ever had. ,0
Lea is a great teacher. I love her energy and her posits vibe . She is super sweet. She is a tough grader very picky about your technique . Would definitely take her class again! ,1
"Dr. Singer is very difficult to follow, he makes mistake after mistake and is constantly making corrections on the board confusing us even more so. If asked a question, many times he becomes irritated and will repeat ""too many questions"" I will not take a class with him again. I would highly suggest checking into SCC for course equivalents.",0
"Super easy to understand whats going on in lecture. Literally just skim the readings, go to lecture and you will do fine",1
"If you want an easy A take him!! Also, it helps if you're an attractive female. I went to about three or four classes the whole semester, failed just about every test, and somehow received an A. It's almost impossible to get a bad grade in this class. And he gives a lot of extra credit just in case you feel you may need it.",1
"hardly had class on fridays, which would be a good thing if she actually lectured the other days of class. unclear of what to expect to on the final. Unclear about everything",0
The professor is very bad at teaching. She refuses to help and is very rude and mean to all students. She thinks thats shes better than everyone. DO NOT TAKE!!!! Horrible teacher. Never expirced someone as bad as her,0
"He is terrible. The class is fairly easy, but overall he is really rude and mean. I turned in an assignment that had 2 parts. I turned in the first part and emailed him the second part because it was a picture. He then told me to submit through canvas after I had already emailed it to him. A month later, he tells me to email it to him NOW. so rude",0
Overall not a great help. Would not recommend to friends.,0
Overall hes a good teacher. He sometimes gets carried away in over explaining things which could make something more complicated than it should be. Hes very good at communicating and telling us what is going on this week for class. I took a eight week course so homework and test were almost every week,1
"Professor Mancinis syllabus is clear and she follows it to the tea. Assignments, small projects & quizzes are super easy, fun at times to do as well. Communication is key, make sure to communicate if issues arise, she truly wants all of her students to succeed.",1
"Took her for ANTH1 & ANTH2 and received an A for both. She is very detailed and awesome at teaching and loves anthropology. She gives you all the information in class that you will need to succeed on tests and really gets students involved in the world of anthropology, even if it's not your major.",1
Good professor who is straight forward. Study the powerpoints and you will be fine. Keeps the class from being too boring.,1
Paula was a great professor but unorganized at times. Attendance is mandatory as she uses it as part of your grade and gives three extra points as well. There are three group projects and the three exams as well. She does give PowerPoints on the chapters but she tells you to read the book and her ppt are not good to use. Overall the class was okay.,1
"Long, less than exciting lectures, but gets the job done. Very willing to help with homework and labs. Makes some of the toughest material pretty easy to comprehend. Reasonable and straight forward with expectations.",1
Shes very nice and very helpful and understanding.,1
"This man loves to hear his own voice. He will find any reason to stroke his own ego. If there is a moment where he is in thw wrong, that is completly preposterous to him and will find someone or something else to blam such as the book. Lastly, all of his material is not from his own knowlege but from a book that was writen 10 years ago!!!!!!!!!!",0
I got a good grade but I don't feel like I learned anything. I emailed him a few times with no reply. That's not good for an online class!! If you don't need to talk to a teacher he's the man for you.,0
"Clearly, everyone before me has had a different version of Mr. Bisiacchi. Snarky. RUDE. All of his tests are pop quizzes. His lecture are useless and boring. If it wasn't for the test that were ALWAYS at the beginning of class, I wouldn't even come. The book is MANDATORY. Essays were simple, but grades hard. Would never take this class again.",0
Toby is a really nice guy. Wants his students to do well. The class is an easy A if you participate and do the papers.,1
"This is one teacher who makes it really hard for you to fail. You would literally have to skip every single lab and lecture. If you try, you will pass. I ended the class with almost 120% and didn't even have to take the final.",1
"Goes over material too fast, doesn't ever give out handouts to learn from. All he does is just talk and do quick problems on the board..",0
Take her classes. She's super nice and makes the classes easy.,1
"Very Unorganized. Contradicts himself and the textbook. I would only recommend taking him if you also have to take Pathopysiology. You will be better prepared for that class. Otherwise, avoid him at all costs. DStudents are required to learn much more than other sections. Take Mr. Bill.",0
I took this class online for Spring '14. He will grade you accordingly as long as you do your work and complete it thoroughly.  Will give advice and tips if asked. Note that discussions can become a bit confusing at times. Doesn't always explain what he's looking for with them. Tests are also challenging and don't always cover what's in the book.,1
"Wasn't sure at first but honestly this professor really cares and loves his field of study. He has his own sense of humor, loves poetry, vocabulary, writing. Book is used so buy it, papers are easy, JUST DO THEM don't let them pileup. Trust me. He just needs to work on how he connects with the class. It was very boring. He's cool one on one though.",1
"I'm guessing most of these reviews are from people who don't like, or maybe who can't understand chemistry. Not a knock...I know it's a hard class. Prof Miller is extremely clear. No ambiguity. He seems to care about the students who are trying. Would recommend, but be prepared to work - as you should be for any chemistry class.",1
"He is very tough, and a strict grader. He is not welcoming to the students at all. Get ready to take notes and not understand what he is talking about at all. Just study from the study guide and mark down notes that he mentioned to be on the exam and memorize how he did it.",0
"not easy but the information is useful, if you are going into the field of theater or film.",1
He doesn't do much lectures and he gives short examples but most of the time he missed an example that we see in homework that we were not taught yet. It's very confusing but if you study hard and you'll pass the class & tests just fine. He does one day in computer lab to assist you on your homeworks and does other day in a classroom for lectures.,0
"Ok don't get me wrong, she's a nice woman and was accessible outside of class but if you need to take a class to fulfill a requirement, look for someone else or wait until the next semester. She provides feedback that isn't that helpful and when you ask for help, she basically tells you to settle for a lower grade.",0
"I don't recommend taking her online course. There was quite a bit of reading, but that is to be expected. Ridiculous time limits on exams/quizzes, NO feedback, and turn around time for grades (semester is over and I still haven't received grades for 2 papers- be prepared to wait 8-10 weeks). DON'T. DO. IT.",0
"Elizondo is a tough professor, she won't hand anything to you, you have to earn it! If you want an easy class take someone else, if you want to learn, take her! It was a challenge, her anatomy class but I loved every class, always learning, she answers questions if you ask. Lecture tests & lab tests are challenging but study and you will be fine",1
He is rude and will treat the class like high schoolers. Threatening to take phones away and gets mad when you leave class to use the bathroom. Unless you already know the material you will not understand what he is teaching. He likes to over complicate things and will get mad if you use another method of solving a problem.,0
"He's a good teacher, he just never tells makes it clear what homework he wants done, just posts is online. And his grading criteria is an age old mystery.",1
Cool guy. Really makes sure the class understands what's going on. You can tell he  enjoys doing what he does.  Tests are mostly written  (doing supply demand graphs  pp curves etc.)  Has an excellent visual teaching style and he's constantly reminding the class when homework is due and when quizzes are coming up. 10/10 would take again,1
She is very understanding! Don't take her online class if you have procrastination though,1
awesome loves teaching. I wish she taught the whole nursing program!,1
Probably one of the most difficult professors I've had. Didn't grade anything until the very last week of the semester and her office hours were never available. Everything was given vague and hard to understand instructions. She was very sweet but I don't think online learning is suited for her. I'm not even sure what my grade is in the class.,0
"She often delivers lectures but unfortunately, most of the class isn't listening. She is a decent teacher but I feel like I am back in high school, passed out on a desk, when I am in her class. She is a very nice person and perhaps, if you really care about the course work, she might be very helpful.",1
"Jim is one of the best professors you can have. He doesn't really teach a lot, but all his assignments are super easy and he takes time to make sure you really understand them. You can do very well on the assignments and would pass even if you fail the tests. He's one of the few professors on campus who truly cares about his students.",1
"He's a bit snooty and pretentious. He has sometimes discredited film as ""art"". The philosophy book you have to read is super confusing. He is also a bit extra for an assignment where you have to write four sentences (ie it's not even an essay or anything), we had to print it out as apparently handwritten is not good enough for him.",0
"I anticipated A&P being difficult, but was pleasantly surprised. While definitely not an easy class, tests are only on the information presented in class. If you go to class, read your textbook, and do the assignments, you will be fine. Professor is approachable and will show you your grade if asked. Very knowledgeable and a great professor!",1
"Registered for calc expecting to end up with a B. The exceptional Dr. Vutha is the reason I have an A, a newfound interest in math, and much-developed skills. He breaks down the most complicated concepts, keeps you engaged, & gives you countless opportunities to improve. Abundant review sessions. Will tailor his help to your needs if you reach out.",1
Plus gros pervers de l'UQAM. Cest une manipulateur pervers jai etait ecoeurer de ce prof qui vient de la campagne. Faut vraiment que LUQAM refasse ses criteres de selection.,0
"This professor is way too difficult. She is extremely confusing and drops a load of work on you from the start. The class just started for me and I instantly regret this taking her. I don't know how I'm going to pass this. If you're looking for a chill and normal PSYC class, this is not it. This is for the people that like to work very very hard.",0
"Do not take his class. For the field class prepare for the class to end sometimes more than an hour past what is schedule. Very strict grader, heavy on the report papers every week. Boden teaches intro level classes but teaches them in a more complex way than most people understand. In other words, if you dont know a lot about geology good luck",0
"He is a nice professor overall, but he is not a great teacher. He is hard to understand and his tests are very difficult. I believe that the average grade for tests was a D.",0
"Im in Dr. Bests Medical Sociology class at the moment, and I really enjoy it! Lectures are posted over the readings each week, and a 4-part weekly discussion board, 4 exams, a midterm writing assignment, and 2 case study group projects comprise the workload. It requires effort, but is certainly manageable! The content is so important!",1
"Mr. Smith was very caring and understanding. The course was made up of 1 persuasive essay, 1 research, and 1 final paper that was 9 pages. No quizzes or tests. Always let us out early and had short classes.",1
"I'v never struggled so much in a class. This guy is impossible to get ahold of through email. He grades so harshly and provides no feedback. His tests are 50% memorizing phylogenetic trees. Seems like a nice guy, but just not the best professor.",0
"What a wonderful Professor! She is very intelligent, and explains things very well. She gave a lecture on proton and carbon NMR making it understandable. She was very patient with students who didn't follow directions or who should know their way around a lab by organic 1! Clear expectations.  She is an asset to Tunxis, I highly recommend her lab.",1
"Has a very high opinion of himself, likes to read out his own stories and talks about his life A LOT. There's never a clear definition of what he wants as a paper, and he's a tough grader. I was bored all the time.",0
"I love Dr. Shively. I only had her twice and for both challenging classes (upper anthro) but I loved her teaching style. She's laid-back, relatable in her manner, and a very good explainer. I enjoyed that the classes I took were writing based. She also has interactive with little projects or field trips. She's interesting and a great person. ",1
Arrogant but admits it. Does not give reference material. Knows his stuff. Not a fair grader. Grades your work as if you are an advanced student when you are in a beginning class. Can be rude!,0
"First, DON'T buy the textbook. It's expensive and you'll never open it. Other than that, prepare for a fairly easy professor. His class is boring, but the tests are fairly easy. Find a friend that will give you notes and you'll never have to go to class. Seriously. Oh, and I was sick during exam week, and Doughty let me take my exam late!Super nice",1
She's a good teacher who gave you the information that was needed in order to do the assignment. Coming from zero coding experience I thought her assignments were reasonable. As long as you put in the effort and start the assignment before the night it is due you will do just fine. The hardest part about this class was handwritten code on tests.,1
"This is the worst class I have ever taken. She locked down my final semester grade before she had graded everything yet. Suddenly I ended up with a C instead of a B. She never replied any emails, dont even bother to try to email her, she wont respond. Give you bunch of videos to watch. You can find them on youtube and teach yourself.",0
"This teacher is really hard to understand, the way he teaches makes the subject matter harder to explain than necessary.  He adds steps that go beyond the basics of this class and goes more into higher end math like calculus",0
one of my faves! She really cares about her students and makes class as interesting/fun as she can! She is always there for you during office hours and she is a sweetheart!,1
"Ok so here's the thing about Arevalo:She can't speak English well but the class is so easy you can teach yourself. Show up for class because she knows when you're not there. She is a relatively nice person, and funny on some occasions. She will NOT repeat herself so you're better off getting the information from someone else. Overall she's not bad",0
Did not like her class at all. I had her class last semester and when she would teach she would go off topic and talk really slow. she is rude and reads off of her powerpoints. she does not give out reviews for tests.,0
Her elegance and poise is only matched by her classy style. She's really nice and well organized. Hands down the fastest marker i've had. she's tough and doesn't tolerate nonsense but if you're on the ball and know your stuff she is a joy to have as a teacher.,1
Professor Con was a good professor. All you have to do is pay attention when she is going through each power point and complete each assignment on SimMet and you will pass with a high A.,1
Do NOT take this Professor! Ever! Run! Quick change classes and SAVE YOURSELF! Worst Prof. Ever.,0
"Lois is great.Passionate about the subject, and invites you to think about things differently. Yes, many think the class is disorganized in topic, but Politics touches everything in our lives and is messy. If you do the work, ask questions, and participate, you'll do fine.",1
"I really liked Mr. Hoover as a teacher.  Accounting is a tough class, but he teaches the material very well.  Do not be afraid to ask questions if you need help.  This class requires some studying but if you do the homework and study, you will be fine in this class.",1
"There were a lot of readings (free online textbook and articles) and videos, but I learned a lot. It is not hard to get a good grade in the course if you follow the rubrics for the major assignments. There were weekly online discussion posts, an online quiz, a midterm assignment, and a final paper. She was very accessible via email for questions.",1
"just a slight accent, but overall a very good prof . if you do not attend her lectures you will miss out on things that may be on the exam.",1
"the BEST math prof @ CSM! a literal blessing bc he managed to teach ME stats. effectively too. very accessible outside of class and is very patient with you if you dont understand a concept very well. everything is connected so dont worry abt things popping up on tests. long story short, take him for math if you can, you wont regret it",1
Below average teacher,0
"If you want to pass, avoid at all costs. Plays favorites big time, and will not help students he does not like for whatever reason.",0
Just don't take her. I would wait a year to take the class with some other teacher. She's pretty bad. ,0
Probably one of the best teacher I've ever had. even tho you submitted the assignments late you still will get full credit.,1
"This semester has been rough, it is all online and he has not been good at teaching or helping students. There are lectures he puts up, but if you do not understand it, he will not help you. Also, the final is FORTY PERCENT of your grade. Definitely would not take him again.",0
"Really, really awful professor. He's intelligent, but not at all helpful, and doesn't really want to make things helpful.",0
This rating has been removed as per our site guidelines.,1
"Smartbook hw for every chapter, it's like a 50-100 question quiz that you always can make an A on but only worth 5pts & takes forever. HW isn't bad, Quizzes okay. Midterm and Final are worth 300pts, made a B on the midterm & dropped my class grade 10pts. That was with it not being proctored because of COVID-19. No lecture videos, you have to read.",1
One of those Teachers who made an impact on my education 25+ years ago. Great teacher and motivator.,1
I CAN'T STAND THIS WOMAN!  Literally have been in her class for a week and regretting it so much already.  She is super rude and condescending.  She gets frustrated by questions and has the same blanket response for everything.  Its going to be a LONG semester.,0
"Dr. Matlack is awesome. He's super charismatic & passionate about what he's talking about. His class was generally super interesting and I highly recommend it!! BEWARE: Most of your grade comes from the Aerial Photo projects -- if you don't do them, you won't do well. Also all of his tests are short answer, but they're all straight from lecture.",1
"Madhav makes many mistakes when doing work for us on the big screen. The worst thing is the online homework. There are problems with the homework that he never taught us how to do, not to mention the (free) websites notation for entering answers is ridiculous. I accused him of all this, and he told me computer science is hard. Thanks, man.",0
Our class got a 43% average on the midterm while Alex Crams midterm average was in the 70's .. she doesn't teach you ANYTHING. Midterm exam was horrible.,0
Took his IQL class and haven't gotten below a 95 on anything. Take his classes he's the best,1
"Class is mandatory and if you don't go, you'll lose points of your final grade. You just have to be there; you can do other assignments. His lectures are boring, but he tells some jokes. The answers to the essay questions are in the book. His TA doesn't give feedback just the grade. I skipped a plethora of classes - don't be like me, go to class!",1
"Awful teacher. He does not actually direct you, and the lectures are pretty pointless to the homework which you are left to figure out on your own. He is arrogant and rude, and expects far too much from students who have never worked in the field. Will mark your papers as ""So what"" and ""irellevant"" but give zero direction.",0
"Gives copies of his notes and all tests are open-notebook, but don't think that will help you much.  His notes are dumbed down versions of the tests.  Tests are only 2 problems, so if you make a mistake, ""you are dead"".  He is very unapproachable in the classroom, however, if you go to his office for help, he is actually very nice.  Huge curve.",1
"His voice is literally the most monotone voice I have ever heard in my life, especially with a lecture at 9am it is impossible to not want to fall asleep. The content is interesting at times but overall he isn't too exciting to listen to. Good thing he posts everything online.",0
"Amazing teacher. Very clear when explaining content. One of the best teacher I've ever had. Pretty easy class just don't skip because not only will you miss clicker question, you will be behind in lecture. He also doesn't put notes online so it will be hard to catch up. Just show up and you'll be fine. If you participate you get extra credit.",1
"She has an accent which can be a little tricky to understand. Goes over material very fast. Expects you to spend a ton of time outside of class to read and study. Occasional pop quizzes. Much of grade is from exams. I would highly suggest a different professor. She is however pretty caring, though that doesn't make up for how the class is taught.",0
Very understanding professor! Truly enjoys his job and it shows! Very easy to talk to,1
Awesome professor! Enjoyed his online class. Puts out all the work and you may complete it before due date working at your own pace. Take him you wont regret.,1
"Easy class if you follow his rules. Make everything JUST LIKE THE OUTLINE- I cannot stress this enough. Speeches are easy; just follow the outline, careful with time, and practice. He makes the class feel very supportive. You don't have to be a good speaker to do well. The syllabus and outline examples will be your best friends. Take good notes!!",1
"This is an easy class. Shes very passionate about her job but tries too hard to create friendly connections with her students. This can be a bit annoying at times as she goes on long tangents. This feels nothing short of a highschool English class. Get ready to pass, its hard not to.",0
Mehmeti was decent as a teacher. Gives out a copious amount of homework for an introductory course.,1
"Extremely smart, lots of work, but he's willing to work with you.",1
"2% chaque cours pour les travaux d'équipe en classe, mais on en a fait a peut près 5 max, donc 2% facile à chaque cours (pour un total de 20%). Il n'est pas très pédagogue. Ce que j'ai le moins aimé c'est qu'il va plus vite que ce que prévue au plan de cours et donc lorsque l'on prend un peu de retard dans les exercices c'est difficile à suivre.",0
"If you are not spanish or know any, please take someone else. This lady is heartless and makes it harder for students to be able to succeed in her class. She never answers emails, wont be clear with the instructions, and the amount of work everyday was disrespectful(6/day) .She has a ""figure it out on your own"" attitude and will set you up to fail.",0
"Nice and cheesy lady, but also upfront and ready to teach.",1
"I took MAT 099 and MAT 121 with Miss Dashley. She is an amazing teacher and I wish I could take more of my future math classes with her. She was always enthusiastic, presented her ideas clearly, and took the time to answer any questions we had.  She clearly loves math and wants to share that with her students. ",1
"I'm a good student,so I know what I'm talking about.His power point slides are all at a mess,really boring class, homework and projects are hard yet non-related to his lecture",0
Enjoyed his class so much i took another with him. great experience. he will explain till you understand. no dumb questions in a philosophy class!,1
"I had him for Global Patterns of Racism. He randomly assigns grades. He does not give good feedback and when he does, you can't read it because his handwriting is not legible. Many quizzes, a few essays. Very tough grader.",0
I wish he would have done more lectures.  He was fun to listen too.  Way to many group discussions which really seemed usless!  Not an easy grader.,0
"Very unorganized. For a class like this, it makes it VERY difficult when your professor is all over the place. Don't get me wrong she's very kind, but something was off. The lectures are easy and her objectives make you think you know everything front and back, but then you get to the test and it's way harder than expected. I wouldn't take again.",0
"Pat is the best teacher in the Chemistry department, and one of the best at MSU. I was very pretty afraid of going into his physical chemistry class for biologists. He makes the difficult subject easy to understand and actually very interesting. I would any of his classes in a heartbeat.",1
Very helpful. Gives a lot of analogies to help you with your work. Very funny and easy going. Good Prof. Highly Reccomended,1
"Plusieurs vont l'adorer, mais il n'est pas pour tout le monde.  N'est pas accessible par courriel, n'est pas clair. Donne de mauvais conseils pédagogiques (ex: dit de ne jamais relire ou annoter les lectures (???) ) et est contre tout ce qui est formel, jusqu'à l'absurdité.  Est ''ouvert d'esprit'' mais judgmental. Avoir un A+ est très facile.",0
By farrrr my favorite Professor at FAU. She is extremely sweet and caring for her students. She actually checks and answers her canvas messages hella quick too . Attendance is not mandatory but for all three classes I've taken she gives extra credit quizzes that basically are the questions on the exam so if you want the best chance at an A show up!,1
"Pire prof que j'ai eu a ce jour, aucune explications utile vous devrez vous preparer vous meme pour les examens a l'aide du livre",0
"Do NOT take this professor. I don't care if you have to wait a semester; it is not worth it. You will not have a good time with this guy, even if you think you are an awesome student. No study guides, just burns through formulas with very little explanation, no curve, no extra credit, easy to fail tests, and is kind of condescending.",0
I LOVE Dr. Braun. I don't know what the commenter was talking about when it comes to clarity.  She gives you specific things to work on and will work with you whenever you need help. Extremely passionate and knowledgeable.  This will not be an easy A but it is worthwhile in my opinion.,1
"will always recommend her. She wants to give you an A and gives you every opportunity to get one. You choose your own grade; just show up and take notes. You can use your notes for every test. Easy A. Plus, she makes geology extremely fun and interesting. Great person.",1
"Mangone taught the second half of my genetics class after Liebig, and I was very disappointed. He had terrible communication skills, if you couldn't make his office hours then good luck getting in touch. His explanations did always make sense and could conflict in lecture. When I did talk in person he was nice and gave advice about pursuing a PhD.",1
"Very hard course. There is only a few grades, so if you do poorly on one, it really can hurt your grade. Wish we would have spent more than a few weeks going over theories, since the exam material is 50% of your grade. Class time is mostly discussion. Be sure to read rubric for group project!",0
"Hardest class I've taken. Almost nothing covered in his lecture is on the test. you must rely on the reading for that material. Loves talking about himself. If you can teach yourself, then you can do well.",0
"Dr. Miller is a very nice and caring man however, he is not a good professor in my opinion. The majority of the class fail his tests. The only thing going for you are labs and PAs. Its not easy to fail his class because he drops the lowest grades and the Practice assignments are worth more then tests. However I did not find it easy to do well.",0
"This professor took long to get things graded and when you ask him about it he will blame it on his TA who you will never meet and does not even live in the same state. He will also not care about your grades. If he doesn't grade something right the first time, he never will. He will respond to emails but they are likely not helpful.",0
"Mr. Goodman knows his voice is monotone, but if you can look past that he is a great professor. All of his notes were on D2L and he would tell you what was important. He also stresses what other students have missed and wants student feedback to help more students learn. Very helpful and caring professor too.",1
"Jesilow was amazing. He's really clear in his lectures and you can tell he knows what he's talking about. He's really funny and blunt so that's always fun in a crim class. The tests are pretty easy (34 lectures & 14 readings), but you have to read. Super easy B class but you have to work for that A. ",1
"There is a lot of reading. Daily homework, but it's not hard. The research paper in the class is lengthy but she isn't a brutal grader. No textbook and she provides all the reading material. Her lectures are great and engaging. The class is hard because there's a lot to do, but most of it isn't hard itself. Stay on top of it and you'll be fine.",1
"Dr. Wang has a very confusing way of teaching, then when students ask her to explain an example she makes it even more difficult to understand. She only uses examples to teach rather than teaching the entire concept which makes it hard to apply the learning to different problems. The textbook helps some but not much. Avoid this prof if possible.",0
If the person before me was in the same class theyre wrong. Majority of the class never skipped and many people complained because this professor doesnt explain things well. She will give you study guides but half of it wont be on the test. She tells you to remember things and take notes but it wont be on the test. Nice lady not a great teacher,0
"If you are not electrical engineering, do not take him. He is a research professor, not a teaching professor. I took every AP Physics in high school, did the homework, studied for hours for the test an failed. He gave a 3 question test that was 9 parts total. The class average was a 44% and he does not curve. He does not care about your grade.",0
ten out of ten would never take a class with her again. she prides herself on failing pretty much every student on their first essay and takes forever to hand back the essays. she can be very rude and tough on students by calling them out and then humiliating them. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS IT IS REQUIRED FOR YOUR MAJOR.,0
"Most of class time is correcting him on the math because he doesnt know it well. He does not explain how or why an answer was right or wrong. The professor would tell us to check the online the textbook instead of teaching us in class. The professor does not curve grades, even when all of the class failed a test.",0
Honestly a great professor and had no problems with the professor. Recommend her for sure.,1
"Nicasio is a great professor but has high expectations. There is a long reading assignment to do for each class, and a pop quiz can be given at any time. If you miss a class for any reason, five points are deducted from your attendance and participation grade. That said, he's approachable and isn't a tough grader if you put in the required effort.",1
One of the best professors! He is caring to his students and is always willing to answer questions. The tests are fairly easy as long as you show up to class. You will need the book that is suggested to pass. I would take him again!,1
Just read off the PowerPoint doesnt make his own PowerPoint uses the book so get ready to not need over half of it but he wont make his own so you really have no idea what youre studying at home. Just lectures youre not interacting with a 3 1/2 hours at all. For someone who has a learning disability get ready to be very challenged. NSCC,0
"He is nice, but I wouldnt take OChem at OC again. He doesnt know his stuff enough to answer questions at all.",0
"Robbi works to make her students' lives miserable.  She is a terrible role model, and is destroying the nursing interest.  Her tests are on how well you can take a test, not on any of her lecture material.  Lots of work, stress and headaches.",0
"Students only like Garyen because he is funny and caring in lectures. In terms of actually learning something in his class, chances are you probably have to learn it yourself. He's forgetful and sometimes tests you on material that you haven't even learned in lecture and not even found in the textbook which is unfair. He's not as hype as you think.",0
"She is a very sweet professor that seems to care about her students passing. You have to do the work to get the grade, but she's a pretty easy grader. Three tests, three papers, and 5 pop quizzes with lots of opportunity for extra credit. When it came to the pop quizzes, she usually just took attendance. Really enjoyed the class and her teaching",1
DO NOT TAKE HER this teacher is terrible. She grades homework but doesn't tell you what you did wrong just to look at the notes. The notes are no help just all letters with no descriptions. I've held a 3.5 GPA but not after this class. This is the only class I have failed or gotten below a C. SHE IS TERRIBLE!!! Better be ready to teach yourself!!,0
"This class is tough.  Homework is no cakewalk either.  SHOW ALL WORK ON TESTS, I didn't and paid the price.  Seems like many students did very poor on the first exam, below 50%.  You just got to work hard and ignor him if he is talking down to you.",0
"If you need a gov credit, take him. You'll get a great grade if you do what little things he asks and his lectures aren't mandatory, but they will definitely benefit you if you go. Also, here are no exams, he is very approachable, and his lectures are a lot more interesting that i anticipated. I highly recommend! Take him and get a good grade.",1
"If you have the chance, you HAVE to take Garrigan.  He tells great stories, he's very helpful, and his unique personality keeps class pretty interesting.",1
"This online class was my least favorite business class of all time.  The instructor assigns an obscene amount of homework for how basic the class is.  I was also not a fan of having ALL homework, assignments, quizzes, etc due on FRIDAY NIGHT.  Ouch!  Expect hours of busy work and an absolutely detestable TWO group projects that made no sense!",0
"I spent a significant amount of time with Prof. O'Donnell back in '81-82. Loved volunteering with the theater group.I was initially terrified of her and speaking in public. While I remain nervous about speaking in public, I do it frequently and I owe it all to her for giving me the confidence and providing me with the skills to continue. Thank you",1
"Shes a very nice lady, but this class was a waste of time. It was like she wanted to teach a race and gender studies class, but got stuck with writing and rhetoric so she had to shoehorn it into Computers and Writing. This course did not improve my writing, lecture mostly consisted of discussing pop culture, and the final was a group project.",0
"She assigns care plans in the form of a ""Health history questionnaire"". Majority of critical thinking ICU, MedSurge, ER nurses will tell you that care plans are time consuming and useless. Yet she assigns them anyway without a care in the world and expects you to write an APA format paper without even a template. Very hard and old way of thinking",0
This Professor is a subject expert. He teaches Energy Storage Systems battery class very well. It is highly attractive class.,1
Don't take him. Worst profesor ever! 3 weeks to hit finals and the only thing I learn was football. I'm so disappointed.,0
"This professor NEEDS to be evaluated by SMC + Scholars Program. Unaccommodating, inconsiderate, and unwilling to work with students to the extreme. When questioned, she spits back a condescending retort. DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. CONSIDER SOMEONE ELSE.",0
"Dr. Ghosh cares for her students and is organized. As long as you do the assignments on time, you will do well in the course. There is one online test which is proctored and there is one project. She gives great feedback and usually gets the grades back in a short amount of time. You do have to be pretty comfortable with computers & put in the time",1
"Really doesn't care about teaching the course whatsoever. Told our class that half of us may become good engineers and the others would be outright bad ones. Doesn't really read emails for questions, instead responds with rude comments on how we should know certain things that he either hasn't explained yet or explained poorly in class.",0
"Absolutely awful. All he talks about is how academia and the legal profession is left of center. This constant refrain only makes him look insecure and weak. Frankly, if he'd focus on the facts, the truth would be clear. Stop telling us how great you are, its unbecoming.",0
Worst professor i have EVERRRR had . She does not help you whatsoever. Expects you to know every single thing. On blackboard her power points have atleast 105 slides. EXTREMELY tough grader. Takes of points for the smallest things such as adding a 0 or removing one. Test are weighed ridiculously high. do yourself a favor DONT TAKE HER AT ALLLLLL.,0
"Two exams, coaching assignments, he has a review day before exams. No surprises great guy great teacher",1
"I read these reviews prior to taking his class and wasn't too thrilled, but he proved them wrong on the first day. I found his lectures interesting cause he would add his personally experience to help you remember. Unfortunately, the pandemic took that away from us. You have to work for what you want- read, study and be engaged and it's a breeze.",1
This class should be a 200 level or below class just based on the curriculum and how every assignment in this class is a step by step walk through. It was very apparent that he had no real world experience on this topic and there were quite a few things taught that were false. An example: apparently a web application firewall can stop 0-day attacks,0
"She is the best! The sweetest lady you will ever meet. If you just pay attention, show up, don't break he rules, and do the homework you will get and A. Take her!",1
"Class average semester GPA was a 2.9, he's satisfied with giving hard-working and talented students mediocre grades. Personally, I did not learn anything and the whole experience was just insanely stressful and unrewarding. Avoid, as this is a GPA killer. Makes students uncomfortable with inappropriate jokes as well. Intimidating person.",0
"She is fun, weird, and helpful. Pretty easy class, also buys some materials for students.",1
Great teacher! who cares.,1
"John is the best professor I've had at Knox so far. ""Questions? Comments?"" He's also a kick-ass water polo coach. Take every econ class you can with him, because he gives away points like they're nothing.",1
So caring and kind. You can tell how much she loves what she does and it shines through her. I had been in the hospital for a while and she checked on me constantly and was there for me when I needed to get caught up. She tells you exactly what will be on her tests. If you fail this class it is completely your fault. She gives multiple chances.,1
My discussion section's gpa average was around 2.6 and it's not even organic chemistry yet. She definitely needs learn when to curve,0
"Fox is great! I did her online course, she really knows what she is talking about but also grades pretty hard (on final portfolios). As long as you pay attention in class, ADD TO CONVERSATION, & read you will be fine. She didn't do traditional MC exams instead it's 4 projects due at the end of the semester. She just wants students to pay attention.",1
Glad to have her as an advisor.,1
"For those students who said she's easy, it might be compare to another male professor who's teaching this course. She's a tough grader I have ever seen, her assignments were confusing as hell. she took lots of points off if you had little mistakes. btw you won't learn a thing from her class. If you can't skip her class, good luck and have fun.",0
Has an excuse for everything and does NOT give useful study tools! He even brought his daughter to class during a midterm which was very distracting. Would not recommend this prof. He is a nice guy though,0
"Very bad professor. Explains things without detail, expects you to understand the first time as if you already know the material beforehand. Extremely disrespectful to students during class (won't let you use the bathroom, condescending if you don't understand, etc.). Random pop quizzes and random homework checks can make or break your grade.",0
"Only three grades in the whole class: a midterm essay, a final essay, and participation. Make sure you speak up because he takes participation very seriously. In general, the class work was not difficult. We read short stories and poems and then wrote an essay on them.  You can tell that he really does know what he's talking about, which is great.",1
"I had a teacher say once that in math and chemistry if teachers use scantrons they are just lazy and that is so true. This gy uses all scantrons so it doesn't matter if you really know this stuff but make a minor calculation error you still get no credit for what you do know. Take from Hodge, his tests let you show what you've learned.",0
Mrs Hubbard is one of the best teachers I have ever had. She truly enjoys teaching and takes every opportunity to provide helpful information or learning experiences. She cares about her students and is passionate about women's health. Take advantage of having her as a teacher and really get to know her or you will miss out!,1
Amazing professor but I don't unders Her bad reviews. You will Lear a lot.,1
"Pleasant attitude; incredibly eloquent speaker and entertaining to listen to. Good sense of humor helps lectures to be completely bearable. Exams are difficult to study for, but if you grasp material during class, you'll get by. Good at answering questions, very knowledgable. Acknowledges all students on equal ground. Conversational. Loves soccer.",1
"She spends the entire class talking about herself and doesn't actually teach the material, yet when it comes time for the tests she expects you to know anything. Avoid this teacher at all costs!",0
"This is a difficult subject.  His teaching methods are unclear and the class is left confused.But he is relatively lenient on tests and quizes If you wish to gain experience predominately teaching yourself this subject through homework and the book, take his class. He does try very hard to answer any questions you have.",0
"He likes to extend class periods as much as possible. He is a very tough grader on homeworks and quizzes. His grading is not very clear and is entirely graded on his judgement. He was much more helpful outside of class. If you're struggling in class, go to the MaRC and it should help.",1
"Great teacher. I truly learned. Really tough class though. Her grading is tough and usually unforgiving. If you come to class and at least try to answer questions, she'll learn your face and will be more willing to help you with grading, though. She is really nice and really loves to see students succeed.",1
"If you don't go to class you will not pass the tests. Lectures and content is easy, it's just the listening part on tests that is what kills you. Very clear about expectations from the start, nice guy but comes off as kinda arrogant. Hard class to have as an 8am. Bring coffee or find a different time.",0
"Great teacher. He is a very opinionated and animated in race and ethnic relations. However, he is able to keep class attention and make things interesting the entire time. There was a decent amount of reading for this class. Overall he is one of the best professors I have had at Simpson.",1
"Wanda Jones is a very nice lady, you can tell she genuinely cares about her students. However, I would not recommend her to anybody. Her teaching style is not adequate for this course. She requires you to show up to every lecture, yet she rarely ever lectures. You have to teach yourself and if you get stuck she is not really good at clarification.",0
This professor has a true passion for math . He definitely knows how to teach and helps you understand math.  I recommend taking his class if you have struggled with math.,1
"You meet one time a week in class, and she assigns group work and expects the group to work on it together, when we only meet once a week. Only grades one group members assignment as well, so if your group members don't do the work properly or at all, you can be penalized for their laziness. Assigns 2 part exams in one class, so not a lot of time.",0
"He's very inconsistent with what he says in terms of assignment requirements, and seemingly has trouble both communicating what he wants out of assignments, as well as understanding the questions students ask. This was honestly the worst and least enjoyable course I've experience. The workload was HUGE (24+hrs of drawing per assignment)& hard marks",0
Dr. Henton is not a very understanding professor. She knows her stuff but she doesn't really know her students. I definitely don't recommend her as a prof.,0
Just got hired as a 3rd grade elementary school teacher in a charter and find myself drawing on many of the ideas I learned from taking this class into my instructions. Technology was heavy in this class and now I use technology a lot in my class. The professor is smart and supportive. Met with him a few occasions I needed extra help.,1
"All test are pop, only 2 make ups, don't show up to class and you will fail the class, I passed with an A but I worked for it. If you don't ace the papers or get B's you won't make it with an A or B in the Class. If you are lazy or want an easy class don't take this one",0
"Hybrid class PROS: friendly, no lock down browser required, sends weekly reminders, clear grading structure, will excuse absences, doesnt mind if youre late, Hybrid so all quizzes/exams are online, free e-book, CONS: DOESNT ALLOW MAKEUP, no extra credit, ALL assignments due at 8PM, quizlet is of NO help, get ready to google ALOT or read,",1
"HARD! does not explain material very well. goes way to fast.  He is so smart that he does not understand basic questions.  SO SMART.  he is funny and a nice guy. you really need to stay on top of things, and you can go to him for help. It's just SOOO much is thrown at you, and fast.",0
He's alright. He shows a lot of videos that are pointless. There's a lot of reading in the book but don't buy it all of the stories you can find online. If no one speaks up and talks about the readings from the book he'll start giving quizzes on them. He wasn't bad just not good at connecting with his students.,1
"I mean, Its E101, I hope its easy. She will take the time to sit down with you and help you with your questions and problems. Great resource during and after the class. Clearly loves her work",1
"Professor Wisotski is an awesome human being however, her discussion can be very tedious and slow at times. She really made me work for my essay grade and I never did as good as I did in HONR 101 surprisingly. Sometimes it is difficult to understand paper grades but she's available at office hours to explain",0
"Not a fan of professor Sikora whatsoever, terrible lecturer, not easily accessible, taught myself the whole course the textbook. However, his tests are a joke so I guess that helps.",0
"Putting tough grader isnt specific enough. Having a map quiz once a week is not a appropriate way to engage students and lecture slides that are so long the computer cant download them wasnt helpful either. When your average and median scores On everything are below 70% that is an issue with the structure of the course, not the students.",0
"At the beginning of every class you have a quiz. These quizzes count for almost 40% of your grade so if you're not great at quizzes, pick a different professor. No tests (I would have liked to have some). His lectures are very complex/scattered. He will ALWAYS give you the complex definition. If you do not study and learn at home, you will do poor.",1
"English 201 is a literature survey course, so it's no surprise that there is an exceptional amount of reading. Overall, this professor was fair if you made effort in the classroom. This was not an easy A, but I found that this class was very enjoyable and worth it! Very interetsing professor and no lectures really-lots of class discussions.",1
GREAT professor. Explains how to adjust in a very clear and concise manner.,1
"Noble is a solid teacher, but the class is a complete joke. This whole course could be taught in a matter of days and HPER decided to make it a semester long course, because of this he assigns some busy work projects and has a ton of people in PE professions come in and talk. His tests are tough and his study guides are useless",1
Very easy. Very chatty. Knowledgeable about the education field to the max! Alice is so loving!! I would recommend her.,1
"Learned nothing from the course, pretty unorganized when giving lectures, and the group projects pretty much determines your grade. She's an okay professor but if you're looking to gain information from this course, she isn't the professor to take.",1
"I was extremely dissatisfied with this course and I am disappointed because I was looking forward to the material (St. Francis). I would not take a course with this professor again. He is intelligent, but lacks the social skills to maintain a proper classroom environment. It felt like a dysfunctional family; I dreaded going to class each day.",0
"I thought this was a very difficult class-I managed to get a C but was afraid of an F. He seems to be a good teacher, kind of quick, but the material itself I just had a hard time with. Attendance is not mandatory, but I def recommend it because he covers a lot in a day.",1
He is not clear the way he teaches and makes you feel very dumb.,0
WORST PROFESSOR and very arrogant... No student should have to deal with a professor like this! ,0
She's inexperienced and it shows. She doesn't know how to give a good writing assignment or run a class. Her grading process is absolutely nuts!!,0
"Fairly difficult class. Lecture material is presented really fast, so it's often times hard to catch all of the information. But if you study hard for the exams, you will do fine. They are curved pretty significantly, and there's other components in the class to help your grade.",1
"I took him fall 2019 and he was an absolute nightmare. I tried reaching myself from the book like i did with him for orgo 1 but couldnt. Not clear test grading it has nothing to do with lectures/hw, basically you are never prepared. I retook it again this semester with Dr. Proulx and got an A+ if that says anything about him vs a good prof.",0
"Despite the heavy lecture material, Goldberg was able to keep me engaged during lecture with his quirky and upbeat personality. All of his lecture slides are posted on Moodle which is helpful if you happen to miss lecture. He allows students to record his entire lecture on their cell phone for future reference.",1
"Always read what he asks you to before class and PARTICIPATE in discussions. If not, he tends to get angry and assign papers. He's a tough grader, but welcomes students to visit him during office hours to review papers. Hilarious guy, hands-down my favorite professor.",1
"He was never really organized. Last semester, he planned on covering at least 10 chapters but we ended up barely doing seven. He wasted a lot of time in class fully reviewing an example from the previous lecture or trying to get the microphone to work even though we could hear him fine without it.",0
"Do the homework and youll be fine, tests are basically reworked questions outta the book",1
"Although an absolute disaster administratively, Prof Mackenzie is one of the best lecturers I have had at McGill and also one of the most sweetest and generous. The exams were very easy if you went to class and took notes. He also provided and went through past papers that were nearly identical to the exams we had. An absolute gem!",1
"She is one of the best instructor, very helpful.",1
I barely went to class... just for the review and tests. Going to class will just confuse you because all she does is drag on topics and uses big words for no reason. Her power points are literally just words without explanations. The only reason I got a B- was because I never went to class and just read out of the book.,0
"Straight Up Awesoem Dude, made learning fun!!!",1
"Professor Miller is great! He is always willing to help clarify things if you don't understand something. Expect to be quizzed every day you meet, but it's not hard. As long as you study and read the material he provides you can pass with an A.   Take his class! :D",1
Class was OK. He can be kind of rude so don't take his class if you are easily upset. ie. acts like youre an idiot if you answer a question wrong,0
"Best teacher I've ever had hands down. Readings are a must, and there is a lot, but is interesting and you should expect to do work if you go to UCSD. You must go to lecture, he has mini quizzes, which he will announce prior, but also the lectures supplement the readings and if you are organized and prepared you will be fine for the midterm/final.",1
Ms. Parker is a teacher that has you teach yourself but expects you to be at every class. She tends to have favorite and tends to them more than the rest of the class. She gets mad when she has to answer questions from people who arent her favorites and usually makes the rest of the class figure it out themselves.,0
One of the worst classes and professors on campus. His teaching is absolutely pathetic. I recommend noone to take him as a professor.,0
"Unorthodox teaching method, all quizzes are online and timed, and very tough. Study the terms and artifacts on blackboard as often as possible. In class work is a hit or miss, so show up as much as possible. One quiz over each section as well as a short essay, and a final essay that he gives you a week in advance. Study thoroughly for this essay.",1
"She doesn't assign a lot of work, but she's     picky about grading.",0
"Professor Benton as a person is great, as a teacher that's a different story. She takes a while to respond and her responses are vague. She'll post items with due dates on the calendar, but if you were to check canvas to do them the night before they're due, they'll still be unpublished. If you put the work in and read the book you will be fine.",0
Kelly Young is a great teacher. She has a way of explaining things that is simple and smart.  quizzes every class but they are open note and one answer comes from your homework.  The way she sets up her class is very organized and she is good at staying on schedule,1
Terrible prof. Shouldn't even be teaching anymore.,0
My favorite french teacher by far.  Honestly I'm not sure how her rate my professor score is so low.  I had her for 102 and she was extremely helpful and generous with grading.  Not only myself but a group of students agreed to take here again specifically due to her kindness.  I wish she was teaching 202 so I could have her again.  ,1
Wingender doesn't mess around. He will be direct and to the point. He will clearly tell you what is on the test throughout his lectures. He even gives out a practice test which is helpful. I would highly recommend taking his class. Very interesting and applicable.,1
Digiorgio is a very nice teacher and cares about her students. Her class was a cool experience and I would recommend it if you need a writing class or like poetry. I did not care for her sharing her political views and having to sit through class while she wastes time talking about them.,1
"She is fantastic. Straight forward and clear. Expects you to know the material from assigned chapters, learn smart and homework. Plenty of in class practice. Exams are tough but will help you prepare for CPA. Wish I could take for all Acctg course. Highly recommended.",1
"Great prof, do as he says and you are golden, plus no midterms, YAAY!",1
"Dr. Keeling is a very demanding teacher and does not and will not give you extra help / accommodation when you need it. He expects everything his way or you'll get a 0, while preaching ""grades don't matter."" If you miss a class or show up a fraction of a second late, he'll passive aggressively call you out on it and make you feel terrible.",0
This prof is AMAZING! such a sweet and caring person! he really wants people to succeed! If you need help he will go out of his way to help! he uses personal stories in his lecture which helped me remember what we were talking about! Exams were exactly like the study guide!,1
"His class is so easy and he really just wants everyone to understand and cares if you pass or not. He teaches directly from the book, which makes it easy to catch up if you miss a class. Homework isn't graded but you get extra credit if you hand it in. You have to ask questions! He will keep explaining until you understand.",1
"Wonderful! All homework and quizzes on my accounting lab (like mymathlab) with easy ""help me solve this"" solutions. Miss Errico will help you do any HW probs you need help with. Two tests, you get very similar practice tests to practice on. There is one final paper, I got 100%, just do your research and follow instructions. Don't miss assignments.",1
Well I must say Dr. Purser is a wonderful professor. At times the work can seem overwhelming because the assignments due dates are close together. But he is willing to negotiate to make his students feel more comfortable. He is very knowledge toward the subjects he teaches and he is also very funny as well. ,1
"This class was a challenge, his lectures were interesting and understandable but not really exactly what you can expect on the test...TEST ARE REALLY HARD...I havent completed the course yet but Im praying for aleast a ""C""...if you want to learn than take this course,you cant slack at all....no room to,oh attendence isnt mandatory but still attend!",0
I think the online component for Finance classes is not taught well.  If they had lectures with examples it would be much easier for Non-Accounting Students.  This instructor definately has favorites and grades accordingly.,0
Her lectures are long and she just talks at you for most of it. Tests are alright but she grades them very meticulously. The homework are an easy 100% but they don't count for much towards your grade. I would not take this class again.,0
"I got fooled by all the glowing comments. This teacher rewards the ones who does not work by extending deadlines more than once, and we who got bags under our eyes, giving everything before it was due, got nothing. Waits until you lost all of your sleep to anounce extensions. Very harsh grader. Not an iota of extra credit. Regret taking her.",0
"I would NOT recommend taking 122A with her. She's super confusing, unclear at times, and most of the time messes up the problem she's doing on the board. She's inconsistent w/ her grading, you could get the same answer on your paper as someone else and she'll mark you down for stupid reasons. She also gets off topic, and makes class hard to follow.",0
"She seems like a smart professor but just cant convey her thoughts across. I try so hard to understand but the language barrier is tough. She tries her best to make sure we understand but doesn't really help much, rather confuses more! tests are very ""unique"" as well!",0
Awesome professor. Her experience in the law enforcement community shows. She brings real world events and her police stories into her lecture. Class went by really fast. If you pay attention in class you will be fine,1
"He has a hard time staying on task and I never knew what he was trying to explain. However, once you go along with the craziness, you might enjoy it. He is very easy going and easy to get along with, but understanding his ideas and assignments is another story..",0
Her accent can be hard to understand sometimes. Homework after most if not every lecture but can be finished fairly quick (15-30 mins) if you understand the material. Not a super hard course but can move pretty quickly so don't fall behind. If you need help you might be better off asking another student or friend.,1
"Not enough can be said for this beacon of light in the Lambton College faculty line up.  Delivers material very efficiently with clarity.  Intangibly, he provides motivating insights into various gainful career avenues in the accounting industry.  My best advice:  use this man to the fullest.  Don't let that sheepish grin fool you.",1
"This class sucked. Never would I recommend taking her, she gives a lot of assignments and test. She expects a lot out of you. We did 2 chapters a week, plus discussion plus a test. She is not very helpful at all. I would never take her!!!!!!! Plus she takes forever to turn in grades.",0
"I have taken McNabb for both math97 as well as stats. He is a wonderful teacher and relates what you are learning to real life situations or obscure situations that really allow you to understand the material. He really sets you up for success, you just have be willing to show up to class and put in the work.",1
"Really awesome class! I'd never thought about taking a women's studies class, but one of my transfer credits never went through so I just went for it. I don't regret it! You watch a lot of movies and have a lot of interesting discussions. And no, she's not a ""man-hating feminist."" She's rational and easy to listen to. Ask about ur grades, though!",1
He's Chinese and has a heavy accent. He is very hard to understand and is bad at explaining things. He words everything weird. He should not be allowed to teach an advanced class like biochem. Do not listen to the positive reviews. The only good thing about him is you can get points from hw and he gives 5% worth of extra credit.,0
"Absolutely loved this class. She has a different, hands-on teaching style and is just a really nice person. I would take her again for sure!",1
"Online class instructions were a bit confusing, essays graded very differently and harshly, definetely turn in every assignment and on time, but not sure your best effort always gets the best grade in this class.",0
"Never stays on topic. More interested in telling BS stories about himself, trying to impress us rather than teach us. Never around when I needed help. Knows a lot (I think) and wants you to know it. Seemed more interested in helping (& flirting with) good-looking girls than anyone else. But he is fun (for a prof).",0
Unorganized and off topic often. Really easy class to pass. DO NOT BUY THE BOOK. A bit confusing. Watch movies discuss them. She stops the movies too much. Write 2 papers. Midterm and Final are multiple choice and essay form Over all worthless class but easy A. She is usually late. She talks to much about how she went to USC. Recommend. Good luck.,0
"I only had him for a 1-credit pass/fail class, and passed.  By the skin of my teeth.  The class was far more difficult than its credit weight and pass/fail status would imply; it was about abstract concepts in discrete math, and he knew his stuff, but was not very good at communicating it.",0
"WORST TEACHER EVERY!! He is horrible. He talks down to students, makes fun of them if they ask questions that he thinks are dumb and only cares about himself. He is unorganized and does not help you one bit. I can't believe SVSU employees someone like him. He is horrible and should be fired! Disappointed in SVSU for keeping someone like that.",0
"Dr. Kovach likes to structure his class as if though its the only class you are signed up for. His multiple choice questions on the exams only confuse you rather than test you on the literature. Unfortunately, he is more concerned with keeping up his reputation as the ""difficult"" professor which takes time away from actually teaching us.",0
Best teacher I have ever had!,1
very easy and helpful. she gives extra credit papers. Easy A. language is a lil hard but if you are good with memory take her.,1
"Caldwell is a funny old man. He's very enthusiastic and really knows a lot about the material. No tests, just take-home essays. If you like Shakespeare or want to know more about it this is the class for you. We even got to choose which plays we would read together as a class.",1
"She is a fabulous teacher! Very enlightening, and writes everything on the board as you go so that you don't get lost or confused. Always available to help outside of class, and will set up meetings if you can't make her office hours. Not too much homework, and the tests come straight from the notes.",1
"I didn't ever meet him. He left his class to a TA who made the class absolutely miserable. There is no professionalism whatsoever. I would have been nice to have an actual professor teaching this lab course, or at least having more of a handle on the way the TA was teaching. She was so condescending and rude people refused to ask questions.",0
She is very interesting and funny,1
Carters exemplary character and openness to all paths makes students gather before the morning sun to re-examine their half lived lives. I long for the days when he would sing to us the anthem of the international workers of the world. God bless the sound of 1000 brains forgetting how to shop.,1
Major is one of the best professors you will have at Blinn. He takes what he does serious and is a model for other professors to follow.,1
Do not take any class with him. Very boring class and need more time to practice and you should be good at MATH.,0
"As long as you turn in your essay on time, you will get a B no matter how awful it truly is. To get an A in the class, you really have to work for it. She does not have a rubric that tells you how each essay is graded. You won't learn a thing in this class.",0
"Great teacher!this class makes you look at movies differently,gives you a study guide for all her test,papers are clearly explained,her project is a breeze..take this class!highly recommended!",1
"She is BY FAR the best professor I have every had. She genuinely cares about all of her students and wants you to feel comfortable in and enjoy her lectures. She is funny and honest and so passionate about the subject she is teaching. I NEVER missed a lecture, not because they are mandatory, but because I NEVER wanted to! Such an amazing teacher!",1
"Listen to me. Listen to these reviews. DO NOT, unless you have no other choice, take this instructor. Just save yourself a semester of pain.",0
She is great.,1
"Dr. Chalk gives a ton of work constantly, and doesn't give you a single day off. She is under the impression that her class is the only class you are taking, and it is the most important. She gives random reading quizzes and picks awful books. She talks for 55 minutes about the books while you sit in boredom.",0
"Very confusing professor. I have extensive musical experience and even I get confused. Does not teach how to read music, although it is not a prerequisite for the class but is necessary for success. I do not reccommend taking her.",0
"Shapiro may be easy -- but this is because she develops such a strong personal bond with each student that you feel guilty if you don't truly apply yourself.  She is smart, makes students excited about class and aware of the issues, and assigns work that you actually learn from",1
"Such an adorable woman! Assigns very easy work and makes the class enjoyable by showing interestingclassic hispanic films. She is always there for her students if they need to speak with her, and she is an incredibly understanding individual. Great professor!",1
"She is an amazing teacher. She was always willing to help, and very understanding if you had to miss class. She does not put up with people on their phone or being late to class. I would take her foe every level of English if I could.",1
"This instructor is very involved, makes the course fun and engaging. Truly an outstanding professor!!!",1
I graduate from this program in 2014 and just had to come back to mention that 3 years later and I still resent this man and his attempt at teaching.,0
I took this class as a distance learning course from Armwood.  The professor never replied to any form of communication and was not at all understanding when I was unable to upload videos of my speeches due to internet restrictions at school and deadlines conflicting with mandatory afterschool activities.,0
Do not take his online class. Gives homework problems and expects you to learn it yourself. Only grades are tests and quizzes. He doesn't give any guide how to learn the material. Just 2 minute videos to teach you that barely explain the problems.,0
"This guy is my favorite polisci professor I've had at CofC. He lectures with little visual aids which is difficult for a visual learner, but he will make himself available to you whenever you need and as much as you need. Super cool and very knowledgeable. Class is a lot of reading and hard tests with a 25 research paper due during finals",1
"Honestly did not teach me anything in class, had to learn everything from the textbook and from the Organic Chemistry Tutor on YouTube. Three tests all with averages well-below 50%. No homework, really nothing other than tests.",0
"Really nice guy and very passionate about the subject but TERRIBLE teacher. Class averages are always around 70%, lecture slides are not clear, and exam questions do not correspond well with lecture notes. Nice guy but one of the worst professors I have had at GV",0
"He's a great teacher! One of my favorite professors at MiraCosta College! I got an A in this class only because I worked really hard for it. You can't expect to get an A from a teacher if you don't study so STUDY, STUDY, STUDY! Make sure you spend your time wisely in Lab and get your work done. If you have questions, ask Matt. He will help!",1
Tests are much harder than presented material in class.,0
"I didn't expect to see anything negative about Ms. Banks. In my class, we would have fun. She treats everyone with respect. It is a shock  to read other people's  experience and hear that it was a terrible one. Personally,she is very positive and supportive. She's gives constant encoouragements to her students. She is known to help student in need.",1
This class has mandatory attendance but the lectures are never on topic so don't expect to learn anything its basically a waste of time. There is a required textbook that he forces you to buy. Definitely not an easy A and you learn nothing except when you open the textbook. Not worth it in my opinion.,0
"This class is SO much reading, about 150 pages a week (books, not textbook). Wheeler is knowledgable and interesting but the class is so fast paced that I found it hard to participate. If you're really interested in history/social movements and can handle a ton of reading, take it. Personally I didn't like the class bc of the workload",1
"Dr. Allen is very knowledgable about seismology and is always ready to field questions, no matter how ""dumb"" they may seem. He is always enthusiastic even though students may not be. Great class: pay attention or re-watch a course capture and you should be fine. Probably the best class--3 units--to get the L&S physical science breadth over with.",1
"Super unorganized, especially because half of this class was online. Very unclear about assignments and what he wants in your papers. Barely answers emails. I am a student that normally received a 3.5 or higher in classes but I currently have a 3.0 in this class for no reason. He takes off random points but does not give any feedback as to why. ",0
"I was not happy with Mrs. Dudleys teaching. Her lectures are pretty bland, and her grading was very hard. Her labs are rushed and take forever. I would not recommend taking this class if you're looking for an easy A...",0
"Currently in her class during the coronavirus. Although some teachers lighten up on homework during this pandemic, she doubled it for us. I know we have a lot of time on our hands, but an eight hundred points essay and a thousand points essay are too much on us students who is stressed about the times going on outside of the world and in their home",0
"One of the best professors I've ever had here, his class is easy, but you still learn allot. He focuses on educating, not testing, wish more teachers were like that here. He doesn't have any probs with late assignments either, within reason. Not bad looking for his age!",1
She explains things very well and the grading system was very self explanatory and concise. Willing to help whenever you need her to help.,1
"Good lecturer, but his lectures are all about theory and not about how to solve the problems on his tests, which look nothing like the problems in the textbook and he gives no problems sets or quizzes to prepare. Not helpful or interested in helping - refused to explain a basic concept in office hours because it was below him. Avoid at all costs. ",0
"Professor Dunham is one of the best professors I've had at JCCC so far! I took him for MATH 116 during Fall 2016 and I took him for MATH 171 this past semester after failing it this past Spring. There is a lot of note taking, however, the notes are what contributes the most to your success in his class. He also offers several extra credit options!",1
DO NOT take this class if you're in chem 121. The professor is not good at teaching that class. She is disorganized and does not go off the syllabus. The tests are ridiculously hard and you would get a much better grade taking Van Huizen. My lab partner is in VH's class and is much better prepared for everything.,0
"COMM001-This class is very easy, show up to class and present a speech every week and you'll get an A . Professor is really patient and will work with you as long as you communicate with him.",1
"Take any class he teaches, he is a very kind man who is a very generous grader to a point where you can resubmit any paper until the end of the semester. You will leave the class feeling like you know at least a general sense of the topic being taught. ",1
"I went into college loving English, I have always passed my English classes with A+/100% as my final grade but this class? This professor makes me dislike English and makes me not want to write which is something I personally love to do. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PROFESSOR.",0
This was the worst class i have ever taken! Every other class she would stand up and read something from the book (we can do that ourseleves!) and the other class we wrote a small paper in groups of 10. she did not help us in any way and she showed no interest in teaching or having us learn.,0
"Tammy was a great instructor to have for MKTG 360. She doesnt use the textbook to save her students money. Lectures are very short and normally last 30-45minutes. There are 10-15 applied assignments which just get annoying after a while, but drive home the information from her lecture (10-20min a piece). Overall, great professor and easy class.",1
"The class is based on one big project. Attendance in mandatory. Her guidelines for the assignments sometimes are the opposite (literally) of what she wants. For example, one assignment we did was a survey with open-ended questions, after turning it in she said she ""said in class"" she wanted closed-ended questions. Staff loves her, I'm not sure why.",0
"Great professor. If you are lazy and don't want to work you will find his assignment difficult, but he knows what you need to know to be successful. I realize this once I start working although he will help you to create your resume. When I apply of my job the company like my that he show me how to do it. it will be a loss to BGC if he leaves",1
Very nice,1
Great guy. Learned a lot. Very interesting.,1
She is really nice and helpful.  There is no reason anyone would have a hard time in this class.  Must take.,1
"She's a super-professor! Always willing to help regardless of the situation. Her lecture tests get progressively harder, but her lab exams are equally difficult (just have to learn a couple more items as the semester progresses.) Take advantage of the extra credit! The textbook is useful, but not required. In-class lectures are very helpful & cool!",1
"I took Professor McFaul for English 1C for spring 2020, and this was one of my favorite classes that I have taken by far. We first started as in class lectures, but due to COVID19, we switched to online classes. I got worried about the transition to online class, but Professor McFaul made it so understandable for us. He is the best English teacher.",1
He is probably my favorite prof from IUP. He's one of those guys you know probably went into teaching for the right reasons. Super nice and if you need help just go to his office hours. Also had him for Phil 100 and was very helpful with that too. If you go to class and participate the hw and papers are super easy.,1
Amazing professor!,1
This course has a lot of info but he tries to make it as easy as can be. Multiple choice tests from the HW and from the lectures. He has his moods sometimes where he is a bit obnoxious but mostly he is helpful and likes to joke around. EXTREMELY anal in the lab... Stupid questions get attitude. He tries to make it interesting.,1
Tough tests you can't image!!,0
"HORRIBLE TEACHER: Does not get back to your questions, any question you have you have to post it on the ""discussion board"" in front of the WHOLE class. HARD grader, how the hell can you fail a computer class? (I am very tech savy even) This guy is a joke",0
"Avoid avoid!! This class was horrible! I wish I read the reviews before choosing this course. I failed both exams even though I did the study review. Only a handful of questions were actually on the test. George assigns 5 assignments to complete every week, it's impossible to keep up. Best advice: choose a different elective!!",0
One of the best teachers I have ever had.  He makes the material understandable and does not talk down to his students.  He could have easily been a prick and made the tests hard but seemed to be more concerned with the students actually learning the information.,1
"Dr. Simms is very knowledgeable of the subject, but he is not good at explaining things to people who do not understand the subject. He's hard of hearing, asking questions during class is kinda hard unless you literally yell. There was a paper to write, and there was no clear idea of what he wanted, AKA no outline.",0
"Started to realize towards the end of the semester that her explanations for otherwise simple concepts were quite convoluted and confusing. Chem 206 also has one of the most tedious components ever devised for a course. Final exam did not reflect posted past finals, very unfair. Overall: brilliant prof who means well, but a frustrating class.",0
I had her yoga class and I had never done yoga before. Her instructions are crystal clear. She is such a great teacher and she is very helpful. She walks around and makes sure everyone is doing things right and making sure you're comfortable while doing it. Easy class and I would recommend her to anyone! She's absolutely amazing!,1
"One of THE most difficult classes I have taken in my career as a student. While the information is very interesting, she has a certain things she wants to hear, and to do otherwise results in a loss of marks. Bonuses if you are a Feminist. Her classes can go from funny to dull in no time flat, and the otherway around depends on her mood.",0
"Provides a horrible rubric for the class. Huge negative is her importance on rough drafts. 30% of the grade is based on 8 drafts worth 2 points a piece. TA rarely gives 22 on drafts so you basically lose 15% of your grade right away. Her response when asked about extra credit was ""afraid not."" Never comes to class, required to buy HER book online.",0
Hard on grading and doesn't any mercy on helping you out on your grade.,0
"Hes a great professor and gives great feedback, but his tests are very hard if you dont study very well. If you do your work on time and study you should pass with a high grade.",1
"This prof may know her stuff, but she's better suited for a research position. Classes are incredibly long and boring, tests are semi-relevant and the majority of her examples are out-dated or don't appeal to the class.",0
Just really boring. Her voice is really shrill and she says the same stuff over and over. There wasn't really any structure to the class and all you need to do is read the book. ,0
Nice woman cares lots but makes no sense and impossible to follow. For a gender studies class she was a very closed minded.,0
"Dr. Hines's lectures are very confusing, since he often gets the questions wrong. I have attended every class and done all the homework and still do not understand the material because of his lectures. His office hours are during my other classes, so I recommend going to the Study or Mathskellar because his lectures/notes online are not helpful.",0
Dr. Kang got 7-10 on his own quiz.,0
"This was probably the most annoying class I've ever taken at UT. He takes random attendance, but being in class is the most boring and painful thing in the entire world. TA grades everything, and harshly might I add. Falola would just fwd my emails to the TA. impossible to understand b/c of accent.",0
"She makes it as simple and clear as possible. Organic chemistry can be difficult for some people, but she will help you. She will encourage you to go to her ""office hours"" with questions. If you take her class, study hard, no other way around it. Study her power points well. Great teacher overall, I'll have her for Organic II next semester.",1
"Very intimidating. Do not even think about bringing any electronics into that class. The only good thing about that class is that he pulls his MC questions straight from the study guide. Final project was very difficult and if you get a sucky group, too bad you are stuck in it from week 1 to week 14. Very rude to students. Not a pleasure at 8am.",0
"unbeleivable, english is defietly not my stong subjectand managed to get an A. pretty straight foward class if your the kind of student that just wants to show up and play angry birds. she shows alot of videos.",1
way too hard...a bit unreasonable,0
Hardest class I have ever taken.,0
"Even though it was an online course it was very much self teaching. The notes he posted aren't his own, he makes you watch YouTube videos instead. A quiz for each module, 3 exams, final is the option to retake one of your exams. Self paced course, piazza to ask questions, lockdown browser for exams. ONLY TAKE IF YOU CAN LEARN STATS YOURSELF",1
Overall his class was okay if you need to take an English class online. I didn't like the way he taught the class. I felt it was more of a Communication class then English. Some of the videos were almost two hours long and you still have a few of them to watch plus some readings.,0
Only reason I dropped was because I did poorly on the two exams. i didn't study and failed both but couldn't afford a C in class so dropped it other than that she's a chill teacher and exams were easy if u study the terms!,1
"This class is so so easy if you are a logical person (I am a mechanical engineering major and I never had to study for this class), but if you struggle with logic then this class will be a big effort, so many people dropped.. either you are really good or really bad at this class I guess",1
Great teacher overall explains everything with clarity and is very helpful and understanding i would advise taking her clases. only negative is she kind of looks down to students on rare occasioms.,1
"She is awesome! You will have to work hard and do all homework to pass. The exams are difficult and long, but the knowledge you get is invaluable!!",1
She was very nice and you can tell she cared about her students but the class was just too hard. I would compare my tests with students with other professors and the tests weren't nearly as hard.,0
"I took this professor for english comp 1 and 2 a couple of years ago. I hated her so much that I occasionally come back here to warn people how unprofessional and bipolar she is. I would get B's on her papers with NO explanation as to why??!? If you're a cute boy you'll probably do well in her class, the rest of us have to work a little harder.",0
"Took Prof M for summer B. Syllabus was modified for the short time, exams every week with inclusive review. Labs are full points for participation.  Always responded to emails.  She is such a really NICE lady. So show up for labs study the review it's an easy A.",1
Slightly painful but bearable.,0
"There wasn't a single student in class who wasn't in awe with his lecture. He's extremely passionate about his subject, very personable, has a great sense of humor, and very easy to work with. His lectures were very interesting, the textbook (free) was easy to follow, and the homework prepped you for the quizzes/exams. Best teacher at MJC!",1
"Professor Dyer was always kind, creative and engaging. Lectures always included an anecdote which related to the course material. Never hesitated to listen & help with a problem, but you gotta show up to the office hours & send emails. Firm but fair grader. If you're a first year student, Dyer is the way to go for Math 1000.",1
"Terrible. Talked about her personal views only, lots of that planned parenthood stuff.",0
if you are absent to her classes you will not pass i guarantee it. Other then that great professor.,0
best teacher ive ever had. She makes class interesting and is a very intelligent woman.,1
"I took his class 4 years ago and this is my hardest class. It's not because the level is so high for me, it was teaching me how much I was recognizing and understanding the world and people around me. The greatest teacher, Mr. Lawson helped to open my mind!!! I am appreciated his smart and stubborn sides! =D",1
"First off, he's a nice guy with a big heart. However, Vallee is very unclear about his expectations. He is a very poor marker; no constant b/w projects/reports. If course material was presented differently, it would make for a much more enjoyable term.",0
"She's the type of professor your conservative parents warned you about. If she could hug every whale and destroy every coal mine she would. LIBERAL. Can be mean to girls. She locks the door after the start of the hour (excuse me, I'm paying to go here). She also is so far behind the times in terms of resumes and cover letters it's not even funny.",0
"She was horrible, she treated and 1101 class like a grad class..she doesnt care about anyone and will willfully fail the entire class.",0
This was the worst instructor that I have had. She grades arbitrarily and is partially knowledgeable about the subject.,0
Boyles is an amazing teacher! There is a lot of group assignment work but he also makes sure all the books he assigns are pretty cheap! He wants to help people succeed!! He has a couple of important papers & a final that is easy if you have a big imagination. Take this class & really engage with this guy if you want to learn anything & keep an A.,1
Nelson is a kind teacher who cares for students. She has a monotone voice and talks very quietly. Her lectures are very boring and she talks from the PowerPoints. You can pass the exams by studying the vocabulary words/concepts from posted study guides before each test. You will have to do a project- which is easy! I recommend her if you want a A!,1
"We did easy science labs in this class. Now I know some simple experiments to do with my 3rd graders. This class is not that hard, you just have to keep on top of the material.",1
"I could not stand this class. I found it to be annoying since I signed up for an in-person class and got a hybrid class. The lectures were boring, people would sign in and leave. It was frustrating because her class was all based on MindTap. I would not recommend anyone to take her just because her class is a waste of time and money.",0
Doesn't know what he's doing. Disorganized for every class,0
Great professor of a well organized and thought through course,1
Horrible. Avoid her if you can. I promise there are better communications professors. She could use some brushing up on communications since she's so horrible at it. Didn't teach a single thing. All student based and forced discussions on zoom.,0
Great teacher. Helps when asked. Gives a lot of homework and worksheets but all the work he gives help tremendsly on the tests. If you are going to show up for class and work hard you can get an A.,1
"Pretty dull lectures. Weekly quizzes with questions taken straight from the homework assigned for this week to encourage you to study systematically. Midterms were straightforward, final was a bit more challenging, but the grades get heavily scaled in the end.",1
"Maybe he's good at teaching all the Calc courses, but to me his teaching style was bad for Precalc. During summer more than half the class dropped and it is because he grades so harshly and doesn't give enough time to complete quizzes and exams. He rushed through lectures. I got marked off points for checking my original answer using another way.",0
why is this guy employed at a 4-year accredited university? isn't there a community college or trade school he could be doing a mediocre job at? the man destroys the credibility for the  International Business Major at CofC,0
"One of my favorite teachers yet at North! Very knowledgeable and passionate about his field. Engaging lectures and funny jokes throughout. The tests were quite difficult, but he does his best to set you up for success with study guides and clear lectures on what will be covered in the test.",1
"Worst math teacher I've ever had. He gets dragged off topic and doesn't teach the curriculum well. 90% of your grade will be if you can do math bookwork because he won't teach it, you have to learn it there.",0
"Professor Saudino is, by far, the worst professor I've ever had. Seek an alternative class. Her style is awful, her tests are ridiculous with material being taken from oddly specific examples, and her lectures are so very boring. I'm so glad this semester is almost over and I hope I at the very least get a C-. If you do end up in ps241, don't skip.",0
I just loved this woman i had to take her class twice. Actually i failed the first time but it was so great i was able to take it over with her.,1
"You'll pass if you can stand being berated in front of the class, can self teach or at least read his mind since he'll never be clear. I cried so many times because of this class & not cause I don't work hard, but cause he expected award winning films w/out teaching anything. Had his ""caring"" days but mostly made sure to crap on us for something.",0
"I never really struggled with the content in this class, so I cant exactly say what a struggling student would experience with this prof. However, she seemed very willing to help her students. She always responded promptly to emails she sent, and she gave partial credit on exams/quizzes also. If you have an A or B, you can exempt the final.",1
"if you can handle your class without attending lecture, it is your class. she is absolutely not helpful in her lecture and makes everything boring. she also never tell you what you are doing wrong and your opinions against what she is looking for are easily being disregarded",0
He is literally my favorite professor here! He is very understanding and lenient and willing to work with you! He is very passionate and facilitated amazing discussions that make you think deeply and critically about things you may have never even thought about! Definitely take a class with him at UR!,1
"This could be the worst professor on campus. She has no leniency so anything late is a 0. She makes you read out of a pointless textbook on a weekly basis, and then asks questions on quizzes that do not relate. This teacher is terrible and I highly recommend that you do no take this teacher, every other public speaking teacher is better than her",0
"She was probably the worst professor I've had to deal with. She is an extremely tough grader, when she gets around to grading. Her instructions are extremely unclear and she doesn't tell you due dates. You can't keep to the syllabus since it changed the first day. She was unwilling to answer questions and her questions are extremely open ended.",0
"Class is 90% exam grades. Exams of which are incredibly difficult and almost impossible to do well on. This class wasn't even for my major, and I think I speak for most when I say anything remotely interesting that I could've learned in this course was ruined by her terrible teaching style. This class is such a disappointment because of this prof",0
She is the worst teacher ever! Sucks you have to take this crap!,0
"Phenomenal teacher. A great individual who truly cares about the success of his students, and the importance of communication (cinnabon, savvy)",1
"I have had Hersha for several classes and she is hands down my favorite professor at the Academy.  She is always fabulous, is very intelligent, makes her classes actually interesting, and knows so much about the industry!!  If you want a class where you just read the book and take a test this is not it though.  She likes students who participate!",1
"He is so cokcy and full of himself. He makes you buy the books he has wrote and read them. THEY ARE SOOOO BORING and crap that no one really cares about. If I were you I would change professors, unless you want to hear about how much money he makes and listen to him belittle other professors.",0
"What I have noticed throughout my experiences at CRC when I was enrolled inside this course during pastimes had to do with amount of overall spent time-consumption efforts, economic expenditures (tuition board fees and school supplies), STRICT ATTENDANCE POLICIES (PARTICIPATION POINTS), INTENSIVE READING CHAPTERS (TEXTBOOK), POWERPOINT SLIDES, ETC.",0
Literally the easiest class I've ever taken. She's amazing. If you don't end up with a A after taking her...... chile.,1
I actually really liked this professor. PAY ATTENTION TO ONLINE HOMEWORK AND SLIDES FROM LECTURE WHEN STUDYING FOR TESTS!,1
"Mostly discussions followed by a quiz, per week.  Not very involved with the class, dishes out assignments with no specific lecture/power points.  Just A LOT of reading. Not very involved with the class.  Final was difficult, did not even provide a prep sheet or study guide and most of the questions were not part of earlier quizzes.  Not great.",0
Shes a solid choice when it comes to a professor but beware she docs points for every little thing. I complied to her discussion points and felt like I did exactly what she asked me to yet I was never given an A on any discussion. Always gave me a 2.5/3 even when I did exactly as was asked.,1
Take this class if you have to take psych and its not important to your major. Easy A if you do the paper. You dont really have to do good on the paper. She scaled all of our quizzes since everyone scored so low (no one got above a 70). If you really care about psych and want to learn it. Then do not take this class because you wont learn,0
She's ok. I wish I didn't take this class.,0
"Ayland is an amazing teacher. He cares about the students, and is clear on grading criteria. He wants students to learn the material, and really puts lots of energy into the course. Highly recommend.",1
"Loved her for calc 2!! Very easy to understand and examples done in class are very helpful. Tests are very fair and don't have anything too difficult on them. Good amount of homework, and you get 10 tries per webwork problem.",1
"The only reason students take Dr. Jones for genetics is because she is the only one who teaches genetics (most of the times). Nobody I have ever met has anything good to say for her at all. Her arrogance is all over her face, the way she talks, and the way she answers your questions. Why do I need to buy Tophat when I just spent $250 buying books?",0
Horrible I mean REAL BAD professor I do not know what I was thinking when I choose her over the others. She is not consistent with formats of quiz and does not even gives a heads up changes from 10 questions to 20 then back tracking for some quiz and then some allow. Never answers emails does not send send reminders like every other prof. STAY AWAY,0
laid back. his lectures are hysterical.,0
"Krutz is the coolest professor in the SE department. He's extremely laid back and approachable, which makes him a favorite of most students. That being said, you probably won't learn much taking a course with Krutz. His class was beyond easy with little to no homework and the easiest exams I've ever taken. Take his class to have fun, not to learn.",1
"She is a waste of space.  Totally useless, living in the 80's.  This class, on the whole, is a waste of time and just a way for SCC to get money.  She thinks she is funny, she is not.  She claims you need the book, you do not.  She likes to be the grammar and spelling police when most of her work is laden with errors. The class is a complete waste.",0
Please don't take his class!!!!,0
Great teacher learned alot of things about sports which i love,1
"Very knowledgeable about the subject matter, but lacks commitment to the class and appears unreliable. An A is  realistic, if you give a decent effort. His lackadasical attitude toward the class (several missed classes), poor communication) have the ability to make you lazy. You just have to remain focused throughout the semester.",1
"Steve is pretty hardcore, you'll basically have a paper every week as your weekly homework. Many assignments, lots of reading, and he's very tough on grading, especially when it comes to APA. I can easily say I never cried from stress as much as I did from Steves class. Good luck...",0
"Is not very clear with her lessons at all. Does not go back to review any lessons but gives tests on previous chapters????? Good luck, you'll learn more going to tutoring and reading the textbook",0
Do not take this professor unless you are a fulltime student and enjoy spending over 20 hours EACH WEEK doing homework. Expect work to be assigned every single day. That is not an over exaggeration. She has a firm belief in quantity over quality. I learned very little and her interactions with students are cringe-worthy and combative.,0
"This dude is awful, has a thick African accent, lacks modern teaching techniques. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS .  Should go back to tutor school. ",0
"all you have to do is write papers. They dont even have to be good. You'll probably get an A on the paper, if he remembers to grade them. the lowest grade i ever got on a paper was a 92, but he forgot to grade one of my papers so it went in as incomplete and i almost couldnt have english 112. It eventually got turned into an F and i recieved a B.",0
No rubrics or clear instructions for essays.,0
She was really nice,1
"First off I got an A in this course. But I don't feel like I learned all that much. THere are way too many moodle assignments (especially focused on small subtopics barely mentioned in the book), come on many of us have work too. Exams are open book, but again you don't learn anything if you take exams that way. ",0
"The average of his exam in our class was a 47% and the average of the final exam was a 51%. Instead of curving the class or giving opportunities for extra points, he wrote a letter to our class saying that he gave plenty of ""free points"" and that we all need to ""be adults"" and take responsibility for our grades. No attempt to rectify the situation.",0
"Greatest professor of all time! I don't like government but Prof. Tapia makes it really interesting. I learned a lot in his class. He's really funny, and good looking. The class had easy online quizzes, and a discussion assignment on the budget. This was my favorite class at MDC!",1
Worst prof ever- brought her toddler to class 3times including final exam! She expects to be accommodated but accommodates no student even if you have a learning disability. Boring classes- always starts talking about her own life for min. 1 hour every class. I tried complaining to the dept-  no reply! She should be fired. Waste of my money & time!,0
Boring boring boring Idk if it's because this was online but I was suffering I have ADD so having to sit for 4 hours in her class where she doesn't show power points or anything really visual It's hard to stay focused. She's great for some people but she wasn't it for me It was hard to retain info.,1
Please listen! She is a very hard teacher! Anatomy is suppose to be basic but she is detailed to everything! Her exams are extremely hard and so are her lab exams. You need to dedicate at least 40 hours a week to study for only this class. This is only a basic anatomy class and she teaches like a university advanced anatomy course. Don't take her.,0
"The class would benefit from having a textbook alongside lectures. He goes through the material pretty fast, but he does cover everything. The class suffers from the same problem as every MGMT class, which is that the tests are subjective and extremely vague. During COVID, the final was a two day test that took students an average of 7 hours",0
Dr. Piland was the worst teacher I've ever had. He made things more difficult than they should have been. He changed his grading point scale multiple times and nobody could keep track of their actual grade. He doesn't answer questions clearly; he just tells you to look it up yourself. Avoid this teacher if you can!!!!,0
"You have to be ready to participate in Dr. Duque's class. He will call on you at random. He gives everyone the same grades for compositions, but he steadily increases your grade throughout the semester. You have quizzes after every class and a weekly discussion board. Both exams were take-home and you have a 10 minute presentation with a partner.",1
"NOT AS EASY AS HE APPEARS,THAT IS ALL I'M GOING TO SAY.",0
"I wouldn't recommend taking his class during the summer. Really fast paced. Tests were every week. Note cards allowed. However, no extra credit and no lowest test grade drop. Clear grading criteria and does get back to you as soon as he can. Tests are worth 70% of your grade.",0
Ms. Murnighan is an amazing teacher. She makes sure students understand what is going on in class. Class discutions are great. I wish she taught all the business classes I needed.,1
"Professor Faux is a great teacher. Offers lots of extra credit. Your grade is 4 exams total and your extra credit. Super easy material even for non-music people. You have to go to lecture because he does not post lecture notes online. Super easy class, he spells out exactly what you need to know. Really nice guys, cares for his students.",1
honestly the coolest professor I have ever had. Only grades on in class quizzes that are straight off of the boards in class. Super scary at first but his class is an EASY A. One of a kind person and a must take for MGMT,1
DO NOT take this teacher. He treated me so bad and it was only my first semester. He blamed me for his mistakes countless of times and had always called me out for mistakes he made on my page.  i have never disliked a teacher so much in my entire life. & i wouldn't want any one to be put in this class.,0
"Mr. Mac is one of the best teachers I have ever had and I just finished my junior year. Lecture is all powerpoint but does a good job to keep the class of 300+ engaged. There is a lot of homework, but only because he truly wants you to understand the stuff. Read the book, go to class everyday and do hw and an A is easy.",1
"203 is a difficult class, dr engelkes kaltura system is genius so I didnt have to read the text book. It really is what you make of it. The program is tough you have to put in work. She has helped me even after I graduated her class.",1
"Fair class. All of the homeworks, quizzes and the final are online on a different website. She dropped three of the ten quizzes we took and all of the homework problems are straight forward.",1
I don't even know where to begin. She thinks she's a Messiah of math and don't even know ho to teach and gives too much homework to and its about 250 math problems per week. Please don't take her any math classes NO EVEN JOKING.,0
"Dr. Pham is such a genuine, hardworking, and caring professor. She is very clear with the material she teaches and ensures that the students understand the concepts. She knows exactly what she is talking about (she has had experience in the field) and is also very straightforward with what she expects from students.",1
"Bushey is HARD. You must put excessive amounts of time in practice aside from homework, to get it fast and be ready for weekly quizzes. He also changes questions unnecessarily and makes it 10x difficult sometimes. He is unfair on time for quizzes, and leaves almost no value in understanding what we are learning, b/c of how fast you must finish.",0
"Professor McGlynn was the BEST teacher i have had at SSC. I loved her class! She teaches you so much, not only about the class but also about life. She is so caring and sweet. You will actually learn in a way that excites you. I can't hesitate enough that you NEED to take her class, you won't regret it!! FYI: You will need the book.",1
"confusing questions, unclear expectations and unavailable. awful professor stay away from any classes he teaches",0
This class is pretty much all self-teaching and memorization. She reads over the entire powerpoint in class which is not very helpful. The written portion of her exams are hard but she gives partial points and curves all the exams. She also gives lots of extra credit. Getting an A is possible but you have to put in a lot of effort.,1
Worst class EVER. I'm a straight A student and I failed this class. His expectations are waaaaaaaay too high and he won't stop talking about his glory days at the UW and their expectations. He's the only teacher that has made me cry.,0
"She was always very vague about what she wanted. She expected you to use canvas a lot and from what I could remember would never give you a heads up with something was coming up, I understand that it's our responsibility, but Eng101 is one of the 1st classes you take in college and I didn't know how to use it right away. A heads up would've been n",0
"Not my favourite prof, found him very hard to follow and almost always getting off track. It was almost impossible for me to define or understand the meaning of many of the key terms to the point where i would rather sit at home and read the text book than attend his lectures.",0
"Lecture were extremely boring and tough to pay attention to. The tests were online and pretty difficult. It's possible to get an A, and I would take this class again. But it's not a fun one to get through.",0
"This professor is absolutely terrible. She is always late to class and never has a lesson plan. She just starts talking and expects the class to keep the conversation going, even though no one knows what she's talking about. The work for this class is excessive. If you have any other options for professors, I urge you, don't take professor Hart!",0
"Was a nice teacher at first and had a different way of teaching that I respected because not many professors are willing to try something new to help students succeed. However this style of teaching just did not work for me, and after expressing these concerns I guess I triggered him into writing a 5 page paper about how I was a terrible person.",0
She doesnt actually teach. She just talks about her personal life. Regularly late for class. Very unclear with grading.,0
"I think Prof. Lane knows what she's doing. I shouldn't have taken it as a summer course because she has 8-10 assignments due on Sunday. I had a good average, and then the 1 time test dropped me down a letter grade after being at a 96% for 4 units. I'd recommend for fall instead of summer.",1
"EASY A, she spends most of her class just talking about her own life. she is super nice. we only did 2 speeches this semester that was extremely easy. she does require a cam, but get a cheap one or use a laptop cam. TAKE HER",1
"He makes simple topics very difficult to understand; you're better off teaching yourself. He is kind of rude when approached with a question, and isn't clear.",0
"She's really nice. The lectures are too long. She's so repetitive, it takes up a lot of class time. I wouldn't take a class with her again, even though it was so easy.",1
He has long lectures about what he talks about. If you pay attention to the DVDs youll be fine. Not really much to do when just taking notes. Sometimes he asks certain foreign words and wants the class to participate in on their meaning. Most of the time its silent in class because we just doesnt know the answer.,1
"TAKE HER! She's the BEST professor I've ever had at CNM. I was nervous taking Physics since I had never taken it before. I was overwhelmed the first 2 weeks of class, but thankfully I went to her office and got help. She explained everything to me. She is willing to sit with you and take you step by step. She wants her students to pass. I love her!",1
I took this class back when I was a college newbie. Man oh man as soon as professor walked in I thought it was pop eye. That shaker bottle. Those guns. I knew we had an instant connection because I lifted too. He shook his shake up. I shook mine. We both looked at each other and knew gym sessions were gonna be great.   Great class. ,0
I think all the good ratings were written by the professor himself. Sounds exactly like he talks to his class....,0
didn't care about student understand or not. many tests and didn't have time to ask he question.,0
"Many of my friends I have talked to about UI100 say how their classes are blow off classes and they do little to no work. In this class, I felt as if it was all busy work. I was never doing anything beneficial towards my education, I was simply wasting paper by filling out ""workbook pages"" for homework every night.",0
Assignments are mysterious. Grading is unfair. This professor is one of the worst I have ever had!,0
"LW I is required for the first semester of 1L. This might suggest that LWI is a difficult course because we are not used to legal writing before coming to law school. This prof. is a nice person and is willing to help. But, if you want to earn a passing grade, you should use some supplements.",0
"By far the sweetest, nicest professor I have ever encountered. I really appreciate your time and effort. I wish all my professors were like her!",1
"Mrs. Vasquez is an outstanding teacher. I learned a lot from listening to her lectures. Her teaching style is based on power point lectures and great points of interest throughout history. She connects well with the students and is very sociable and likeable. As a history fan myself, I would love to take any of her available classes to learn more.",1
This teacher is not good i dont know how his reviews are high. Its a 101 class but he expects you to write like a person who majored in writing essays. He trys so hard to find things to mark you do with. ,0
"I took this prof. for a mini and all we did was work on his projects after class. Do not take this prof. for a mini, alot of after class work. We ended class on the dote than the whole class heads to the library to work on the projects until 10 or 11pm. Everyday for mini there is a new project to write. 5 to 7 pages.",0
"Took her for Into to old testament. She was okay. Made you write 8 1 page responses for the whole semester. Readings you should do because they will help you in class and finals. I stopped reading because I already knew about the Bible and I got a B+ on the Midterm. Grading, maybe kind of hard, the usual.",1
"He give a lot of homework, but it is so easy. His class saved my gpa. He  is such a great teacher.",1
"I found Professor Abrams to be unorganized and confusing. Yes- he cares a lot about his students and the course, but that doesn't mean that he's smart or a good teacher. I regret that I did not learn very much from his class.",0
"She is a very nice prof, neat, organized and has very positive attitudes. Not really a tough grader but you need to show your efforts. She's very helpful inside & outside the class. Really glad that I spent a whole year with her.",1
"Tobin is very passionate when teaching and you can tell she is knowledgeable on the subject. However she is very disorganized and I personally felt like she always spoke way too fast (she would say a lot that wasn't on the slides, but she speaks so fast its hard to catch).",0
She is the worst teacher i have ever had i got 60's on every single assessment.  she was rude. When i asked for help before classed started she told me to get out she was not on the clock. I have no respect for her at all.  The only good thing about her is that she lets you redo assignments.  other then that find a new teacher.  ,0
"Great professor! The course in general is designed to be hard, lots to memorize. She gives all the powerpoints needed and on Zoom, explains them very well. Other than that it's up to you to study and memorize, don't just study the powerpoints, STUDY THE TEXTBOOK CHAPTER IMAGES, it on the practicals!! Great prof tho, good at explaining + answering!",1
"He is a beautiful creature and incredibly nice! He's very clear with his explanation and encourages everyone to engage with each other hence why it's a Marketing course. I just didn't like how we needed to group ourselves the 2nd class because we hardly knew anyone but it is a good way of exercising networking skills. Also, doesn't post his notes.",1
He's super funny and very interactive. there's not a lot of work at all if you just pay attention during lectures and listen to the music at home then it'll be a very easy class for.,1
"Kipp is the BEST! It's half way through the semester and we haven't had any homework. He just asks you to bring in an article from the web every now and then pertaining to the topic that is being covered that day.  You do have to show up to class, although he doesn't take attendance, he covers the test very well in class. It's HARD to NOT do well!",1
"Dr. Koh gives well-prepared lectures but expects students to use their brains.  The homework and programming assignments require considerable time spent in thought.  Additionally, his exams can be tough.  However, he cares about the students and has an open-door policy for his office.",1
Just go to the lecture and you'll be fine. Don't need to take notes. Every assignment is online and you have to go to two concerts within the semester. He's super chill and understanding about absences if you email him a good reason he won't count it towards you. Attendance is mandatory of your grade will slip.,1
"Professor Jenkins was great. Very engaging during the weekly discussions, and provided good feedback on assignments. Very fair grader and her classroom felt a bit more relaxed than most, which is a nice change of pace from a lot of the HMLS and PSAD professors at UMUC...I'd take her again in a heart beat.",1
"Horrible teacher. He is inconsiderate, and is very unwilling to help.",0
"At the beginning of the class she told us she didn't like the new curriculum. We wrote on one topic the whole time and if she took the opposing view point, she would make it known that she didn't agree with you. She grades based on her own thoughts and she isn't very clear on what she is looking for in the papers.",0
"Lectures are extremely fast, no clarification. i would not recommend him.",0
This professor was absolutely horrible. All she did during lecture was read her power point slides word for word. As if I can't read them myself. When test time came the answers to the questions could not be found anywhere in the slides or book. She expected you to have a deep understanding of the subject material without teaching it to you.,0
"Martha Steffens is best described as completely, totally, and utterly incompetent.  She doesn't care about her Econ 1051 Journalism class.  And she is completely computer illiterate.  The class is really easy, but she is a bore of a teacher.  Take it, don't go, and just read the power points online.  You'll be fine.",0
"very passionate instructor, however she gets distracted very easily and talk openly about her political and religious views.",0
This subject is difficult on its own but Dr. Kennedy really tries to make it interesting and easy. There was so much extra credit which helped everyone out a bunch and lab was easy. He is a fair grader and professor. Attend lectures to gain bonus points.,1
"Dr. Gonzalez is respectable and highly intelligent in his field. His instructions for essays are clear and concise, he provides an outline of how the format of the essays should be. Attend the lectures, do thorough research for your essays, and do your MyWritingLab and you will pass with flying colors. Overall, great professor and would recommend.",1
Take someone else if you can,0
"Worst teacher without a word of a lie l. Barely passed the course (usually As). He makes you look like an idiot when you get questions wrong and simply doesnt do well at explaining concepts. If he had his way he would fail everyone, he said 90% on success rate on a midterm question was too high so he would make it harder next time. AVOID HIM!!!",0
"Hard to understand. Hard class, lots of homework. Just not my kind of learning",0
Her class was hilarious but she did not curve at all on the final grade although she promised that she would.,1
"Lecture every Tuesday, worksheet handed every Thursday and both the hw and worksheet are due the following Thursday. Practice exams, slides and study guides all available online. Lab work and lecture are useful. Book not needed except for hw. Really nice teacher. Get a hold of the past exams because she just changes the numbers..",1
You have to teach yourself. No matter how many zoom recordings reviews & practice exams BE PREPARED TO TEACH YOURSELF. I regret taking this professor esp. online. Homework takes up majority of your time and has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE EXAMS & reviews HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE EXAMS! take her if it's your last option. You've been warned! Be wise!,0
"Does not use the textbook like other profs for this course do, but didn't tell us ahead of time so many students had purchased it already. Lecture heavy and can be boring. Four group projects, present one of them. Three quizzes and an online final. Many opportunities for extra credit. Sign in for attendance but isn't for points. Okay overall.",0
"Janey's class is super hard, but she teaches it well and does a pretty good job of helping you understand some of the more confusing material. Her late work policy is very relaxed, but it definitely helps to do the work ahead of time in her class. Otherwise, she's super nice and has a good sense of humor and knows the material extremely well.",1
she does about a month's worth of lectures and then puts the rest on students. I pay her salary and she sits back and watches. 15 minute presentations from students for 3 hours numbs your mind; we are not professors so it can get quite boring. AVOID HER CLASS AT ALL COST,0
"Dr. Foster is fairly average professor, in my opinion. The class mostly covered French history and other cultural topics, but I found it genuinely interesting. The work might become too much and her tests were some of the most difficult I have ever taken outside of math. However she gives clear directions and if you do what's needed, you'll be fine",1
Prof. Regan is not clear. hard to understand. Poor at teaching. Got nothing from this class. Oh well.,0
Carefully read his syllabus and refer to it before asking him questions. Online quizzes every week based on textbook chapters and exams based only on in class lectures. Lectures are not scripted so you have to write what you think is important which is a lot of  what he says. Exams were fair and you could manage a decent grade with good notes!,1
"My main issue with this professor was the delay in the grading process. I understand needing time, but returning assignments two months later does not help me understand what I am doing wrong. If assignments were graded in a more timely manner students would be able to use the feedback to perform better.",0
She is nice and supportive on my work and I can say that without her I cannot even finish my final work since I wasn't doing it in right way. Thanks her a lot!,1
"Dr. Schittjer is extremely difficult.  I had him for an online class through Liberty University.  His papers are very demanding. He is a VERY tough grader. All his instructions are completely different from EVERY other professor at LU, and if you turn in assignments incorrectly you lose LOTS of points.  I'm an A student and got a C+ bc he is RIGID",1
"Assignments are obnoxiously long.  Exams are just piles of confusing true false and short answers that she never mentioned.  Easily the hardest class in my college career, without having friends to work with, you will not make it.  I hope she actually stops to inhale sometime between classes, because she certainly doesn't while shes lecturing.",0
Not exactly sure why Bushey gets poor ratings? Chem isn't for everyone so rating him poorly because you didn't understand the material is unfair. Bushey's class is straight forward and organized. All the lecture notes are online ahead of time and all of his quizzes and tests follow the notes perfectly. He does a lot of practice in class as well.,1
"Class overall was easy. She is anti-phones and understable, if emergencies arise. A lot of assignments were easy but could've been done individually. easy if you do homework and participate during class (participation points).",1
"Patty is amazing.  She is easy to approach, and genuinely cares about you as a person.  She wants you to succeed.  I would highly recommend her for any classes.  She is knowledgeable about so many subjects and I swear I was learning something new every time I spoke to her. Had her for clinical and she made it non-stressful.",1
She is one the best lecture professors at CSULA but she is brutal when it comes to her tests and assignments. Her tests are multiple choice and rest is scenario questions. She will combine every thing she lectured into one question multiple parts. She does curve but depends on the highest grade in the class. She is very helpful during her office.,0
"Day 1 I was certain I made a mistake when my guidance counselor signed me up for his course. Over time he did grow on me, has a way to keep lectures decently interesting. Tests cover a lot of info, but I never had a problem with them. Very strict guy though, especially about lateness and absences. Overall not too bad. Not a ""friend"" type of prof",1
"(taken spring 2020) Love this man! Super intelligent and explains things clearly. Makes economics interesting. Cengage works great with this class. Self proclaimed ""hardest Eco Prof"" but if you just do the work it's fine. Really want to take him again when I can! Grade based on Cengage HW, tests, and participation. Definitely do the extra credit",1
"The material is not clearly laid out for any of the assignments, she doesn't grade anything or give feedback until the week of finals. Her quizzes are hard, weekly assignments that are long. She also is just an ununderstanding professor, don't come to her with any issues she doesn't care",0
"Floyd is the man. Take this class if you want a non-stressful introduction to marketing. Group project heavy, and he makes the material interesting with his presentation style. Also, Floyd seems like an undercover cop.",1
"Great professor. He knows what he's talking about and wants to ensure that you know the material. He's a tad eccentric in the delivery but if you're willing to put in the work, he'll meet you halfway.",1
Staring at the wall is more eventful than his lectures. He is not very good at presenting information. All his exams are fill in the blank with word banks and attendance sheet is there to be signed every day.,0
"He knows something about the topic, but his angle is extremely narrow and outdated. To his credit and my amazement, though, he emphasized fundamentalism's larger history rather than merely clan Anderson's role in it.",0
She is a bit unorganized but the class was fairly easy. To make up for her being unorganized she made all the test online and gave a ton of extra credit.,1
I barely learned anything. The only reason I did well was from teaching myself and being taught by my friends. His class was useless because he just recites a lecture with no interaction and flies through the material. Good luck.,0
Dr. Cogan is funny and passionate about what he teaches but gives a lot more work than I imagined. I've had a paper/presentation/quiz each week of his class. If you put effort in you will do well.,1
"The material he teaches in class is almost no help when it comes to homework. Then when it comes to tests, reviewing homework, the study guide (which is a list of topics), and writing a sheet of notes seem almost useless, because the problems are not what you prepared for. The good thing is that tests are heavily curved as well as the final grade.",0
Im not sure if her class is vastly different in person but I did not have a good experience online. The notes she provides dont help with the homework and theres group work EVERY week which is ridiculous for an online class. Theres no extra credit offered so good luck if you mess up a test or quiz.,0
"Although attendance is required, don't pay any attention to her lectures. Study straight from the book.She wants very detailed answers and is a little nitpicky when it comes to grading. She does curve, and if she doesn't get to a topic, she will delay tests. Everything is straight memorization from the book. If you're good at that, you'll get an A",0
"Falk is an amazing mathematician and a fantastic professor. If you want to pursue a math degree, I suggest taking him. His class is difficult but you will learn a lot. It will be demanding but you will be better for it. I think he realizes that he is difficult and therefore grades accordingly. Be sure to utilize office hours if you can.",1
"This is genuinely the worst instructor I have ever had. He is rude, condescending and extremely harsh in his grading. He does not respond to emails and is rarely present during office hours. Class consists of 15 minutes of verbal roll call followed by 20 minutes of a verbatim reading of the already posted notes. Tests are nothing like the homework.",0
Dr. Sikora is a great guy and a pretty good professor. During office hours he walks you through problems and answers all questions that you may have. He is always willing to help out as long as you show interest and are not just trying to get the answers from him. He is a very fair teacher and makes you want to learn more about mathematics.! ,1
He is horrible; one of the worst in NJIT if not the worst.Complete disaster!!,0
DO NOT DO EXTRA CREDIT!!!!!  Unfair with grading students extra credit after working all weekend to complete a packet.,0
She gave no homework. Classwork consisted of 2 projects that you could choose. All of the topics were very interesting. Tests consisted of material from the book and class so you should go. No participation in the class at all. The information was very interesting and I never minded attending class.,1
"She was really easy to listen to and always responded to questions in an efficient manner. Online the class was taught through the textbook so be prepared for two chapters weekly. If you can manage your time wisely, it was easy to get everything done. Students posted meaningful discussions and were easy to engage with. Overall an interesting class.",1
Gives really good lectures but the test will hurt you.,0
"I'll be honest here, I have never put in as much effort as I did with 116. I went to tutors, I went to the east wing, and numerous other places. I failed this class. Ontop of the confusing subject matter, he tends to ramble in class about barely related topics, such as the history of math. He is a nice guy, and is intelligen, but not a good teacher",0
"Some professors make you wonder why youre going into teaching...weiner is one of them. who calls their students liars? people who have no place in the classroom, thats who.",0
Her test are hard and you really do not know what is going to be on them and the amount of poems and other things you have to memorize for the test are way to much. Also the test are short so if you miss a few then you grade drops fast.,0
"WORST TEACHER I have ever had in my life. She went on about how we should already know stuff instead of actually helping us, and the worst part is that she made us do the Kanji on our own time which is terrible because thats my weakest area. DO NOT TAKE HER u will regret it",0
He is by far the best accounting teacher I have ever had. Very clear and helpful. I highly recommend.,1
Dr. Thrasher was very helpful. I enjoyed the class.,1
"She is very helpful, gives very clear assignments and good feedback. You can tell she cares about her students! Would definitely recommend her.",1
"Me: Can you go over #7? Him: What's your question? Me: um... I'm not sure how to do it Him: You need to be specific, next question please.  and thus my motivation to ask questions in class was crushed. Hated his structure for teaching. Not helpful at all. ",0
"This was by far one of my favorite classes at UofM. The topics discussed will quite literally change your perspective and how you see the world. The papers were slightly challenging but if you go to office hours and keep up with the reading it is fine. Discussion for this class is also actually very helpful. Overall, awesome class!!",1
Overall one of the best professors I have had in 3 years of college. It is a relatively difficult class but is well worth it. His lectures are very enjoyable and he lets the students get involved.,1
Problems on the tests ARE THE EXACT SAME as the ones in lecture. The only thing that changes are the numbers on the problems. Grading criteria is straightforward in the syllabus. You can even pass his classes with a 50! Only 4 problems for each homework. He's literally helping you to pass!,1
"Completely useless teacher. I came out of the class with the same level of drawing skill that I had going in. He will state that he dislikes your drawings without actually telling you what specifically is wrong with them or how to improve them. I received back one graded drawing that just said ""This is problematic""  on top of it and nothing else.",0
"This instructor is the only reason this class was difficult. The rubric was barely followed, if at all sometimes. She will mark you down for random things without reason, and for things I've never had issues with before. She finished grading all my milestone papers within 15-30 minutes.  Nothing was ever clear, making this class terrible.",0
"Mrs. Roche was very nice, but her class was very frustrating. The TIA tests are hard, but I used quizlet and passed them with As. She focuses more on Microsoft Office, but she does not really help you unless you look desperate. Taking this class online or with a different professor will save you a lot of time.",1
Doesn't respond to questions in a timely manner.  Very disappointed with her help with the class.,1
She isna great professor. She could be better faster at grading but she gives great feedback. I have taken her Macro class and currently taking her Micro class. She seems to care a lot about her students. I wouuld def. Take her again,1
She is a horrible professor and shouldn't be teaching. She is a very tough grader and doesn't teach a lot in her classes. All she does is read of the powerpoint and the material on the test isn't anything we talked about in class.,0
"This professor was the absolute worst I have ever had. She gets off topic almost daily; you forget what it was you were supposed to be discussing. Her idea of ""teaching"" is having students discuss with no help or input from her.  Critical research paper halfway through the semester but gives no help on it. Everyone in my class got a 1! Sanity? Nope",0
"He is one of the best professor I have ever seen in my life if you want to get a good knowledge about history and of course, if you want to pass I will definitely recommend gis class he is the best !!!!!!",1
Really nice and sweet teacher but make sure you do your work because you might think its an easy class if you skip or fall asleep don't its an easy A class cant get below a B if you do your work,1
"the easiest prof for the easiest class. He does abide the attendance policy so dont skip more than a few times or youll fail. Other than that, his lecture is cool so you do do other hw in the back of the room. He gives all answers to the midterm and final so easy 100s. only 2 concert reports which are easy 100 also",0
the worst professor i've ever had. he's very knowledgable in the subject but he doesn't know how to teach it. he rambles and often tells us that things are going to be on the exams and then they aren't. he comes across as rude and is not accessible to students.,0
"Moshe knowns management--almost too well! He is condescending and will spend time putting students down instead of answering questions when they ask for clarification/help on a matter. Class itself not too difficult. Not much busywork like other I-Core classes: couple quizzes, two short answer exams, few group projects.",0
"Avoid this teacher at all costs! Major language barrier,unorganized and sucks as a teacher. If he doesn't understand your question, he completely ignores you.",0
"A very hard class. there are a lot of memorization but he allows a cheat sheet.  Even though he was hard to understand, he was very dedicated to his students and the class. He held a lot of office hours if anybody needed help with homework. I would recommend to read and study the material before you go to him for help because he will get angry if y",1
He is the best math professor I have ever had. Would highly recommend choosing him does not require textbook and does not assign homework.,1
"Maybe because it was online ,that this class was so hard. The professors made the tests harder than they usually are to curb cheating but that's not fair for students who don't cheat. They don't curve the class for some reason so do not count on that. Final was harder than usual so don't get blind sided.",0
"He is a really nice guy, but he gives a quiz every week and its 50 percent of the grade. If you study, pay attention in class, and do the readings you will get an A in the class. Not an easy A but its a fair amount of work for a 4 credit class.",1
"She taught at RU in Spring 2020. Her class is easy and she dumbs down the material, but she's unorganized. She never posted slides and lectures on time, didn't prepare us for the exam, and randomly assigned group work that we had 2 days to complete. She refuses to answer emails. I can only imagine how many ppl would fail if the class was difficult",0
"Garyen is very sweet and hilarious in class although he is completely different online. Took both 1190 and 1191 with him, and his exams are fine but the quizzes are horrendous. In class as well as online, his quizzes are very challenging and if it weren't for them, my grades would be much better.",1
"Professor Kaur is by far the worst professor I have had at William Paterson. All of my peers this past semester had a great English professor but I got stuck with Kaur. I got a B for the semester but I got all A's in the essays. All assignments are essays and her grading is horrible. Not an easy class or an easy person to deal with, trust me.",0
"ABSOLUTE BEST PROFESSOR! He is the nicest person, very interested in literature, and cares for his students. He is funny and very intelligent. As long as you try, you will do very well!",1
"Class was fairly interesting.  Yet, she makes test very difficult.  Most questions are okay, but she pulls out a few picky things like random stats never mentioned in class.  You will not get an A unless you can nearly memorize the book.  But she is a very good teacher and understands marketing well",1
"Everyone told me she was strict.  She was not.  Favorite quote, ""Your windows of opportunities are wide open.  Mine are closed.  I'm going to die soon.""  Likes to talk about life during class.  Be prepared for a lot of reading and translating from stories/ handouts.  Tests were easy.",1
"This guy is honestly awful as a professor. Just finished another exam in which no one could even manage a B. The way he words questions is terrible and unclear and he refuses to change anything or take suggestions, despite the fact that out of the entire class 15 have below a C.",0
The biggest problem about him is that he does not give solutions to his HWs. This along with the fact that the TA's dont grade all the hws results in you only getting about a third of the answers to the home works. There just aren't enough examples in his notes to make up for this. ,0
"Believe all previous reviews. She posted a take-home test (a day late) with only 77 of 100 questions and didn't send an email after she updated. Several students showed up to class with only 77 questions answered. She randomly gives good papers Fs, but usually gives full credit. Final exam tip: most questions from chapter summaries in book.",0
"You work on projects independently, in groups and whole class setting. It was a fun experience. You can't afford to miss classes often. The class is intense. I missed classes thrice, and felt a total stranger the next time I came, but much respect for the caring, friendly and accommodating nature of the professor.  An excellent class to take.",1
"If classes are remote for fall term I highly recommend to not take this class, he is not flexible with the time requirements for the speeches, it is really not a public speaking class if it is online. He takes weeks in order to grade speeches and the midterm exam. Lectures relate to the class but I would wait on taking the class if things go remote",0
"I took her summer online class and she gave an extreme amount of homework. Her reading questions were basically all essay questions that were very difficult. She gives way to much reading and work to do for an introduction class. Also when you tried to ask a question she replies with a snarky comment which, made me never ask her anything again.",0
"The worst teacher I have ever had from elementary school to college. I took his astronomy course as a visiting student a few summers ago. I go to a college that is ranked top 30 in the country and was expecting to do well in this course. Not only was he an awful teacher, he made you feel stupid for asking questions and if you dont understand.",0
"Really despised this class. The textbook was awful, had a lot of useless information that you HAD to read through to do well on the quizzes. You basically need a LOT of time to do well in this course. The final exam had 80 MCQ and one hour and a half to complete which was not enough at all. One of the worst grades on my record.",0
Do not get me wrong English 1020 is the definition of boring and basic however this professor exceeds even that. Not only was she rude to certain students but she treated us all like we are in 2nd grade. Every class was mandatory and if you are not the best writer don't go to her for help because chances are you would be even  leaving.,0
"He reads straight from the textbook, (which I'm positive is the wrong book for this class. We received one about fallacies, while everyone else gets the designated ""critical thinking"" one) and goes off topic like its story time. expect full 1h20min lectures. Also gives no information about midterms, quizzes, or assignments. He gives no description.",0
Carina is a very inspirational person. I really liked her a lot as both a professor and a friend. She really knows how to get your mind working by having class discussions which were fun as some books looked boring but with her it's as if you are the narrator. She also taught me to think for myselfinstead of depending on someone else's essay notes.,1
Worst teacher I have ever experienced. Elementary Spanish 1 became level 3 Spanish her  tests are over 100 questions. She doesn't respond to emails. I explained to her how during one of the online exams that my computer crashed and emailed her right away but not response. Went to talk to her about it and she said there was nothing I can do. BS,0
For MATH 106. He is the best Math teacher I have ever had in my life. I wish I have met him sooner so I didn't have to struggle with math for the first half of my life. I have nothing bad to say about him. His teaching is just amazing and easy to understand. Take his class and you won't regret it!,1
"Dr. Pell really wants her students to succeed. If you email her for help with course material, she will get back to you quick. If you need help during the midterm and ask for help, she will give you a lot of clues. The thing is, the midterms are VERY fast paced since there are about 6 long answer questions with only around an hour of allotted time.",1
"DO NOT TAKE HARMONY WITH HER!!! If you are a music student, it is a bad idea to learn the basic from Prof Sellers.  She is very unclear, and while she is very talented and skilled, she is unable to teach what she knows.",0
"The class can be easy if you are interested and actually want to learn about severe weather, but I just took it for an easy ace class and it was actually difficult. She uses tophat for everything, her lectures are boring and you don't really use the book (unless you do the assigned reading. I just dont take it.",0
"The lectures and homework are much more in depth than exams. If you listen to the lectures and do the homework, the exams are an easy A! I love this class!",1
"Her class is tough, but she is very sweet, not to mention very funny! I thing there isn't enough time to completely retain the material but I don't think that's her fault, but how the class is set up as in time. Definitely need the book, and will probably have homework on a daily basis most of the time",1
Possibly the worst class.  She has the most strict attendance policy so that you can sit in class and have her read you the book.  I have other ways of WASTING an hour and 15 min.  I highly recommend looking elsewhere for a mktg prof.  Take Turner instead,0
"Incredibly slow lectures.  Group work is also frustrating because he never wants your group to work ahead or he chastises you.  Also, office hours aren't ""open"" like any normal professor.  You have to email him the exact questions you want help with and that's all he will answer.   Very upset that I registered for his section.",0
"She is way too harsh a grader. She gives assignments for projects and papers, but does not give you any structure for them, just ""do this"". Then she tells you that you did the assignment wrong. I would not recommend her.",0
Sondra Ricar in my opinion is not an excellent instructor because she has negative opinions about students and quite frankly she doesn't try to help students succeed in the course and if you do something wrong when you know you didn't she accuses you rightaway and is a terrible judge of character.,0
He took my passion for sociology and turned it into a gray world full of boringness and dullness. He's a good lecturer but gosh I wanted to run from his class everytime,1
"Doesn't have patience God would give a cat. Had to teach myself, very incorherent on what is going to be on the test.",0
This class is very dry. It's for sure not an easy A. I have learned a lot not from the professor but from my own diligent reading of the textbook. Study as hard as you can for the first test so you don't start off on the wrong foot with this class. Important to go to class because he tests on concepts not in the book and gives you test questions.,1
Best teacher of my life. He is not hard to understand if you are listening. Very intelligent and willing to explain things. Would recommend him!,1
DO NOT TAKE EZELL. May be the worst professor I have ever had. Is extremely rude and gives a ton of pop quizzes. He is extremely specific on his grading and gets really mad if you ask him a question. He makes the easy information way more difficult than it needs to be. If you have the ability to take another prof. DO IT. NEVER TAKE A CLASS W/ HIM.,0
"super cool guy, laid back class. attendance isn't strict, neither is late work (as long as you turn in all projects by the end of the semester). gives a lot of feedback during grading, and overall just a fun teacher to have for art class.",1
"My only class out of 5 for the semester that did not adjust to this ongoing, world-wide pandemic. I let her know my work schedule was not consistent due to the virus, and my internet connection was terrible and I was not able to do my work because everyone in my area is home. Work is also due by 8 and not midnight, and assignments almost every day.",0
"Dont waste your time with this professor. Nice person, but terrible teacher. If youre not a strong test taker, you will not survive. Also have fun purchasing a brand new text book, Lab Manual, Lab Guide AND online software (which you wont even use) no opportunity to earn any points other than the 3 100 point exams and quizzes every Mon/Wed.",0
"Good teacher, easy A, just study and read your powerpoints and review chapters. If you can get an understanding of your short answer questions, which are given weeks in advance, you should fly through your exams easily.",1
"Not going to lie this class was my most difficult this semester. Bobs a bit of a tough grader and the speeches take a good amount of time to prepare. However he gives back great feedback. I actually think Ive grown as a person in his class. Im glad its over, but Im really glad I took it.",1
Very confusing professor.,0
I love his class but I am very bad with math. I took statistics because I needed the credit for my major and I refuse to take calculus. His lectures are hard to understand if you havent taken anything statistics similar prior to the class. Tests are basically the review so study the review! Homework is very easy EOO. Pay attention and STUDY!!,1
not good.,0
"He wants you to succeed and helps you get there. He helps you do the right amount of work to make a good grade, without going crazy on extra problems and studying. I made an A in his MATH 1710 class and finished 2/3 weeks early. If you are a good student, and honestly even of you aren't, he'll do almost anything to help.",1
"Dr. Irani is by far one of the best professors I ever had.  She is brilliant and obviously invested in her students success.  Trust me, she is a ""must take"" if you have the chance.",1
"I haven't been to school in almost 20 years, and I was able to understand what he was teaching.  Enter as an adult, ready to learn and he is willing to help, I'm sorry he won't be here to teach Math 96.  Its true he does require a lot to pass, yet its broken down and he's always willing to help.",1
I enjoyed your class and I like how you taught.,1
Forces you to go to class by not posting any of his notes. Doesnt make slides. Class is so slow going because he takes way too long on the same questions over and over. Absolute worst prof I've ever had. Grading scheme makes no sense. Do not recommend.,0
"I loved taking sociology with Mrs. Trent. She is funny, kind and a good professor. If you put in the work the class should be an easy A. Exams are the hardest part but there are plenty of other things that you can use to bring your grade up!",1
"if you like English it might be the good class for you, but trust me this teacher is Hard.  ",0
"This class was a bit of a hassle since we had homework but it didn't count as a grade, so no one ever did it. There are wayyy to many assignments besides the 3 essays (4 vocab assignments, a journal,2 tests...) Just give it an honest effort and you could probably make an A. Although I hear the other prof. who teaches this class assigns less work...",1
"Great guy, very intelligent. The comments that call his attitude into question: he can be a little sarcastic, but he never lets his disagreement with a student turn into disrespect. He would speak to me during class breaks; very personable, very intelligent. Recommend as a professor, especially if you can get him in a small class setting.",1
"to the prev. rater: i suggest you pay attention in lecture as well as read the text. 1/3 questions from each...the other 1/3 are random, educated guesses needed..not too hard to pull at least a B. curve is insane",0
"Ugh, biochem is hard but there are other professors you can and should take than him. I understand that teaching through zoom is not his thing, but he rushes through his lectures very often. This class is only based on your exam grades and that is something you should look out for. Fail one exam, and you're out from the race of getting an A.",0
She is an easy teacher and entertaining. She posts all her power points and gives study guides for tests. If you use those you will do well on tests.  You have to come to class because she does in class assignments that you can't make up if you're not there.   If you're looking for an easy class this is a good one.,1
She's very knowledgeable on the subject matter.  Make sure to keep up with the readings and study guide.  Also make sure to attend every class.  She's very helpful if you're having trouble with something.,1
"Professor Searfoss comes into class expecting the students to lead the entire thing for an hour and 15 minutes. Instead of teaching or asking provoking questions, it almost seems like she is so bored that she could care less about planning out a thoughtful class discussion. Prepare to read a lot and talk about what you read every class period.",0
"Not a good lecturer at all, harsh grader, and made the class extremely theory based to the point you would just have to memorize everything and hope for the best. Tests were very difficult and he refused to curve or even let kids use formula sheets during the exam. If you're not a math major or naturally good at understanding theory avoid him!",0
"His lectures are confusing if you are new to this (non-EE student here) and are full of jargon. Says that ""it's not a programming class"", but you definitely need some coding experience. Go in during his office hours, he is much more helpful and also very friendly. Gave us the option to skip the final (he'd take an average of the first two tests).",1
"He is mad boring...it's like watching paint dry..hes a nice guy, but hes an accountant not a teacher so he just tells you how it works instead of teaching it to you..",0
"Terrible professor, it's sad too. She isn't very good at teaching and explaining. If you're not one to study and work REALLY HARD then this class isn't for you. DON'T TAKE HER.",0
"Overall, he should not be teaching.  If you like a professor who thinks they know everything and thinks they are higher than you, this is who you should take.",0
"Professor Horn has been one of my favorite professors. She is very understanding. If you at least show effort, she helps you out tremendously. I am so glad I took her. I wish I could take her again but Psychology is not my major!",1
"The key to doing well in this class is reading and outlining sections in depth, so you definitely need to get the textbook. I didn't learn a lot from lectures, but I liked that Sharma's quizzes and exams were always straightforward, no trick questions. Once you get used to the more abstract nature of linear algebra, the course really is not bad.",1
"Horrific. She gave us a quiz one day after syllabus day that was extremely specific and difficult. She is not helpful and her teaching method of having students read and learn the material themselves through a dull and non-interactive textbook before each class seems counterintuitive. A professor's job is to teach students, not watch them struggle.",0
"Worst professor I have taken till date. Very boring lectures, feel like they never end. Very unfair grader. Please save yourself by taking another prof for 1700.",0
"Participate, seek assistance when needed and your time in this class will be worth it; dont participate and you will rate Matt and the class awful. But who's fault is that? Everyone I spoke to learned something more than they knew about public speaking. That was my goal, I'm pleased with the results, thank you Professor Rosenberg",1
"Ana is by far one of the sweetest, most caring teachers at Chapman. All she wants is for her students to learn and succeed. She is very understanding and will accept late work if there is a valid reason. I would definitely recommend taking Spanish with her.",1
"This class was unnecessarily stressful. The homework is not horrible, but it only counts for 10% of your grade. Exams are the other 90%, and most exam averages were below 60. There is not a set grading scale in the syllabus. Also, Dr. Trinh did not feel like he explained the concepts in any type of helpful way. Read the textbook if you want to pass",0
"this teacher thinks you check u email once a hour and when student made tiny mistake, she just give you a 0, the worse teacher i ever had.",0
"Yea, what the guy below said. Stay away from professor nemat. he's ignorant, and he doesn't care about students learning. Everybody literally cheated, and he doesn't even know it. Dumb old dude.",0
"Taking this class will be the biggest mistake you will ever make. Its a lot of reading, a lot of homework, and she takes her precious time grading assignments (think 6 weeks for one assignment). Even if you get a 100 on everything, you will not be able to survive the final and you will finish with a B.",0
"Test are incredibly difficult. Very lecture heavy. Very knowledgable over Econ however tends to forget that most of his students aren't. There are 6 tests and he drops the lowest 2, but all of them are relatively difficult",0
"Prof. Riggs is a great guy and I think he's a great professor who seems to have his students' best interest in mind at all times. He is, however, a little scatterbrained and at times it's hard to follow him as he jumps around. He makes up for this with a generous grading scale. Go to class, pay attention, and practice and you'll be just fine.",1
"Taking him for History of Rock 'n' Roll, seems pretty passionate about it. really tries to make you think more into the music not just by the lyrics, but by what the Artist was thinking when the song was composed..",1
"A TON of homework. One Chapter may have up to 10 homework packets, which should be semi-completed by the time he gives lecture, (which he rarely does.)  Study guides do not match his exams. Grading is difficult to understand. Every other word from his mouth is ""I wont explain it, you guys are at a 209 level. "" Very rude",0
"to be honest, although I re-watch his recordings, I still don't understand his English at all for both lectures and questions on exams, so I don't learn anything useful from this class. The good thing is he is an easy marker and his exams aren't hard (due to open book). Unfortunately, he is the only person who teaches 4115, 3225, 3235, KPU IT sucks",0
Hands down the best professor at Clark College. If you ever take econ 101 make sure its with Mac,1
Worst teacher ive ever had,0
"Rude and not willing to help students, has walked away twice in the middle of me asking him a question about chemistry. Barely finishes lectures before we have an exams and rushes everything, take another professor!",0
This class was very hard. He is a nice person and is willing to help. The material was so difficult. Luckily the curve was good so most people got better than they expected.,1
Awesome!,1
"Very through explanation and gives very good feedback. You definitely have to work for work for it. If you do the readings, take notes, and complete the assignments you will do great.",1
"As a Professor you expect them to be involved in the course and respond to student questions, this did not happen. Many questions in the virtual office went unanswered and it was almost as if he just didn't care. There are 4 modules in the class, each with 2 assignments and 1 test; so easy A or easy F depending on your test scores. No extra credit.",0
"She really is not that bad as everyone makes her seem. Yea you have to do work, but overall she is a great professor. You are in college. Take her if you want to learn.",1
"Lectures are clear and easy to follow, which is important for stats. In class assignments really help, lowest (or missed) one is dropped. Only 5 homework assignments, an online assignment once a week, two unit exams and the final. He's very friendly and even goes out of his way to learn your name. Only need textbook for the tables. Great professor!",1
I am in the process of taking one of his classes and so far so good. He is very caring and reachable outside of class. He wants us to succeed and will do whatever he can do to help make that possible. The class is very paper heavy but you should expect that in an English course. He is very clear as to what he is expecting on papers. Meet with him.,1
Really good guy who is very passionate about what he teaches. Movies are usually somewhat dark and thought provoking.,1
I have nothing negative to say about Mr. Butman. I tried the class out and did not comprehend with his way of teaching. So now i am retaking Eng. 28 with a differ Professor (SANGHA) and it is a dramatic change. I am learning the concept that needs to be met for this english class.,0
Hardest class ever. The tests and group work were almost impossible. The amount he had to curve this class was absolutely ridiculous. He curved some tests by 4 letter grades and curved the entire class by a letter grade and a half.,0
Her feedback is terrible and her grading is the hardest I have ever experienced.  She is unreasonable in her grading practices and does not take responsibility for her own errors. I will never take another class instructed by her again.,0
"Tapia is great! The class online is 3 exams, they are OPEN BOOK and OPEN Notes, take him exams that you do online, multiple choice. There is no way to fail. It is amazing if anyone complains. Super easy class. I passed it with flying colors. EASY-A!",1
"Class was easy enough. Weekly writing assignments and three research papers. No tests. I'm not too sure about the grading system though. I got an A- with a 95%. Not sure what this is all about, but it's my only real complaint.",0
he is a really good teacher but the only issue is he should be more specific about what he wants from his students in assignments.,1
"I don't think there is much to add about this professor: he sucks. Look in SH381. See the paint peeling from the walls? That's how boring he is. He wants you to memorize everything. Solving problems, not really. It seems the EE dept does not want engineers that can actually solve problems; only those that can spit out definitions like a robot.",0
"Good prof overall, however she should have included more of her own slides instead of the textbook slides. It would of been more interesting that way.",1
Very nice guy. But worst math teacher I have ever had. If you don't show up you will not pass. There are no video lectures so if you miss class then you don't know what we did on that day. If you are not confident in math then do not take this class. He doesn't explain the material clearly at all and if you ask questions he gets annoyed.,0
"Bob is friendly and totally knows his stuff. He expects a lot from his students, but it is all to make you a better artist. Flying in the face of ""those who can't do, teach,"" he's an incredible artist himself and really cares about the success of his students. Make no mistake though, you will have to work hard in this class to get a good grade.",1
Absolutely Horrible. Treats it like it's highschool. Rarely answers questions. Won't help you with anything in excel. Doesn't work with students. Leaves grading up to other people. Blinks too much and her only child is cat...Stay away from rankin if you value your G.P.A,0
"Do you like being confused by simple concepts? Then Glen Spiczak is the man for you. He makes simple concepts hard to grasp because of his spastic speaking style and his obscure examples mixed with his love for advanced physics which doesn't translate to 90% of his students. If I didn't take physics in HS, I probably would've gotten a C or worse.",0
"Not very clear, not very helpful.",0
Possibly the most boring and terrible teacher i've ever had. He jumps around on the subject everywhere to where his lectures make no sense at all. Then somedays he'll be in a terrible mood. I always used my phone for a bible and he had no problem with it at all. Then one day he just told me to get out cause he didn't like cell phones.,0
Worst teacher ever. He reads off the slides in a monotone voice. good luck staying awake. does make u feel stupid when u have a question...thanks dick i love F's,0
She's a great teacher who's committed to teaching and keeps the class fun,1
"Very nice professor, love her personality! LABS ARE FUN, BUT If your are not a science major DO NOT take this class. Test are tough  ""This is why i hate teaching non science majors"" Her words exactly.",0
"100% my favorite class I have ever taken. Jozsef made this class come to life and made it more than just about the grade. I looked forward to every lecture. It's tough and classes like this require a great deal of work, but Jozsef gives plenty of opportunity to understand. The tests are tough, so participate, join reviews, and record lectures!",1
Best teacher I have had at Calhoun. She takes the time to individually help students and is very knowledgeable about the classes she teaches. Also funny and pleasant to be around.,1
Interesting and kind person.,1
"Monotone voice, gives long lectures before and at the end of class. Talked all class period once and then made the class stay after to draw. Gives a lot of homework assignments, and rarely gives A's.",0
"Her class was incredibly easy if you showed up to class and did the homework. Having a deaf teacher takes a week or two to get used to, but there's really no problems with communication and she's very easy to understand.",1
"I hadn't taken Spanish since high school, and going into this class my junior year of college was intimidating. Marks made it easy though. He is a great teacher. Enthusiastic and willing to help. Regarding a previous comment, he said that we should drop the class as in take a lower level to develop our understanding. I would recommend Marks any day",1
"For someone not interested in math, this class was very dull and seemed to be a lot harder than it would have to be. She seems pleasant enough but doesn't make any attempt to connect to most students. Not a great teacher; take someone else for 125 if you can.",0
"He was kind of flaky this semester, but hopefully he will improve. Pretty solid teacher if you put the work in to practice and apply the material he teaches. Zappa is his soft spot",1
He's a smart guy if you're listening. He was a NASA engineer for 20 years and spent time teaching in the military. The kind of person who would say anything bad about a teacher like this aren't the types of people you want to listen to. Trust me. I took him for Math 1410 and learned a great deal because I was paying attention.,1
"She is a very good teacher!! She is very detailed with her lectures and labs which helps, but is also stressful when it comes to test taking. But she is a very good teacher, would highly recommend taking her class, you will definitely learn from her!!",1
Walling is THE absolute worst professor Ive ever had. She Has a bad attitude and is forever in a bad mood. She likes to make smart remarks if asked a question and she is constantly giving attitude or rolling her eyes if you say anything to her at all. BC should really get another professor to teach A&P because nobody should have to deal with her.,0
I recommend him to anyone.,1
"She doesn't answer questions, but dirty looks for asking questions, so take somebody else instructing dysorganized and messy class cos talks about herself",0
"Her grading system made it difficult to see where you are on grades until it's too late. Harsh and slow grader. Her general HW grade and Attendance grade seems made up and not based on anything but her opinion. She expects a lot from you, cancels class often and expects us to be understanding of her but she is not understanding of the student.",0
Please don't take this course with him. I took it as an online course and I barely passed. Too much work and his explanation was awful as he only reads the slides- you can do that by yourself. The tests will look easy but wait untill you receive your mark back.I was hoping to learn lots from this course but unfortunately I learned nothing.,0
Awesome prof,1
"He sticks to the syllabus. E-mails his students reminders about HW/upcoming project due dates or what you may have missed in class. Very sincere, gives good feedback on papers, and is understanding. The readings aren't difficult and usually come from articles or books he scans for us. Short weekly HWs usually assigned. Would definitely take again!",1
take her Class if ur PASSIONATE about reading a bajillion pages of history.,0
"I can't with these people complaining about her. Mrs. Trombley is one of the best teachers in LAVC. She is accessible anytime you need, she's helpful if you have questions. And her classes are very informative. It might seem easy because it's online class, but actually you have to work hard to keep up with the schedule. I might take P66 with her...",1
This class consist of a lot of papers but Prof. Dendy makes up for it. She is awesome and super funny! I definitely recommend this class to any first semester student. She helps you if you have any outside problems or are having an struggles at all. She's the best!,1
"Extremely disorganized, constantly correcting himself. The tests have nothing to do with the books or his lectures. Gives extra credit for catching him with wrong information and it happens depressingly often.",0
"Dr. DeVoney is the WORST Chem professor at Stetson. No joke. Upperclassmen have warned me about having her as my professor but her class was the only one that fit my schedule. She was so horrible that my class reported her to the department chair. She is very inconsistent, manipulative, and doesn't want to improve as a professor. Good luck!",0
Recommend him for this class if you want an A to boost GPA. I took him online. Homework that you get 100% for completion and then online test with no time limit. A few discussions but not a tough grader.,1
she talks too much.,0
Another laid back instructor. He is Very well educated and he conveys his point clearly. He is fair and will help you out as much as he can. Hard concepts but he makes it as interesting as possible. Will recommend.,1
"MA structures this class in a way that if you want a good grade, it will consume your entire semester. I can't think of the last time I wasn't swamped and worried about what accounting homework I should be doing. She makes things seem more complicated than they are because she knows the material so well. Expect at least 20 hours of homework a week.",0
Professor is simply outstanding. His lectures are so interesting and action packed. I learned more from him than anyone else in the department. Definitely take him if you want to learn and if you want to go far in the field.,1
"Very personable, he is a bit of a picky grader, but an easy B. As long as you follow the essay format for the three essays that he teaches you in class you will be fine. He literally tells you how he wants each essay written. Interesting enough topics as well. Overall good.",1
"I love Ms. Magallon! She is an excellent teacher and a great person. I did not think her essays were difficult at all, but others may disagree. Receiving feedback from her will help raise your essay grades, so get as much as possible! She is willing to help to her students to make sure they pass.",1
"MR. CONTA'S AN AWESOME PROFESSOR. HE KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE HE WAS WITH THE LAPD FOR 32 YEARS BEFORE HE RETIRED  ABOUT 5 YEARS AGO. HE'S A GREAT ROLE MODEL AS WELL. I REALLY ADMIRE THE FACT THAT HE'S SO POSITIVE AND NICE TO EVERYONE AFTER BEING A COP FOR SO LONG, MOST TRY TO EITHER ACT HARD OR HAVE A TENDENCY TO VIEW THE WORLD IN A PE",1
"Stephanie was a good professor.  Sometimes lecture on Tuesday was a bit long, but she usually made sure that the Thursday activity was engaging and helped to reinforce the lecture from the last class.",1
"His class was boring, the work was pointless, he didn't grade anything until the last week. He didn't assist when asked for help. Getting an A was easy but not rewarding. Would not recommend for anyone who wants to further their skills.",0
"This class is awful. I'm sitting here now and am debating getting up and leaving. She has NO clue how to use the online system and if you don't do the homeworks (which are graded) you WILL fail. She never lets you leave early and is so unclear, for a 101 class she speaks Spanish 90% of the time. Drop this now. ",0
Mangone is obviously very passionate about what he teaches and really tries to make the information digestible. He puts all the information you need for exams on his PowerPoint slides and his tests tend to be easier than Liebig's to help your grade. His lectures are a little rushed but if you review the material you will likely be successful.,1
"Mr. Pilla is the best math professor you'll ever get, hands down. No homework, it's all considered extra credit for tests. There were only 4 tests, and if you get perfect attendance he will drop your lowest grade. He really cares about you passing with a good grade. Just don't be disruptive and pay attention! That's all he cares about.",1
"If u must take this class best advice I can give is to study the book hard bc u will be frustrated trying to understand anything he teaches. He expects his students 2 put more effort in the class w/out anyeffort on his part to improve his teaching methods which is a frustrating attitude ina professor. If u must take this class, dont take itfrom him",0
I liked him a lot. Even though class is difficult and long he keeps you interested. I also appreciate his efforts to stay accessible for anyone who need help.,1
"Do not take his course unless you want ""America is Evil 101: Introduction to Gore Fetishism"" and want to be taught nothing on the supposed subject matter of English composition. In short, the class is 50 minute lectures of how ""Totally imaginary group"" rapes, tortures, abuses, etc. ""Now go write a paper about American imperialism/racism/etc.""",0
Dr Hill is a wonderful professor. He isn't easy but it's because he really wants you to learn about life and bio. He is so willing to have interesting group discussions and to answer any questions you have. Study hard for the tests. They are not easy but he will help you as much as you ask for help. Can't say enough. One of my fave teachers ever.,1
He does not grade tests fairly in my opinion and only rewards you marks if you follow HIS process despite many of the problems having two or more approaches,0
worse class I've ever taken. Lab reports take forever to be graded and she take points off for every little thing wrong. get out of this class if you can ,0
"Professor Easterly is extremely knowledgable and you are guaranteed to learn a lot! The class has no exams and is instead, based on 2 essays. Make sure you do well on those 2 essays and you will be totally fine! The class is extremely fair, though you must be able to apply the concepts you have learned into the essays very well.",1
Makes math extremely hard. If you want to know how to do the problems you need to rely on the book. He doesnt give extra credit or let you make anything up. He will also grade things very tough and doesnt care how you do on anything. He is also hard to contact at times and will not reply on occasion. Seems like a nice person but not a nice prof.,0
"i got a B+ in this class and did so much work , only missed 3 classes and made up 2, and did extra bonus out of clsas work.  she gave someone a C+... she's moody and weird. avoid her if possible",0
"She is a nice lady, but that's about as good as it gets for this review. This class was very disorganized. The TAs made a complete mess of the ""project."" If you really want to learn OS, I would hold out for another professor.",0
"Dr. Wilhite is an extremely difficult professor. She's hard to learn from, but if you're interested, you're guaranteed to receive good grades.",0
Dr. Thomas is a great professor.  He can be a bit intimidating but really does have a big heart.  He loves to talk about his experiences and people he knows.  It is all very interesting.  You must read all readings and turn things in on time.  He is a stickler about his student's writing!  Be sure to go to the writing center for help.,1
"Honestly he's a good professor but he reads off the power point then explains it. To be honest it should be an online course considering our quizzes are online and PP and only meet for the trips, pointless to be an actual class. There is NO homework or midterm which makes it even more important to do good on the 2 trip papers, quizzes & Final!",1
"Every single part of the class covers different material (lecture, discussion, and textbook readings) and it is never reviewed or elaborated on. Discussion quizzes are just useless busy work because they are not handed back so students can use them to study for tests. Lectures are so boring and the tests are too specific.",0
"great guy, take him and you wont regret it.",1
"Not the best teacher! There are better 125 teachers at Los Angeles Valley college. Im letting you know! Do not take this teacher , he has attitude and very discouraging. Dont waste your time on him! He uses fear to get the best of you! I recommend You drop Him right away, for your sake . Goodluck !",0
"Dean was OK. Going to lecture is important, often boring but just go. No cum. final which is clutch. Boring and not super useful, but we made it folks.",0
"Mr. Riley was a good teacher for the most part, he is nice and approachable and will listen to any questions. Bio 101 was a little hard but it is definitely possible to get an A if you work for it; some people got 95 or 100 on the tests and others got 60s. Overall, he wasnt my fav teacher ever, but hes still a good choice",1
"Ed is a great guy who has been working with computers since they were invented. He is always on time, prepared and very nice to students. I highly recommend taking his class.",1
Bon prof!,1
Hard class. A lot of studying will give you a C.,0
"Not a terrible teacher, but not an amazing one either. She seems to know a lot about what she's talking about, but she DOES NOT appear passionate in any way. She smiles and tries to relate to students, but at the end of the day, most students in the class do not respect her. Her class isn't extremely hard, but the prompts are a bit silly...",0
Terrible teacher!!!!! You are tested on material that isnt taught yet. You take blackboard quizzes everyday. He will keep you late.,0
As a biology major I was required to take Dr. Laycock for general physics 1 and 2. His lectures are okay - you must attend because he does daily clicker questions. The people grading the exams are extremely inconsistent. But the worst part about this guy is that he is a jerk. He belittles students for asking questions that he deems unnecessary,0
"Took Human Impacts on the Environment with Beck. She's a good professor and good person. Do well on the papers. They are worth as much as the tests. Put in effort and you should get nothing worse than a B. Some of the test questions were worded in a way that made easy concepts confusing. Overall, good professor.",1
"Professor Flores is an activist, intellectual, mental health clinician, and a very pro-student professor-- unlike most at Davis.  I regret not having taken her courses earlier.  On a side note, Yvette, Sergio, and Angie are the best people in the Chicana/o Studies Dept.  Very inspiring individuals.",1
"He is an extremely tough grader (looking for specific wording in exams). He also talks about being available for help anytime outside of class, but when you ask him questions or try to reach out he is either dismissive/passive aggressive or never replies (email). I am currently teaching myself with the textbook. Take this class with someone else!",0
"Prof. Stewie is a very difficult prof. indeed, but so is Research Methods in general. He however was always available to help and invests time in the success of his students. His humor is a bit sarcastic but he is pretty entertaining. During his class my friend and I would often chuckle about the chest hair that would always pop out of his collar.",1
"Doug is very down to earth! Getting the packet for the class will really help. You can get extra credit on tests. If you don't understand animal science very well then it might be a little difficult, but you can still definitely get an A in the class.",1
this course requires a great amount of effort and work. every class you are graded based upon your participation. lots of homework. Tough grader on the writing assignments. I am not sure that anyone received a grade higher than a B+ in my class.,1
"Professor Zein is ridiculously picky about what she looks for when she grades, and it's very difficult to get a feel for what she's really asking.  Her lectures are fairly disorganized and somewhat dull, as are many of the readings.  She expects close reading, deep thinking, and hard work, but that's probably not enough.  Avoid her if possible.",0
"He expects you to read and will often give a short quiz (usually 4 or 5 questions) over the material. Personally, I just read sparknotes or shmoop and I got a pretty decent grade in the class (it was a B or A, I can't really remember as I took this course last spring). I would definitely recommend Osborne to anyone!",1
This professor does not answer e-mails in a reasonable amount of time. He barely interacts with the class and his assignments are VERY incomprehensible.,0
"He was very picky about work, you would ask him for feedback and he Rufuses to email you and tell you what you are doing wrong. all my assignments are 70 and why I don't know , he hasn't told me",0
"Very unprofessional and inappropriate at times.  Extremely laid back. Although, her adult lecture class is fairly easy. However, not a good instructor to learn from or gain experience with.",0
Dr. B is the BEST.  He's got that rare combination of California cool and oklahoma charm.,1
"Dowding is funny and knowledgeable, but he is an extremely tough grader. He cold calls throughout the class and can be condescending at times. It doesn't matter how much time or effort you put it, he will still grade harshly.",0
"Inconsistent grading.  Like seriously inconsistent.  Get's on her soapbox in class, doesn't really let anyone else talk.  Likes to talk about how busy she is, yet this is her JOB. But really, very inconsistent grading, inconsistent feedback and a lot of work with not much in return.  The college of Ag really needs to rethink this course. ",0
Don't expect to do good if this is not your major. You definetly need a piano the exams are extremely hard and the assignments are too advanced for mus 101.  All homework is not explained in class and you have to research in class. Most homeworks are very irrelevant to the coarse and what she teaches. ,0
She grades like it is a 400 level course and she never answers her email so don't bother trying to ask her for help through an email. Avoid getting her at all costs,0
really boring.... no will to come to class,0
pretty easy.  she is helpful.  good starting point for people that haven't taken online courses before.  several assignments but they are all pretty easy.  you write a couple short papers during the class.,1
Mr. Cayse is the Dean of the Business technologies Division I had him for Financial Accounting 2. He is a really nice teacher he gives you a pretest packet before each test that is set up just like the test. He goes over all the answers with you in class so you have the correct anwers to study from. A little hard to contact,1
"She got into a car crash at the start of the semester. After that, it was a mess. She didn't grade a single thing we did. There were no tests. She made up the midterm grades, which was a B for me, completely arbitrary. She made us buy $50 worth of things that we didn't use once. She was also reckless with her words talking about sensitive topics.",0
Terrible teacher. She puts you down.,0
"Yates is a really really good professor. The class is deemed ""hard"" because you got people who think social psych is ""hard."" Abnormal was a really fun and interesting class. She is an amazing lecturer and the exams were easy if you put in the time to study.",1
"I've had the privilege of knowing Mr. Henson over the years and eventually took one of his classes. You;ll never find a greater teacher or a greater man. Knowing him was inspirational and he truly is a pillar of our small town college and our town. Whenever he retires, there will be mighty be shoes to fill.",1
worst teacher ever period !,0
Talks too quietly and has a really thick accent. I asked him THREE TIMES for the answer key to the midterm and still haven't had it. The class isn't too bad but hes just not much of a teacher. If you want a good result study his assignments - his exams are almost exactly the same in format and questions!,0
Just read from power point slides. Tests were really unfair as many questions weren't even discussed in class. Extremely vague study guide for Final exam. Would not take another class from this instructor.,0
"Mr. Pierce is a great professor! He cares about his students, and wants us to succeed. His quizzes and tests are heavily based on his powerpoints and lectures. He is great!",1
Nicest most caring and understanding teacher ever! He is super passionate for it and you can tell he works really hard for all of his lectures. Such a nice smart man!!,1
"Spaeth's passion lies with Rome, not her students. She's far more concerned with rushing through powerpoints than engaging and educating. Yes, there's a lot of material to cover, but the class just feels like watching someone rapidly talk to themselves. Don't buy the textbooks; just review the power points online. Take only if you love the subject!",0
"His high degree of knowledge shows through every lecture, and he is good at clarifying complicated subjects. However I find he is very critical, and when asking questions aloud in class he seems to only accept the one answer he had been waiting to hear.",1
The class is not really that useful. No one really learns anything directly from this class. I would not recommend unless you already have decent knowledge of everything in the book beforehand,0
The class is super boring. He super arrogant. He only talk about himself and bragging about his connection.,0
"great lecturer, very interesting. Keeps class engaged. Readings are important. Not too many assignments and no midterm. He doesn't post his slides so you won't get the content without attending lectures.",1
I have a very tough time with math. That being said I've had some amazing math professors she is not one of them. She goes way too fast and doesn't explain anything. All her notes are just practice problems with no explanation. I along with many others dropped the class in fear of failing.,0
"Disgustingly horrible professor that knows the class struggles. Didn't teach me a single thing about calculus; learned everything from self textbook use. You WILL struggle on exams which in theory ""reflect what you learn"", but will be so un-ordinary from class and webassign, that you'll spend alot of times in exams figuring out whats going on.",0
Not my favourite prof for a course that requires clear explanations. His slides are very detailed and he tries to engage the class but he's not an interesting lecturer. His assignments seem straight forward until he tries to explain how to complete them; very vague and confusing instructions which makes them harder than they should be.,0
"All throughout the semester the class I thought was going fine until halfway through the semester no grades were posted trying to get ahold of him was impossible. If you wanted to know your grade you had to ask wasn't readily available, just a total disaster.",0
"LTF is the best deal in town! The gym is nice, clean and quiet. They always have people on hand to help you or answer questions. They always have fresh towels for you. Don't forget your ID or you can't get in! Make sure you keep track of your workouts... EASY A if you show up.",1
Loved this guy. He knows his stuff and made a boring topic interesting. Plus he's easy to talk to and cares about the students. He went out of his way to check up on me after I had a family emergency during the week. LOVE THIS GUY!,1
i really wanted to take spanish i was so happy when i got the only class and then when i got there it was so hard and i asked for help and he said that i can do it...then after i was doing badly he said drop...after the dead line for money back passed,0
"Very passionate man about American History. His lectures do get outta hand since he doesn't use a power point or blackboard page. He scribbles everything on a board. Tests are easy though. He gives you 30 concepts and you choose 5 to write about. If you want an easy 'A' I would suggest taking it. Any history book will work for this class, trust me",1
Worst professor for calc 2 DOES NOT TEACH,0
"avoid her if possible. she seems cool at first but as the semester drags on you'll regret taking her class. her lectures are very unorganized as she goes back and forth through time periods you lose track of which your supposed to be learning and what is just ""setting the scene"".",0
Amazing professor!! Doesnt slack on teaching and teaches really well.,1
"Class consisted of reading the textbook on TopHat and answering module questions. Her lectures are 5 minutes long and only help understand general concepts. They try to give you ""application"" questions on the quizzes but the questions are not specific and you have to make tons of assumptions on what its asking. 1 error  6-10% down on your average",0
"This guy does really messed up things like give problems on tests that use notations youve never ever seen before, or material you've never seen before. Need to put a lot of effort in to pass, but he does know what hes talking about and will help you if you go to his office hours. Does not curve and is the most unfair teacher in math department.",0
"Well what can I say , I honestly think he could use some lecture time . If you come to class just know that you are coming for the clicker points and that is it, there will be no lectures you are on your own in this class and the sample exam have nothing to do with the real exams given. Good luck ",0
Dr. Kim is not a nice person even though everybody says so because she is bubbly and makes jokes. She is rude and dismissive. I had this course during COVID and she was the least understanding professor i've ever had. 3 exams are 90 percent off the grade and she gives 50 minutes with proctorio monitoring. The worst professor I've ever had.,0
He was the first professor I ever took at SUNY Westbury . I was horrific to choose such a hard class but I really learned a lot. He is such a good professor! Love his feedback . Take him if you can !,1
"The worst prof I've ever had. He's a good guy, but not college prof material. Doesn't thoroughly explain any part of his lectures, and if asked questions, doesn't fully answer them. His exams are quite tricky and nothing like study guides he provides. Quiz everyday, exam every 2/3 weeks, 20 page homework once/twice a week. Save your GPA and run!",0
"Lectures are dragged-out and could be much shorter if she didn't give multiple 30-minute breaks. Also, Aplia assignments get graded by average instead of your highest score. Let's say I get a 5/5 on the second or third attempt of a problem, the final score would be something like 2.7/5 depending on what you got in previous attempts.",0
"Tamm is awesome.  He's incredibly laid back and chill and has a lot of quirky, kinda dorky things to say.  Easiest A ever, but not because he's bad.  He knows what he's teaching and has this somewhat funny way of spacing out during lectures and expecting people to respond to his rhetorical questions.  Great guy, witty essay grading",1
"Don helped me to understand finance very well. I took finance once before with a bad prof and come out not liking finance because I didn't get it, but Don was a great prof and knows what he is talking about and teaches it well. I would definitely take a class from him again.",1
This class is terrible take another one. Class has no direction the lectures are a waste of time and boring have nothing to do with the tests. Just an awful awful awful awful class and professor. Lazy no direction just terrible,0
Exams were worth 70% of your total grades. Talked and talked and talked during lecture and didnt stop to explain anything. Played favoritism with specific students and would tell them different things regarding exams in office hours. Graded free response exams very odd.,0
Recommend if you are a graduate student. She is not approachable. Loads of reading and tests r hard.,1
"she is stern but really wants you to do well.  if you care about your work then she will go out of her way to help you.  she is always available to help and is really nice when you go see her.  i loved her and wish i could take her again for all my english classes!!! Take her but don't expect to just ease through and get an A, you will have to work",1
"her final was beyond absurd ""a final oral exam"" that we had to meet and conference with her for. she collects all our stuff and never gives it back. doesnt give letter grades, just ""check plus"" (whatever that even is) which makes it hard to know where we stand in the class. you wont know how ur doing until finals week, when it's too late. good luck",0
The best professor at DU!! This class is not the easiest but if you put a bit of effort into studying you will do fine. Prof Leung is an amazing human and gives students tons of resources to succeed. Lots of extra credit opportunities. Leung is hilarious and tries to make lectures entertaining. If want to understand finance take his class!,1
"This is the best Professor at Elac, she provides the notes on canvas and you just need to print it and bring it to class to follow along. She goes over on what will be on each exam and drops the lowest grade on one exam. She's adorable and super sweet. People like her make me enjoy going to school and not feel any anxiety. No textbook needed.",1
"Hard subject, but he is pretty cool",1
"Amazing prof, recommend taking. Made me switch to a socio major",1
"Prof. Hasegawa is academically advanced, but a very poor professor. Her lectures are long, boring, disjointed and extremely hard to follow. She is hard to understand both logically, and due to her accent. She does a poor job of answering questions clearly. Not UW quality,  and definitely not worth my tuition. Very unfortunate. ",0
Took walker for summer session and I regret not taking a full semester with him. He is a really awesome speech teacher and I recommend anyone to take speech with him. Every class met is really fun you'll never be bored once especially with his random fun speeches he does. ,1
"Awesome dude. He speaks a lot about God because it PERTAINS to the readings, not because he just feels like it. He made the readings very interesting and made me want to read as time went on. He's very chill and likes it when you talk with him in class for discussions. Slackers won't do well, if you try, you'll be good. Do the journals!",1
"Avoid this professor. Bad in every way. Rude, arrogant, hard to reach, and disorganized.",0
"As a person Im sure professor miller is a great dude, but as a teacher. He is so robotic its hard to learn. Before the corona virus, I had an A+ in the class and was able to find the class easy because I had people around me to help. Now during the virus he puts these videos on YouTube (khan academy like) and expect us to learn this. Bad teaching",0
Terrible instructor Even terrible instructions. She never announced any PowerPoint project until the day before the submission. Assigns half/incomplete readings and expects you to answer in class Ughhh nightmare ,0
"Save yourself & don't do it. The first time he said, ""I forgot how to do this, let me look it up..."" I stopped goes to class, as did everyone else. Boring, extremely hard tests. Read high school calc notes if possible, less confusing that him.",0
I did the ratings I did based off of other ratings because I was suppose to get her however she had to be dismissed for my entire semester and a pee-on took her place. Beware of Professor Iverson. Retired teacher of 30 years thinks he knows what he's doing. Don't buy the book if you have him. Wish I could have enjoyed a class with Fritz. :(,1
She is a sweet lady to your face but when she returns assignments it is as if she is Dr. Jekyl/Mr. Hyde. She is not clear about what she wants and then takes off alot of points when its not up to her standards. Take her if you want to work your butt off and still get a bad grade.She is one of the toughest graders in the nursing program. BEWARE!,0
From time to time his lectures can get a little dry but he'll tell you upfront. He is very aware of his students and their attitudes towards his class. If you're honest with him and genuinely want help he is awesome! He always had us laughing and the info stuck. Very recommendable if you're willing to put in a little time. ,1
"Shef is a bit unorganized and scatter brained, but he is a decent professor.  He requires A TON of work but its craft, can't except anything less from Craft.  He's there for his students and very helpful if YOU ask for it.  Super tough grader on his papers so be prepared.",0
"Great professor, would love to have him again for other classes.",1
"I would dare to say that this is the worst Writing Professor in NYU. She's vague, except when it comes to her ridiculous and tragically terrible prompts. Then when you don't write exactly she wants, she gives a bad grade and never gives any helpful criticism. There is absolutely no room to engage with your writing on more than a superficial level.",0
"Barely showed up for this class & passed with an A grade. You can skip his lectures, but DO NOT SKIP review day! He gives his EXACT exam questions so be sure to write it all down & print it on his allowed 1-page cheat sheet. He doesn't check his homework so I just passed HW1 for all the homeworks and changed the name to HW2, HW3, so on. Easy A",0
"Dr. Wildman is an amazing professor, easily one of the best at SFCC, and his class is a lot of fun. I personally didn't get along with him, though. Whenever I sought help, he made me feel as if I was wasting his time. I've never experienced this problem with any other professor. I was never rude and never felt deserving of his borderline neglect.",1
This teacher was the worst professor I have ever had.  She belittles and talks down to students on a regular basis.  She also never teaches until the end of class and refuses to help students  when asked for help.  People like her should retire before they stop caring about their students as she does.,0
"This is the worst History professor that I have met so far! she thinks that her class is the only one that we take during the semester, and make you read a lot for every single class. Avoid her at any cost!!",0
"As a graduate student, I've had a lot of teachers/professors in my life and I can without a doubt say this is in my bottom 2. He expects you to teach yourself EVERYTHING and then gives 6+ hour homework assignments that he takes 4 weeks to grade. It's all so selfish and disrespectful and a waste of my money.",0
"His exams are open note, so if you take good notes you're golden.  He is one of my top five all-time favorite professors.",1
DO NOT BUY THE BOOKS. You literally don't need them. I just showed up and did other work on my computer. You have a reflection due every week but its super easy and he's a really really easy grader. Your midterm is take home and no final. Other than the midterm and reflections you have an easy group project and a bigger reflection paper. TAKE HIM!!,1
This was by far one of the best classes I have taken.  The professor was always on time and respected the students time.  She makes sometimes difficult to understand lessons easy to learn.  The class was also very informative and I am certain to be using the things I learned here for the rest of my life.,1
"LOVE wessel and psyc221! Very clear expectations and methods to succeed. Super interesting lectures, and every other week, you only have to go to class once. Fair amount of writing in this class, but you can do them in a couple hours and the essays are interesting. Easy A, but a super respectable class and professor. Considering psyc major now",1
"She cares for her students and helps them a lot. Extra credit was offered many times. She always comes prepared and is ready to teach and makes a comfortable environment. She understands that French is difficult, she always gives useful worksheets. She is a nice professor that needs a bit more recognition. A bit fast pace; the book is always used.",1
"A bit boring at times, but overall he's a fine teacher. He cares about what he's teaching which shows, but the class itself is not for everyone.",1
"Very clear and organization. Take Tabea's class if you actually want to learn something. Do not use your phone/laptop in class, and participate as much as possible. Super knowledgeable, accessible, and cares about your success. This class was the most ""worth my money"" course I've ever taken.",1
"Max has not handled the situation well, did not give us guidelines or dates of graded material (quizzes). He also does not give respect to students at all, and will not even give guidance on exams. It's no wonder the midterm average was so low. All he has to say is what would be on the exam, rather than respond with ""don't pry for information"" BAD!",0
"Prof. Sun is not a great teacher but he leans towards the better side of profs  when compared to others in the department.  He gives many pop quizzes in the class that can come at any time, but even if you do bad on the quizzes you can still ace the class by doing well on the final.  Do the hw cause that's the best way to learn the material.",1
If you read the books you will pass. ,1
"Such a hard time explaining what he was doing and solving. Students usually correct a small mistake it does. You literally have to practice more hours than the syllabus tells you too. He show a little sympathy for my class and gave notebook extra credit to which I thank god for, but I wouldnt recommend this class if youre not that good in math.",0
"The physics in this course is really not that difficult contrary to what an average student might say. This course's use of mathematics, however, is too difficult for the student to properly understand without prior training. On that note, I vehemently recommend spending 2 to 3 weeks before the course starts learning the required vector calculus.",1
"Worst class and worst professor I've ever experienced. Incoherent, arrogant, insecure, condescending. There's nothing I learned in this class that I couldn't have picked up from reading the books by themselves. In short: a waste of time. Buyer beware.",0
"Every week you have a reading and a response paper (Usually summarizing the reading), the occasional class discussions, he has one or two lectures recorded every week on the reading and theories discussed that week (They are very clear and contain a lot of information). He has a Zoom call to review before tests. GREAT PROFESSOR!!",1
"Only covers the surface level of topics while lecturing so youre going to be doing a lot of learning on your own. Also grades the study guide as a test, but doesnt grade it until after the test which defeats the purpose of the study guide.",0
"Posts additional required coursework as a ""just for fun"" assignment on top of the other extensive assignments that are due. Even if you really take the time and try your absolute best (handing in completed and well-thought out assignments/papers on time) it seems like it's never good enough for her, even if you follow rubric guidelines.",0
This guy is almost impossible to understand at times.  Class is SOOO boring.  Tests are hard and you wonder if he ever taught what he is testing over.  Some test questions aren't even in proper english.  AVOID!!,0
"Probably one of the most unorganized people I have ever met. She always showed up late for class and had to fight with the projector. Lectured for about 4 weeks and then sat back and made us do presentations for the rest of the term. She was also not very helpful. The midterm and the exam, however, were really easy.",0
"Avoid taking her for Phisiology. She is extremely horrible instructor for this subject and should not be allowed to teach it. She doesn't answer her emails, she is not thorough about what is covered on her exams. The study guides are almost useless. She is not very clear in explaining the material on her PowerPoints. This is by far the worst class!",0
"He is a super easy professor, but he will put you to sleep so fast. He gives a good amount of writing assignments, but they are all really simple. Lots of grades so it is easy to make an A. Requires attendance. He let me redo a paper that I did bad on and then he gave me full credit. Nice guy, just boring.",0
"Huber often demands too much from students, even from entry-level courses. Huber is very pompous and is rarely understanding of student.    Hard work is his class barely yields a ""C"" in most cases.",0
"If you signed up for Pynns RS class for a challenge, you got one. He makes the course material interesting but hard to learn and keep up with. The tests are 5 strict essay questions long and the lecture itself doesnt even come close to covering enough material for them. Unless you are a Religious Studies major, your money is best spent elsewhere.",0
"took him for eating rights, easiest class at rutgers. there are weekly short assignments that are 1-2 pages double spaced, a easy poster assignment, and a final 5-7 page paper double spaced. everything is graded very easy. the ta's basically give 90s and 100s on everything. only downside is you have to go to class for clicker points",1
Professor Kim had really long and boring lectures.  He flew through powerpoint slides and didn't really explain concepts well at all.  Never actually had an in-class test until the final so I had no clue what his tests were like until then.  Just was not a good teacher when it came to teaching or testing.  Somehow got a B-.  Would not recommend. ,0
"worst teacher ever.. dont take her.. you'll regret it.. she's mean, bitter and wont ever help you..",0
"Liz is great, absolutely hilarious and actually cares about whether or not you understand the material. She is willing to hold open labs outside of the set schedule and will stay after class to explain concepts. She is very thorough and knows her stuff! Ask questions because she's a wealth of knowledge!",1
"Extremely nice, very caring, wants you to learn, loves to teach, willing to help, understands that life happens to people, got an A will take again",1
She's the WORST prof I have ever had in my life. Seriously terrible. She reads off the slides and tests you on pictures but wont put them on D2L. She doesn't answer questions properly and tells you to look in the textbook. Her lectures are 100 pages per lecture and they are PACKED with information. Midterms 45% of grade. 10/10 do not recommend.,0
"Perov is the absolute best physics professor at Suffolk University. His accent is hard to understand at times, but he is a kind, caring, old Russian man, who just really wants you to succeed. To pass his classes you actually have to try. There is a daily group quiz ( if you pay attention to his lectures you'll 100% always get it right).",1
"Ms Wasinger is great, you actually learn a lot in her class She is really tough but this is nursing school. She makes sure you understand the material, gives extra credit. She only has limited time to teach lots of material . So good luck asking questions!!",1
"her tests are difficult. Even with the ability to look at notes since its an online course, students still did bad because she words her questions odd and makes them difficult to understand. She also grades harshly on the research paper even though its a short, 4 page paper that should have been an easy A. Not an easy online course to take.",0
"He gives good feedback on work, but don't miss any assignments. You will definitely have to put in effort in order to get a decent grade.",1
This class was by far the toughest class Ive taken thus far. Tests were extremely difficult as there were no study guides given and when asked what would need to be studied we were told our 18 pages of outlines. Tests were very heavy as there were only 4 in the semester 2 of which were the final and midterm.,0
"His accent is very heavy, he does not clarify what he teaches in class so get ready to teach yourself!!! he shows absolutely no enthusiasm, but he'll give you chance to make up homework if you miss it. I was extremely bored in class, he would talk and write on the board and if no one understood he'd go on to  the next problem. AVOID HIM!",0
"Dr. Wolff is a great professor, she gives clear guidelines on what to expect from her class on day 1. I'm not really interested in Psychology but she makes the lectures enjoyable. She does do random in class assignments so you must come to class.",1
The lecture was good. Just don't miss the class.,0
"lectures are pretty straightforward. take lots of notes because those will help. the study guides will help too, but still take notes! it's not too boring. he's fair enough, and the class is pretty easy. tests are short answer questions, but know a lot of the terms.",1
"she is an amazing woman outside your classroom but ooh do not get confused when you see your grade at the end of the semester. Speaking of the devil, she actually gives undoable projects which are actually a pain in the ass.",0
"The best trumpet teacher I've ever worked with, and one of the best people I know",1
I took the online class.  Everything for the whole semester is laid out for you in the beginning of class.  Teacher has his own book.  Take him if you need this class. You will not regret it...,1
Dr. Ghosh is a really terrific teacher. She makes it easy to follow the course material online and has a easy to follow timeline for everything in the semester. She answers emails back quickly and usually with a good deal of explanation. She is very fair.,1
"After orientation i felt i would do well. Then i forgot  about the 1st exam which was due 4 days after orientation. She wont reset a test if taken 2 days from due date. Must take exams early to receive help with resetting exams regardless of whether the site crashes or you get locked out.  --stupid rule, she should be available att all times.",0
Gives the easiest simplest lectures ever and if you don't understand she will work with you. She was just wonderful and I definitely recommend her! All homework is on aleks and you have an entire week to complete every assignment. Reviews test and what's on the review is on the test. Easy class easy pass!,1
It's a passable class but don't bother buying the textbooks. Everything comes from her power points. Also she gives random quizzes to check attendance.,0
"not the greatest prof, if you work hard you will get a good grade.  You have to pay attention in class no skipping or sleeping.  A lot of work but if you have the time, then hes alrite",0
"Norris was so distant from his students. He didn't even know the SI's name for this course. Exams were curve balls. Whole grade for the semester was based on TWO EXAMS AND THE FINAL - and some points for the partnered lab section. He made studyguides, but refused to post them or the powerpoints to CC. Wouldn't take him again.",0
"My average math grade in highschool was a 76. My grade in her class is a solid B (85). She gives a good amount of homework, but it really helped me understand what she was teaching. She teaches quick and simple ways to do math equations. She is funny, good sense of humor and reasonable with grading. I would recommend her to anyone.",1
Davidovitch is an absolutely useless incomprehensible teacher with no ability to help his students with anything.  THe way he teaches is impossible to learn from without memorizing every single thing he says. But the thing is you can't understand a single thing he says or writes because of his horrible spelling and accent. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!,0
"I think a lot of people can agree with me when I say that his lecture videos do not make much sense. He's smart, but he does not do a good job explaining content and trails off into irrelevant topics. I understand that he has a lot of students, but he takes long to respond, sometimes he does not even respond at all, and if he does, he's rude.",0
"Miller is the man! One of the best professors I've had at ACC. The material is hard, but he has a good way explaining it in laymen terms and by example so we can fully visualize the material. He loves teaching and it shows. He can be a bit sarcastic at times, but overall he's a great professor. Wish there was more grades though, not enough grades.",1
"Worst professor I've ever taken ever in my history of math professors. She is an introvert, which I did take into factor, but she cannot teach the subject whatsoever. Skims through the guided notes, if she doesn't like a part of the notes she skips it and her tests are worded so you cant understand them. Don't take unless you want to teach urself.",0
"Her class consists of talking an excessive amount about phallic symbols, being interrupted by her multiple times everytime you speak, and trying to understand her (which is difficult) whether it be due to her accent, terrible grammar, or flawed logic.",0
"Such a boring Professor. He is a nice guy, yet he is VERY monotoned. Also when he is going over the PowerPoints, he doesn't elaborate at all. I could not tell you a single that that we are talking about in this class. Tests and homework are easy though and the book is expensive.",0
This is the worse professor I have ever had a class with & the worse part is that he teaches accounting. He skips from topic to topic expecting people to know what he is talking about. He gets very side tracked easily. He constantly brushes people off who have questions. I do not recommend this professor at all. I would avoid at all costs possible!,0
Talks a lot while not really helping much..,0
"He's a nice guy and his class is really easy - there are weekly quizzes and four tests, but they're all multiple choice, and on the quizzes you usually don't have to answer all the questions. He shows a lot of videos, so make sure you're in class to watch them. Overall, good professor.",1
You have to work for an A but Dave provides you with everything you need. He is incredibly helpful and makes learning financial accounting fun. ,1
"Horrible professor who is more unprepared then your dropout college freshman. Does not use D2l for any extra help. Arrives late to class every day. What he teaches in class will not be on the test nor homework. Unless you HAVE to take him, please dont and wait till another professor teaches the class.",0
"This lab professor is not helpful at all.  He always changes his mind so don't believe what he say. Every class meeting, you will need to do your teaching presentation. He would pick on people during their presentation. He expect you to know everyting!!! if he ask a quetion and you don't know the anwer to it, he will lower your grade.",0
"Very knowledgeable but expects all his students to understand & know everything he does. Assigns many assignments throughout the semester you will never have a break. Weekly quizzes over readings you have to print out yourself. NO EXAMS. Group project, lectures are boring & confusing to follow, assignments are confusing, frustrating, & unnecessary.",0
funny!,1
"Ms.Jacobo was a real nice teacher but she made us by all our books with in 2 weeks and some we didnt even use till the end of the semester.She's strict on cell phones and her tests are real easy,sometimes she treated us like middle school kids.oh and she let us out early sometimes",1
"Doesn't teach very well and usually explains things poorly, but his notes are excellent.  Teaches straight from class notes.  Requires a lot of work outside class to succeed.  Attendance of TA's office hours is usually required to get a good grade on the homework.  If you put in a good amount of effort, a great grade is possible.  Slackers beware.",0
"Professor Moya is an amazing professor. His method of teaching was easily understandable and fun. You definitely need the textbook. Doing Homework is extremely important. If you need help with homework or with the lecture,email him or talk to him, he will help you. Attend all classes and participate in class. Definitely suggest to take his class.",1
"HW is not too difficult, quizzes are taking in groups. Huge group project is done throughout the semester so make sure you are around good people. Midterm and Final are not bad. Barely understood accounting and passed with a B",1
"Great guy, active in arts scene in baltimore city. Super down to earth and encourages personal drawing style choices while still promoting technique.",1
"She grades weirdly and words her questions/directions weirdly because she doesn't proof read. Also, she wants us to cite our sources but will give us a 0 on the assignments/discussion posts if we quote from them like what??? She expects you to do your own research in addition to the chapter reading for the test so you'll see q's you wont understand",0
"He knows his stuff, you can ask him anything. VERY DRY PERSONALITY, your best strategy is to copy his notes word for word, It might not seem like it in class but they're an amazing resource for studying for exams. Warning, the first exam will wreck your grade if you're not prepared for it, after that it's smooth sailing.",1
"It's all about her good side, get on it. Go to office hours, keep up with the reading, contribute in class, and if she still doesn't like you, be ready for that B+.",1
"This instructor was awesome! He really cares about his students success, come to class and you can literally pass this class and be sure to participate. His grading structure is very good, he keeps you updated on your grade status. If you don't understand something he will make sure that you do. I would highly recommend Mr. Ball! Excellent Teacher!",1
"Very long, monotone, boring classes.",0
The class was unnecessarily difficult. She told our class that she was the toughest bio prof. This is an intro level class but the information she taught was advanced. Medical majors--do not choose this prof.,0
Alynn was a wonderful professor for KIN 150! She was very enthusiastic in her teaching and willing to help students individually outside of class time. She marked the final sequences very fairly and gave you good marks if she knew you were putting the effort in. I would highly recommend her class to anyone! (and she's really pretty),1
"Marielle is very caring, she creates in-depth discussions and the course is well paced. There's usually time-consuming homework but it's interesting. Marielle is easily available outside of class and it's really beneficial to get to know her/ for her to get to know you.",1
"By far the worst professor I have ever encountered. This professor does not write one line of code the entire semester even though all his assignments are code based. You would think he would go over examples as a minimum. All he does is show youtube videos. Students can read the theory at home, they don't need you to read your poor PDF's for 3hrs.",0
Amazing teacher! He is so inspirational with his lectures and makes English really interesting. His assignments really make you think about the world around you in a new way. He is definitely there for his students and really strives to get them to do their best. Amazing! ,1
Kageyama's class is really something. He knows his stuff but I don't think he knows how to teach it. The tests are almost nothing like the powerpoints or textbook. He had random questions that had nothing to do with Genetics or anything we've discussed in class. You're better off not studying or getting another professor.,0
Terrible. Toughest pickiest grader ever. Terrible long boring lectures. Unfair in general. Takes 6 tries to say something. Babbles way too long ab irrelevant things. 0/10 avoid him if possible,0
"He's excellent at teaching. He's also passionate, funny, and caring. I learned a lot from him which I'm very thankful for. Class is usually discussion based, so you MUST show up AND participate. Otherwise, he'll take points off. Exams and quizzes are mainly from the readings which are easy. Always ask for help because he loves it. No extra credit.",1
"He will make you work for the grade !!! Its tough if you have a job , you really need to manage your time if you want to get a fair grade. He is responsive to emails but  tough at grading.",0
"Caring professional, but extremely difficult to keep up during lecture. Comes across as if unprepared and her dry method of facilitation does not help. She has conflicting information on her syllabus and seemingly is using a previous version of text and material; confuses students. Highly encouraged to avoid this professor.",0
"This class is so easy, and Mrs. Lombardi is so sweet. Her tests are only hard if you don't study, but she gives you all of the material. There is no reason to fail this class.",1
Great teacher would definitely take again. Hard grader and sometimes confusing in class but if you go to her office hours she will help you and tell you exactly what she expects.,1
"I would not recommend Professor Jewell to anyone. She does not teach much or give  helpful information, or relevant information. She loses papers and gives you a zero grade. Doesn't help with research paper assignment - you're on your own. Doesn't answer emails and is not accessible to students.",0
"As someone who is pretty good at math, professor Wenstrom seemed like a great teacher who explains the information thoroughly, very passionate about math even at 8am. The class before exams she reviews the units material, if you have specific questions she will walk you through it step by step. The 143 finals are much easier then the unit exams.",1
Watts is one of the nicest teachers I've had. She's super flexible with due dates and really wants you to succeed. You have to write a good amount for the class but it's not difficult at all. I would  definitley take her for any English class.,1
Dr. Israel obviously knows what he's doing but he's not always the best at watering down concepts. My biggest complaint is that 90% of the test is multiple choice graded on a right/wrong basis with no points for work. Easy to tank your grade by making a small mistake. This class has the same curriculum as BC calc only with tougher problems.,1
Karen is very fair and has great tricks to help you remember things. The class is tough but you get what you put into it. I truly enjoyed the class and saw my grade increase as the semester went on which showed that she was effective at teaching the material. Would take another class with her.,1
"She's a nice professor, her class was just very dry and a lot of busy work.",0
I've only taken the course for a month and my class is too afraid to ask questions cus she makes math more confusing,0
"Doctor Shahrrava may be good in his field, but he is definitely not a great professor. He lacks everything that a teacher/professor should possess. He teaches as if he is talking to himself, totally ignoring questions asked by students. He lacks communication, compassion, understanding, etc. for his students. He should retire as a professor!",0
"She is a fair grader and tells you what you need to know for the exams. She can be a little rough around the edges but overall is a good professor and teaches the material in a manner where everyone can understand. As long as you study and practice for the exams, the class is not that bad.",1
"Will is really approachable and seems genuinely interested in helping his students succeed. This is a really hard course though. If you are not a good writer, you should set aside time before taking this course to improve, or you will definitely not do well as 90% of your grade is based on writing assignments (blog posts, research paper etc.)",1
Very difficult to understand him. Long winded explanations that dont clearly answer questions. Never fully completes examples put on the board. Tests are extremely difficult.,0
"Maybe it was just me but I was bored out of my mine in this class he has a strong accent, he just talks and talks with out letting u get a word in about what he's speaking on as he's speaking on it. In overall hated this class. No lap tops no cell phones but others in class said they would take him again just because they know what to expect.",0
Sure she knows her stuff on political analysis but she is a horrible professor. Pop quizzes on the days most kids are absent(like the day b4 thanksgiving) and 7 memos total in the class. She couldn't care less about her students and literally makes sure they do bad. The class is extremely boring and she makes sure we go overtime every class.,0
"He is very lecture heavy, and flies through the material as if you already know it all just as good as him, which isn't the case or you wouldn't be taking this class. Not very good at explaining unless you ask him 1 on 1, which you would have to do for every question. A quiz everyday, and then a test every 3/4 weeks. You teach yourself if possible.",0
"Participation is important to her and will ask you to participate directly. She is enthusiastic about the subject and is very critical of you if you do not do your work. In this manner I think she is caring, she gives at least 2 short essays per week, final is on book of choice. Musts, use the writing center, check your grammar, submit on time.",1
"In the beginning you think what a great teacher...then he grades analytical essays that he makes you do all semester. He has very opinionated views and grading system. This shouldn't be a history class, more like a essay competition class to make him jump out of his seat but that won't happen b/c he thinks everyone sucks at writing except himself.",0
Awesome professor.  Funny and very knowledgable.  Makes the material interesting and easy to understand.  Goes the extra mile to help with exam prep.,1
He's a great professor! Very clear and passionate about what he teaches. His tests are straight forward but they do require a lot of studying and paying attention to his lectures! He records all lectures so you can re-listen.,1
Dr. Solano is a good guy. He's not like some of the other professors who just show up and treat each class like a routine. He really wants his students to succeed and will work with you to make sure that happens. Operations Management isn't the easiest subject but Dr. Solano teaches it very well. You'll get an A if you take it seriously!,1
"I took the Psych-1 6 week course during summer and it wasn't bad at all. The class consists of weekly discussions which are easy points. There were two 10 question quizzes & a few other assignments, four 50 question exams and an 80 question final. The exams and final were a bit difficult but take advantage of the 2 chances the professor provides!",1
"If you want to learn child and adolescent psychology, do not take this class. It is a very easy A but you do not learn a thing.",0
"Midterm had a bunch of curve-ball questions that asked for details that were NOT in her lecture slides. Final is ""cumulative"" but only focuses on material after midterm. It was surprisingly 10x easier than the midterm because questions were straightforward from lecture slides. Tests are MC (requires to circle ALL that apply) and Short Answers.",1
"He's a good teacher if you follow his instructions. I often went to see him during office hours and spent 16 hours a week on his essays. Believe me you need a lot of time, because he's not an easy teacher.  Gives good feedback on essays and assigns a lot of reading from textbook. I strongly recommend finishing essays ahead of time for his feedback.",1
"I'm taking his Gallatin class Moral Behavior, sediment and psychology. It's interesting, but honestly, I zone out during some discussions because his inability to answer questions. He's a true philosopher and will never say anything definitive.",1
I had Dr. Venus for one semester and he was great! He was a little slow when it came to getting grades back but he had great classes! He was always making jokes and making class fun! I always enjoyed his classes and looked forward to them! He would always help you if you got stuck on finding a topic or needed help when writing your essays!,1
"Dr Kevin is very understanding and kind. I took PSY 4485 Online. Weekly assignments about interesting subjects and 3 tests that you will have 8(yes, eight) days to submit. The easiest class you can take with the kindest teacher you can find. Take him!!!",1
I didn't believe the rumors I'd heard. I should have. Flee this class. You're still reading. Flee I said!,0
She is terrible!I don't know what these other people are saying when they say she is willing to help because she doesn't at all!I was nothing but polite to her and she refuses to asnwer any questions without telling me to look it up myself or make me feel like an idiot.Teachers are supposed to help and guide you not tell you to look it up yourself!,0
he's a nice guy but he disarms you with his kindness then half way though the quarter you realize your doing way too much unnecessary work to justify for an English 101 class. Attendance is graded and you will be test on his lectures on the finals. You will turn everything on canvas & online quizzes are taken in class. he's very loud speaker,0
"DEFINITELY not an easy course or professor. I busted my butt in that class and barely passed. On the first day of class, the class was completely full, some students even had to stand because there weren't desks available (40+ students) at the end of the course: there were only 6 of us left. SIX STUDENTS. SIX!!! But I will admitI learned A LOT.",0
is the hardest teacher u will ever take in your life......hes boring and his lectures are boring its hard to pay attention.... he a smart guy but a smartalic... the tests ha u might as well get the drop sheet ready.....,0
Thad is seriously the best! I wish he was full time so he had more time for his students. Lecture exams are graded instantly- lab exams can take a couple weeks. He makes online lab quizzes which is nice. Gives good analogies and is really funny so it makes the material easier to learn. Gives study guides that are just like exam. Cummalitve final.,1
"Mr. Mac has a very particular teaching style that works really well for some, but for most it isn't the best. He tells you and expects you to come to class already knowledgable about the material. If you don't get it, he won't help in class and gives really cryptic comments. Do not take if you learn by doing b/c he doesn't teach at all in class",0
"Wasn't the biggest fan of this class but she tried. Thats all that matters right? Basically, her class is all lecture based and most people dont learn well from sitting listening to someone talk (while also repeating themselves over and over using different wording) for three hours.",1
Hilarious commentary from previous HSC 4930 evaluation. I've had Dr. Moorhouse for 2 classes and he is beyond fair.,1
"He takes a ""simple"" concept and complicates it . He is reading ,word for word, from the book and somehow makes this more unclear.  I don't know how he has not noticed that his attendance is less then 1/2, it seems like he does not care.",0
"My OPINION of Grachev as a teacher: The second-worst professor I've ever had. Not accessible at all. His grading policy is easy, but unfair. Nobody puts much effort into his class, but only approx. 1/3 of the class gets an A. If you get an A, you lucked out..if you get a B, too bad. If you get a C, you probably put forth absolutely no effort.",0
Rude and demeaning. She doesn't care about her students. She goes over your head and never bothers to clear anything up. She may know the material but can't teach it. ,0
Two Exams. Super lazy professor. Doesn't seem to know how to use tech or online systems correctly. Tried to conduct the class via E-mail. Only good thing is that the class is based on two papers. But don't expect to learn anything through his lectures. It's a self teach type circumstance. Oh and he looks like Bob Ross. No joke.,0
I gave him a good review earlier but now that I am in 122 I see that he did not do the subject justice. I am completely unprepared for this class and its only the first week. Please take a better teacher if you need to go on in chemistry. 121 is the foundation for the rest and I feel totally lost thanks to the poor teaching of professor Heske.,0
"A solid choice for theology. Definitely not the easiest grader, and lots of reading. Having that said, he was a super chill guy, he was his lectures easy to follow with terms he told you in advance you needed to know. You truly do not have to read anything and you'll get a B.",1
"He is a really great guy, but I would definitely not take him again. On all of the papers if they are not what HE wants them to be about or the thesis HE wants he will give you a bad grade. I, along with other classmates, put a lot of effort into this class and didn't come out with the grade we felt like we deserved. DO NOT TAKE HIM.",1
"She is the most horrible instructor I have ever had in my life!  She does't respond to emails, doesn't update d2l, doesn't grade assignments promptly, grading system is a joke, she grades and gives grades on however she wants, and she's not punctual herself but expects that from us.  Literally she makes you read the whole book. hardly lectures",0
"I took this class as an elective in my major and she treats the students as if we all have PhD's. Her grading criteriaexpectations are for graduate level students, even if you think you did well, you didn't.  A failing grade is her ""average"" and you have to work your way up from there. Flaunts her intelligence more than she actually teaches.  ",0
"She is the perfect professor for GESM, one of the easiest GESMs that allow you to actually learn something and get an A. Go to every vision & voice she ask and do the little homework she assigned then you will get an A. She cares about every student and put all her efforts on every class. Available in Spring (probably Autumn) semester.",1
"He is the most specific grader I have every seen.  He docks off points for the way one writes their symbols.  I once overheard him tell a student that he will give him/her a zero on the test if he/she writes too small for his liking.  He seems passionate about math and one's understanding of the material.  Good guy, awful grader.",0
"There's a reason there aren't any positive reviews for this professor. Reads slides during the lecture which can be found online, going to class is completely pointless. midterm much harder than the quizzes and homework and he doesn't curve grades, so good luck.",0
"Professor Moss was a real one. Her lectures may have been exhausting in a long class, but the class was alright. Learned more about street art and especially graffiti. There was some awkward nude art moments, but the rest of the class was pretty simple with not much work to do at all. Final group presentation at the end, two exams.",1
he is lazy....he should be paying us to take the course.  i didn't learn a thing in this course and if you don't play like a pro then you do aweful and he doesn't respect you.,0
"She is very unclear and disorganized. She assigns videos to watch for homework and then questions to answer,but she does not give trigger warnings for them. I have had panic attacks because of this. Be careful with ""Tough Guise 2"" and ""Iron Jawed Angels"". She will make you watch these so be careful if you are uncomfortable with gore, abuse, &rape.",0
One of the best prof in dealing with the current situation! 1)livestream lectures(also recorded). 2)online office hours. 2)cancelled remaining assignments + posted their solutions. 3)fair assessment measures (he is using proctorio for exam + helping us practice on the system). 4)changed his grading scheme for the benefit of students. 5)very caring.,1
" very energetic women & makes class interesting, when it comes to grading (esp papers) extremely hard.  her hand writing is worse than a doctors. She will give feedback all over papers, but its illegible.  I went to office hours and she actually turned me away because she had 2 students coming at the same time. Makes EASY quest impossible to answer",0
screw this class!!! worst class i have ever taken at ucr. ridiculous group paper and 4 HARD HARD HARD tests! she is rude and thinks she is better than everybody else,0
Carrie made class enjoyable with creative group oriented activities. She was very easy going and kept us engaged. She was very lax with timelines and due dates and she taught us meditation techniques. A very delightful lady!,1
"Professor Zank is a very nice guy who is genuinely interested on educating his students about the various bible. His class is easy, I hardly paid attention & got an A. Exams are based off his notes which are readily available online. He is not that clear, so try to sit in front to hear him clearly. Lectures arent that organised but that's his style",1
Very easy class. Get the book!,1
Very nice and chill guy. He cares about his students. Gives a lot of extensions.,1
Extremely unorganized. Not timely with handing back grades from anything else besides tests. Reads off a packet each lecture as his lesson. You come out very unprepared for the departmental exams (which are tricky). Expectations in class are unclear. Take anyone else but him. You won't learn anything and you'll struggle on the tests.,1
"I took him for a class that was actually about religion and science. He is the most biased professor I've ever had. He talks nonsense, trying to make intelligent, well spoken students feel like idiots. There's no point in reasoning with this gorilla.",0
"Tests are way too hard for a course that should be straight forward. Ive taken exams in the past that were worth 300 points, but thats the entire class grade. 3 exams, 100 points each, thats it. Mainly based on Essay Questions and 25 multiple choice. Avoid if you can. If you have to take this class just make sure you dont take it lightly.",0
"Old fashion teaching- assignments,assignments,assignments. Hard grader.",0
"Honestl dont know how people even rated this man nicely. Literally his lectures are way longer than needed to be. Everything they talk about honestly doesnt help, just do it for the pop up quizzes but wont help for exams. For exams you really need to do a lot of practice problems from the textbook, not from his recordings. Really rude, and arrogant",0
This course is very reading heavy. If you don't do the readings you won't pass. Dr. Meade provides a reading schedule at the beginning of the semester and I HIGHLY recommend you stick with doing the assigned readings on the assigned dates so you don't fall behind. Dr. Meade is super understanding and the class is so interesting!!,1
This class was taken this summer and it was very tough to get an A with such little time to do all the work. The class was very interesting and you will definitely learn a lot! Not an easy A that is for sure.,1
Who has two thumbs and makes chemistry more difficult than it needs to be?? Dr. Evans. He is soo tough he barely ever talks and uses hand gestures to get his point across. Usually he just grunts and picks up things because he is unusually strong. He kept getting stronger during classes and began to smash things. I think he was also turning green.,0
"LOVE HER. Be respectful and she will be your bff. She's a super easy grader and as long you listen she tells you everything she's looking for on the speeches. Tests are easy and she tells you what it will be on. Final isn't cumulative, basically just another test. Textbook is definitely needed to ace the tests though. Easiest A ever.",1
"Was my first SCC class  summer '15, very glad I took it. She would tell us when the schedule would change & clarified information when asked. Her lectures were interesting & helpful(sometimes got little tiring), went along well with the book.  Her stories were funny too. You MUST attend class.  Reading the book helps, a lot. She knows her stuff.",1
"Professor Sobhi is the best for teaching General Chemistry, he really cares about his students success , and his exams , and quizzes are from the lecture , you need to attend regularly to get a good grade , he is aswome .",1
Impossible to get good grades with how he has his TAs grade our work. He does not make clear how papers are graded. I also never understood the logic behind TAs grading student essays cuz they are not even an expert in the field yet.,0
Jenneke is a fabulous teacher.  Her commitment to the students is absolute and she is always willing to go the extra mile to make sure that everyone is on board.  The class was rigorous but not difficult - she made the process of absorbing a new language fun and as easy as possible.  Highly recommend!,1
"Great online class, definitely recommend her!",1
She goes right off her powerpoints which teaches you NOTHING: you can obviously read. she gives you chapters to read each night but does TEACH you anything. she gives reviews for exams but then SURPRISE: only a few things she went over is actually on the exam. Papers are easy. Exams are hard. POP QUIZZES!!!,0
Easily gets distracted. Rambles a lot. Turns a five minute information session into 20 useless minutes. She can be demeaning and talk down to you. Can make you feel very stupid. Also doesn't mind confronting and embarrassing you in front of your patients so make sure you are 100% ready to enter the patient's room with her.,0
"Super understanding professor, very laid back with lectures and homework. You can tell he actually cares about students learning and not so much on grading. Would take him for every MKT class if I could.",1
"She is the best professor EMU has. You need to go to class and pay attention and you will do well, she is excellent at explaining the material and will do anything to help her students. This is not an easy class by any means but if you listen to her and prepare for exams you can most definitely get an A. Her exams are extremely fair.",1
"Athar is a great guy, but terrible teacher. I don't want to be mean, but his accent is very hard to understand. He just hands out packets in class and expects you to teach yourself. He answers questions, but doesn't explain answers. His reviews for the exams are also lackluster.",0
He was not clear on grading and did not understand what he was teaching most of the time. He would ask the class if he was doing a problem right and sometimes end up teaching us the wrong methods so come test time--when he knew how to do it--he would grade it using the correct method and our grades would tank. Would not recommend.,0
"A lot of fun. Quirky, and very amusing. She's very helpful with work and goes at a relatively slow pace so that everyone can keep up. There are problems that can be done much simpler ways, but the way she teaches sometimes take 1 or 2 pages just to solve one problem! Otherwise very enjoyable teacher!",1
"Dr. Larson is a fantastic professor. He has been a great advisor.  I am not his assigned advisee, it hasn't prevented him from going the extra mile to ensure I was on the right track. Highly recommend taking as many classes as possible from him.",1
This class is a disorganized mess.,0
Id rather transfer than take this class again. The class is an hour despite the 50 minutes allotted for the class. For the sake of your mental health do not take this class. Studying for exams with our homework and with a professor that teaches differently from the textbook will kill you,0
"WARNING: INFORMATIONAL WRITING IS NOT WELCOME. As an engineering major, I write things based around hard evidence, facts, and logic. In other words, I do not like to present unproven theories as factual, because they aren't. However, she likes writing that jumps to conclusions, so if you don't write like a tabloid, you better learn how to B.S.",0
I really loved Mr. Dayoub C Sharp class. Wonderful job Mr. D!,1
"Peter is a nice guy, but his class taught me nothing. Very focused on sewing and design, but did not really teach us how to sew. Taught us the bare minimum to code, still didn't understand. The way he explained things was very confusing and never answered his email. If you asked me to code now I couldn't do anything basic. Nice grader tho.",0
"The best professor at Hamilton College.  The guy keeps it real, is the most well-read person I've ever encountered in my life and goes out of his way to see to it that you are comfortable and getting the most out of Hamilton College.  There is no doubt that my education is that much better because of Rick Werner.",1
"Professor Yemut is awful. He doesn't care about you learning, he is hard to understand and leaves class early. He teaches exactly out of the textbook and expects you to do the rest. Test are heavy, but he does give partial credit if you do part of the problem wrong. If you work on your own, you will pass the class, just don't expect him to help.",0
"Cyd is good - even though my final paper was technically not fully in line with the syllabus, I was able to ""talk my way out of it"" and she accepted my final project. The section we had was very challenging from a technological standpoint, but we made it through. Good class!",1
I did not enjoy taking her. She was confusing in her lectures and assigned way to much work. I never understood an assignment and always had to look up what she supposedly taught us. I do not recommend. ,0
"Terrible. Mocked me for being shy, and when I became too anxious to attend her seminar, mocked me further. This was 4 years ago now, but other reviews indicate she hasn't changed, so I might as well throw in my 2 cents!",0
"Her genius lies, in part, in her ability to take sociological concepts and relating it to real life situations. Definitely deconstructs the concepts for most to understand. I honestly loved this course, and I look at my surroundings differently as a result of this course. Take her if you can!",1
Fliping awsome,1
"Brilliant. Extremely helpful. The class is ""difficult"" in that you can't just skim the readings to understand, but, if you read through them carefully and ask good questions in class Dr. A will definitely help you out. Expect to work, but expect to learn.",1
"Rarely showed up to class, which was cool but she never graded stuff. She would take months to grade any assignment. However she was nice",1
"Shes pretty nice and I understood alot of the things, but when it came to certain types of science she just wasn't very clear about it. The workload can get too heavy soemtimes.",0
I LOVE this man.,1
She is nice and amazing.,1
I read great things about him but just pray you dont have a family crisis or you will be ignored and dropped. He had the audacity to ask if I was still enrolled in his class when I was out dealing with covid and deaths in the family. Other professors were willing to help and even extended due time for work so I can complete the class but not Ric,0
"I took this class over the winter. Its not hard, its just a lot of reading. My negative critiques come from the teacher deleting everyones extra credit and accusing us of not doing it, and thus giving no credit. My other critique is he provides no rubric or direction for assignments, yet he marks down things you should have done differently.",0
"Bob Waxler is an inspiration. He is so deeply passionate about his content. Take his class, it changed my outlook on literature and life.",1
"One of the best professors I've had, enjoyed her so much I took her again for other classes in my major. She really cares about students and does her best to be helpful and makes things interesting and enjoyable.",1
She is very hard to understand most of the time. I peronally wish I had just taken the class online. Going to class was pointless but was required to get participation points. It's easy material for the most part but the tests on SimNet are really hard. I would reccomend you take this class online or with another professor.,0
"Okay, despite my various low gradings on Jonas, he is not so bad.  He is vague, and can neglect the basics of art (which I believe are essential--such as basic techniques of shading, etc), BUT you just have to GO with him.  If you go with him, and work hard or THINK hard, you'll like the class.",0
"He is not the worst or best. You will have to work for you grade and spend hours on math homework so be prepared. There will be days you will multiple assignments due and some days you will have 0. Get in the mindset to put in the work and you will pass. Will it be an A or B? Most likely not, but you will pass if you do the work.",0
"Tang's lectures can be boring and he is sometimes hard to understand. However, if you can actually pay attention he explains concepts well. His tests are very fair and not too bad if you study. He is willing to help his students if needed.",1
"Dr. Pave is very structured and organized which I like. I took his class for a 5week summer course, so it was heavy. Initially it was overwhelming reading his syllabus. However, he does seem like he really cares about his students. He is active on Canvas, posting weekly. He is prompt to respond to emails. Do the work and you should pass.",1
Seems intimidating at first but he really cares about the student and he's really good at answering questions if necessary. He gave my friend a full text book for free.,1
"This teacher is amazing, if you struggle with math especially in an online environment she is always more then willing to help and make sure you succeed. She really wants you to be able to get something out of her class so as long as you reach out she will help you.",1
He's the best,1
Mrs. H is a really funny and chill prof. She goes over your papers with you and gives you a lot of honest feedback. Very invested in wanting everyone to do well and very understand and kind in and outside of class. Her class has a lot of reading on politics and history which I thought would be boring but I learned a lot.,1
"Her labs are awful. Her classes are okayish but could be better. You read powerpoints, you get the questions from book. You read both book and powerpoints, you have no idea where the questions came from. Tests are hard, not because students don't read it, but because the questions are vague. She does give bonus points , which is the only good thing",0
"Thank God i got an A in english despite the fact that it is my weakness. English requires a lot of dedication. Prof Glauber is fair at grading. He allows you to rewrite your essays in order to improve your grade. Sometimes, he is not clear but he is helpful if you know how to ask. Be prepare to write a lot.",1
"This is a course where you have to interact with the Professor often, it is difficult because the Proffesor can sometimes be very rude/condescending. I did get a good mark for the course, however I found the Proff's attitude extremely unnecessary. There was a lot of interesting material to learn, but I would not retake the course with her.",0
"She was very rude in some of her feedback she gave in the discussion forums , she was not a very good grader she gave me poor grades because i spelled a name wrong , and she seemed like she didn't care to work with people problems that they had if they couldn't do the assignments on time. i would never take her again !",0
"Pros: - Flexible on the due date of homework if a life event pops up.  Cons: - No feedback on the graded homework so you have no idea where you went wrong. - Says he gives partial credit on the exams, but he doesn't. - Really hard to follow his lectures, so I spent hours outside of class watching Prof. Leonard to teach myself the subject material.",0
"Very good prof, thoughtful lectures, interesting stories. There's a lot of reading and the essay tests are killer, but I think it was worth it.",1
"She's insanely hard! I had to work extremely hard in her class to pull a C. When she lectures, she talks too fast and in a way that no one understands. I like her as a person she's very nice. Would I ever take a class with her again? Absolutely not.",0
"He is a very nice teacher, so wiling to help if you ever need it. His teaching is very clear, and he answers all questions! There were quite a few projects in the class, but that isn't his fault, it's the curriculum made for the course. The tests were a little tricky, but it was easy to make up for it with other work!",1
"There was so much work I was dreaming in equations. But, all the work paid off because if you paid attention and did everything, it would eventually click. I thought he did a great job, specially for a summer semester (more like 20 hrs of hw a week!).",1
"Professor Kieswetter is a great orgo teacher! She's very clear and to the point in her lectures, and also posts tons of practice problems. Her tests can be difficult, but take advantage of self-checks, practice problems, and practice tests that she posts for each chapter! It is definitely a tough class, but it's not impossible to get an A.",1
"Terrible. Unclear lectures, exams too long, no sense for basic things like class prereqs/posting homework solutions before exams, talks too much about how simple the concepts are/how everyone should get them (several times/lecture). Homework was lectures ahead of us conceptually more than once. And all this was *before* classes went online.",0
"Loved this class because he kept me engaged with his stories and the topics discussed. He also brought guest speakers, who are his journalism partners from all over South Florida media, talking about their experiences of journalism ethics. Granted, there were quizzes every week based on book readings but as he said, ""Nobody really fails at FAU"" ;)",1
he doesn't know how teach paragraph and which you don't  understand clearly what he want to do this rule that he gave you  I recommend don't take this class.... ,0
"I had Dr. Daniels for my creative nonfiction class, he was really nice then. However, for this fiction class, his comments on student's work were unnecessarily mean on paper. This fostered a non-creative environment where students felt overjudged. Definitely has a complex about ""high fiction"" just because he's published. He was definitely rude.",0
"This class is hands down one of the best classes I have taken. I her class and COMM 1101 (the general public speaking class) and Dr. Swenson's class is SO much better, more hands-on and I feel like I learned so much more from her class. She is a very kind, fun and engaging professor and I would recommend taking any/all of her classes!",1
"Very nice and friendly, obviously knows her work but assumes the class does too. She rushes through everything she teaches and expects the class to understand. Gets frustrated if you ask questions during class. Very very difficult exams,  they are super long and you never have enough time to finish. Shes good with office hours but thats it.",0
"He is a very nice guy, and as long as you make an effort to participate in class and try on the tests, he is a pretty liberal grader. However, he is not necessarily the best teacher. Honestly, the only reason I have an A is because of the SI sessions. So if you take him, I highly recommend making time for the SI. Also, he does have a heavy accent.",1
"You need to read so many books in his class, even the blogs and wikis are easy but you need to take them every week. His test is not easy for those people whose main language is not English.",0
"I took this class online and it was fairly easY 2 quizzes, midterm, 2 more quizzes, final, term paper. Take him if you can!",1
SHE IS VERY GOOD AND UNDERSTANDING.,1
"He falsely accused me of not citing sources when I cited sources. When you do well on your exam, he is okay with your homework topic even if it's stupid, but when you didn't do well on your exam bcz exam was worded wierd and study guide was misleading, he has problem with your hw topic. He is not a good professor, and he deserves a bad grade.",0
"Dr. Lamas is one of the best professors I've ever had. He's so knowledgeable about religious studies/scripture and his passion for the subject really pours over into his lectures. He's also just a really cool guy. He truly wants to see people succeed. So come to class, do the readings, work hard on the essays, and he'll meet you halfway.",1
"Dr. Phil Schertzing is a great professor. He provides feedback, guidance and insight and feedback on assignment.",1
"Easy class, there was supposed to be 4 exams but he just got rid of one because of no time. Makes you buy the textbook but doesn't use it is class. 4hour class per week but only had 2 hours of class every lesson due to his personal problems. Highly recommend this professor for students who want to get an easy A but don't care about computer science",0
"The best math professor I have ever had! She is great at explaining the problems and if you need help, just ask. She cares about her students and wants them to succeed. She is not a tough teacher, just show up to class and pay attention.",1
"Worst professor Ive ever had. The only thing done in class is are easy examples and then its home to do 3-9 objectives (9-27 questions) that only about 3 are similar to whats done in class. Mentions tutoring available but for those students who work at night, theres barely time to complete homework let alone tutoring. Lots of pop quizzes.",0
"She is very knowledgable, but not really willing to share this knowledge outside of the classroom. Not really helpful during office hours. Her class slides are very general and lack examples and explanations. Again she explains the material good, but not really passionate about it, so her lectures are pretty boring.",0
Insane class. This professor did nothing for us. When we asked questions we were shut down with rude responses that were smart ass like. It was just not a good course at all. We worked so hard to receive such petty grades. She obviously had favorites. I mean give me a break. We literally are having class over a screen. -GIB,0
One of the best professors at UHD.,1
"Introductory level course.  Professor lectures excellent, has power point available for students to review, provides a study guide, and extra credit opportunities are available for all students.  If you read the text and listen to his lectures, an A is very achievable.  Overall, a great class and prof!",1
"I don't know why so many people have Dr. McCartney so highly rated. If you have her for Tsem drop it, hardest class I've taken ever. 5 mandatory novels to read and she assigns so much work that she can't get it graded and returned. Aweful class all around",0
"(fall 2020-freshmen) Overall good class. I'm not really a physics person, but they tried to tie in life science material to engage students more. The studios were kinda tiring, but that also depends on you group.",1
"Susan is all over the place in her lectures both in class and online (has in class lectures with her previously). She answers questions very broadly and confusingly, she just wants people to laugh at her jokes and be her friend. It is hard to communicate with her during online classes, she is very selective when replying to emails.",0
This teacher should be fired. You leave his class with less confidence than when you started because he makes fun of you if you dont understand in front of the whole class.,0
"I took her online class and I let her know what my problems were and even came to an in class class to do the work but she was kinda mean, and had an I don't care attitude.  I'm taking it again in class and I'm sure I'll do fine but I won't like to have her as a teacher.",0
"Prof. Paler is not as hard as everyone says. Come to class, participate in recitation, do the papers, study the material, and you will get an A. The class is very interesting. She does give enough time for exams, despite what others may say. You have to study but she gives you a comprehensive list of what is on the test. Overall good professor",1
"Just posting so you all are warned. Take another prof. Dr. Wigginton is super judgmental and rude especially if you ask questions or dont understand her examples. She cancelled class 6 times all last minute, twice before the midterm, and expected us to teach ourselves based on the textbook only. No study guide and doesnt follow the syllabus.",0
Best teacher ever!!!!!!,1
He is an ok teacher. He gives a lot of oppertunity for extra credit. His main goal is to have everyone pass the class. There is a lot of reading to be done by yourself. Tests are easy if you know the bold faced terms and trend on maps. I am sure there are much better teachers but he is not horrible.,1
"Leung is an excellent professor, he always expect you actually learn something from the class, not merely just getting the grade. Although his exams are hard, you can learn great deal in his class. Also, he will give your extra credit report chance once he notice your grade is in danger. Take his class you won't be regreted",1
"College is a challenge in itself, but I know that it is a stepping stone, to the rest of my life. Having an understanding and compassionate teacher, such as Professor Lunn, is the reason why I would take another class with her. If you have not taken her course, you are absolutely missing out!",1
"Best teacher I've ever had. Really knowledgeable, easy to understand, and makes the class fun and interesting. Uses real-world examples to teach so that it all seems relevant.  If you work hard and show up to class you will make an A. Unfortunately I missed a few labs so that bumped me down to a B.",1
"I really like this professor and I am kind of glad I got to have him teach my class. I originally registered to have someone else, but she was absent majority of the semester due to maternity leave. I would suggest Professor Stewart to anyone. He is a really nice guy and a great teacher. If I wasn't transferring schools, I would take him again.",1
"Alright. She is such a difficult teacher. You have to work for your grade, which isn't the issue. The issue is your work is probably not sufficient enough. Show up, try hard, and be nice.",0
Excellent Professor! Gives very good feedback and amazing lectures. Dr Gueye is always willing to help students. Would definitely recommend him. ,1
"I came into Financial Accounting expecting the worst, and it really was not bad. I credit Dr. Chiu for this. The workload was very manageable and she clearly laid out her expectations for students. Very intelligent. Good professor overall.",1
"I think Tip may have had some stuff going on this semester, but he never grades our assignments and is not clear on instructions. The grade is mostly based on speeches and we are almost done with the semester and he has not graded any of them. The assignments he gives are long and tedious. Would not recommend this professor.",0
I have to say that I disagree with the person below me. I went a few times to his office and got the You should have understood this in class vibe. Also if I could make one suggestion to him I would say to try a bit more to listen to students better bc he would often interrupt students questions and then explain the wrong thing.,0
"ACC2203 is HARD. Very HARD. Number one tip? GET THE FREAKING BOOK AND READ IT. THEN READ IT AGAIN. This class builds on ACC2101 which was already a hard class and takes it to the next level. Expect and online class with online homework and exams. Prof. Ozbilgin is ok, very responsive and provides help through slides etc. Final exam is hard!",1
Horrible teacher she doesn't explain at all she expects you to know everything she give a lot of homework and she grades super hard DONT TAKE HER CLASS!!!!!,0
"If I took this course in person, I would not get an A+. The weekly tests were the only reason I did well, and I could not imagine going to his lectures. He explains the math concepts really complicatedly, and I memorized everything. Wouldn't recommend.",0
Very little correlation between lectures and exams. He is very bad iat explaining topics and overall a very bad teacher.,0
"This was honestly the worst class I have ever taken and it has nothing to do with the course itself. The lectures were great but often times the professor would cancel the class last minute, change assignments or just never grade your exams. I, as well as many others, still don't have a grade for my last semester from him. It's almost February. ",0
"Woody is one of the coolest teachers at Saint Leo! He gives you the option of how you want your grades to be set up. If you at least try, the class shouldn't be hard at all. Not many group projects, but definitely a lot of in class group work. I'm not sure how any couldn't like him he's one of those teachers you always speak to outside of class.",1
Doing the homework is a must.,1
"AMAZING teacher. Great grader, interesting paper prompts, and extremely open to student input. Came to him multiple times for life advice out of class, and he was always helful.",1
"Only teaches the easiest questions in class and then sends you home with a bunch of hw either much more difficult questions that he didn't even at least brush over and there's even questions that we didn't go over what so ever, overall he's a terrible teacher. Guess that proves that anyone could become a teacher",0
He is a nice guy and does put effort into this class; but he is very awkward and expects the large majority of the information to be learned in the textbook readings. He is very vague on what he wants and his essay test questions are no different. The entire class was just a very Awkward vibe.,0
"Nice guy but not a great teacher.  He goes off on tangents all the time and ends up having to cover a ton of material in little time because of it.  We covered too much information too quickly.  The entire class consisted of slide shows, which just about put me to sleep everyday.  Boring class, but it was interesting to learn abt human tendencies.",0
Horrible class structure and the professor is a bit crazy. I dropped this class because I had a bad feeling about him. He has lots of assignments and he is ridiculous about how he requires you to submit them. The class has a horrible structure and he treats the students like it is a second grade class.,0
"Stoner is very long winded and hard to follow. A third of his tests are quizzes, the other on the lectures, and you have to write a paragraph about a definition. Only take if required, I'm struggling to even get a B. Very knowledgable though and very kind. Gives quizzes every day on chapters and chapters  of reading so you have to come. ",0
By far the worst prof I had in my 5 years of undergrad. Always too busy to discuss anything with any of his students. Also amazingly rude has no social skills. It is clear to see why he is teaching business and not actually in the business world.,0
HE IS VERY HELPFUL AND FUN ,1
Stupid class,0
"The good reviews for her are mainly because of the fact that she was kinda nice. Her exams were a different story. She does a review before the test but you're better off studying the whole manual. The exams are misleading, even when you study everything she says to. She also grades harshly and these exams can make or break your final bio grade.",0
Hands down one of the rudest professors I have ever had. I have never met any professor who is so rude and seems uninterested to teach their students. He truly seemed like he did. not care if we learned the subject or not. He said that calc 2 was the hardest math class yet he said we need to teach ourselves. He did curve a little at the end.,0
Best prof at viu. Really encouraging and you can tell hes passionate about what hes talking about. Tests were a little hard but he actually made biology interesting. Also tells funny stories.,1
Orgo is hard enough as it is. Do yourself a favor and just take Flemming if you want to understand anything at all.,0
"Katselis tends to just copy straight from the ECE313 course notes when he lectures. Occasionally, he'll bring his own examples into the mix to try to help, but this class was still difficult for me. He is willing to do review days before exams if time permits. Probability and stats just aren't my thing and his teaching methods helped very little.",0
"I Totaly agree with other comments below. Great guy, BUT can't teach. Make you look like stupid when you ask question. Wont grade HomwWorks.",0
"This class was extremely boring. There is a ton of reading that isn't hard, just time-consuming. Professor Wheeler can be somewhat passive-aggressive and rude. One thing that isn't great either is that she and Dr. Nieman both say the word ""Negro"" frequently. She seems like a smart lady, but her class is not engaging in the least.",0
"It's hard to understand her not only because of her accent/ways she words things, but because she likes to complicate the big picture before you're able see what it was to begin with. She's a sweet lady, but I'll definitely be avoiding her classes in the future.",0
"The absolute best instructor I've had at Baker. Most instructors don't understand learning online, but Vincent absolutely does. He gives great feedback and the tools to actually learn.",1
"Class sucks, might as well be reading out of the textbook. Most of his students fail. Dont do it. Loves to talk about his college experience and college football thats about it. Tests cover chapters he didn't go over.",0
Honestly this wasn't a bad professor at all. She does not follow the syllabus because she asks the students their opinions on when tests/homework should be due. She teaches quickly but is open for questions and use the chem extra help center!,1
"I don't recommend at all. U will not know about nothing, unless you struggle by your self.",0
"I took Mr. Stanglin's online 2306 Texas Government class and it was a breeze. As someone who has never understood government at all, Mr. Stanglin had a way of explaining it to where it was so easy to read into it. His instructions are very clear and easy to keep up with it. Would definitely take another class taught by him.",1
"If you like literature or writing, you need to take this class. A great teacher as well. It's not an easy class, it takes dedication, but it has been one of my favorite classes I've taken here, and one of my favorite teachers.",1
He is not a good teacher.,0
She is very caring and wants her students to succeed. The main downfall was this paper we had to write which needed to be 4000-5000 words AT LEAST. If you take this class you would need to start at least a week before its due. You also have to love writing because if not its hard writing that long of a paper on something youre not interested in.,0
"Great professor. Very clear with concepts and is open to questions. The only way you can possibly fail this class is by not doing the homework or missing class. When class is cancelled, she will send us a message with videos that go over what we would have went over in class. Exams are tough but aren't anything she hasn't gone over.",1
just dont take this class cuz you will regret it.,0
Her tardiness policy is wack. She shows up to class 3-5 minutes early and expects every student to be there or do not show up at all. Multiple times students have been counted as late (then she marks off your final grade every time your late) even before class is suppose to start. She also marks you down if your cell phone is out on your desk.,0
"She is a very kind teacher, funny, kind and sweet. But her tests are extremely hard, she says that the test will be based on her class notes, but half of it is something you have to research on your own. I studied everything from her class notes and got 7/15!. . She is super kind but if your really interested in psych , dont take her class!",0
Fast like lightening...but interesting.,1
"I dreaded going to her classes every week. She is very intimidating and demanding. The only good thing is attendance isn't being marked, but she will know if you skip class and calls you out on it. Readings were just long and boring academic articles. She seems to think she's better than she really is.",0
"Terrible terrible teacher!! Very disappointed with her teaching methods, tests are hard and confusing I can't believe I ended up with a D I wouldn't take her again!!",0
"First time here at SCC and I am taking all Online courses. This teacher was absolutely amazing and she truly cares and wants you to succeed. I feel like her motto is she won't allow you to fail, her course is that organized and very easy to follow and understand. Her feedback is respectful and doesn't discourage you at all. Highly recommend!",1
"Class felt somewhat disconnected. She's not really receptive to feedback. If she asks a question in class and nobody knows the answer, she will act as if we are all mentally incapable. Grading is average, she gives partial credit. You must do your homework, she randomly checks it for credit. Quizzes nearly every class. Exams are relatively easy.",0
"She grades tests very tough every test had 2 essay questions. I would not recommend anyone to take this course. The assignments are all over the place. Granted this was an online class her normal classes might be better, but I'd avoid her online classes.",0
"she is very helpful, and a great teacher, she is always motivated the students to go ahead, she asked you all the time you understand? If you not she take time to give you all the explication  that you don't understand she is great and she have a charisma to teaching she love that she don't wants the students fail class,she is reminded each time.",1
"Prof. Sanders is willing to help. she sent out an email after the final asking if anyone wanted to come to look at their finals and because of this, my grade moved up a letter. her powerpoints are a bit disorganized but I never had trouble knowing what was on the test because it was going to be everything she would emphasize, no surprises here.",1
He is so easy!!!!!!!!!!!! He cancels class majority of the time. You are guaranteed an A.,1
"His lectures will put you to sleep within five minutes. Coursework is easy but time-consuming because he's so nit picky. Disorganized and looks for ways to cut points. Penalizes heavily for insignificant mistakes, and claims that's how the real world works. Seems to think students are stupid. Overly critical and just downright awkward. AVOID.",0
"The class always acts like theyre always mad with her and she doesn't have a great rating- but I don't get it. She is respectful, very intelligent, always responds to emails, etc promptly. Few assignments and 3-4 tests, nothing too difficult. Pop quizzes, again nothing too bad. Off topic and rambles often, but not a big deal. Shes act. very sweet!",1
"Horrible. Worst teacher ive ever taken. She grades WAY too hard, and is not good at teaching at all. If you miss any work, you cant make up for it. She is too strict, and slow. Would never take again. Terrible",0
"She's shown up late to class nearly every day.  She is vague about her expectations, and the tests and quizzes are a nightmare. Also, I'm not a fan of the way she weighs grades.  It's hard to communicate my questions and concerns to her.  Nice lady, fun personality and funny, but I wouldn't take another class of hers if I could help it.",0
"I made an A in this class simply because the exams were departmental, and they were much easier than the work we did in class. He is a really nice guy who is willing to help, but he is just not a good teacher. He made things so much harder than they had to be in class, and he confused me more than he helped.",0
"Nice woman, but discusses things of little relevance to the subject matter. Helps brainstorm paper topics, which is beyond valuable for the papers, but most of the discussion section consisted of awkward silences as responses to useless questions. Add feminist elements in your paper to up your grade.",0
Assigns homework and goes over one little thing and proceeds to talk about it the entire class. I've had to miss a couple classes due to death in my family and she got annoyed with me. I tried emailing her three times and she never read or responded. I even showed up to her office hours and she wasn't there. Safe to say I'm nervous about passing.,0
"she is the last person that needs to be in health care field. i missed the 1st day my son was in hospital and she informed me she didnt care and refused to tell me what i missed then brought it up in her lecture as an ""example or hypothetical situation"" critical condescending, its all about her and her life NEVER take her class",0
"This is the worst teacher ever.  He not only puts the program to shame, he also puts the fire service to shame. Makes many mistakes. Has multiple incorrect answers on tests. Doesn't give feedback and so on. If you are looking to become a firefighter, please do not take him.",0
"Mrs. Johnson was the best professor I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. She was very organized, kind and generous. She puts her heart into her work and puts her students first!",1
"Survey of Am Lit CLASS ONLINE. NO TEXT BK REQUIRED. THERE IS AN ASSIGMENT MON-FRI. BUT THEY ARE INTERESTING. READ A STORY HE POST AND WRITE DISCUSION ABOUT IT. TOPICS ARE INTERESTING. SLAVERY, WOMENS RIGHTS, PURITANS LIFE, POCHANTAS..ECT...",1
"Eran Makover should not be teaching precalc. Anyone who is going into a math heavy major, avoid this professor at all costs. He will give you a test review and the test will look nothing like the review shown. When you asks questions in class about the homework he will confuse you more by answering them. Pick any professor besides him for math.",0
"I get pretty much nothing out of this class, except what's in the readings.  The books she chooses are boring and fairly irrelevant, and the class discussion seems wandering.",0
"Definitely knows his stuff. Thinks hes funnier than he is. DONT think this is a blowoff class- ATTENDENCE and complete notes are a must. Types his notes on overhead for class (take notes on a laptop to keep up) STUDY NOTES FOR EXAMS. KNOW your definitions and be able to apply them. Hard exams, but hes probably the best professor for this class.",1
"Dr, Carol is very good at what she does. I admire you information and her willingness to learn from her students as well. Most professors that teach graduate level courses feel they are only source of information that matters. The reason why I said she grades hard is because she follows strictly follows  APA formats but she provides great feedback",1
"Not only a tough grader but an unfair grader. DO NOT RECOMMEND WHATSOEVER.  Also she is not afraid to share her views with the class, which I found unprofessional. Definitely an interesting class but it is not enjoyable whatsoever. She does give extra credit options but even is picky with that. DO NOT RECOMMEND.  Not a nice nor understanding prof.",0
"Fowler is a fine, quirky professor. I personally enjoyed her class, but some people found her lectures to be cloudy and non-topical. All in all, she is a great professor for those who are confident with the abilities of their TA.",1
"Great teacher. Took 3 classes with him and I was the only female, but I always felt included. Asks for the same passion from his students that he gives as a teacher. VERY motivational and accessible. Never makes you feel bad for asking questions. Tough class but worth taking. Probably wouldn't have stayed in networking if it weren't for him.",1
Good guy. Very cool and makes sure that you enjoy class time. Class was not all that difficult. I would take TJ again.,1
"Gives you everything you need to get an A in the class. Do the papers, practice exams, and packet of 40 and Exam review and you'll be fine. After first 2 weeks you get used to his notations and hand writing. Willing to work with you if you need extra time and does allow retakes.",1
"Interesting topic and there's potential for the class to be cool but the lectures drag on and the professor isn't really captivating. As long as you show up and pay attention you should do fine, just be ready for reaaaaallly long lectures",0
"I have had many professors, but this one definitely needs to take an accent reduction class. Other then that, she is nice, but lectures are boring,  basically, you don't have to be there, it is just like watching slides that you can find online, but attendance is mandatory. If you need a credit, take it. For knowledge, look somewhere else.",0
"He's really awesome. His class is easy, just keep up with the journals. He gives plenty of extra credit! Take this class with him, you won't regret it!",1
DO NOT TAKE HIM!! I took the 8 week online class and asked for help with the Excel project and got no response. I emailed him 4 times and got a response that did not explain anything. Way more than just the usual computer stuff. I get all A's in my classes but will be lucky to get a C.,0
"Absolutely ludacris that this class is allowed to be taught at a University that prides itself on innovation and intelligence. Khalsa attempts to use modern physiology to explain the benefits of yoga (mostly erroneous claims) and teaches in a rather cultish fashion. If you have any respect for the advances of science, DO NOT take this course.",0
Great class on Udacity,1
"The work itself isn't difficult, but he makes you take quizzes before the lecture is available to make sure you have read. It makes it difficult since the book doesn't explain well. The amount of work is crazy and it's difficult to keep up if you're fulltime. You can pass but if you have the option avoid him.",0
"While there's no doubt this man is an absolute pro at what he does, his genius might be his strongest weakness especially during lecture. Notes he gives are very extensive, but he will usually skip steps because he will infer you know what's happening, making you more lost and confused the longer lecture goes on. I learned about everything online",0
made me feel stupid.. should be at a higher level and not community college,0
"I didn't enroll in CS 146 but I go to his class for my own interest. He teaches materials that are a lot different from CS 136. He didn't teach C at all in the lectures but he stick with Racket and taught us some compiler and assembler stuff. It's pretty hard to understand in first year. He is an amazing prof, funny and very smart.",1
Good teacher. Cares about her students and makes sure you learn. Took her for math 110 and she helped me understand math even when I was terrible at it. Thank you!,1
"HE IS A GREAT PERSON! HE IS AMAZING, I RESPECT HIM SO MUCH! TAKE HIS CLASS, YOU WILL NEVER REGRET!",1
"If you're even a second late to class you're marked absent (which I get not being late, but I only had 10 minutes to get across campus to this class). It messes with your financial aid. He talks too low; you cannot hear a word he's saying unless you're in the first few rows. He reads straight from the notes, no enthusiasm..",0
"Let me be clear about myself, this is by far the easiest professor I've ever had. As long as you do the homework, put in some minimal effort and good responses then you should be getting an A no matter what. I have over 100 percent in the class even though I was late to a few assignments.",1
"Mrs. Stralka was a great teacher.  Did she talk often about her family, yes, but it was completely within context.  She did a great job clearly explaining everything.  She was helpful when needed and focused on helping you pass.  Show up, take notes, pay attention & you'll not only pass, you'll understand the concepts for the next Math level.",1
"STOR 435 is a hard class, so be prepared for that when you sign up with Pipiras. Nonethess, I personally think he does a great job. There are homeworks due every class that make sure that you keep up to date with what he's teaching. He also gives quizzes so there are lots of grades and not just midterms.",1
"Students that perform well in Steffens' class will get some serious help to land well paying internships that are likely to lead to future work. Even the broadcast students in my class landed paid internships in New York, when most broadcast internships were unpaid. She makes it easy to use numbers in reporting.",1
"Sister Gallini is great - all the negative comments from other contributors are misapplied (they belong in a review of the class and its curriculum). There is a lot of (unavoidable and course-required) reading. You will be required to work in groups, but as long as you contribute you will get a fair grade. She will even correct it if grade is poor!",1
Professor McDaniel does not make this class interesting nor teaches enough on the material needed for the test.,0
"Her lectures are long and she often goes off on tangents and won't finish her initial thought, she takes forever to even get through a slide. The first test took her over a month to grade so don't expect to be able to just check you're grade whenever you would like. Because of this i'm not sure i'm passing her class and finals are in two weeks. ",0
"Amazing prof, really down to Earth and cares a lot about his students' success. Lectures were very engaging, and Prof. Adve effectively created an environment where students felt comfortable to ask questions. Homework was designed with a good difficulty; it reinforced concepts while not being overly hard. Exams were fair, but had to work fast.",1
"This prof is absolutly useless when it comes to teaching an introductory course.  I probably cut down an entire forest with all the paper i needed to print off his lecture slides this semester, which I gotta say don't help a whole lot.  My advice if your looking to take an elective out of interest or for GPA booster, avoid this guy.",0
"He's a nice prof, but papers/ Exams grading are unfair and heavy.",0
Hands down one of the worst professors at the University of Hartford. He never responds to students asking for help and will take points off your grade for any stupid little thing. He is out to get students and if he doesn't have a good feeling about you from day one drop the class because you don't have a chance at passing.,0
"Very unorganized and the whole class is based on the textbook. Quizzes are 2-3 times a week. Very confusing to understand sometimes you're better off going through and teaching yourself in the book. Test are manageable if you stay with the homework. She gives main campus test and homework. However, she is very caring and really wants you to do well",0
Dr Ostrowski is seriously such a good professor. She's super nice and her assignments and tests aren't that bad at all. Study a decent amount and you won't have any trouble whatsoever. She's also really good about explaining things if you don't understand and will make sure you get the concepts. Take Ostrowski if you can!!!!,1
One of the best professor's I have ever encountered.  The guy is on top of things and has a personality that matches. You learn a lot and in a way that is memorable. He get's everybody involved and gives excellent constructive criticism that really challenges you not only as a student but as a person in general.,1
"Burke is the best teacher I've ever had!  She inspired me to change my major to chemistry.  I've taken her for Organic Chemistry and Advanced Organic Chemistry.  Know the in class notes inside out, and you'll pass any test she gives you.",1
"I am taking his class now! So far, I just love him. He is fair and very prepared! I have no idea what grade I will earn in the class, but I am learning a lot!",1
"Great Professor. Super Knowledgeable, tons of real experience, very fair, has good sense of humor, I would take him again for sure.",1
"This class was a nightmare. I am a 90+ student, but I struggled to get above 70. He throws in unpredictable twists on his exam questions that have not been covered in class. His examples on the board were always riddled with mistakes and made understanding the content very challenging. Definitely go to office hours and do all practice exams.",0
"If you enjoy self-learning then this is the class for you. For the online version of his class, all he did was give you links for youtube videos and said figure it out. He also doesn't give enough time on the exams but when you ask him for extra credit he doesn't offer it. Go with caution when taking this class, many breakdowns happened.",0
"I loved her class! She is very funny and nice. Overall, the class itself was not terribly hard, but the tests were hard. Luckily, projects helped pad the grade.",1
"Quizzes after every chapter online, you must read the textbook. The final sucks. Its worth 30% of your grade and extremely difficult to study for. Its all of the quiz questions, however, everyone has different quiz questions. Class is boring but bearable. You do learn a lot and can be interesting at times.",1
"Dr. Attard's a very good teacher. His lectures are easy to follow if you understand the math, like trig and some calc. Oh and yeah you really need to work on the homework or you'll never pass his exams.  He sometimes pulls test problems from his notes just to see who actually takes notes and studies them! The only tough thing is his Greek accent.",1
"Very Unorganized!! Knows his things well, but cant teach!!",0
Richard is the best!!!,1
"Absolutely hated this class.  He is horribly inefficient and unorganized and he babbles to himself in lecture.  He has you complete these little quizzes in lecture to check attendance, but he barely covers half of the stuff on the page.  His antics in lecture aren't funny either; it is just plain annoying.",0
"I think he was by far one of my favorite professors. I learned French I well, and I always never realized I was learning. He has a great teaching style, he's very friendly, kinda goofy/nerdy, but he really cares for his students. I wish the university had kept him, but wherever he goes next I hope his new students appreciate him.",1
"Easily the worst professor I've had at tech. I understand online school this quarter was a drastic change, but oh my. 100 question tests, 60 minutes, and HARD. 10 question quizzes, 5 minutes. Tries far too hard to exert an extreme amount of control, and came off as very untrusting and condescending. Incredibly hard class online this quarter.",0
Someone with such a lack of respect for American students should go home to whence they came.,0
I loved Dr. Carter's class. He is always prepared for class and each class has something that will make you think. One of the best gen eds you can take.,1
Take him if you can!! he's AWESOME!,1
"This class is hard, but Professor Dutta does everything he can to try and give you the opportunity the succeed.  His YouTube videos are a step far beyond what most professors would do.  You should go to class and pay attention.  Doing the practice problem really helps.  Tests are open book, but if you aren't prepared, it won't matter.",1
Professor Reyes is really funny and he makes Spanish fun. You still have to study hard to get a good grade. Overall the class was good.,1
"As someone who struggles with math, Dr.Brown was the best choice as a teacher. He is always willing to help his students. He'll stop during class and explain something over if you need him to. There are opportunities for retakes on tests. There isn't homework or quizzes. If you put in the effort, you will pass. TAKE HIS CLASS !! (:",1
"Lots of reading and many assignments, but  assignments lead up to the final paper and are helpful. She seemed to really care that students learn the material. She definitely knows the subject and tries to be very clear. But doesn't give grades unless sought out. If you are here to work and learn- this is the professor. ",1
"took her online class, I wouldn't recommend her to anyone. she seems extremely lazy asking for screenshots of packet tracers results and seems like she wants it easy and not have to open the packet tracer to see the grade. takes points of dumbs things. DONT TAKE HER!",0
"This class drove me NUTS! He teaches so slow, and goes over so manny things that you should've learned years ago that I couldn't hardly stand sitting through class. He also wrote down the problems on the board wrong more than he got them right. We had to show him how to solve the problems most of the time. Mostly we students had to teach eachother.",0
"All you have to do to get an A in this class is do the work. She is extremely flexible if you are having a hard time getting something in on time. She wants to see a student do well and for are not a good writer she pretty much grades you on your effort to get better. She is very cool, very down to earth, and in general a nice lady.",1
"Extremely unreasonable. Unwilling to help students, spends most of her class giving long lectures that aren't related to the syllabus. Whoever reads this, please don't choose her as your professor.",0
"Class is easy, but time consuming. HW & quizzes are done on the McGraw-Hill Connect website. The HW is over 100 questions per assignment. Weekly discussions are simple, post and comment on one other. Her due dates & times are always messed up so be sure to check them. She isn't helpful & doesn't respond to emails. The final paper is ridiculous.",0
"Professor Ray is such a harsh grader for no reason. If you want feedback good luck. The class was converted to online, and he made it 10x worse.",0
"Attendance isn't mandatory, but it does affect your grade. Come to class, take notes, and everything else will be easy.",1
"This class requires you to practically live on quizlet. All she does in class is go over the terms, so attendance doesn't really matter. YOU HAVE TO STUDY. The tests are mainly memorization over word parts, very easy if you study.",1
"The subject itself is tough here at W&M, but if you need to take it, take it with Humber. He's a good mix of understanding, helpful, and clear, while also being intimidating, disorganized, and genuinely brilliant. You'll learn to love him, but you still might not do well if math isn't your thing. He's helpful and pretty young. Not bad, not bad.",1
"a complete mean, arrogant man. Had for visual fund. He recently told the class that we deserved to die if we did not vote (in which it is against some of the classmates religion) and also that 85 percent of the class is waisting their time in school and will be working in retail in their future. Forgive me if i am wrong, but teachers are to help mo",0
"She is very enthusiastic about her work, however the content she says to study and the questions on the tests don't seem to line up, or the question takes that extra step. Lots of extra-step questions, so you really have to KNOW what you've studied. Tests are hard, though there are few of them. Rushed lecture a bit in my experience. Detail-oriented",0
JOKE. I learned more about time and territory management during my summer internship.,0
"Dr. Lin is one of my favorite professors of all time. I'm not even a psychology major but she made everything so easy to understand. Her lectures are clear and tests are straightforward. If you put in the work, she will recognize that.",1
be careful!!he deducts points on your exams even though you do them the right way.,0
Her tests are all writing and if it isn't in her words you don't get credit for it. Awkwardly stares at everyone in class and makes you write a short essay everyday in the beginning of class,0
Very hard to understand. Changes direction with her speech so much you cant follow her. Also grades alot harder after drop date.,0
"Avoid this prof at ALL costs. I'm in my fourth year and this was one of my toughest classes, it was supposed to be an elective. Lectures took me 4 hours to get through, no midterm review, tons of textbook material, HARD and time-constraining tests, and extremely hard marker on essays. She was also short with me when I emailed her a question. AVOID!",0
"Her tests are very easy, the projects are great, and she makes Computer Science understandable for everybody.  One of my favorite professors so far!",1
"George was an amazing professor and made what could have been a really dull class so intriguing and interesting. His lectures were awesome, and I adored the class, although it was a lot to remember and learn. Make sure you do the readings as they are integral to understanding material.",1
Brill teacher ... would take again in a heartbeat. Always takes time out of his life to help us.,1
"Dr. Mock is a tough grader. I feel like I tried so hard to do well on his tests and could never get over an 80. This was the hardest class I have taken just because of that. With that being said, hes still great and very, very smart. Just pay attention and dont skip a lecture. He gives NO extra credit",1
"Great, keep it up",1
"Not the most organized, but  flexible.  Passionate about the subject.  Focus on vocabulary, like he says, and you will get an A. Vocab, vocab, vocab. He explains grammar better than the three other EnglishArabic professors I've had. Brilliant man. ",1
"First things first, his voice is the most monotone voice I have ever heard. If you do something wrong he looks at you like youre stupid. He goes on and on about the lottery and plays the hump day commercial before every class. He tries too hard in trying to make you laugh rather than actually teaching.",0
"If English is your second language, never take this professor. I repeat. NEVER! He expects all the students to already be A grade authors. The homework that is given is very hard to do. too much course load. if you are just average at English, do not take this prof.",0
"Doctor SC was the best. You always knew exactly what she was asking of you, and she makes political science courses super interesting.",1
"She read from book and ranted about the material. Its graded mostly on test scores. No study guides!!!!!! I read the book from cover to cover & took notes. Received a ""B"". I'm not happy considering it was a ton of work. She expects you to memory recall any given detail out of the book that she chooses for the test. Don't take if you need ""A+"".",0
"The ready is easy enough.  It is a lot of reading. You will NOT pass the class unless you learn to apply the principles learned for the exams. The tests are quite tricky and some questions are pretty misleading. You have to put a lot of work in, but you do also learn a lot. ",1
"She's great honestly, I think she is an amazing Professor. I'm so glad I got the pleasure of meeting her, if you see her name anywhere for classes take it I swear you won't regret it. She's kind, and cares about her students, loves her job and pays close attention to everyone. Take her course !",1
"Mrs. Myers is an OUTSTANDING instructor! She is so helpful and will take the time to explain formulas to you, in whatever method works best for you. Very kind, down to earth and only gives you assignments to help, not busy work. I would take one of her classes again!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",1
Love her!!! She enjoys what she is teaching. Tries to make the class more interesting by adding little activities. She is great!,1
hard to get ahold of,0
Very bland. Hard to stay awake. He skups the small steps and leaves his students confused. If you ask a questio. He never understands what you ask.,0
This professor is by far the worst one i have come in contact with. He talks about the same thing class after class and then expects you to write essays about something that makes absolutely no sense. Provides no prompts AT ALL. Talks about random things the whole class. Once you speak your mind he begins giving you lower grades.,0
Professor Daigle has got to be one of the most difficult professors I have ever had. He doesn't care whether you get a F or an A in the class. I'm sure there's better teachers at the mental institutions. there is only 3 grades the whole semester and its insanely hard test. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH MR. PAUL DAIGLE! he's a trash can,0
Best prof. i've had here. Credible and passionate about his subject.,1
"His tests were really hard. The tests were nothing like the labs or homework. His lectures weren't so great, he started off expecting you to understand Matlab and how to code. Major of the class failed or got a D. Not an easy class at all.",0
"Amazing professor! Your grade is made up by 7 quizzes, 1 final, 1 group project, 1 lab project and extra credit. ,Microbiology is a tough subject but he gives you the tools you need and is fair in grading. Responds to emails and answers questions. I would absolutely recommend him!!",1
I would highly recommend taking a different professor for Spanish. She's highly unhelpful if you didn't take a Spanish class the semester prior to taking her class. ,0
"I had a hard time learning from Logan b/c he sped through the lectures. He gave out practice tests before each test which was a lot easier than the actual test. The final was super easy which helped push my B up to an A. He is super quiet and boring, was very hard to sit through his class.",0
"This class is the foundation for all other pre-med courses one will likely take after. Based on that, this class is tough and you have to study very hard. His exams are straight from his notes, but there is a lot of material to be covered. Study, study, study and study some more!!",1
You must show up tp every class or points will be taken off. He gives a lot of work and is very strict about having things done a specific way. He also wants you to memorize the entire syllabus and talks the whole class.,0
This professor was all over the place with his lectures. It was very hard to follow him and understand what he was trying to say. He was not very good at explaining what he wantesd from us and worksheets were always so repetitive. Although he gave chances to earn extra points. Attendace taken every class and will affect grade if you do not come.,0
"Overall very helpful, office hours are great and always willing to help out. Sometimes can be tough grading tests but there are plenty of opportunities to nullify bad grades.",1
"The material's pretty dry and I had him for a night class, so staying awake was always a challenge. Mostly, you have to attend lecture and memorize definitions. There is a huge group project (presentation and paper) at the end of the semester, but he grades easily on this.",1
WOW,0
"I enjoyed having Professor fields because she was approachable, but she didnt get back to me on a few emails (or took 3 days). The class was kind of difficult, honestly. Reading the chapters was a breeze and the information wasnt hard to grasp, but the homework assignments and tests were pretty difficult. I barely got an A and had to work HARD.",1
"Ive taken a lot of college and english courses in my career as a student and its VERY safe to say that Professor Wardens Comp 1010 course was the highlight of suffering, anger, and rage. Her grading is nothing short of rage inducing. You can do the exact work she wants and shell still make up something about how you didnt do as you were told",0
"Tries to be the cool professor, but fails. He fails because he relies almost entirely on PowerPoint and reads off the slides. He often gets lost in his own notes and will just talk without clicking through the slides then finish the lecture and realize clicking through all of them at the end. Ineffective, test-heavy, and unfunny. Avoid if possible.",0
"great teacher, i reccommed him to everyone takes a math course. he knows his material. he does expect you to come to class, learn and expect you to do your homework. he writes down all of his work and shows you step by step on how to do it. by far my favorite teacher.",1
"teacher is not clear with material, very broad but quiz questions are very specific and built to trick you. They suggest to log into the VOH sessions but they are useless and do not provide any important information. The reading material is extremely heavy for a 200 level  elective course. I strongly do not recommend this class.",0
"He was tough for me as I did a lot of self teaching. I would take him again only because I know how he works now. 8 Chapter quizzes and 3 exams are the only grades in the book so that makes it tough. Be ready to spend all of your time on MyMathLab - that part was hell, but he relieved us towards the end. Mainly all online",1
"If you're looking for a passive history class to coast through this GUR, DO NOT TAKE GILL. She's under the dire misimpression that her students want to take the class seriously - THEY DO NOT.   Obscure questions, tons of homework reading for EVERY class, low quality preparation material before exams, often late to class. 2/10 would not take again",0
"Exceptionally poor communicator, not engaged in the class. Assignments took weeks to grade, when requesting feedback and support on lab and homework assignments it was seldom to never provided. Video lectures read from the slides, almost like she didn't know the material. She cared more for APA style than content of assignments.",0
One of the best professors I have taken in a long time. He has a passion for Japanese and teaching. He's easy to understand and thanks to him I am quickly learning the language.,1
This class was an easy A. Dr. Corrigan was very helpful with papers and his lectures are hilarious. Visit his office hours because hes an amazing professor to talk to!,1
"This class in general is very difficult but this professor didn't help at all. Limited office hours, no extra credit and your grade is 75% exams.  homework is 25%. He expects you to read each chapter 4 times, and come with questions. Wont tell anyone what is on the exams. If you don't ask, he doesn't tell. Will make you feel dumb for asking ?'s",0
"This professor has an amazing resume, but dont let that trick you. He is rude to students, doesnt answer questions most of the time, even thought he will ask if anyone has questions. He may struggle with hearing as he does wear a hearing aid, but that does not excuse his attitude. He picks and chooses who he calls out, and you will learn very lit",0
She's very rude and insensitive. Honestly she's there to make kids not want to stay at college. She really hates on men and will call you out to talk about your minority issue.,0
"He can go off topic a lot. Sometimes he doesn't talk about other cultures unless an exam is near. I noticed he talks a lot about Christianity than any other religion, mostly not in a good way. He's passionate in what he loves but barely knows how to teach it. You pretty much have to read the textbook to understand the class.",0
A man with no compassion that has no idea what he is talking about the majority of time. Many times students have corrected him. Gives you no way to make up class or tests.  Very condescending.,0
"Though he's knowledgeable in his field, he's definitely the worst teacher I've ever had...",0
She is kinda nice but she is the worst teacher on campus. The class is a waste of time and not worth the work. If you have her you might as well just drop the class to avoid the headaches of her insane projects.,0
Pawkett makes it really easy to learn some very hard stuff about the guitar.  His class was awesome and the fact that he is hilarious makes it all the more reason to take his class.,1
"He is a very self-righteous person, doesn't believe that he consists of imperfections. Claims he is the best writer, and can do anything better than anyone. Excessively talks about movies and shows. Loves to play Devil's advocate but isn't open minded enough to see other sides. Offers suggestions but will tell you that you're mediocre. Conceited.",0
"Pretty useless professor. Mumbles in some unintelligible language which slightly resembles english throughout his lectures. His exams cover material which he doesn't go over in any detail until afterwards. grades the exams based solely on the answer and maybe a little work, so even the smallest error can bring you down to a c/d.  Not reccomended",0
"I would love to take more classes with Dr. Knesek, even if I don't need the credit. I've definitely taken more away from this class than any other and the textbook is really good too. He cares about you taking something away from his class. I want more classes with him!!!",1
"Phenomenal professor. Take his as much as you can, as often as you can. While the readings are complex, his explanations in class make them simple to understand and extrapolate from. He is, self-admittedly, atrocious at email, but is readily available in office hours and to meet by appointment. A fascinating person inside and out of class. Take.",1
"20 percent of test comes from the reading, attendance is a grade, but probably only around 10%. Tests are extremely easy and his lectures are actually really interesting, hell answer questions if you dont hear something, and extremely nice",1
"Yue laoshi was excellent, showing a great wealth of knowledge way beyond what was expected. She know the entire history and origin of every single character and had great background and cultural information for many of the topics covered. She was also very aware of the difficulties in learning a new language and was very patient and understanding.",1
"Dr. McDonald gives you everything you need to do well. He will meet you halfway. Put the work in and youll be fine. Be prepared to get called on though. Very scary in the beginning of the semester, but youll get used to it. Dont be embarrassed if you dont know the answer, he will guide you to the right answer or just skip to the next person",1
"In-class assignments&homework don't always prepare you for the tests, which are the only grades in the class. By semester's end, the gap bt students who understand the material&who fall behind is wide as Hadavas doesn't focus on those confused in order to help them better understand the material-he waits for someone to state the answer & moves on.",0
"This is my first college English class. So the transition from Highschool English to this class was definitely different. Nevertheless, Every assignment that Shamane gives ties into the main papers that she assigns. After every assignment, she gives helpful feedback on how you could improve your writing in the future. I definitely would recommend.",1
"Even though he bashes lecture heavy classes his classes are lecture heavy. The lectures were really boring and no one ever really talked in class because Professor Dotts appears very judgemental of viewpoints outside his own. Class is graded on a few things, but they were easy. If looking for an easy, boring A then take this class.",0
"He is very kind and funny, can tell he knows his physics. But most of class was spent discussing theories and I didnt really learn anything. The material in lectures and the material on homeworks and test and had no correlation, I only started to understand the class until after he graded it and gave feedback, which he takes forever to do .",0
"Great teacher, makes Math understandable for the Math challenged!",1
"Her lectures are very boring, and her low unenthusiastic voice makes it hard to pay attention. Tests are tricky; never really tells you what to study just tells you to expect everything that has been covered so far. Sometimes would be tested on things we didn't learn. You'll have quizzes and assignments done in class also count towards attendance.",0
"Exams tricky, not as easy as others say. Some extra credit but don't count on it to save you",0
Great Professor! He is so cool. Easy A as long as you do the work. Made me more interested in Mexican History. Would take him again.,1
"Professor Bermudez is an excellent Professor. For starters, if you show up to class and do everything that she asks you to do you will get an A. Only 3 papers, after every paper you will have an individual conference, she will give you feedback, you implement the changes into your paper and you will get an A. Take Professor Bermudez for any class!",1
"Prof Woodside is hands down the STAT prof I've taken at Carleton! Her lectures are super easy to follow, and she makes everything easy understand. She loves when students ask questions. If you attend all the lectures and use her notes, the assignments and tests are a breeze!",1
"Good teacher tells you what you need to know for the exams. Lectures are boring at times. There are several papers 1-3 pages (at most, usually 1 page). Need to study, you may not always use the book he makes you get but it is very useful for the papers & exams. Theres a final presentation (in a group), a final exam & final paper.",1
Far and above the best professor who prepares you for real world. Class was hard work but you actually learn stuff.,1
This is a very casual professor. There are no presentations or any of that BS (in lab you have to work in a group of 2-5 people). There are 4 tests and they are the problems he does from the book with different #s. He lectures for half the class and then does the associated problems from the book on his iPad and and projects it to the board.,1
"Lim is a good guy but hard to follow in his lecture. ECON is hard, but when I felt I understood it I was hit with a curveball. His tests were very difficult. 3 tests, attendance, and homework counts towards final grade. He did not curve any test grades even though the averages were failing grades. Very nice guy, but I wouldn't take him again.",0
"Over the top intense in lectures but I really do think this is a teaching strategy. Very engaging, hilarious, sometimes goes off on a bit of a tangent on material not relevant to the class wasting time. Did a good job considering this is his first time teaching this course. I found the lab way more challenging than the theory from lecture",1
"Mr. Narin is an awesome teacher. You need to attend every class and stay on top of homework. His expectations are high for his students, but he is always available to assist with any difficulties you may be experiencing. All tests must be passed in order to pass class. He does allow some make-ups. His lectures are thorough and simple to understand.",1
Avoid at all costs.,0
This was the last class I had to take at SVSU and thank god it was. He ruined my experience at SVSU. He does nothing but talk down to students and makes you feel scared top ask a question. He is the biggest hypocrite. He complains and projects his feelings to his class. He also makes very inappropriate comments about students. DO NOT TAKE!,0
"terrible time with this guy in LFS 250 and 350, 250 was the worst class I ever took, waste of time 4 hours gone a week just like that and the course was for a whole year, absolutely useless and nothing taught, very opinionated and we do stupid activities as if we are 5 years old, same in 350 if you value your time and brain cells don't do it",0
"She honestly makes her tests waaaayy harder than they need to be. She puts trick questions on them that are meant to lead you astray, and she crams so much content into them that it's too overwhelming. She's okay for lectures, but overall I didn't enjoy her class at all. The online hw she gave us at the beg. of the semester would take 4+ hrs",0
"Very, very bland lecture. Monotoned and reads almost straight from her slides. Tests are not to hard if you study. A lot of questions come from the online quizzes and the book self check so that helps. Not a hard class but not interesting either",0
"He clearly explains all concepts in lecture and explains ahead of time what will be on the tests. Your grade in the class is based entirely on the 4 tests, as there is no homework, extra credit, etc. The tests are challenging but the GSS resources (which are posted on ELMS) help a lot to prepare.",1
"Dr. Lin is awesome! Her classes are interesting and challenging, but she is very helpful if you are struggling. If you do the reading and attend class you should have no problem at all.",1
"Professor Bronie is such a great teacher! Do the homework, study and ask questions and you will pass her class. She provides her students with a lot of useful handouts and resources to prepare you for her tests and to gain a better understanding of Math. Her class is not easy, but its worth it. She wants all her students to succeed.",1
"Reynolds is amazing. His lectures are fantastic, and his class sparked my interest in social sciences. I would highly recommend his class.",1
"Honestly probably one of the worst professors I've ever had. She gave many assignments throughout the semester but did not grade a single one so I had no idea how I was doing, and when I asked she just said she had too many students to grade them??? So basically I did not get a single grade until the final grade of the class, when it was too late.",0
"Nelly is the sweetest professor, she is very funny and loves to tell stories and always lets class out early. Tests and quizzes are simple, for compositions she grades really easily. Participation is important, it can actually have an affect on your overall grade but she makes it easy by asking questions to class frequently. ",1
"On numerous occasions I have emailed her with no reply. Her syllabus doesn't match what she says in class. We have to watch dumb movies and answer things like ""What repetitions do you notice?"". I'm not even sure what that means. We also have to write 500 words a week on absolutely nothing. She's very nice but her assignments are ridiculous.",0
"Stay far away from this course. Journals are tough to understand and the course is based off of them. She is really bad with giving back marks so you won't know where you stand until final grades come out. Also, she is the worst lecturer I had in uni",0
"I didn't enjoy this class. It might be because it was completely asynchronous this year, meaning there were no zooms, just videos of her reading powerpoint slides uploaded to Canvas twice a week and assigned readings and homework. I found the lecture videos boring and unnecessarily long. Maybe she's great in person but online this class wasn't good",0
I really appreciated the feedback and concise instruction given for each week of this condensed summer course. I enjoyed both books and feel like I've retained information from this class! Thanks Dr. R,1
"Unclear, doesn't explain what he wants, then gets angry after the fact, not very helpful, seems disinterested in seeing his students succeed. Misses classes. All over the place in lectures, goes off on tangents. Biased with marking. Very knowledgeable, just not a good teacher.",0
"Really good teacher, I enjoyed my time in class. He makes it interesting and you actually learn material by attending class. He's very helpful and fair in his evaluations! Definitely recommending him.",1
"He is an amazing teacher, very nice, cares about his student and he make sure you understand what he's talking about. grades fairly, he like class discussion. sometimes the class gets boring but it worth it, but EASY CLASS.",1
Save yourself time and money. Do not take Gerschick. Hes the worst professor ever. You will not pass this class. He will comment on your papers saying he believes in you then turn around and fail you. Take some advice dont do it. He is the devil. Beware. He loves to fail students.,0
"phenomenal professor & person, def one of the best at ucf. he's so funny and caring and the course material is engaging and worthwhile. test material is mostly off his powerpoints but not hard at all. fun class to go to & he pays attention to how much effort u put in attendance only mandatory a few times not always but go anyway it's worth it",1
Probably one of the worst prof's i have ever had. I completely agree with the comment below me when this class is NOT a level 200 course. Basically the entire class failed or got a C on the first assignment and his lectures are ridiculously dry and confusing. I wish i never took this course - AVOID AVOID AVOID,0
The lectures are often not relevant to test content.  Test studying can be difficult due to lack of direction in class. Study guide found to be irrelevant.  Working with students was a struggle.,0
not to bad...he's a good guy and lectures are a bit boring he's very understanding and approachable,1
I am an independent tutor who avidly helps students in English courses. I find that this class is unbearably difficult for the level. The grading criteria is incredibly specific to the point where the student will be unable to write a fulfilling paper. I have been a tutor for 10+ years and this is the first time Ive been frustrated by a paper.,0
"I don't do these at all, but let me tell you the rudeness I received from such a professor. I used to like Kathleen, she was and still is amazing. But personality and favoritism aside, I give her a 0. I definitely will not take one of her classes again. ",1
He is not helpful at all,0
"He doesn't ever stay on topic, he is late to class and he keeps you over the time alloted. His opinions are never backed up an if you dont agree with him your mark suffers.",0
I was terrified to take statistics but Dr. Clark had spoke in a previous class that I had taken about how he wants to help everyone learn statistics.  When I signed up for stats I made sure I got him. I was not disappointed at all. He makes sure his students understand the material and is available when they do not. I reccomend this professor to anyone wanting to learn stats!,1
"DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID!! I thought this course might be an easy elective option, but no. The lectures are recorded but they are literally just close up videos of her face, NO powerpoint or anything. The syllabus is extremely misleading and the evaluation criteria is very unclear. Plus, very unorganized. Dropping it ASAP.",0
"Teacher is knowledgeable on the topic of microeconomics, but her ""english second language"" accent can be distracting. Class was hard for me, but then again my interest in the subject is zero. All quizes are online, but final is in class. Two group projects to present to class throughout semester. Overall, meh.",0
"The classes at boring all she does is read of the power point and posts it up on BB. its 3 exams, 1 final, a group projects and presentation which is 9 service learning hours, and a 5pg term paper. she offers extra credit worth 5 points. test are average not too hard, takes forever going over the chapters, behind of schedule for exams.",0
I took her class on spring semester. Be ready to Give 100 percent of your attention if you miss even a minute you will be lost. Tests are relatively easy if you pay attention in class I recomend you dont miss a day or you will be lost. pop quizzes are given but she gives a heads up. Listen closely because she has kind of a heavy accent,1
Assigning a massive group project for an online class full of adults who already work full time (which is likely why we are taking online classes) is absurd and infuriating.,0
Very confusing on what she wanted on papers and was not very helpful. The only positive thing was the work load itself was easy. But she was way to picky on grading.,0
"Great professor, great class. Took his online courses. Homework is so easy, just do it and get full points. Have to study ahead of time for quizzes and exams. No discussions and only one term paper at end of semester",1
"While Professor Sinha was a caring person, her plant bio midterm was literally the hardest test I've ever taken in my entire life. She would go way too fast during the lectures, so much so that you would not get a chance to process anything you just learned. On top of that, her midterm would make you remember the most minuscule details. Neelima was",0
"Great teacher! Interesting, helpful, and very clear. Dont be afraid to ask questions during lecture, he's really cool about it and prefers you to ask. Take good lecture notes and do the homework. Pretty straight forward class. Just gotta go to class, do the homework and study to notes. You'll learn/pass with ease",1
"Impossibly hard grader.  1 credit class with 100 points, took off 3 points because she saw me talking in class (3 points = 3%).  She has no sense of fairness in terms of grading and will go out of her way to ruin your grade.  Avoid this teacher.",1
Shubha was very lecture heavy and i feel like her teaching style would better fit an upper level course in the same topic.,1
"This class made no logical sense how would you expect someone to pass a class when you get test/quizzes and , homework on material you haven't even learned yet. His teaching style is so robotic too with little to no emotion what so ever. 0/5 wouldn't meme again.",0
Hardest class and hardest grader ever in IU. Do not take her unless you are willing to go through a rough semester !,0
I really hope the people taking this teacher in the summer know what they're getting themselves into.,0
"We rarely had class due to his absences, which made it very hard to understand his unorganized lecture notes. Class was long and dragging, and don't expect to know what your grade is until after finals. He openly insults all questions, and never gets us feedback in a timely fashion. Avoid him at all costs.",0
"If you work ahead and ask Professor Kolluru questions as they come up, this class will be an easy A. She's super caring and will work with you even though it's an online class.",1
"You always have the opportunity to rewrite for a better grade, never worse, until the last day of class. Clear grading criteria. Excellent professor.",1
"best crim professor at stockton. had him for intro and correction and i plan on taking him again. he lets you get a few absenses but if you dont go over the powerpoints yourself youll have some trouble. go to class, pay attention, and look over your notes and youll be fine.",1
"Nice Professor, he helped out a lot.  He knows when and how to crack a joke when the class is a little dry. He gives no homework with the exception of maybe 2 or 3 blackboard assignments. He gives out maybe 5 papers to write the entire semester.  Easy class, take him!",1
"Grades given are very confusing. Would not recommend unless taken pass-fail. Otherwise, you can attend every class and work really hard and think you will get an A and then end up with something much worse.  In terms of class material, the dance class feels more like yoga. Would recommend looking at other classes like Ballet or Jazz dance.",0
"Professor is nice, kind, and informative. however shes not on time with anything, always adjusting her schedule of the syllabus changing dates for assingments due. talks about her jobs and is constantly asking for feedback which pushes time back for assignments due. Heavy grader for a class to improve for poor writing. DONT TAKE HER!",0
"You're going to have to rely on your textbook. She rambles  and goes off-topic during lectures, mentioning things she thinks are ""interesting"" but they're really unnecessary to know. We don't have any study guides or review in class for tests. She keeps wanting to make it more challenging for us without teaching us the basics first so we get lost.",0
"I'd heard such great things about Dr. Anitori and was sorely disappointed by his teaching. He puts the most random information on his weekly exams, which are only 20 questions. You are not allowed to study from previous tests for your cumulative final, you can't question him or else he humiliates you, and there is a lack of organization in lab time",0
"Lopez a cool techaer, however he reads off slides which he posts on Rcampus for printing. No homework, One group project for extra credits - very important(involves presentation), Only 3 exams and the last one is the final, he gives out study guides for every test which is very helpful",1
"As a teacher myself, this guy could use some pedagogy classes. Sure, he knows the material, but can he teach? No. I had to practically teach myself. If you asked him a question he would belittle you in front of the whole class. I think he means well, perhaps he should be working with more advanced students, not amateurs. Avoid this class if possibl",0
Don't take orgo II with him if you actually want to learn anything. He forces you to memorize things and his exams don't test your understanding of the material. Also he is so useless at office hours and makes you feel stupid when you go there to get help. Your textbook WILL BE your best friend so be prepared if you plan to take this dude!,0
"He gets pretty upset at times, but as long as you're on his good side it's okay. I thought I deserved a higher grade, but didn't receive it due to a ""mix-up""",0
Proffessor Williams is a good person but a BAD examiner. The class is hard The exams are open book open notes but hey .. the notes should be hand written only and the book must be physical one NO EBOOKS. his exams are hard with a 50 minutes time window .. you've better hurry!!,0
"I am not even done with the course; however, ""hear me roar"". As a professor who teaches an online course, you would expect one to be more involved, detailed etc... She isn't. It's a good class, informational, & good discussions, but at the end you ask yourself: Where's the teacher? If you email her (a good long email) expect a 3 sentence response.",0
"do not recommend for a non-english major or to take just as an elective, the class was so boring. she spent the first 30 min of the first three classes attempting to learn our names and 13 weeks later and she still doesn't know mine. she also has a strict bathroom policy. her lectures are boring and class seems to last forever.",1
"Carlos is super nice, has his quirks (i.e. his rhythmic talking and random yay's) but that makes him extra cool. He is helpful and understanding. the class can run too long and it can get boring but i have no interest in the subject plus i grew up with the language.",1
Basic assignment. But if youre into not learning this is your guy. Hes nice but very unclear. assignments are very easy but it gets difficult when you're taking a test and have no idea what hes talking about,0
"Try to count the number of times she says, 'Ok.'  I got 387 in 30 minutes.",0
"I had Dr. Strange for Conservation, a class he created.  Incredible!!  This was one of the best classes I have taken at UT.  Dr. Strange is funny, passionate, engaging and a downright blast.  I learned so much in this class.  Don't miss this one!!",1
"Teacher is terrible. She contradicts the information in the textbook when lecturing. She seems to not have read the book. She makes a very easy class harder than it really is. The quizzes WILL NOT prepare you for the exams. No idea where she pools the questions from or the format, but the Exams are awful, and she won't prepare you for them.",0
poor explanation,0
"HORRIBLE TEACHER DO NOT TAKE! I took Anatomy prior to this class for another college and aced it. He barely speaks English!! You can't understand a word he says, mispronunciates every other word. The whole class is lecture...how can they give a lecture class w/a prof you cant understand?!?!",0
"she doesn't like your ideas unless it is within her genre of writing. And it isn't real if it's comedy.  She is the worst teacher, there is no support or guidance. It's her way or a failing grade. She is not fit to teach because she doesn't know how to share knowledge or accept others ideas. It's a terrible learning environment.",0
"She was enthusiastic. The class was super easy, as long as you participated you will pass. I took this online, you either have to put your speeches on you tube or go into class and do them, either way its super easy. Loved this class! Pick your topic carefully, you have to use it all semester!!!!!",1
"Dr. Galileo was VERY monotone, and I was not interested or engaged. He reads off his powerpoint slides, and expects you to read the book to learn. He is not helpful, and does not answer emails . People say its an easy A (if you actually read the book and practice test), but I 100% preferred BISC401 which other people have said is harder. ",0
he is so inspiring with his teaching delivery. you will definitely learn and be motivated to further your course concept. this class was very difficult because it was a minimester but as long as you do your work and participate in class you will do well.,1
Currently studying for this final and I really don't think I'm gonna make it. At 2 on the dot he walks in dims the lights and begins lecture for the entire class time. He is not good at lecturing and makes no effort to get students engaged. His voice is monotone so it's easy to zone out. He seams like a good guy but the class is a struggle.,0
"Dr. Marlow is super fun. He has a hard time getting through the material because he encourage class discussion. He knows how to explain things so student's understand. Though there was one time where I emailed him a question and his reply was ""it's in the syllabus"".  The syllabus is 13 pages long. Just sayin. Into to Linguistics is very interesting",1
Celia is an extremely tough prof. As a science student who is used to getting a lot of work-don't be fooled she gives a LOT of homework. She is really strict and for some reason thinks no one in the class studies and puts in effort while everyone is struggling and crying. I think I've had maybe 3-4 nice cry sessions from her class. Not worth it.,0
This class summed up in two words is awkward and vague. If Mr. Wisla wasn't in the middle of a lecture that could put the hulk to sleep the class was left sitting in awkward silences.,0
"If you will listen to what she tells you, it is an easy class. She often straight up tells you the important parts of tests. Her tests are not easy but if you study they are managablr. Her lab is even better, but for lab you will be in her room the entire time. Do not expect to leave early.",1
"Good instructor. Some organizational issues, but those issues are minor. The class was interesting, but there are a lot of dense readings, so come prepared by reading the day's material at least 2 days in advance. Which is what you're supposed to do, really.",1
"Excellent for 108. NOT for 201.  I was 2% away from passing and I only missed one class AND did tutoring, and she didn't care.  Only cares about smart students or those in front row. Rude outside of class. She got corrected EVERY class period.  not a good teacher for 201",0
"Great teacher! if you do your homework and study for the tests you will pass with an easy ""A"". The class ended so FAST! It was fun. I liked that we did a lot of things in class with a group.",1
"I took Dr. Russum's courses until the school had to tell me, alright, you've capped on out Humanities. Take this professor. Appreciate the sources he gives you -- I still look at my notes from 5 years ago. Take this class if you're serious about the course itself. And when you do so, be prepared to learn and unlearn what you think you know.",1
"Polanco is a tough grader but she a very nice professor. The grades included a midterm, final, journals, RPS credit, Reading checks, a final paper, and 5 group projects. It's a lot of work but I enjoyed the class. It's not an easy A, you have to participate to get a good grade!",1
"Marjan is pretty funny, and is a good teacher. That said, we get let out of class early way too often. I mean yeah, who doesn't like extra time now and then? But in her classes, it's a bad habit. I didn't feel like I was getting what I paid for by getting out early all the time. I like her, but I'm going to find another teacher.",0
Terrible class. You won't learn much.   Teacher is not all together.,0
"Textbook was mad expensive, homework assignments were a time suck but not difficult in the least. The amount of studying for the exam does not correlate at all with your grade. Final exam is killer, which requires way too much memorization. This class is no longer an Easy A, do not take it if you have heard that it was.",0
"Love Mrs. Bartee! She is very helpful, easy to follow and gives a great study guide. I highly reccomend her!",1
Oh my God where should I start. Stay away Professor Thompson is so very terrible. If you like sitting through long boring lectures that have nothing to do with what youre going to be tested on then this is your class. His Tests are made up as riddles and have nothing to do with the material gone over in class. Stay away very far away.,0
Professional and sociable. He's great.,1
"Barron is a lovely lady and I would like to be friends with her outside of class. However, she is not a good professor. She assigned way more readings than she could actually get to and she is unclear on how much to read which made students played guessing game. She is also very unwelcoming for any out-of-class assistance.",0
He likes to make lots of jokes and make fun of his students which is cool because we take him as a joke as well. His class is stupid easy. If you do the bare minimum you'll pass with 100% He canceled class often and would end class after 30 minutes. Little to no hw throughout the semester. You can tell he's not passionate about teaching anymore.,0
"Vitz is a great lecturer. Although the class was 1.5 hours, he made it really interesting, so time just flies. He is relatively an easy grader and detailed professor. He tends to lecture fast but if you ask questions he won't mind. Although he is not hispanic, he has a love and passion for Latin American studies, which makes his lectures great. ",1
Teacher is bad. Don't take his class. Took CGS1100 online and had to make up one of his tests. Had to email him 6 times before I could take it. He tells you to check blackboard for messages everyday but he doesn't even do that himself. Skip this prof. and pick a different one. Easy class but I knew 90% of the material prior to taking it.,0
"This dude is a jerk. I DID NOT want to take him bc everyone told me I shouldn't, but he was the only one teaching this req course. I've passed all my 4000 level courses with A or A+ but this guy graded me down insanely at every turn. Unreasonably hard reader, is mean about opinions he disagrees with. Only passed how I did by acing the final 110%",0
"This is a computer class, but you have to write 10-20 page papers and use a pencil on paper tests. The homework is extremely tedious and long, and is not weighed fairly at all. For example: I spend about 10 hours on a lab (which consumed my whole day), and I only got 5 points for it. The class has 500 total points. Lectures are very boring too.",0
Dr. Bar Nadav deeply cares about her students and wants them to succeed. I became a more inspired and motivated poet by taking her class. ,1
"You've been forewarned.  Do NOT take this professor.  Highly unprofessional, inappropriate, and rude. I frequently encourage people to switch out of his classes because of his rude, sarcastic attitude and nasty disposition.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",0
"Very nice teacher, very hard lots of quizzes, all timed and lots of questions.  Too much material given to study it makes it confusing.",1
"Easy class, she does space out your essays which is really helpful but overall extremely boring lectures and you can't doing anything else but bare through the monotone for an hour and a half, would not recommend this teacher.",0
He is good,1
"Go to lectures if you don't know compsci, or you won't pass the exams. She's a good lecturer and will answer questions if you come on time or send her an email. She ends and begins lectures on the dot which is sort of a plus. Use the practice questions and take notes during lecture to retain the material and you'll ace the class.",1
"Professor Capper is awesome! His lectures are super interesting but they are pretty long, around 40 minutes each. I'm not sure how he is in person (mid Covid time) but online he's super easy. The only thing you really have to do are watch the lectures and take notes. You're supposed to read the readings as well (no textbook) but I never do.",1
"Would not recommend at all. She's a tough grader. Literally so disrespectful, she shamed someone in front of the whole class because they didn't do their homework. She expects you to like and be good at music, regardless of major. Avoid at all costs.",0
"Mr Farris is a really smart guy, but he makes the class is extremely difficult. He expects you to know the material the first time he teaches it and there is A LOT of stuff to learn and memorize. He doesn't explain things very well and you will not pass if you don't study super hard and pay attention in class. Had to drop his class",1
"Great Professor! Ive taken him for 121 & 122. One of the few instructor at wright I would recommend! Over all the lectures are always interesting. For 121/ 122..expect to have about 4 (mini) test, 1 group project, and 1 exit exam.",1
"I dropped her class in spring after I saw the syllabus (a lot of work) but she was the only professor that teaches the class so I took BUSA3301 for summer. You have to have your head in the right place (WANT to learn) or it will be tough in any class you take. If you apply yourself, you will make an A.  She doesn't give you anything, you earn it.",1
Convoluted instructions.  Poor responses to questions.,0
"This was one of the most tedious and difficult courses I've taken in graduate school. However, Dr. Weston made navigating the course a breeze and was consistently available for help. She provided numerous opportunities for questions and gave detailed and useful feedback on all assignments. Would not recommend taking this course with anyone else!",1
"Professor Cummings is an absolute sweetheart! She gave so many extra credit opportunities, provided great feedback, gave extra time for assignments, responded quickly, and her assignments were extremely easy and usually consisted of surveys or simple questions. I highly recommend this professor, shes great and if you do all your work then you good",1
"In the first couple of weeks of classes, Stan was spending a lot of time talking about his own personal life and his son. He mentioned how he cares more about his son than teaching here... um ok Stan, you don't need to tell us that just put some effort and be more alive when you teach and stop being so stressed and maybe let a new instructor teach",0
I took prof Rice for lecture and I say just try and avoid her at all costs if you can. She is sarcastic and does not care about you passing at all. Again AVOID AT ALL COSTS IF YOU CAN.,0
"such a boring professor, tests are easy if you follow along though. You will never understand what he is talking about though. He seems like a nice and settle fellow though.",0
This guy likes to talk a lot about his personal life and likes to retell boring anecdotes repeatedly every single lecture. Apart from being a strict guy he is extremely rude. If you are trying to get your GED done do not take him unless your really into poetry. Also be prepared to waste money on useless books. This man also takes attendance serious,0
"really hard to understand. he moves very fast with out giving alot of examples. there are alot of office hours, but when you go if you don't understand something he seems mad at you. test was 6 questions, 2 mc, 2 put in order, and two worth 25 points each...stay away!!!!",0
"Homeworks is optional, but do it! Trust me! I didnt do my homework the first half of the semester and only passed this class by the Grace of God! VERY test heavy. Does not give extra credit. Usually only explains things one way even if you ask because you do not understand. She tries hard to be helpful and great; but in my opinion, she isnt.",0
This guy is funny if you appreciate true humor. He is tough though I will tell you that!,1
"Dr. McConnell is a hilarious professor. His classes can be a bit boring but he makes you think. His grading does not always make sense, but he definitely helps you become a better writer. He is more than willing to meet with students whenever. I definitely suggest this class for anyone looking for a fun, intellectual class.",1
"Plenty of people are saying this guy is great, do not be deceived. Take this from somebody whos been around the block a few times, trust me Ive dealt with some bad professors and I took this class twice with him, none have been as vindictive and cruel. The tests are incredibly difficult and tailored to ensure that you do poorly.",0
"Because he would rather sound 'correct' as opposed to understandable, he seems more concerned with the quality of his own voice than being a good teacher. His online class only uses video lectures, which are unnecessarily tedious and boring. Bottom line: This professor makes an interesting subject like music needlessly challenging and frustrating.",0
"Loved this class. Brad was super helpful when it came to writing papers. Participation really does matter, speak up in group discussions and you will do fine. He's very nice and is passionate about what he teachers. Assigns 3 papers. No tests. Overall great class, and I learned to love and appreciate poetry. My favorite teacher at FSU.",1
"Do not take a class with Bryan. His explanations are very blurry and unclear. Whenever you ask him a question he does not directly answer.   I found that since his teaching methods sucked the exams were tough, but if you find a way to teach yourself then exams will be fine.",0
Mean,0
"AVOID THIS TEACHER! She creates her own tests and the answers are often wrong even when counted right by the textbook! When I asked her a simple question, she had to use Google to find the answer! This class has been one of the worst experiences I have ever had, and I hate having to worry about this so much. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!",0
"College of Engineering Dean. Lectures were difficult to follow and disorganized. Classwork (lab) and homework was meant to help students use technology to solve engineering problems, but I found it to be elementary and a waste of $263/credit hour. Nice guy, but disorganized presentations without a clear purpose. Recommend another instructor.",0
Mr. Brown is one of the best teachers I've ever had. He came to be a teacher from the job world so he has first hand experience with a lot of the material and has valuable stories about it. He assigns work frequently but it isn't constant. He gives plenty of time to finish harder assignments and is open to extensions (when appropriate).,1
"100 lvl class, straight forward requirements, not highly recommended if you need a nap.  Worth paying attention to and all of the exams come from the lecture.",1
"Amazing.  Really helps when a student needs it.  sarcastic at time, but a lot of fun.",1
"The lectures are a waste of time. I went to every single one and I don't know jack about what's going on. This is an intro class and all he does is use upper level terms that make no sense to me. I like him, he seems like a cool dude, but his ability to teach needs work. On the upside, there's very few tests.",0
it is near impossible to get more than a B in this class. He taught the material poor inna more complicated way then need. He gave an extraordinary amount of homework that barely pertained to class and his test problems where kinds of problems we have never seen before. He let us use our phones (yes our phones) and were all still failed. DONT take,0
"Randal was an okay professor. Easy subject, however, all he would do is read from the power point slides or show art history videos. If attendance was not required, I would have only shown up for the quizzes and tests.",0
"If you have other hard classes, DO NOT TAKE HER! Absolutely too much work!",0
Best Professor at UNO. He teaches a lot of good stuff and new trends. Dont miss his class if you get a chance.,1
"She's really nice.  She's outgoing, and kind of loud.  This class is extremely easy but sometimes, she can be very unclear about assignments.  Sometimes, she's hard to follow and you just don't know what she is talking about!",0
"I had to drop because I was so confused.  When I went in for him to sign the drop papers, he said ""Why didn't you ask me to clarify in class?""  Well, I did.  I just didn't understand a thing he was saying.",0
"This professor, and the TA, both choose which parts of the readings they consider fact. Multiple quizzes I had correct answers and quizzes from both the reading and lecture but missed the points because, in their opinion (never shared with class) they were not the most important. Would not take again.",0
The Exams are so hard. there are weekly quizzes that need to be done with weekly research paper and weekly discussion question.  Dont Take him!! ,0
"Teach yourself the stuff. he teaches his class with videos and lectures (although, you'll probably get bored and stop listening). Not a particularly fun class, but he made me laugh...probably not on purpose.  I would say: TAKE THIS CLASS. He's not much fun, but it's an easy A...although he'll try to trick you into thinking his course is hard.",0
"I enjoyed him and actually still think about him. I had to take Physics 2 with another guy, and I instantly regretted it. His lectures are not magical, but the simple way he explains things made everything clear.",1
"Professor Shapiro is super knowledgeable in her field and is overall an amazing professor. She mentions a lot of her personal experience in the field. I really enjoyed taking her class. We had to read about 3-4 books throughout the semester which were discussed in class. Occasionally brought in guest speakers, which is always interesting.",1
"If you are looking for a class that will make you bang your head against the wall, this is the perfect class for you. Dr. Taylor has extremely hard test and his lectures will put you to sleep. He does not really care if you succeed or not. This had to be one of the worst classes of my life. I did like the lab though.",0
"The first 60% of the course is a joke.  Quizzes are moderately difficult, but all answers can be googled.  The ""Virtual Emergency"" exercise is easy in theory, unfortunately Ali botched it due to clericaltechnical errors.   The final exam is extremely difficult (and worth 40%), and would require a didactic memory to succeed.  ",0
"I saw how crappy her reviews were after starting her class, but after taking her for almost 4 weeks now, she's not as bad as everyone says. She's boring, and grades toughly, but she's definitely not the worst. She won't be your most fun class, but she's not the worst option",0
"doable if not working full time and taking 3 other classes. Every chapter needs to be read, and quiz taken, along with unit exams. Midterm and Final are proctored. Some instructions were not clear so ask as you go along. Consider this class as two in one by the amount of work and effort that needs to be put in. Avg studied 5 hours a day. Good luck!",1
"Physic is hard, but he did a good job. Quizzes and test are not hard, since it bases on formula. Class is very comfortable, and I don't feel any stress like a previous physic classes. Trust me, take his class, submit your lab on time, do homework online ( pay code ) and ready for exam, you will get A. I hope he will teach PHYS4C, will take again.",1
"I loved this class. Liz was a great instructor and as long as you read and ask questions you'll be fine. With papers, the key is having the right GSI or you end up with a problem. Liz has rubric that explains paper expectations and my GSI definitely adhered to it. Be prepared to read ALOT -most of the readings were really good but a few were dense",1
"She's very disorganized, so if you don't know much about the Microsoft programs, I don't recommend taking this prof. To succeed here you're better off only using the book, and not her instruction. It's an easy load, but you need to expect that she's very fly-by-the-seat, so nothing is set in stone. She's passable, but with effort.",0
he offers so much extra credit theres no way anyone could fail his class. he made understand the math lesson easy but i always did my homework in the math lab incase i had questions.,1
"Due to the pandemic and making no accommodations in teaching style or tests, this is the worst class I have ever taken at Missouri State. I would definitely recommend other professors for this class that were more accommodating and understanding due to the pandemic.",0
PLEASE DO NOT TAKE HER. She is by far the worst professor i've ever taken. No one in my lab passes with an A. Her averages on her lab quizzes were always 6/10. Her lab quizzes are extremely hard and she's a tough grader when it comes to lab reports.,0
"I would not take Professor Aguilar again only because her lectures are not really lectures she speaks about the reading but she tends to go off topic a lot. If youre not much for writing papers do not take her, she only has about 4 assignments and theyre all heavy graded and really long and does not take late work. A lot of research is involved",0
"I took Geography 1 online and he made it very easy to pass his class! All you need to do is participate in the discussion questions and do the weekly assignments. He gives you a study guide before the tests, just complete them and literally all of the questions are on the test. Super easy class if you are looking for science class for your GE.",1
"I can say that I barely learned a thing in this man's class. He talked about racism and systemic injustice for 6 classes straight and I learned more about the national news than state government. He invalidates opinions that aren't his own. If you don't want to be in an echo chamber, I'd suggest another professor.",0
Not clear on expectations.,0
"She gave great examples toward real world expierences. Her slide shows may be boring but she gives you the information needed to know for all test. she prepares you for test questions with her teaching. she makes sure you understand the topics and the material. Plus there is ZERO homework. All you need to do is take notes and study, no busy work.",1
"Showed up late to almost every class, likes to hear himself talk and tends to ramble. Exams were easy as long as you studied and did the guide he gives you, show up for attendance points.",0
"one assignment one week but assignments are really difficult after midterm. one TA told us the average grades are 30%-40%. if you want to take this course, be careful.",0
Ms. Carter is  a character! She's is professional BUT don't think that you can take advantage of her cuz SHE WILL NOT HAVE IT! she did favor her Jamaican ppl a little toooo much though! I'm sure they all passed. Some times we would get a little off topic. but all in all she makes the subject fun and interesting. She's a tough grader also,1
Dr. Andrews is a super great lecturer that loves to talk about his personal experiences & call on students to hear about theirs. The class itself is interesting but it covers almost too much. Your grade is all dependent on the TA. 3 tests & 3 essays in addition to weekly paragraphs. Tests are online but are not as easy as u might want/expect.,1
"Have to start this review by saying that this prof. is SO passive aggressive. Will make class optional, but guilt you into being there if you so choose to skip. Not to mention, the material is difficult to begin with. I, personally, found this professor sometimes snarky and difficult to converse with. He is quick to shut people down.",0
he lets you get to know the other students before actually teaching the stuff. the book stuff is boring but the speeches are fun. he makes it comfortable and easy to speak in front of the class,1
"This teachers teaching style is different to say the least! 95% of the time he goes of topic and rants about the history of... or what he deems interesting facts! Overall, not much learned from class, extensive amount of work! Long and teedious! This class is not for the weak of heart!",0
"I took Activism, Participation, and Protest with Professor Alvarez and I have to say that I am not impressed. I think she lets her personal political opinions get in the way. Her ""lectures"" are confusing and there are way too many group collaborations on the readings. (There are SO many readings). She's a smart person, though, which is nice to see.",0
"AWESOME PROFESSOR! She's laid back, funny, and can relate to the students. Final study guide was extremely helpful if you jot down notes. She only did two easy speeches in the class! She definitely makes you feel comfortable speaking publicly!",1
Not a very nice person and very opinionated. He is supposed to be a deacon but he seems pretty politically weird to me. Take any other religion teacher instead.,0
"I was kind of nervous to start this class but Dr. Ferguson is an amazing professor. Shes very caring and always willing to talk to students. She gives you 3 autobiographies to read so as long as you plan out your reading youll be fine. The books do show up on the final. Her exams are pretty easy, plus she brings her dog to class sometimes.",1
"Pretty interesting class. A few essays and free writes are all the grades. No textbook. Attendance mandatory. Can be a bit of a tough grader, go in for office hours, they help a lot. Really invested in his students and wants to help you do well! Let's you revise papers. He's a great (although a bit eccentric) guy, I would definitely recommend him.",1
Dr. Nguyen is an excellent professor who will be there for a student in need. The class itself can be difficult as it is a bit of an introductory course however the difficulty Dr. Nguyen methods ease this stress through solid formulas and practicality to computers. ,1
I learned a lot from her and she is the best english professor a student could have. She tells you exactly what she wants from you. Great professor.,1
AVOID THIS CLASS. He honestly gives so much homework and expects you to follow his answers word for word. He makes you read the chapter in the book and then you are allowed to revive lecture videos afterwards which I think is ridiculous. This is honestly the worst class Ive taken and I regret doing it online as well.,0
"A very nice professor. Plus, he would make a very good artist (his diagrams were always well rendered). I took his class years ago and enjoyed his teaching and personality very much.",1
"Extremely disorganized professor: lost 100 quizzes (grades never returned), never has enough handouts/quizzes to give students when he needs to, forgets his calculator or other things and makes us waste time. This professor seems completely clueless and it isn't fair to have such professors at University.",0
"Loved her class. She is open to suggestion and arguments in class (provided their productive), her power points were great. The book use will REALLY help, you could get by w/out it, but not very well. Her personality is absoltely charming. She also defines the difference between being a woman, and a lady. My fave prof to date.",1
"she means weel for her student and is pro student rights, but she has trouble relating the materal to relife examples.  also, she barely goes over how to do problems unless someone ask how to do it.  she is a nice lady and offeres extra credit.  cant recommend her or not cuz from what i hear all the 1050 profs suck",0
What an incredible professor and all around guy. Never gotten more out of a class at USC than both the ones I've taken with him. PY is so knowledgeable about the industry and gives you the most valuable learning experience. Hands down the best prof. and really cares about the success of his students. You'll be lucky to take one of his classes!! ,1
"Easy A, but you actually learn in the class. She has a lot of guest speakers that actually teach you things you should really know going out into the world. She gives only a midterm and final, but goes over it with you before you take it. She also assigns 2 papers that are opinionated based and short.",1
Professor Miura is extremely vague when it comes to lectures. He only skims through basic information rather than developing detail for the material he is teaching. Be sure to do all the work possible outside of class because he will not be specific during class. This was a lab course and it wasn't as detailed as other courses Ive taken at Loyola.,0
"He is ready to help but doesn't really help. He is too specific about everything and writes wrong emails every time he sends out an email or posts something on CC. After taking his class, I feel I lost confidence in Biology although that's my major.",0
"Pretty unprepared usually and unpredictable every class. Does things last minute constantly and gives no time to prepare for anything. Review sheets prepared arent close to what is on the test. I always felt like like I got the gist of what he said, but if it wasnt word for word, expect points taken off. He loves stochasticity a little too much.",0
"Jean is a great prof. I looked forward to her class every day. She cares about her students so much and clearly cares about quality teaching. On the flip side, I really wasn't challenged during her class, and I dont remember any content from her cass, though she is a great example of what it looks like to really care about students.",1
"Sa Signature:Écologiste humaniste altermondialiste coopérativiste postcapitaliste. Si vous préférez un cours où l'idéalisme prend un second rôle derrière la réalité, voir ailleurs. De plus, sa plus grande exigence est la présence, donc c'est pas un gage de haut niveau.",0
"Class isn't too bad. Goes through textbook/worksheets to guide lectures. Do multiple practice problems in class. ONLY GRADED ON 3 TESTS, NO HW GRADE! Tests are only 6 questions that are very similar to lecture & HW problems. Make sure you format answer how he does in lectures & HW to get maximum points. Easy C, little harder to get an A. STUDY!",1
"Rizkalla is the only teacher that truly believes we understand him and the material as well as he does, and it shows, because there is no method to his madness . He does pay enough attention to his students and does not try to understand us. this also shows because he will give out a test prep work sheet, and only use 1/4 of it. worst prof ever.",0
"I took Dr. Buck during the winter 2015 semester. This class was tough! It was only a 4 week course, with 16 weeks of work compacted into such a short time. Be prepared to spend time during the week watching films, reading chapters, and taking tests. He gives out plenty of extra credit opportunities. I got an A with hard work!",1
"She is useless in the classroom, doesn't explain things very well, and talks about things that are completely irrelevant. Too much class time is devoted to doing what should be homework. The textbook the department uses is horrible; I had to go online to find out what I needed to know. However, I found her quizzes and marking to be very easy.",0
Alisa is a wonderful professor. She is extremely helpful and goes out of her way to make sure that her students succeed. I was afraid of Math until I got into her class!,1
She makes algebra easy by teaching it step-by-step!  A wonderfully considerate instructor who helps you all that she can.  Attendance and participation alone counts for one grade of 100.  She will make you feel at ease in her class and she is at times quite humorous which is so much fun!,1
"Take his class if you want challenge. He knows his thing but he is a tough grader, he grades every single homework and didn't accept the only late homework that I accidentally forget to do. Tests are hard and didn't give partial credits on tests so I screwed up really badly. (could get a B with partial credit but get a D) try to avoid him.",0
Absolutely do NOT recommend!!! I took AP Calculus in high school and passed the class but after taking his class I failed the final and now have to retake the course. His tests and quizzes were unreasonably difficult and I basically had to reteach myself calculus. He just rants about Newton and physics without actually teaching anything. Stay Away!,0
"Dr. Felizzi is one of the best professors I have had. His classes are heavy on participation and things are kept at a conversational tone. He gives great feedback on assignments and prepares his students to succeed. If a student is having an issue, he makes himself available to the student and his very approachable.",1
Very strict. Requires too much writing for an online class. Doesn't answer emails which is annoying for an online section.,0
"I took him Thursday, 7-9:45 pm. He is so easy. Will stop the lecture if you have a question and make sure you understand. Will also stay after class for you. You don't have to show up, but make sure someone gives you the notes because sometimes the answer is in the words. Oly five assignments (really easy) and about 4 tests, all easy.",1
"I honestly think he has issues. Throughout the class he acts like youre doing well since we get good grades in exams, assignments and keeps on saying how he isnt here to fail anyone we will do well. And we all put so much efforts, but in the end ..... BOOM. You see your grade and its a b :) He messed everyones final grade up for no reason.",0
This professor was horrible! I had her for the lab portion of PSYC 4483 and I did not enjoy having her. ,0
"I loved her class.  I have a good math background, so it wasn't that hard for me.  If you do have problems though, she'll help you as much as she can.",1
Professor is very condescending and rude. She treats us like we are wasting her time when asking questions. Lectures are 20-30 mins. Never ever responds to emails so dont bother asking questions. If you want to do well in this class just read the book and study the book. Professors lectures wont help and questions are all from the book.,0
"Great prof, dry sense of humor is good for the tough course. He's a genius programmer, if you need help, ask him! He will explain it. Some people think he makes students feel dumb for asking questions, but he doesn't, he cares about questions, so he will answer them the best he can.",1
"Ms. Jensen is so kind! I was dreading this class when I signed up for it, but when she came in an explained how she sets her class up, I knew it would be a breeze. As long as you do your assignments on Mindtap & Canvas, youll do fine in this class! Shes always willing to help out whenever you need it, so do t be afraid to ask or email her!",1
"Choose any other professor, literally any.",0
Teaches at a graduate level although it was an undergraduate course (non-profit mngmt).  Course should have been taught very simply to get an idea of the non-profit world - instead class was put in groups to create our own non-profit organization from soup to nuts.  Excessive amounts of work and writing.  Very helpful but not quite as effective.,1
"Dr. Portaro is very friendly and a great Spanish teacher! As long as you attend class and do your part to study/learn the material, then this class will be a breeze. She's also very good at spending more time on topics that everyone needs more practice on. Overall great teacher and class!",1
"Overall I don't think this prof cares about your grade. I initially was excited for this class, the prof also seemed excited & interested in the topic but that changed. Directions are not clear for most of the work. The research paper instructions were very vague & then harshly graded. Class was harder than it needed to be.",0
This class included some interesting material but we never gave any of the readings the attention they deserved. The class is superficial and pretentious and the professor will laugh in your face/make the classroom environment very uncomfortable.,0
Professor Paradis Is Great Very Helpful And Nice. I Would Recommend Taking This Professor Paradis He Kept The Class Entertained With Art Lectures Being Very Boring And He Also Cared About Us Passing His Test. His Test Are Easy If You Pay Attention Class And His Study Guide Is Identical To The Test!,1
"Super great lectures! He's funny and makes history entertaining and not boring. Usually history classes are difficult and textbook heavy, but he doesn't use a textbook and as long as you show up and pay attention, you'll pass. If you listen and take notes and spend like an hour studying for the test then you get an easy A.",1
One of the best professors I've ever had. He is truly an advocate for his students. It is clear that he is passionate about his job. I have never had a professor encourage me as much as he did. He is super nice and loves to talk about history and war. We didn't use a textbook but did read chapters/excerpts from novels. I definitely recommend him.,1
"There is a TON of reading and just as much writing to go along with the reading. It's not a class to take when you have a heavy course load, but it was one of the best classes I took. I was very reluctant because of the preconceived notions I had about WMGS courses, but I am forever grateful I had Dr. Hersh as my instructor",1
Mr. Prunty is an amazing professor! His teaching style is easy to follow and very straight forward! Loved everything about his class! Definitely want to take math from him again!,1
omg... i did not have a good experience withthis professor. She failed me on a paper but never gives an explanation why. i only saw her once a week and i dreaded everytime i went. i did however make a b in her class suprisingly.,0
"Charles cares very much about the topics he teaches and about his students. Maybe it is just the content of the class, but I still found his class difficult. Every class is a lecture and attendance is taken at all of them. It's easy to want to skip. And you NEED the book in order to pass, because you're constantly making study guides from it.",0
He takes a a long time to understand the abilities of the students he teaches. Does not understand the preparation given by the prerequisite courses and assumes a lot of material not covered by other courses. His homework is achievable but difficult. His exams are tough. Not much feedback initially but was decent by the end of the course.,0
The exams were tricky and there were some questions on the exams that were not in the readings nor in her lectures/ppts. She doesnt like to help others when they have a question about a concept and when she does help the explanation is no good. Avoid taking her class!,0
"For someone who failed math repeatedly in high school and got an A in this class, Id say hes a pretty good professor. If you dont go to class and pay attention to the examples he works through you will fail. Weekly quizzes but theyve are 10 minutes long and easy if you showed up the class before. Very good professor, sometimes hard to understand",1
"Loved her and she really does make you work for it, but in a great way. Astronomy is my favorite subject and it should be a requirement to take this class. She made me feel so special by reminding me of how lucky I am to be on Earth. I didn't need this class for a requirement, I took it for my own love of our universe. Thanks, professor Walker! ",1
"He's a great teacher.  He clearly knows what he's talking about, and he can answer just about any question in the subject.  Several papers to write and books to read, but overall a great class.",1
"Started off a good class but quicikly went down hill. Not a good summer class! the information was too dense and he expected you to start off on a level that nobody was at. He didn't teach just used the textbook and made students teach part of each class for him. He was a very nice guy though so I will give him that, few good assignments.",0
I took Stephens for Shakespeare.  The material covered in class is not hard.  What's hard is that Stephens likes to ask juvenile trick questions on her tests to lower the scores.  It's damn near impossible to get an 'A' on any of her papers (I only managed 2 A's) because she is always extremely vague when explaining what she wants.,1
Really good class to take.  She makes it easy to follow along and very fair in grading.  The only problem is when she turns the lights off its a little harder to pay attention (night class),1
"Coop was a cool guy, but he was an awful teacher.  I often left class confused and didn't understand and went to office hours but his tests were 2600still hard,  but gives generous curves because of the low averages.  I did very well in calc in high school but his class was terribly hard & doesn't prep you for the final at all.",0
Can easily carry a 2-hour lecture. Brings a wealth of experience. My favorite professor by far. ,1
She is very caring and easy to get a hold of if you ever have a question outside of class. She ask for feed back so do not be afraid to speak up if you need more practice work sheets to help yo understand the concepts. Watches many videos in class to help understand the concepts in each chapter.,1
She is glamorous as ever but not as helpful. She will help if you go to office hours but she tends to talk in circles. I really wanted to like her but I don't feel like she explained what was necessary. I will say she attempted but it wasn't the best.,0
"class is a joke, he gets side tracked on everthing but attendance is graded. Tests are easy, and he grades even easier. extra credit available on all homework and quiz points are also extra. you wont have to work hard but you wont learn anything either....overall waste of time and money",0
"Such a hard grader! He gets down to the nitty-gritty of his rubrics, you have to do everything specifically how he says or you won't receive full credit. Discussion boards have to be 3 replies DURING the week, God forbid you post 3 replies/day. Only good thing I can say about him is the material is good, other than that, wouldn't recommend at all!",0
"I learned so much in her class, she will help you out as much as you want- you just have to ask her.  She is an awesome teacher and really nice person, her expectations are high, but not unreasonably.",1
"If you are reading this, do NOT take this professor. Lectures are long, boring, and unrelative to the course. She is confusing about what she wants to see in assignments/essays. I never know when anything is due because she doesn't go by the syllabus. Pushes political opinions on students too much. Says she wants X but looks for Y.",0
I took his online music class and it was an easy A. The content is super easy but the listening quizzes are pretty hard. The strike at the university messed up a lot of things and the grade book was funky for a while. When you email him he usually responds pretty quick but he isn't clear by what he means.,1
Speaks in broken English that's very hard to understand what is being taught.  Never likes to repeat questions and teach at a very fast paste. Never comes to math lab are makes himself available for help.,0
She cares way too much about rocks. Its weird. She expects us all to be geologists even though the majority of our class are not geology majors. If you are thinking to take her just to get your science credit - DONT. She will make what you think will be a blow-off class way too hard.,0
"Great Professor! He was really easy to connect to and very animated during lectures. When writing papers, he will give great feedback on how you can improve. Most of the due dates are set at the beginning of the semester, so stick to the schedule, show up to class and participate. Would definitely recommend him to anyone and everyone.",1
"This is by far the most incompetent professor I have ever had. I have had her for two classes now, and the second was worse than the first. Hey syllabus is nearly never correct, she is unorganized, and her teaching is a joke. She stays so topical, critical thinking and discussion would never be fostered in he classes. Her tests reflect it too.",0
I took him for Java and he made the class enjoyable and interesting with his examples and lectures. Make sure to go to class so he likes you and don't sleep/ yawn. Make sure to do the lab projects so you actually learn the material.,1
"I've taken Physics and Intro to Solar System Astronomy with her. She's very interesting, and gives lots of great examples. Class is extremely interactive and she is incredibly quirky. Honest grader. Her English isn't perfect, but it doesn't take much to understand what she says. Encourages students to correct her grammatical errors. Very chill.",1
Excellent professor and a great person. He teaches beyond engineering. He teaches you life skills. Mr. Blake has been a mentor and a great friend.,1
"Nice guy, a bit strange. He is not a very good professor and the tests questions are not fair. I have a 3.9 gpa and I got a B+ in his class so just try your best if you end up getting him for 300.",0
"One of the most fun GSEMs! Instead of structuring class around papers and readings, the class is structured around performances. You truly go behind the scenes through workshops with actors, radio editing, museums, and dance rehearsals! About half of classes have guest lecturers. ALSO SHE BRINGS SNACKS TO EVERY CLASS. And you publish for Annenberg!",1
"I thoroughly enjoyed taking this course with Dr. Reddy! She makes her expectations for the course clear and provides plenty of study materials/resources. There is a lot of homework, but it does help with understanding the lectures and material. Highly recommend taking Biology with her!",1
"She is a super tough grader on her 2 virtual child papers. Go to her &the TA before hand for ANY Q's bc clarifying what u have written is important. Her exams r very fair, & I personally never read the book &only used it to quote for the papers. Dont forget to do the discussion board posts and go to all the ec she offers. She grades out of 430 pts",1
"have professor Tompson for PS101, Andy class is ridiculous compared to my friends'. This class was WAY over the top for an intro psych class. most other classes had 3 tests and no final, whereas Tompson gives 3 in depth tests AND a cumulative final. In addition, she requires a difficult 4 page paper that NO OTHER PS101 class requires.",1
"Prof. Quinlan is the sweetest professor I have ever had.  He genuinely cares about his students.  On the first day of class he said do the assignments well and get an A, just ok get an A-, and don't do them B+. He doesn't care if you show up or not, just that you're doing ok as a person. The assignments are rather tedious, but the films are great.",1
"If you are unfortunate to have him for your COB 300 marketing class, JUST CHANGE MAJORS NOW! He is by far, the worst professor I have ever taken. He will tell you to study a certain part of the material, and test on the complete opposite. To make it worse, he took a class in grad school about formatting exams which are ridiculously hard. Good luck!",0
"HORRIBLE! His essays are so hard to get a good grade on, he doesn't teach all he does is read from the book and expect us to know how to write A+ essays. I dropped his class it wasn't even worth going to. I would never take him again.",0
"Quizzes every single day, and just 10 mins per quizz, make sure show up every day for grade. She will drop some of your bad grades. She teaches very fast. Don't take her class If you are not good at math. She has no inspiration, i can't not focus on what she taught. Study by myself at home help me pass all her test",0
Easily the worst professor I've had at UK. Don't bother asking him a question in class because it's a guarantee he will miss it and a student will have to correct him. And he does very little explaining how he gets his answers. Would not recommend,0
Shes so relatable. She understands what you are going through and doesnt judged anyone. Shes also very funny!,1
Seriously NEVER TAKE THIS PROFESSOR unless you're amazing at math already I don't think he did his online lectures past the first 2 weeks of school he just uploaded the notes and it was basically like a GOOD LUCK type situation you teach yourself and him really he also teaches the most confusing ways to do things he confuses himself,0
"Even if you do exactly what he wants, word by word, you will not get an A. He refuses to give out 100% and can never be reached in time. His lectures have NOTHING to do with anything you do in class, but since attendance is mandatory, it is a waste of time. There are projects back to back with no clear grading criteria and hundreds of assignments.",0
"Professor Castano goes on tangents a lot about Spanish countries and her background. The online homework matters a lot, don't goof off/ talk back in class she doesn't respond well to it. If you participate and communicate with her you will be fine.",1
"I really struggled in his class. I only missed a few classes and still had issues understanding what he was teaching. You can tell that he knows the information, it's just sometimes confusing to understand the way he explains things. He always offered to help me in and out of class, but I found it easier to get a tutor.",0
"AMAZING! One of the smartest people I have EVER MET IN MY LIFE!!! enjoy this class, its awesome",1
"This class fails the Lemon Test. Effectively speaking, the Secular Purpose of this class is to give a comparative examination of Scriptural Texts AS Literature. Pym fails this and instead has students listening to interviews of self-proclaimed ""Mystics"" and not one piece of literature. This class has no secular purpose and skeptics are not welcome.",0
"His quizzes, are 5 questions and they are hard. When he says he gives partial credit, it 4/10, and he doesn't really give feedback. Tests are about the same but at 10 questions. Must go to office hours in order to get more time for understanding material. In lecture he speeds through it you have to ask questions. Do not be scared to ask!!!",0
She WILL help you become a better speaker and her assignments will challenge you to think outside the box. She doesn't critique too hard but you will have to work for that A. She will straight up tell you that she has no problem dropping and failing people who don't show up or do the work. One midterm and final.,1
"She is the best TA that you could ever have. Her hilarious comments and lightening out mood by playing baby sharks was a real highlight of this class. While she is a tough grader at times, she does it to make you better and honestly thought me so much more than I ever thought I could learn.",1
"This professor is just as hard as Mary Allen, another a&p professor at North Harris. She knows the materials and explains them well. I just don't like her aloofness. In class, she is funny with lectures; but outside of class, she is  totally opposite. So unapproachable.  She doesn't show much interest in answering questions.",1
Great professor! I would definitely recommend him to anybody for learning frameworks.,1
"I would take this class again. Going in with some information and experience with excel and power point will definitely make this class easier for you. I felt like I learned something from this class and overall the class wasn't very hard. Weekly discussions and quizzes, three excel projects and one paper. Could have been worse.",1
"Although the test were very hard (highest grade was 50), I still made an A because of all the extra assignments. They were all easy, fun, and interesting. She is also very funny in class.",1
"Dr. Vinebrooke was without a doubt my favorite prof this year. He cares about his students and really tries to get them into the material hes teaching. Hes a fair grader and allows extensions. For one of the labs, they brought us a bunch of algae drinks and snacks! I recommend this class to anyone, algae people are great.",1
"Her online class is the easiest class i've taken.  You will learn how to use word, powerpoint, excel, access, on myitlab, and have a test on all 4 parts. Besides that you have to participate in discussions, take 3 easy exams, and other easy assignments. Nothing you can't handle. She's also replies on a timely manner to your messages. RECOMMENDED!",1
"Such a sweetheart, really tries to connect with students ; class can easily get boring ; material is hard but hw, lectures, and office hours help immensely ; big on academic integrity ; will constantly call for attention to try and keep kids engaged",1
"Dr. Kosnik is lovely. He is super passionate about music, and it shows in his lectures. He keeps his lectures short and engaging. He is by far my favorite professor.",1
There is a midterm and a final and they are mostly comprised of the quizzes. Make sure to review the outlines. The quizzes have very specific questions and little amount of time is provided. There is an assignment due every week. You have to really WORK.,0
Best professor ever! Easy A honestly gives a review for both final and midterm. You have to do one 7-10 page research paper towards the end. Also a couple of small writing assignments throughout the semester and you have to post 5 responses on blackboard. She does give weekly readings just make sure you have a general idea about it and you'll be :),1
"Vraimenr ennuyant comme cours. Le livre suffit pour la matière. Les examens ne traitent même pas de la matière vu en classe, c'est seulement de la logique. Ce n'est aucunement du par coeur, mais du bon sens. Elle est très généreuse dans la correction des travaux et le cours est facile a passé. Personne coule.",0
Worst teacher I have ever had at Duquesne. Horribly disrespectful to her students and talks to them like they're dumb.,0
"I wrote over 25 papers for this class -- 3 papers a week on average for INTRO to Literature. His essays are incredibly vague and you will have to go to office hours for help since he does not make it clear what he wants. I recommend taking any other professor for this course. Show up to class, read the material, and work for your grade.",0
"This guy will challenge you in every way you can be academically challenged.  I worked harder in this one class than I did my entire sophomore year.Make sure you know your calculus,derivative and integrals.He expects that you remember EVERYTHING you have been taught.The homework is damn near impossible, and his exams probably took years off my life",0
"Great teacher, and she uses a ton of examples. The reports are a pain but they actually do make sense in the long run.",1
"I can go on for days why this class will be the worse decision you ever make. Professor Dewan if you're reading this (He's definitely reading this) please take the time to appreciate my advice, I usually charge for my services but I'm feeling a little generous today. Since there is a character limit I will find a way to give you my advice.",0
"The textbook used is terrible and doesn't have an answer key online, the homework isn't properly graded so you can't track your progress, her accent makes it hard to understand lectures, and she assumes we know everything so resorts to writing ""duh"" on the board instead of explaining concepts. For a potential math major, she is a wrong choice.",0
"I took Professor Klebaur during the summer. We only had four papers and four exams, which were all multiple choice. Study guides were provided.  Attendance wasn't mandatory but will help when it comes to the PPTs. She's a great professor and very understanding. She also gave random E.C for those who came to class and participated.  Easy A.",1
"THE BEST TEACHER EVER!!! so caring and devoted to her students I can't stress that enough. Truly a gem. biggest advice is to come to class, attendance is a grade and write everything but the material is so interesting and she is amazing it won't be a problem. Her energy lights up the room and she breaks down everything you need to know to pass.",1
"Probably the worst professor  I have had so far at Schulich (MBA). Clearly isn't well suited to teach the MBA curriculum, as all he knows are theories, but has difficulty relating back to relevant work scenarios. AVOID - take with Friendman.",0
"She openly admits to not being good at lecturing and it shows quickly. She clearly has experience but she can't form the sentences to properly share her knowledge. Nice woman, kind of funny, but it does not make up for her flaws. We had one big group project that was near impossible. Tests suck too. Quit now.",0
"Laura is one of the most unorganized professors I've ever had as a student at UWM. We have assignments from October that are still not graded. Her assignments and quizzes all have typos on them, her instructions for everything are confusing and full of nonsensical words. Good luck if you have to take this class with her.",0
"The lectures is the only way you'll see the powerpoint of notes. The labs are mandatory and at the beginning of class there's a quiz of the reading about the lab, she'll ask 2 random questions, even what is the Latin name of a bacteria... The lab practical is very difficult, remember the organisms, their functions, group name, their labeled parts.",1
"I took organic 2 and chem 101 Kiesewetter. A lot of people like her because she is bubbly in comparison to other chemistry professors. However, she is not a good teacher. I learned all the material on my own, and she is not very helpful with explaining things. She will just go through problems and expect people to conform to how she does things.",0
Semester Project was a 30 page paper (written in a group).  Gave oral exams (interesting set up)  Also teaches some undergrad courses.  Came from MIT.  Reasonable guy.  (seems like he would go out for a beer after class).,1
"I would recomend taking professor Fujimoto over any other teacher. Shes easy to work with and has great feedback. If you attend class, listen and do her readings youll pass. She doesnt give tough assignments and is very flexible. I truly think shes an amazing teacher!",1
"I read these reviews after taking her class and I'm honestly shocked. She does explain things relatively well, but has such a rude attitude if you ask her any questions in lab. She kicked a girl out and failed her after screaming at her for coming in 15 min late and asking questions. Never seen anything so rude before.",0
"Meryl is not a good teacher. It is that simple. Ruined my interest in English which is sad considering my major is Journalism. Very judgmental, and very sarcastic.",0
She is indeed rude on email. Everything is online. You study by yourself and take the exams online. The Examity she used doesnt work sometimes. And I missed the midterm for some tech issues. Not recommended!,0
"Communicates horribly!! Terrible explaining stuff, and requires a lot of work. Not understanding. I did not enjoy her class at all.",0
"I took his online class. 2 Minor Speeches and 3 Major persuasive speeches. Quizzes every Sunday, based only on textbook and after 2 lowest grade dropped. 3 Exams based on selected chapters. The textbook was expensive and the access code is required. His lectures were based on the quiz after it is taken, which was repetitive. Overall, easy grader!",1
One of the better teachers I have had yet. She goes over problems in great detail and will personally help you if you go to her. She wants to see everyone understand why things happen and not just getting the answer.,1
"He was an average professor that did fine for teaching online. He had videos you could watch and lectures. Your homework and QA are worth 30%, they're simple if you use your resources. three test, one gets dropped, 40%. Final is 30%. The class was average, if you study and put the time in you will do fine. Definitely not an easy A, but still good.",1
Very difficult lab instructor. She's a really nice person but will rip you a new one when it comes to grading. She will take off points for any little thing and before you know it you have a terrible grade on lab reports. She always seemed annoyed when you asked her questions during lab so take her at your own risk,0
"He tries but not enough. His study guides are useless. Most of this class i taught myself. It was really harsh exams, you can pass it if you get good grades in hw and quizzes but even there you will need at least 50 in the two midterms. Advice if you have to take it from him, do not even try to fight with him. No extra credit so dont even ask.",0
He is a smart guy but not cut out for teaching. Just reads off the slides unless he's talking about his own research. Covers way too much material. Would avoid taking the class or wait till a different professor is teaching it.,0
"There are no words to describe how good this professor is. I believe he is one of the very best! He turned my hatred for math to loving math because of his teachings. He makes sure you get it in a gentle way that is not forceful nor demeaning. ECC is not doing him justice by not placing him on full time. ECC needs more Professors like him, period!",1
"Great guy. Average professor. You can fall behind fast in this class, so prioritize it over others. Plenty of EC. Main downside, taught in Java!? C'mon it's 2018. So beware, this class is more difficult than it needs to be because it is taught in cavemen language. Teach JS or Python based stacks. More job opportunities and it'll be easier to teach.",0
"Frank Sobie is amazing. He taught my Geography 142 online and it was a breeze after I became used to the online pacing and way of things, it was my first online class. His directions were always clear and he typically responded thoughtfully to any emails with questions that I sent to him. He offered extra credit a lot, was understanding, 10/10.",1
"I had her for 101 and 102. At first, I thought she just always found something wrong with everything and wasn't helpful. I used her feedback (she always writes feedback on papers to help you), and asked questions about it if it wasn't clear. She was very helpful and informative when you asked. You have to learn her style and work hard to get As.",1
"Christy is a great professor! The class is not difficult, but reading the materials and participating in all discussion posts is beneficial! She is very kind and encouraging and gives great feedback on assignments (which are easy and fun!)",1
"Schaal takes tricky concepts and makes them a lot easier to understand. He does an amazing job of finding ways to explain complicated concepts with real life examples.   Tests are hard and theres a lot of homework, but a lot of that is because there's a lot to cover in the class. ",1
"Midterm and exam were 10X harder than they needed to be with hypothetical type questions and things that have no real answer, just his opinion. Vague instructions yet expects a very specific response. Weekly D2L posts were graded hard and impossible to get a good mark. Avoid like the plague.",0
"Let me just say that Dr. Vartanian IS THE BEST PSYCHOLOGY PROFESSOR EVER. Just take a class with her and you'll understand. But anyway, participation is not mandatory IF YOU'RE GOING TO READ THE WHOLE BOOK AND TAKE THE EXAMS. however, if you attend all lectures you'll literally never use the book. She's really lovely and passionate, Good Luck (:",1
"James(As he likes us to call him) is an amazing professor. He goes into the details of the material and only that. He's very humorous and his lectures are entertaining. His voice kinda has a sarcastic feel to it, so even when he's being serious it just sounds like it's sarcasm. Overall, I loved this class and all the time spent learning in it.",1
"She thinks that she is better than everyone else, when she is truly not! She thinks that all the attention needs to be on her, and does a good job trying to make people feel bad.",0
"Full of knowledge and very clear about what you need to know for the exams. Attendance isn't ""mandatory"" but there are in-class assignments that you have to be there for. I would take this professor again in a heart beat.",1
Mrs Schultz was a good teacher she is kinda hard to understand at times but she gives good lectures and will help you at any time,1
Was not considerate when i was out sick Even though it says redos on papers gets one week to complete she told me that I needed to have the final draft due that night as I needed to redo it. It says one week on syllabus and she said that's only after i grade it. she was making me redo it instantly and didn't follow syllabus she made so i dropped it,0
She is very unorganized. Doesn't give clear instructions on what she expects to be turned in.  You must teach yourself. Exams are almost never similar to the study guides. At first seems nice but it all changes. Class goes from being full to only 17 people by the end. If I knew she was this bad I would of never taken her class. ,0
"Awesome prof! Has fun demonstrations, and explains things clearly. Listen to his random stories though, they appear on the exams!!",1
I took Psychology of Women online this semester and the amount of work Professor Zaech expects from a 100 level psychology class is absolutely ridiculous. My discussion board posts every week were pages long and it was still impossible to get 100% on my responses.,0
"I took this class to boost my gpa. Way too much work for a class that should be simple. Yes, you watch movies, but you also have to do a lot of reading. The avg on all assignments is in the 70s. Very rude and condescending in emails, harsh grader, TAs grade nicer but you have 0 contact w them. Never once felt sure if I was doing anything correctly.",0
great teacher!!!,1
Takes himself and his classes seriously,1
she takes her 1 credit class too serious and never replies back too emails :/,0
greatness is an understatement of this mans collabor in his ability to educate the youths of tomorrow .,1
"When you ask him a ""?""  you have to elaborate on it. He doesn't give a direct answer most of the time, so be prepared to research the ""?"" yourself. He spends the majority of the time lecturing on the topic's background rather than going straight to whats necessary for the exams. His exams are much more confusing than the hw (lots of trick ""?"").",0
"Worst teacher I have ever had.  Gives no practice problems.  Tests are unpredictable and very hard.  lectures are a waste.  Get good at reading all the random graphs .  Find a student who has taken this class and beg them for more old tests.  The only way to prepare is to do as many old tests as possible.  Just try to get through it, good luck.  ",0
"I thought she was pretty good. Her lectures are kinda boring. I didnt read the textbook, just do her study guides because its basically the same as the test (I usually found the study guide answers on a quizlet)She says shes a hard grader but I got As on both the papers we had to write. Go to class bc she gives random extra credit!!",1
"Do not waste your time or money with this guy. He doesn't care about student needs. Doesn't adjust to feedback from previous reviews, also the overall class is 100 level at best. I highly recommend literally any other professor for COMM220. You will not learn any new information in this class, nor will you be challenged intellectually.",0
"I took this class online(virtual) and she go very fast over the homework problems. It wasn't mandatory that you participated online. She made us meet at the school to take the exams,which I didn't understand since it's a virtual online class.",1
"She is a hard grader, I wouldnt recommend. Lots of reading",0
Dr. Hadavas assigned 6 quizzes and dropped the lowest grade as well as weighted the quizzes to help boost the overall grade. His lectures clearly explained the material and his quizzes were clearly reflected from what he covered in class and the examples he gave.,1
Horrible! Wanted to cry almost every time because his readings are so difficult to understand,0
"I learned a lot in this class and it was so easy! Sometimes you think a class is easy and by that you learn nothing, but not here. Still, that does not mean take it lightly. Do your work and be interactive. The professor gets straight to the point and wants you to learn and pass.",1
"I really liked this guy. He taught well, made sure everyone understood the material, which is very hard to do in a class the size I was in. This did make the pace a little slow, but not too bad.",1
I had professor Le for Statistics and pre-calculus and I think he's amazing. I am not very good at math but I could understand everything very easily. He goes step by step and makes sure you understand before he moves on. You have to make sure that you do the homework because that's how you practice. I would definitely take him again.,1
"If you're actually interested in learning, do not take her class. Doesn't have the in depth knowledge to explain the material well or derive stuff. Was telling in the class how hard the grad school was and how she was getting pretty poor grades. However if you just want to get an easy course without needing any proper deep understanding, she is ok.",0
I really enjoyed this class! Dr. Bland is awesome as long as you do the work and show effort you should be fine .,1
"Amazing teacher,  easy A for Prob & Stat. Very funny and it might take the whole class to explain one problem but that means no homework",1
Don't take online. Mandatory 2 hour chats that are hard to get in to and hard to find time for. 4 weekly quizzes. Plus a discussion weekly. 4 papers. He also gave out an extra credit filed trop assignment less than 24 hours ahead of time making it impossible to make time for.,0
We know you use a hair dryer.  What What What a hair dryer?  Great Instructor.,1
Most likely the best professor in the religious studies department and possibly one of the best in VCU. She is helpful and her lectures are engaging.,1
"Mr. Quire is hands down the best teacher I have ever had. Yes, it is an easy class but not because he doesn't teach you anything, you will get a B or A easy but be able to not only understand but be passionate about things that used to seem dull. He tricks you into learning with his humor. I plan to take every class he teaches.",1
I loved this class! so easy and fun :),1
"Didn't know this guys name until I looked it up. Very disorganized class. He talks the entire class, mostly about nonsense, then tells you to take a pop quiz. His talking makes you doze off and not pay attention to anything. His quizzes will feature questions on things he quickly covered that you wouldn't remember if he didn't tell you to know it.",0
"Professor Dewan has a very heavy accent that is difficult to understand. If you try to ask a question because you did not know what he said, he will put you down. His lectures make no sense and spends half the time complaining about his students. You can attend every class and jot down every word he says and you will not learn a thing.",0
"He is a highly educated person with good intentions. However, his classes are a waste of time. His facts and data are usually wrong.  He talks in circles and most of the time makes no sense.",0
"If you are looking for an experienced, helpful, and involved teacher STAY AWAY! His experience teaching is little, and his interest in teaching seems half hearted. He is knowledgeable in the material, but he expects professional workers, not students. Good for experience students who want credit, not those that want to learn in a school setting.",0
The class is not hard at all and he gives no homework. All you have to do is read the chapters and there is a quiz every week. He makes the final paper worth 1% so it doesn't affect your grade. He is really nice and is available at the bridge twice a week to study with. He tries to makes things as easy as possible.,1
"Horrible Psych experience. As a PSY major, I wanted to learn from interesting reads + classmates. Instead it's ALL text book and extremely difficult gradng. Tests are 100 M.C ?'s very hard stuff. WOULD NOT REC. Not a good Psych professor at all.",0
"This professor give you from 2-3 project for each of the 12 Chapters plus a Test with 30 to 50 Question. Every 3 Chapter he will add 1, 2 or 3 Project call Caps on Project from those three Chapter and after all that work you will also have a Final Exam with limited time and very long so he divided it in 3 Final Exams with 50 questions each.",0
sooo easy and she's a really nice person. very passionate about the subject matter. Can be boring alot but still recommend,1
"Melanie was an amazing prof for English 100. There were lots of readings and forum posts in the course and four essays. It was not lecture heavy. She gave very clear and positive feedback and was always willing to give extra help or clarify things. Overall, the course was not too difficult. I highly recommend taking a class with her if you can!",1
"great guy and good professor. However, the grading criteria in this class is ridiculous. it is almost impossible to get a 4.0 in this class. the test are not that bad but he gives no concept list ahead of time and there is zero extra credit in the class. if you are worried about your GPA and want to keep it high, I would not recommend his class.",0
Nice guy but terrible teacher. Learned absolutely nothing from this class and after being a deans list student for 1 1/2 this man was the first to prevent me making it. Quizzes and test are nearly impossible and this class will hurt your GPA. You've been warned! Normally don't leave reviews but I don't want anyone to suffer.,0
It's a shame this man is a professor for the prerequisite classes. He seems so unhappy teaching 2D and 3D which transfers into our class environment. If you are not conceptual or performative do not expect him to like your work. I see him discouraging many future artists which is very disappointing. Do not take him if you have the option.,0
"this class was my least favorite class. the teacher is hot but that doesnt make up for the total lack of personality, he is so boring i wanted to shoot myself in the face every class. plus it is some dumb experimental math class where they give you a bunch of stupid word problems. would never do this class over again",0
"You have to attend class and pay attention, but as long as you pay attention in class (ESPECIALLY to the pictures and maps) you'll do fine on the exams. Pretty interesting course and easy connections are drawn between the different civilizations. Would definitely recommend as an easy A to science students.",1
"I don't know if I would recommend this professor. Yes,I passed with an A but I think eveyone in the class did.Did I learn anything? Absolutly not.You better now how to speak spanish if you take a class with him cause he mostly will teach in spanish.He reads straight from the power points and exams are nothing like reviews.",0
He is so funny. If you try to get to know him he is willing to help. Good Guy.,1
Super hard to understand (accent). Not very helpful. A good guy though...,0
" He has a great sense of humor. Nothing about his classes are ever boring. He plays music videos, lectures, commercials, and so on to teach you to distinguish Ethos, Pathos, and Logos. As long as you show up, do the work he assigns, and laugh with him, your good to go. Very understanding, and treats you fairly. Would take again! ",1
First of all its hard to understand what she is trying to say because her English isnt very good. She makes things harder than they needed to be. Yes she lets you use all your notes and past homework on exams but they are not helpful at all,0
"This teacher... wow (that's good) i took another chem class before this one and the differences between them vary, she goes at a slow pace, she makes us work without the pressure and has a hard hand/soft heart. quizzes help out immensely and very easy to talk to. Want an easy A? hate chem but need it? This is the class for you?",1
"This instructor is terrible.  She expects you to know everything, which is impossible.  Print outs are useless because they only list general terms with no information so you never know what your surposed know. Has good intentions, but not a good teachers.  Lots of essay questions, be prepared if taking this class.",0
"If you show up and actually try, you'll pass with flying colors. She really had trouble with using canvas properly (like making our weekly course overview as an assignment) and by the end of the semester, I had about 10 missing grades. Other than that, she was ok, but I didn't enjoy the class.",0
"If you have no background in  stats, absolutely avoid this class. He honestly reads directly off the powerpoint, (which he didn't even make), and he is no help if you ask any questions. It always seems like he just wants to get out of the class as quickly as possible. He is the worst professor I could ever imagine having in college.",0
"One of the best and most caring professors yet. If you attend lecture and listen/ study ppts you will get an A, he hints what specific questions will be on the exams and gives us questions that are on the exam. Exams and objectives are extremely straightforward. He is lenient and has extended deadlines to help us succeed, he puts a lot of effort",1
One of the clearest teachers I've ever had. Makes the lectures interesting and is a nice teacher. We have one ten point hw assignment a week and 4 tests-which she replaces your attendance grade on the lowest one. Final is only over one chapter. I would take her again,1
"Mrs. Padgett,is a wonderful professor, this is the second class I've taken with her, my first being online in high school. She is a tough grader, but you can always make it up. She is available for extra help at the high school she teaches at and she is willing to help those who do the work. So friendly, and super sweet, I just love her!!",1
"Garver is the best professor at USC.  If you have a passion for Music Tech, Garver is the MAN! He literally knows EVERYTHING. I brought him my personal mixes privately after every class and he was always happy to help. If you truly want to be an audio pro, he'll take you there. (BTW took 5 of his classes, Mastering and Mixing were my favorites). ",1
"Stay far far away from this teacher. She does not care about her students at all, it's almost like she wants us to fail. Her tests don't match the curriculum and she feels no remorse for the class's failing averages on these ridiculous exams and quizzes she conjures up. In her mind, she is perfect and we are all, and I quote, ""brain dead"".",0
"I took his class online. He assigned chapters for each week from the book but I never used it, explains everything in his notes. Easy class and he makes the material interesting.",1
"Ms. Polster is very friendly and helpful, however her guidelines for assignments weren't very clear. I recommend her, though.",1
Nothing you read or study in this class will help you on his tests. It's like he pulls his questions out of thin air. I am a straight A student and will probably have to drop this class because I currently have a D in it. Do not take this guy!,0
"His questions in class lingered on and on. Unimportant topics that he had some hidden interest in were just driven. His tests were okay. In the essay portion he wants every single last detail. I drew a chart, and cited him word-for-word and still got a 4 out of 6 on one question.",1
"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. I took this class for a breadth and regret doing so. It's is incredibly boring. All she does is drone on and on and no one listens. Awful teaching. There are 5 pop quizzes that the class average is always a 60-70%. If you're going to take this class, take it with a different professor.",0
Don't take this professor. She has a haughty attitude and is VERY moody!! She tries to make her students feel less than if they try to get clarification on a topic but she isn't so knowledgeable about the topic she is teaching.,0
Very clear on what he needs from you to pass. He knows quite a lot about Illinois and is a great first resource for material for your paper. Would totally take this class again!,1
Professor Hersh makes things extremely unclear. It is impossible to know exactly what she wants from you unless you ask (the syllabus is impossible to comprehend) and even then the guidelines are hard to understand. Several essays and three assignments in which you must watch movies at home and answer study guide questions. Nothing is on canvas. The syllabus is more strict than she is. I've never done more unnecessary reading in my life.,0
"She rambles about her personal life most of the time. Pay attention enough to answer correctly and she lets you do what you want. She doesn't answer questions well at all, so you're probably better off getting a tutor.",0
"He used Connect in our class and all the homework, quizzes, mid term and final were on there. He really cares about the students passing the class and even gave the students with the highest mid term grades $1 witch is not a lot but still something fun to look forward to! Class was until 10pm but he normally let us out around 9, no later then 9:15",1
"He gives you one assignment a week, which works out okay cause it gives you a chance to do well. He is too smart for his own good, he thinks we all have knowledge of what he is doing even though it is a beginner class. He does post the lecture videos online which is a HUGE help because you can go back and watch them while doing the assignments.",0
"Jeff is an absolute beauty, didn't really show up he didn't care easy grader",1
Homework assignments are very easy to get 100 on. Two group projects that are mostly graded on the idea and not really how you present it. Test are easy if you study sometimes he throws some questions in that are not fair cause they are trick questions.,1
"Dr. Makri was awesome, she has all the qualities I would like to have as a therapist. She is genuine, empathetic, and very approachable. She is more than fair on grading so not a hard A. But cares more about participation, thought provoking discussions, and that we actually take away something that question, affirm or change our opinions.",1
"He would spend a large amount of time having us watch irrelevant movies or talking about topics not directly related to US History. He would also have us read from the book but ignore the material and test us on absurd topics, e.g. How are Trump and Hitler related (we didn't even cover the rise of Hitler or his policies pre-WWII).",0
"Professor Mancini is great at what she does! She loves teaching, and will make the class enjoyable. The assignments she gives are very easy. My class was a hybrid and it was still easy to follow. She gives you credit for showing up to class, so don't skip! Overall I would recommend her!!",1
"Prof. Shine is a really great guy. He's very nice and down to earth. I didn't really like the class, I found it boring. However, I really liked the professor. He talks a lot about his life, which is more interesting than the content. He's very passionate about his class.",1
"Albert Cervantes is a joke of a professor. Late to class, sometimes doesn't bother to show up, doesn't grade anything til last minute, gives less points for everything, and overall just a mess. Office hour is non existent as only his assistant are here to help. Probably busy with his other job but that is not a excuse to have poor teaching/ethics",0
if that was psychlogy then i'm glad it wasnt my major...another bad class at PBU...all he did was preach every class and show movies...,0
"He did have some pretty math jokes, and he liked to tell the history of what we learned about.  He didn't really explain anything else.  He would just quickly go through everything without stopping to explain his steps.  Also, his examples did not really help for the homework, and the quizzes were different than both homework and the lecture.",0
"If your not interested in the Bible, don't take this class. If you interested in it, definitely take it. Professor Zank was engaging, interesting, compassionate towards outside opinion, and very interested in student's comprehension. One of the best classes I've had at BU. But remember... you should be interested in the subject first!",1
"Reddy was great. The class moves fast, it covers a whole chapter each lecture. Every class except three throughout the whole term is a lecture, and theres very minimal homework. The material itself is definitely manageable, as long as you stay on top of your learning. The labs taught by grad assistants were genuinely fun, which is a plus!",1
"Excellent teacher, he is really patient with his students, and I love that he motivates us to improve ourselves everyday.",1
Easy class but this man takes FOREVER to respond and grade! He is very unorganized!,0
"Matt is an absolutely fantastic lecturer. I looked forward to coming to this class every day. However, if you're not good at sitting through lectures, this might not be the course for you. The only qualm I had with this class was the strange grading structure, in which your entire grade is based off of 5 quizzes and two exams.",1
Terrible teacher. I suggest you drive up to another school to take this class. He never replies to any of my issues that occur learning th information. The teacher is making me think about switching my major cause I dont know what i am learning. If you are a person that can only learn through a teacher I suggest to find diff. teacher. bad teacher,0
"Zero direction.  I learned more from YouTube lectures regarding her assignments than I did from her. Having to show up to her class was a waste of my time and efforts.  I was not there to learn about her personal life, or to hear my classmates read paragraphs of short story handouts. We are ALL adults who know how to read! -Borning",0
"Easiest CGS2100, I'm not sure he even looks over the assignments and gives everyone an A. Took it online but still very accessible.",1
"She's extremely entitled. She says she is 'strict' under the guise of just being relatively self-important. I say this because she doesn't listen enough to her own students & demeans them. In a speech class, where students have to speak even when they have social anxieties, why is a professional in the subject demoralizing and degrading them?",0
"Ignores student perspective. It's her way or the wrong way. Quizzes are confusing. The class topic is so easy to understand but somehow this professor mixes in her own ideas and it turns into a completely, hectic and confusing class. Despite receiving an A, I know that this class is a ""GPA Killer"". I wouldn't recommend this class, 3/10",0
A bit repetitive but he's great ! As long as you follow the essay instructions you can get a good grade on your essay. He cancels class often & his homework is super easy ! Best English teacher,1
Very easy going class. Introduces students to the school and you get to know each other. There is a peer advisor which co teaches classes. Very easy going guy. Very helpful if you go to his office hours.,1
This class was pretty easy. She wants her students to learn and be able to pass this class. Provides plenty of extra credit to help get the better grade. Its not required to attend class to pass but she does give out tips on what to study/extra credit answers when you do. Very helpful and truly cares about her students outside of the classroom.,1
No tests but there are quizzes for the readings and critical reflection papers. Lecture can be pretty boring but the information can be interesting. He doesn't post grades but its an easy class.,1
"AWFUL TEACHER! If your interested in Asian art don't take her class--you retain notihng because she doesn't have herself together enough to be a teacher. She is moody, nasty, and really difficult to get along with. You will dread going to class! She grades unfairly, its all subjective. She puts down everyone-evn those who thought they were ""friends",0
she is a great professor.,1
"Very, very good professor. This guy is the professional you want teaching you- he's got a million years working at the federal courts- who else do you want to learn from?",1
Lisa is very organized and is always well prepared. While she gives a lot of assignments they are absolutely manageable and lend themselves well to the course content.,1
"Mehdi Majbouri is great professor. He teaches material incredibly well so his class is very rewarding in how much you will learn. He is also a very ethusiastic and passionate lecturer. Lectures are always enjoyable and exciting yet never boring. His class is demanding; As withall worthwhile courses, the benefit corresponds with a level of challenge",1
I would definitely recommend her as a prof. She is very clear about HOW you are being graded as well as your progress (unlike my last teacher). She clarifies things very well! Really enjoyed this class despite taking it in the 7 week summer session!,1
"Incredibly harsh, prone to terrifying outbursts, the ""improvements"" made by her course were found to be lackluster when my next english professor graded the lessons I ""learned"" as worse than when I later switched back to my old writing style. Incredibly harsh, irritable, unforgiving. I've taken 4000 level courses with less headache. Stay away.",0
really good teacher,1
"This class was a podium for him to spit his political views out. We actually got told that fantasy football is a construct to keep the white man in power over the black man. Don't be fooled by the name of the class, this has very little to do with sports themselves. The second half of this class is an attack on corporate America and how to ""resist""",0
Overview: Straightforward class. She knows the topic well. She will give you several hypos around exam time in order to prepare you. She dedicated an entire class to Q&A. During the semester she will want you to think about the cases and be engaged.  Socratic Method: Daily use. Moderate difficulty. No passes. If you're unprepared she will move on.,1
Professor Jefferies was amazing. I learned so much from taking his course and it helped set the stone for my programming foundation. I wish I would've taken his course prior to taking the JavaScript course as I feel this course are based upon the essentials when learning any new programming language,1
"Dr. Boden knows his stuff and is very passionate about Geology. The 101 class is, lets just say intense. if you pass the class you will know much more than the standard GEOL 101 student. that being said, pay attention, memorize the stuff and stick it out. It's a hard class, but prioritize it and you'll probably be fine.",1
"This class is time consuming, but it pays off. 4 lecture exams (final is a retake of lowest test). Nothing in the class is cumulative so you can focus on each segment without worrying about previous material. He gives his students more than enough material to succeed. Use the book, attend lecture, PAY ATTENTION and you'll do fine.",1
I took Bushey for lecture online and it was by far my hardest class. I would study for the quizzes so much and take a lot of notes while watching his lecture videos and still fail most of the quizzes. Theres a quiz every thurs worth a lot of points and he gives u barely any time. Dont take him unless your super confident and dont mind stress.,0
I had a rough time this quarter (personal stuff) and Professor Nedd was super supportive the whole time.  If you struggle at all in his class he'll go out of his way to help. He's passionate about his subject (esp. Russian art) and was engaging and entertaining. Definitely the best art history experience I've had so far.,1
she was one of my first professors at CC and I loved her teaching style. Very clear on material and how she grades. Super picky on grading. knows a lot about chemistry and passionate about it. Lots of practice problems and studying required to understand material for exams/quizzes since it is a more difficult class but manageable.,1
This class is all group work literally ever single assignment and she grades so so hard my group got a 50 on just questions for an interview project and she offered no extra credit dont take this class,0
Awesome.,1
Do all of your homework. ALL OF IT. Only way you'll survive. Study the chapter study guides. Only way you'll pass. Avoid if possible.,0
"hes really calm and collected, does a great job at explaining the material and cares about his students. great professor overall. you will not regret taking his class",1
the most unorganized professor. she gets ahead of herself too often and you have to do a peer review which means to grade other peoples homework.. pointless. she also made us have a third exam and a final in the same week (which was a 124 questions.) some of the answers on the exams didn't even have the right answers sometimes. avoid her class.,0
"STAY AWAY IF YOU HAVE ANXIETY! She is THE most disorganized professor I've ever had. It is currently November & she has yet to grade a SINGLE paper or discussion board post for the ENTIRE semester. Last week's REQUIRED reading totaled 170 pgs, yet the syllabus (which she's changed 3 times) says to only expect 50 pgs a week. She's so out of touch.",0
"Class is alright. Exams are wordy which makes it tricky. I was excited to take this class at first but the professor has a bit of an ego which led me to heavily dislike her and the class, bit of a bummer.",0
DO NOT TAKE. The PowerPoints she uses arent hers. Doesnt give you time to write down what is on the slide. Tells you you wont havent to memorize something for the test but then it will appear on the test. Has a thick accent so hard to understand if she does try to explain something,0
I took an online class with this professor. He would rarely answer my emails and I never knew what my grade was in his class. The tests online are 25 questions for a time of 25 minutes. This is very unrealistic to me. Not impressed with this professor at all.,0
"Burke is phenomenal.  HIS 385 is intended to be one of the most difficult courses you take, it's centered around writing a 15 page research paper. Burke makes it fun and breaks the work down to make writing the paper easy! I got an A- in this class... take Burke if you have a chance for ANY class.  He's also my advisor and so helpful and positive!!",1
"Dr. McLaughlin is a great professor! His lectures are interesting, although a little long (he will elaborate on a single topic for a full hour on some days). He takes attendance and participation VERY seriously, and it does affect your grade in the class. Also, there's about 1 assignment per week, but they're all pretty simple. Would recommend! :)",1
"Please don't give yourself a heart attack by taking her, this is not fair in pandemic putting so much pressure on students and heavy test and tough in grading. So Big NO! just run away!",0
"One of the best profs I have ever had. Especially during the pandemic, she was super understanding and very lenient. Grades consist of 3 exams, 1 very easy project where you have the choice to work alone or with a partner/group and weekly quizzes. The exams were very easy just study the lecture slides and there's no textbook.",1
"I took Carrino for Spring '11 Wed 7-9:30. Its a great class and a great professor.  He has something a lot of other professors at MSU don't have: REAL WORLD BUSINESS EXPERIENCE.  He knows his stuff and as long as you do the work (read the material, don't worry he doesn't assign B.S. stuff) you will do fine.  Great speaker with good sense of humor.",1
"Look, Logan is a very nice guy, but he's SO quiet and slow, that the class was so painfully boring to sit through. He got really behind because of how slow he is, so the last couple of days of class were insane. He's a poor planner, as our last test was on the last dat of class, and the following Monday was the final. I hated this class.",1
"His lectures are mind-numbingly boring. Sit in front of the class because he mumbles. The mumbling plus his thick accent makes it really difficult to understand. He only goes over things one time and he does it quickly, like if he's reading from a list and he needs to check off everything. Don't take it if you don't have to.",0
"Pretty straight-forward.  Discusses every reading in class and cold-calls sometimes.  Exam was very similar to past exams, so no surprises.  Also, exam is closed book (or at least was in the 2 classes I took).",1
"typed his lectures during the course. overall, unprepared and sloppy. failed to provide clear grading criteria for coursework. ",0
Very difficult class.  Didn't help that he burned through the material.  Nice guy though.  Knew what he was doing.,0
She is hilarious thourogh and engaging lectures easy to access through office hours ... miss her a lot,1
hes not that good of a teacher. he cant teach at all,0
"Professor Putnam, as a freshman, is my first professor that I've liked at UNH. He's very caring and intelligent at what he does. He's very accessible outside of class, and is willing to help you out with anything you need. He's very involved on campus and has worked with organizations like Student Senate to make this university a better place!",1
LOVE him! He's so smart and interesting. Approaches literature in a way I've never been taught before. Take him rather than take the class- you will not regret it!,1
"The material is so interesting but Mukamel does not have  the ability to engage her students nor does she have the capacity to create exams/quizzes that equally translate how much my classmates and I studied for this class. Her TA's grade horribly, and she is basically never available for outside help.",0
"She is such a cute/bubbly person! I look forward to this class every time. Lectures get highly off topic, but it is fun when it happens! Just catch up with the readings and be ready to discuss about it. 3 major papers + citations. The class is never boring! She is lenient, she will be there for you, and she loves what she does! Should be an easy A!",1
great online class. TONS of reading and writing. actually deserved the writing intensive categorization. Good teacher gives feedback quickly and answers questions clearly. Difficult class but worth it if the material interests you.,1
She tends to stomp on many students if she does not hear the answer that she wants to hear. She doesn't take in other peoples' opinion and expect everyone to agree with her.,0
One of the worst teachers I have ever taken. If you ask what's on the test he'll tell you everything. I used everything under the sun to study and did horrible in class. Lab was okay he was more of a person in lab than in lecture. DO NOT TAKE HIM unless its your only class and you can memorize the book!,0
"Terrible calc teacher.Poor teaching skills, not helpful.",0
"This is the 3rd time I've taken Mulvihill for a course. This class is almost solely a discussion between him and students. You sit and talk about the CJS; that's pretty much it. Exams and short papers are difficult if you don't show up or pay attention. Final paper is 20+ pages so start early. If you need a capstone, take this one!",1
"Hes very nice and wants his students to succeed, but hes a very poor professor. Tests are incredibly hard, lectures are very disorganized and all over the place, and there is a ton of homework every week. If possible take Spanish with another professor, especially if youre taking Spanish 1.",0
Dr. Cutler was not ment to teach! She only likes you if you understand and do well in her class otherwise she basically makes the whole class know your dumb. if you ask for help she brushes you off and does not answer your questions. she also rarely does example problems and when she does she does not finish them. Do not take this professor!!!!!!!!,0
"Would not recommend taking. I ended up dropping the course due to the harsh grading. I received a 0 on a 2,000 word essay because my sources were not in alphabetical order. She is nice but the grading is horrible.",0
"Casey lectures make sense & makes math look easy. However, you have to know the material inside and out cause he'll ask you questions on not only to apply concepts but why they work in the first place. He's also very picky when you submit an answer even if it's correct. Not everyone is made for this class. Study guides guarantee 50% of the test.",0
Wants her own ideas regurgitated back at her and nothing else.,0
"This has been my worst teacher in my time at PCC. Schubert does not teach well at all. He does all the problems and lectures with his back to the class and by the time he turns around, he's completed the whole problem and blocked it. Anytime someone asks for help he either says, you should of learned it in the last math or go to tutoring. TERRIBLE!",0
"What a joke. it's like we are back in elementary school. She moves seats, makes you work with partners, and has every single person in the class repeat the same thing over and over again. Terrible teacher. Boring. She's so annoying. Tons of HW (Writing words 5x each) You never get out early even after taking a test. She's terrible. Worst teacher",0
This is the greatest professor around.  If you have any difficulty he will gladly sit with you and explain until you get it. He is very caring and knows how to teach math even to those that are horrible at it such as myself. You should take any math class with him.  I promise you will enjoy his teaching.,1
"He was an amazing teacher. If you had questions he had a detailed answer and makes sure you understand the topic. If you listen and do your work he respects you. If you slack off and don't do the readings then he will lecture about laziness. Otherwise, he really improved my writing skills!",1
she is hard and she grades terribly!!! Don't take her. Try taking any other professor. She will torture you!!! Beware!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
Would not take again. Very unorganized !,0
AVOID @ ALL COST for sensation&perception he teaches from middles school book & teaches @400 level tests all writing/long answer no matter how much detail you put he wants more. treats students who don't understand like idiots/talks down no attendance taken but gives popquizes Extrapolates from book @ rate that's not followable NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!!,0
The one thing I liked about her is that her tests are usually like the review. One thing I didnt like was how strict she was on grading essays. She would take up to 15 points off for slightly citing something incorrectly and acted as if this were an English class instead of a sociology class. Her lectures were pretty boring but overall Was nice,0
"Gave papers made classmates revise or else itll hurt your grade.. didnt have class the last two months, still had essays due tho!",0
"She is a great professor, you wont regret taking her class, she's easy to contact outside of class, and really cares for her students, Take her class!!",1
It's very clear on what she wants you to do. Papers are back to back. Also she will not grade any of the papers on time.,0
"EASIEST CLASS EVER!! Take her, she is an easy grader and very supportive. As long as you do the work she is asking from you (which is never a lot) you will definitely pass.",1
"She never gives full credit to anyone, ever. She is very interesting and I learned a lot from her. However, I do not recommend taking her class unless you want to be challenged. the amount of homework can be overwhelming, especially if you miss any classes. Must be organized!",1
I do NOT recommend you take this class. He is a pretty chill sweet guy however his teaching is awful. He is also not easy to understand. If you want a good grade in this class it can happen but you will struggle. He will NOT meet you halfway. He will not respond to emails. His passing rate is very low and refuses to make study guides.,0
"Sadly, I have to agree with the other reviews, Adrian doesn't have a good methodology to teach. He may know about film but doesn't know how to explain it. He is lacking the spirit of experimentation and risk that most filmmakers have, very formulaic. Also, in a class that is designed for students to direct, not everyone got the chance to do it.",0
Boring long lectures. And not many opportunities for points.,0
HE IS AWESOME & SO HELPFUL I TOOK HIS 101 CLASS & EVENTUALLY SIGNED UP FOR HIS 102 . FUNNY KEEPS THE CLASS LAUGHING.,1
"Shes boring, but if you pay attention its an easy A",1
"Mrs. Horn is an excellent professor, and a very caring person. Very laid back and chill.",1
"DON'T TAKE CLASS WITH HIM!  If you want a sense of dignity and want to feel respected as a person, don't take Rogers.",0
" Jane is a great person in general, but the exams she give out are extremely tough. Apparently she's a former College park professor so it makes sense. Her written homework hardly touches the relevance for the exam so don't rely so much on those. The projects took way too much time.(especially part 3). However the final exam is easier than her exam",0
Taught me so much about my camera and how to look at life to capture the moments. James knows all about the cameras and the history of photography.  He will teach one anything they want to know. This class will provide one with the mechanics and enthusiasm to learn and accomplish one's goals.,1
"Walker is hands down the best teacher I have ever had at LSU so far. His lectures are very entertaining and participation does matter, but I loved going to his class so that was never a problem for me. He cares a lot about his students and is so funny.",1
"If your goal is to learn something, dont take this class. If you dont want to talk you are screwed, and if you get the answer wrong get ready to be made fun of. Its her way or you get the question wrong. She adds too many steps to everything for no reason. Simplifying is no longer simple. More than 12 people dropped. You teach yourself.",0
"Unfortunately, not a good teacher. I did not learn anything from him.",0
"She's definitely a good teacher, just pay attention in class, make sure you read the readings that she assigns so you can participate more in class. gives some essay quizzes, its not too hard to get a 9 on them, 10s are definitely possible. The mid-term is 3-4 essays, she gives you the questions before hand. kind of a tough grader on them.",1
"I've learned more in his class than I have in any other at this point. Incredibly knowledgeable, and easy to pass. If you fail his class, you're an idiot.",1
"I actually took PHIL 205G which I believe is the same as 2050. I took the class online. There were quizzes after every reading assignment which were SUPER easy if you just read the content. There were short essays due at the end of each module, also super easy. Downside of the class was they didnt keep up on grading. Other than that, easy class!",1
"First and foremost, Chemistry is inherently a difficult science to learn. Professor Miller tries his best to elucidate the ambiguity of several topics. Go to his office hours for help on the Practice assignment or a question. Although, I must say his lectures are pretty monotonous due to his monotone voice. But overall, he's a solid chem prof.",1
"I took him for both 301 and 311 and it really is a self taught class to a point. His teaching occurs when he goes over the HW in class. If you don't understand, just speak up and he will explain it until you get it. His anecdotes about his history in the business make the class very entertaining. Good class to take.",1
Helpful and interesting!,1
"Totally incompetent.  Will spend 10 minutes giving an example, only to realize she did the whole thing wrong and have to go back and re-do it.  Totally useless topic and I can't believe people actually devote their lives to studying it.",0
"Stay away from this class!!! He expects you to be a genius and teaches the class like we're PhD students. Like bro, how do you expect me to prove all of calculus in a one hour test?!?!?",0
"She is not helpful at all!  When you email about group assignments she basically says ""Good luck, hope you can work it out.""  Grades outside of the rubric.  Avoid her if you possibly can. ",0
The course in general is pretty bad. Berthiaume doesn't seem to care much and doesn't explain things particularly well. The exams were difficult.,0
"These reviews really helped me out. So here I am giving back. Jennifer is extremely empathetic, patient, emotionally intelligent, humorous, and inspiring. Although she doesn't always explain things as clearly or as in depth as I want, she is a great teacher! She is more interactive and less lecture based than Amanda, and more patient in lab!",1
"Mary is a very nice lady and is very brilliant and accomplished. However, she was maybe not the best teacher ever for Intro Enviro Geo. It often felt like we weren't actually learning anything, and we were assigned a Lot of reading that was actually never relevant ever. But she is nice and probably good for upper-level geo from what I hear.",0
"I took him online, and he is an easy teacher.He lets you take test twice so you can get a better grade, discussions are easy. You will have to put effort into your midterm and final papers, but he lets you pick the topic you want to write about.I would recommend him to anyone who wants an easy Phil class who really has no interest in it.",1
"Worst professor I've ever taken. Please, spare yourself from this course. I didn't learn one thing and he uses the same exams each semester so everyone cheats. Not about that type of laziness.",0
Very good professor. Go to lecture and you will never have to study for the exams. Her tests are easy. There a few homework assignments but not a lot. Funny and knowledgeable. I wouldn't waste my money on the textbook. I never opened it.,1
"Professor Tripp gives extra credit opportunities every week. He truly cares about his students. There is homework due every Sunday night, 4 quizzes, 3 exams and the final, which isn't cumulative! Got a C+ on the final and still managed an A in the class. Highly recommend taking Professor Tripp. I wouldn't still be in college if it wasn't for him!",1
Clark knows her stuff! I love to hear her talk about all the things she knows on a particular topic. She is a little harsh on grading in my opinion though,1
"Dr. Yamazaki is so far the most knowledgeable, interesting, and informative professor I have met. In her class,YOU WILL LEARN. Do not underestimate her class though, you have to write everything she says down, doesn't matter what, just write it down, trust, it will save you later. Exams and finals free response. If you want an A, study everything.",1
She is one of the best professors I have ever had! The material is difficult but she makes it very interesting to learn. I would take her again!,1
"Although many people consider Mrs. Fox's classes to be difficult, my opinion isn't that her class is difficult but instead that her classes are guaranteed learning environments. Starting on the first day, she lays out every detail of her class to the students. She has a strong syllabus that leads to success so long as the student does the work.",1
Great teacher. Makes math not so boring. Sound just like the guy on King of the Hill. Tons of homework but that is what made me get a good grade. Very willing to help. Does not talk down to you like some teachers and will help till you understand. Taking him again.,1
"Misurda is easily the worst computer science professor in the department. Lectures are monotonous, no online discussion board for help, and seems to not care about feedback regarding his course. I have a high B in this course and have had to do all studying outside of the lecture. Avoid all of his classes if possible",0
"Not a very helpful professor. She may be funny sometimes and enthusiastic about her topics, but when it comes to student's opinions, she is not very open. Assignments were not clear and feedback was not helpful at all. ",0
"Professor Nuchereno gives great lectures that are heavily attended by her students even though she didn't make attendance mandatory this past semester. She gives 4 exams including the final, and you can drop your lowest score. Taking good notes on her lectures and doing the online quizzes and homework will lead you to do very well in her class.",1
He is a great teacher. I was not the great student and should of tried harder in this course. I passed though but I would not passed if he did not care so much. He is hard on lectures and he speaks architecture language so communicate with students and find out out about what he wants.,1
"Harsh grading and takes a while to grade. Wont know youre in a bad situation until she puts the grade in, and its too late to try and fix it. Wouldnt recommend",0
"He definitely knows his stuff, but also expects you to know it all as well. When it comes to the exams, they are not at all what he actually teaches and what he makes the practice exams look like. It seems as though he tries to trick his students which I do not understand. Ive 4.0d all my other science classes... this one not so much.",0
"He puts things in the simplest terms, no beating around the bush. He is a character and will explain things as many times it takes for you to understand. Very patient, very caring teacher. He is willing to give extra credit as long as you show interest in the class and participation. I highly recommend him. Speaks English/Spanish.",1
"Lectures are boring, VERY boring. He's funny. You don't have HW other than online quizzes, which don't matter that much because the tests run the grades basically. This was the only class I could not get an A in no matter how much I studied or tried. There's no curriculum, no method or comprehension. If you can memorize a lot of stuff you're good.",0
"This course was one of the hardest courses I took. I thought it would've been easy, but it's not. I barely passed this course, only because I was emailing him 24/7, worrying and freaking out I wasn't going to pass. It's A LOT of quizzes and your final is an essay that has a lot of requirements",0
"One of the best professors to have ever taught. She is more than fair, and when you take her class you will learn, more than you thought you would ever learn.If you try you will not fail.I recommend her 100 times over.Dr. Polster rocks!!!",1
"Probably the worst teacher to have instructed this class. Math 221 is already hard enough with a frankly useless book, but to have a teacher essentially reiterate (sometimes verbatim) the book is not helpful. She is extremely fast without being very clear and has trouble solving the homework problems she assigns. Do not take this class with her.",0
"She is very caring and fun. Most of the grades are online. There are many in class writing assignments, but they are easy and shes an easy grader.",1
Not a hard class with a really sweet and nice teacher. Really understanding and overall a great teacher. If you don't take her for Spanish then you're missing out.,1
Easy professor and easy grading. She responds quickly to emails. Her assignments are clear and easy to do. I would totally recommend her and take her again.,1
Hes honestly my favorite professor from Suffolk. I had him once before in seminar and loved him so much. Everyone talks highly about him and the class is interactive and hes always around to help you whether its by email or face to face. All his stories are hilarious and everything applies to what hes teaching. You really have to try to fail.,1
"This Professor is disrespectful, unprofessional, condescending and mediocre. I did not learn anything from this class, she is more interested in hearing her self speak and repeating irrelevant information in the third person rather than if her students understand. You cannot ask questions, you will be attacked. DONT TAKE HER CLASS YOU WILL REGRET!!",0
"Great professor. She is outstanding and very helpful. Unless your a freshman who isn't use to the real world and how college works and what professor expect of you then there is no downside to her. She is the ideal engineering professor who goes above and beyond to ensure her students understand via projects, tests, and hands on experience.",1
This was my favorite class. The reading and assignments were so interesting. For an online class this teacher was very responsive and helpful and writes very clear directions for assignments.,1
"Mr. Lovell is an awesome instructer.  Class was never dull, discussions were great.  Take notes and read your chapters, you'll be ok. Excellent reviews before a test :)  Three exams, one final paper.  I loved his class. :)",1
One of the worst at NCC Nursing. Her class averages are consistently the lowest by alot(and she doesn't care). She is constantly unprepared for class. Constantly gives work at the last minute. Gives tons of worthless busy work. Be prepared to teach yourself the material. She uses lab for everything but lab activities. Stay away from her!!!,0
Was the worst teacher I have ever had :( Was defensive when you asked for help... received no help! Had to get a tutor to pass the class.,0
"Dr Abdallah Mohamed is the best possible professor anybody could have. He is very helpful and gives a lot of feedback. He explains concepts clearly and he does everything in his power to make sure nobody faces any difficulties, especially in the online environment where technical difficulties are common place. Best prof ever. Thank you Dr Mohamed!",1
Pros- he knows what he's doing cons- he is arrogant and will belittle you,0
"Dr. Vohs is a very good professor. His lectures won't make you fall asleep, and the class is almost enjoyable. Once test day comes though, it can get rough. He will give difficult tests and will grade harshly. I did not have a good chem class before coming here and I struggled a lot because of it. He's also a great first year sem teacher. (GenChem)",1
I would definitely recommend taking a class with Professor Hesford.  Her subject matter is intellectually stimulating and engaging.  She is very helpful if you are struggling with an assignment but she will still challenge you as a writer.  Very fair grader and the assignments keep you interested in the class.,1
"Horrible professor. He was never in class due to countless excuses.  Word is he's an ****, and it shows in his horrible teaching methods.",0
This class is extremely boring. The material is so dry and she does not make it interesting at allThe grading criteria is non existent and the midterm was 5 short answer questions worth 30%. The day of the midterm she held a review the first half of class? Wouldn't it be typical to have a review prior to midterm in order to study relevant material?,0
"The majority of my time spent sitting in the class I just think to myself, ""What is this guy talking about?"" For an organizational com course, his lectures are not very organized at all. He has his powerpoints posted online but the points don't make any sense and when he lectures it's all over the place and makes no sense. I wouldn't take again",0
"TERRIBLE professor.  You must do all the readings or she wont even teach.  No one in the class ever read so you would keep skipping things.  Other people say she is good in other classes, but this one is horrible.  Never take this class.  She tests on the most random facts from the reading.  She is clearly the worst prof I've had at the U",0
"You will NOT get what you earn...grading is 100% subjective, and the class participation was NOT participation based... it was off the wall projects with WAY too little time to complete them....do'nt piss her off or you will get a bad grade...",0
"Very tough grader and hard class. Would not recommend. He did answer emails fast and was helpful, but papers were very hard to even receive a decent grade",0
Amazing lecturer and is passionate and knowledgeable about the subject - especially Cyber law and international law - Legend,1
"Prof Brown was a good teacher, but very technically incompetent. Gave more points to forum posts than assignments. Easy A if you have the time for forums, but she doesn't know basics of programming. Lousy textbook choice (inaccurate), and weekly lessons didn't have useful content, and were painful to watch.",0
Excellent work!,1
"I had Brad Barkley for 334 and 434. His classes are fun and laid back. I enjoy the workshop format of the class. I've learned a lot, and I put a lot more thought into my writing now. Since he's a published writer, I trust his advise. He really knows his subject and is enthusiastic about it.",1
He doesnt understand what the average person already knows. Bio 101 means you have to explain concepts like DNA and cell division. He expects you to be familiar with concepts without teaching them first.,0
"Great professor, if you put in effort you will pass. Pretty easy and straightforward. You have a final project which he gives u a month before notice. He helps you when u need it. He also has few assignments which are in class but you just have to follow his directions. Easy class overall if you put in even a little effort.",1
The worst teacher i have studied with. His grading is ridiculous even the lecture is so easy (since it is a basic class). I would never take his class again,0
"Intelligent. Probably knows a lot about physics. Though, it is too bad he is unable to communicate that to his students. Wish the university would let this dinosaur go. His views are antiquated, and close minded. Which is odd for a science professor.",0
Not a good prof at all. Rambles during lectures and goes off topic frequtly. Lectures are all over the place. Do not recommend her.,0
"I took Paul's class at Hunter College. He is so creative and intelligent. His lectures are inspiring and his activities are life-changing. He makes you think about life and art in a new way. Any class you can take with him is worth it because you get to spend a little bit of time with his brain. He isn't all that accessible, but he's smart.",1
hella funny...hella cool...,1
"Professor Trombley lays her class out clearly. She consistently took the content from that week and related it to real life through discussion topics (which have several options to choose from). The weekly quizzes are easy IF you do the readings, practice tests, and read modules. This class is relatively low stress & I learned a lot.",1
"I will say that his grading system is nonexistent. The homework is automatically factored in, but the tests and quizzes are not even listed. Finals were done a week ago and I still don't have my grade. Soooooo... there's that. But the class itself was fine. Do the reading. Do the homework. Print the lectures before class. Live with the corny jokes.",1
This class was taken during covid. He has 3 tests and a final which replaces your lowest test grade. During tests you only have 1 chance to choose your answer and his questions are super specific. You need to memorize over 200 power point slides to even get a 70 in a test. He says to only know the purple words on PowerPoints but that' not enough.,0
Great.,1
"Smart proffessor who is more interested in publishing than teaching. He is also too simplistic about social forces in policing, but he is a good lecturer. He leaves grading to his TA, because he is out of the country most of the time between classes",1
Dr. Fan is really a great teacher. She is helpful and understanding. There is online homework due monthly but it is very easy and you get three tries on each question with explanations on how to do it. There is one 2-3 page paper due and 4 exams (multiple choice) with the lowest score dropped. You should have no problem getting an A or B!,1
Best Professor ever at GMU. She is the most sweetest lady in the world. She will help you at any cost. If you go to her for feedback she answers all question. A professor that wants to see their students pass and teaches them stuff that you will use your whole life. Zotero was a blessing that we learned in her class. Easy class show up!,1
"I don't know if it was because we had to be online, but there was always tons of confusion in this class. He would easily get angry if we didn't know something, even if it was our first day looking at it. He would randomly start ranting about things that weren't related. He didn't show up for class upwards of 5 times with no warning too.",0
"Professor Heilman is a super passionate and very knowledgeable professor. I learned a lot from her class because her lectures were interesting and attention-grabbing. For a 100 level class, this course had a lot more homework than I expected. That said, all the homework was graded very fairly and it is easy to do well if you watch lectures",1
"Do you want to feel humiliated? Do you want to cry after class and be stressed out? Do you want to have crazy high expectations in assignments but 0 teaching/guidance? This is your class! For real, stay away.",0
An awesome prof who knows how teach and keep his students engaged. Also a great person to talk to about topics not covered in class and gives career tips too.,1
"Prof. Frazier is so uptight, and just takes things way too personal. He only has a 3 minute grace period, and after that you are considered absent if you came in late. He takes out of your grades if you answer a question wrong, he does not have a good teaching strategy. doesn't know how to use icollege. his quizzes dont tell you right/wrong answers",0
Horrible teacher. she made me want to drop out of college entirely. She lowered my self esteem and I felt very uneasy around her. TAKE KATHY SOHN!!!,0
"Be warned, if your in the slightest way conservative do not show it in class. Your assignments will usually involve reading political opinion articles that are not only extremely left leaning, but usually offensive. If you do not see yourself being able to handle having to carefully word you papers as to not offend avoid the prof stay clear .",0
"Took both 1078 and 1088 with him, and I've definitely learned a lot. Homework is optional if you need the extra help, but tests are pretty tough",1
"I hated this class. I wouldn't even take this class if it wasn't required. She is outright rude and it seems like she has something against me. Her quizzes are ridiculous. She expects you to remember the most obscure details from the reading that is hard to comprehend. Her instructions are unclear and virtually unapproachable. If you can, AVOID",0
The worst professor I've ever had. Doesn't seem to care about his students or anything in general. Idk why he has the attitude that he does. Terrible experience. His exams are all from the past papers tho. Do those and you would be good. My terrible grade is on me lol but he still SUCKS,0
Overall a easy class if you can figure out how do everything on your own.She does not explain assignments clearly at all and becomes off topic in class. Just not well structured at all. I believe she can do a better job if she tried. A very boring class on top of that.,0
"Professor Carter is wonderful. She can be your best friend (Professionally)or your worst enemy if you disrespect her. She's just a call away if you need help in her class. She is very caring when a student is having difficulty. If I could I would have every class with her. Because of professors like her, makes me continue to keep going to Columbia.",1
"Russell certainly cares about her students, but doesn't know much and lets her political bias seep into her classes. She called all Republicans ""Confederates,"" for instance, and when asked question about Shinzo Abe admitted she had never heard of him. She often got distracted in lectures, showing more Game of Thrones videos than actual material.",0
"He's a great professor! He made MATH 267 very easy and clear. Homework is only for extra credit. Attendance isn't mandatory, but obviously you're really only hurting yourself by not attending.",1
Beyond boring! she is so unorganized and that stresses you out so much. Worst class ever !,0
Professor Nevitte's class was my favourite during my time as an undergrad. I learnt so much and actually had the opportunity to reflect on what I learnt during lectures. He prompted me to learn more and expand my knowledge. He is also quite approachable and is interested in seeing his students grow. I would definitely recommend the course! ,1
"Great professor. If you're looking for a career in the sports industry and have any questions, you can go to her and shell give you the answer most of the time. Overall this class was fun and taught me a lot about what it takes to be a professional in the sports industry.",1
Great Instructor-  cares teaches and gives a little humor.  Real life experiences used to teach the class- probably can out cook some of the other prof/chefs,1
Teaching is not her thing. Couldn't understand her. Got a tutor and still failed the class. Screwed up my GPA. Totally not worth it. Over half of my class failed. STAY AWAY!,0
"This class is incredibly difficult.  Dr. Grange was available during his office hours to assist with homework problems and explain things, so take advantage of that.  Lecture is typically straight off the powerpoint, but don't think that it's a good reason to skip class.  He curves at the end of the semester.",1
Yes this subject is hard but this teacher made it very difficult to pass. No feedback why 0 points were given when answers mirrored lecture material. Very disappointing that some professors make things harder than need be and make students feel discouraged.,0
"Professor Malone was pretty organized and helped make this class pleasant. He lets us drop one test and five quizzes at the end of the semester, this helped my grade a lot. It is pretty difficult to fail this class if you do what he asks. Homework is optional and he lets us retake quizzes as many times as we want. Highly recommend I loved his class",1
"Mr Selph was a great teacher high up on my list of favourite teachers I've had. His lectures were clear, he approached problems in various ways so all types of learners could understand. He was very patient with his students and created ways for them to solve and discover math solutions on their own, then walked them through it.",1
"In the beginning of the semester, the class was OK. However, after she got into a car wreck, it was terrible. She did not follow the syllabus at all, class was always cancelled, and grades were never entered in Canvas. Also, instead of putting a midterm grade in, she gave me a B for my final grade, even thought it was in the middle of the semester.",0
"He's clearly very knowledgeable about the subjects he's teaching and cares about his students. I'm one to skip class, but you really do need to attend to get a good grade. As long as your there and pay attention, the class isn't hard. He also gives plenty of extra credit on the quizzes. I would recommend him to anyone taking intro biology.",1
"Her classes were always very interesting and she was easily able to hold my attention. For my class, she gave us a day every week where we could ask specific questions about psych and wed have discussions about them as well as get her opinion on the subject. Lots of extra credit opportunities.",1
Your grade is mainly decided by your tests. HW also counts but she adds it in at the end so you won't know how much it helps you until the end. t's really easy to get in contact with her and she answers really quickly. I've taken Calc 1 before so this was really easy for me but she explains everything with a lot of detail so if you'll be fine,1
I DO NOT recommend her for Microbiology! She makes it very hard for no reason and expects you to just know everything. The lectures doesn't really help because it's pretty much the slides that are posted on bb. Exams are super hard! But she does curve at the end depending on the class average.,0
Would not recommend taking his class; boring jokes about his prior jobs and his exams are pretty tricky. Make sure to do your homework cause his quizes are mostly from it(also note that he promises you 10 and at the end you only have 7 or less) and also don't expect him to give you any extra help/credit if you need it. Stay away from his class!!!!,0
"Her class literally made me not major in finance. She is very nice, always in a good mood but its impossible to learn anything. She speaks as if we already know the material, flies through it, and then gives you an extremely difficult test with material we never went over. I had to go home and teach myself everything online. She will help in office",0
Works with students. Has great advice for soon-to-be graduates.,1
She is a tough grader and cares way too much about the assignments. She does not provide enough feedback on how to improve your grade and needs to be a little more relaxed.,0
"Terrible class.  She needs to realize not every student can remember exact details from several books. She has quizzes every day. She is nice and has a good personality, but needs to make her reading a lot easier for those who can't read and comprehend easily.",0
"Very rude professor. Her notes were confusing and did not go along with lab. She would roll her eyes and give attitude if asked a question. Slapped the back of my chair because I asked someone for a pencil. She wasnt even lecturing, she was just walking around while we were getting supplies. I recommend not taking her ever.",0
"Prof Jones likes to be called Randy. I took his Fine Art class and WSU Tri-Cities. While attendance was mandatory, you can really just zone out during class. He's really passionate about art and has some cool lecture points, but the lecture isn't at all in the exams. For the exam all that you need is re-read your hw which he corrects to perfection",0
"She believe that her method of teaching is the best she even stated she would make allot of money if she sold her material and ways of teaching, but for me!! Her way of teaching did  not work she gave so many notes!! And it bothered me that she would hand write her test they were all stumbled up no have to bring extra paper to solve the problems",0
The class is normally a community class yet this year it wasn't. Didn't give any test but your grade is made up of the writing you turn in. Not the hardest grader on essays. It was a very easy class. He does not follow the syllabus and we did not use the book. Over all the class is very essay just a lot of writing to do.,1
One word defines Chet: Exquisite,1
"This is the single worst class I've attended at JHU, virtually or otherwise. Here is everything you need to know. In response to COVID, the professors chose to make this class asynchronous. This is useful for reviewing material. However, the problem that arises when you have an asynchronous class with no grades other than exams, is that students",0
His lectures aren't exactly lectures he does I Clikers and uses those examples to lecture. The homework that is assigned does not go relate to the weekly Monday quizzes. Which makes it really hard to pass his class.,0
The absolute worst professor ever. Professor graded my work very poorly. There was quite a great amount of work in regards to classwork and homework. I completed both and still somehowmanaged a poor grade. Dont take this guy. Im retaking Comp I.,0
"I took a psych class with Al and enjoyed it! Hes quirky and funny and always made the class laugh. Lectures were pretty boring (80 minutes of straight notes) but he was laid back which I liked. Overall a pretty easy class. If you take notes, study for the tests, and do your assignments, youll be fine! Id take more classes with him in the future.",1
Professor Smith was great. She was easy to reach via email or office hours and was very understanding when it comes to grading. Do the work and you'll pass. ,1
Easy A,1
Her test have nothing to do with the class.,0
very hard class and though grader. readings are confusing,0
Be sure to do readings or you wont pass. If you dont get that why bother with university. Come to most classes but you can also get away with skipping a lot.,1
"Literally the worst teacher I've ever taken. If you want a professor who doesn't make you feel stupid for asking questions, do not take her. She really is a lazy teacher and doesn't care if you are understanding the material or not.",0
"She was unclear on everything that she would assign. It was confusing, the lectures were long, she accuses you of cheating with no facts to back it up, and she will not reply to your e-mail's. I would not recommend this ""teacher"" to anyone. She is rude and inconsiderate to her students. The worst experience in a semester.",0
"Lecture heavy, goes through many power points. You must pay attention and take notes or passing the test will be difficult. The class is still doable.",0
"I didn't like him for Advanced Comp 1 at all. We spent multiple classes learning how to use the library database, and only at the end, after our papers were finished, did we go over things like evaluating sources or logical fallacies, which would have been helpful in writing the paper. But it's hard to fail. Buy the books. Two ten page papers.",0
This professor is not organized AT ALL. He changes things around constantly. He makes the material really confusing to understand and complains about how the whole class isn't putting in effort or doing the homework. If you're good at teaching yourself he would be a good professor,0
Prof Dietrich is a not an easy professor but truly cares about her students! She's always willing to explain all questions and is very easy to find outside of class. Overall great class!,1
"Taking her Java class online is one of the worst college experiences I have ever persevered. Her tests and their answers are self-typed, so often answers that she allows are not correct per the book, or one of multiple answers that she presents. When asking for help, she had to use Google to answer a simple question. DO NOT take her Java class!",0
"Sometimes he skips steps, but if you ask for it, he would happily stop to explain it; he is also very responsive to appointments/questions outside of class. He does give you credit for showing work, he even tells you which questions on the hw you will be quizzed on. Make sure to attend his lectures, he gives tips on how to solve specific questions.",1
Boring lecture. Don't take when this guy's teaching Astr323.,0
"She teaches an English class, but the course content is not English related. Her feedback is not helpful, it's rude. The work she makes you do is useless for the class. I thought I signed up for English, but it was all history related content.",0
a very gifted teacher...but talks too much. it seems like she has to cover every little thing in the book and still add more stuff.her three hour lecture classes are just too much. doesnt give too much time for lab(20 min tops/wk im serious) i also think she gives you very tricky quiestis for the exam.im def. not taking her for a&p2.,0
"Shawna was a great professor as she truly cares about the material she teaches. Her papers have clear grading criteria as listed in each rubric or the book. Both her and the TA were very caring and more than helpful if you talked to them, which is hard to come by some times in college.",1
"this class's material seems very difficult, but if you keep up with the ppts and reading, its not all that bad. dr.self is VERY nice,fair, and knowledgeable, not to mention funny. go to class bc he does random iclicker 'quizzes'. USE THE STUDY GUIDE FOR TEST STUDYING (after having read the chps). overall,its a v do-able class, but you MUST study =)",1
She's an overall great teacher.,1
Mrs. Suzanne Mcfarland is literally the BEST math teach i have ever had! Yes you have to do homework which class do you not have homework? Lol. I havent taken math in 4 years and she made any memory I had of it come back! She doesnt move on until you get it! It was a great summer semester I defiantly recommend her to anyone and EVERYONE!,1
Professor Noimann grades very unfairly. I took her class online and she wasnt helpful at all. I turned in all her homework on time and participated and passed all her tests and assignments and overall gave me a poorly grade. I highly recommend you dont take her.,0
"He doesn't exactly know what he is doing I feel like.  He is an easy grader, even gives you partial credit on multiple choice.  so if you want to BS your way through a B, then this is a great class.  But everything is from the book, I didn't learn anything from his lectures.  He doesn't communicate what he wants to teach very well.  Hes a nice guy",0
"A very caring, intelligent, and worthwhile professor. Yes, he rambles. Yes, he talks about large ideas and his lectures get off track at times. But Professor Shine is an amazing professor. For Intro to Lit. Int. - his book selections were well-rounded and introduced me to many great writers. One of Buffalo State's best - and most respected.",1
Professor Prasad is really unorganized. She's really informative but I wouldn't take her for lab. The practical exams are really hard. Seeing the cadaver once won't help you remember the body parts. The open labs are short too. There's so much to remember in so little time. Super hard class & takes forever to grade. I wouldn't recommend taking her,0
"Moved to online courses and he did not adjust material at all, actually had more work to begin with. Constantly ignored emails and uploaded materials late. The class became more work than all my other courses combined. Spent 7 hours on one exam that he said would take 2 hours max. Worst professor at wcu and hoping to get him removed",0
"hard class but worth it prof is  mean, not really student friendly",1
"5 thumbs up for this guy. he was funny, but informative. i came to learn, he came to teach, we made a good pair. I would take another class with Mr Rosenberg as the professor",1
"If you are looking for a traditional class atmosphere, this isn't for you. However, I learned more in this class than I have in all others. Mayor Street and his TA (Jeff Carroll who is a professor himself) make a great team and are EXTREMELY committed to their students.. Everything you need to know about local government is within this class!!!!!!!",1
Eh,1
"For 170A he was fine. But I really enjoyed 145 (Robotics) with him. I highly recommend this class to anyone who is fairly comfortable with using MATLAB. One of my favorite engineering classes taken and the material was easy to understand but very interesting. Grading was fair, lectures were interesting and straightforward. Labs took hours and hours",1
"He assumes you have had experience with coding even though this is an intro class. Tells you to look at Arduino reference pages, which are helpful but you need to learn how to code essentially on your own.",1
She  rambles about things that are not even remotely relevant to the class. she also gives A LOT of pop quizzes about material we have not discussed yet. her power points are vague and doesnt put them up online and what she talks about is not what the power point says. i get As in all criminal justice classes that ive taken but her class i got a C,0
"Dr. Ward is really smart, and you can tell she's really interested in what she teaches/cares about our discussion. Her lectures depend a lot on the class and how active they are in talking together. Rubrics are clearly laid out & she offers a lot of exam prep leading up to it. Any classes missed can (for the most part) be made up with extra credit",1
Not sure what to say. He is a nice person but does not know how to teach well. ,0
"WORST CLASS EVER TAKEN! This teacher gives NO feedback and does NOT respond to emails; he says to allow up to 5 DAYS to respond to an email?! He should not be allowed to get away with that for an online class. Very hard to communicate with. His assignments are confusing and not clear. I would never take him again, waste of money and time.",0
Wouldn't suggest to anyone,0
"I took this class during summer session 1 and I know that there is a ton of information in a short period of time, but this guy did not teach me anything. The entire class was spent doing the questions at the end of the chapter, then him giving us the answers. No explaning of the problems, no teaching of the material. I mainly taught myself.",0
Don't take this professor. TERRIBLE. If you're not strong in math you will fail. Expects you to know how to do everything and moves way too fast when doing example problems. If you have a question on how to do something she will tell you that you should already know it from previous classes or to read the text book or watch the videos (unhelpful),0
"Mr. Jason is seriously a great Professor! If you have him for Draw100, its much easier to go in with a drawing background, but he made it very clear for those that didnt that drawing is a learned skill and they improved dramatically. He didnt grade anything until midterms to actually develop our skills & you dont get many projects, but its ok.",1
"This woman, has been the worst of my experience so far. Her tests are weighted, and are either three questions long, or 8 pages long. Her Conduct class is absolutely terrible.I had a passion for political science before taking her class and it is no longer existent. She doesn't care about her students and she gets an A++ on being a terrible advisor",0
"He lays out his structure very clear. Online participation is on yellowdig, which is better than basic discussion boards. There are media critiques and quizzes due every week and both are pretty easy as well. No trick questions on the quizzes either & you have a whole week to do them so no excuses. He gives excellent feedback. Would recommend.",1
Best teacher I've ever had! Him and his TA were amazing this past semester! They truly care about all their students and give everyone the chance to do well! They are quick to help you with anything you may need and are super easy to communicate with! 100% would take any class again with Rick!,1
"Dr. Trinh is one of my favorite professors. He knows his material 'inside out'. And when he teaches everything makes sense. So anyways, here are the tips to making an AA- in the class. (1) Dont skip classes! (2) During the exams, make sure you write EVERYTHING for the solution. BIG on PARTIAL CREDIT. Write the equations, whatever you know!",1
Great class! He expects alot from students and grades very hard. But that made me just want to work harder. Great classroom discussions. Loved the book.,1
"This class was the only class in entire courses I took at SF STATE that I wish had never ended! Professor Hasheminia is really knowledgeable and makes the most challenging and mathematical concepts easy and fun to understand. Don't get me wrong, you must work hard to get a good grade. Definitely take this clazs if you want to learn Data Mining.",1
This professor is the most awful professor in this college. I totally don't understand why this college doesn't fire him. He frequently is too late to come to class and absent all the sudden. He is terrible as a professor and a business person. I am regretting to take his class. He can't care about students.,0
"he knows the subject well and teaches you things that you'll need in your career, but he is a little biased when it comes to design.  if your design is not how he thinks it should be, you kind of sense this negative vibe from him.",0
awful,0
"One of my favorite professors ever. Truly cares a lot about her students. If you keep up with the lectures and study, you will be fine. She provides study guides and office hours before exams. Everything is very straight forward. Study, ask questions, apply yourself and you will get an A. Loved this class.",1
Totally taking this instructor again next semester!,1
"took over for our physic teacher half way through the semester because he was ill. Completely changed the lesson plan. skipped 5 chapters of learning because we left off at chapter 11 before spring break and came back on chapter 16... and then tested us over 11-15. Nice lady, but her homework and lesson plan could use some work",0
Easy success central class. Teacher made it unnecessarily difficult. All work was easy busy work. Book isn't necessary at all. The dude was creepy. He would stare at one person at a time during his lectures. Had weird eyebrows too. Success central is supposed to be a fun freshman class. This guy ruined it. Look elsewhere.,0
"The class has no structure at all, there is no syllabus he follows. Nearing the end of the semester and we only have two grades so far.",0
"A lot of online homework and quizzes. The textbook is also online. He is very nice but voice is low and monotone. All notes, pretty much reads off the PowerPoint. Just gives you a basic explanation about the problem. You have to teach yourself. Good thing is the midterm was exactly like study guide so make sure to study that.",0
Read the book because that is the only thing that will help you pass. Profs got little man syndrome and wear clothes too big for him. He acts like this the BBOC.,0
An amazing teacher and an even better person.,1
Worst professor I have taken in 3 years at this university. His operating systems class uses an in development language called Rust with a buggy compiler and no real world application. His assignments deal with web servers and shells and emphasize learning this language rather than operating systems.,0
"I took my inquiry seminar with Professor Bullock. If you want an A, there are better options out there but it's not impossible to get an A from him. He is a very nice guy but a harsh grader who expects a lot out of the revisions if you want an A. His lectures are borningist things on earth and he has a no screen policy so the class time is a grind.",1
"all quizzes super easy, watch the weekly lecture video then you don't have to do the readings, still buy the texbook because some exam questions are taken word from word from the textboook, don't save paper till last minute, almost everything is avaliable on quizlet but don't blindy answer based off a quizlet- a lot of the answers are wrong",1
AVOID AT ALL COSTS,0
If you do the weekly labs and take the quizzes you will get an A,1
"Very helpful,  understanding.   Firm rules, but that is very  useful, no surprises,  everything is upfront.",1
"He's a nice guy but not a very good teacher, went to lectures during the beginning of the semester but stopped because they're confusing and often irrelevant to tests. You'll do far better in the class if you use the textbook and the assignments and lab manual questions he posts.",0
"Class is not mandatory to attend and makes it clear on day that he does not care if you atend or not, which is fine, but the exam was  brutal.  There was only 4 questions and if you get one wrong, you are done.  Also he is a really hard grader when it comes to his papers.",0
"How is a programming teacher going to refuse to look at code!!?? I simply cannot understand. If i got something wrong its obvious I need time to talk about it right? NOOOPE. ""Its wrong go away now"" - not a fan of this teacher AT ALL.",0
"Not the nicest teacher AT ALL, and her class is not that easy. If you pay attention and re-work your notes, you'll find the tests are just like lecture. Quizzes helped my grade tremendously so pay attention during class because you will have pop-quizzes at the end and those are your only quiz grades. Challenging but do-able.",0
"Required attendance, but the class is minimally stimulating unless social work is your major. My major was social work, but this class is what made me change my mind.",1
He was horrible the book would say one thing out in way left field... then in lecture would be something well right field... and the tests... yeah who they hell knows where that came from... never having him as a teacher again,0
Does not respond to emails. You have no idea what you are making in class because she does not posts grades in a timely manner.,0
"If you took calculus in High School, Don't listen to him because he makes you confused. He is a very smart guy, but he doesn't know how to teach.",0
I WISH HE TAUGHT MORE CLASSES BECAUSE HE IS THE GREATEST TEACHER EVER,1
"I am so happy I took Professor Wood. The book is a must , participation, doing your work, showing up to class, and communicate with Professor Wood. You will pass the class. I highly recommend her because she cares for her students, welcoming, and inspiring. You wont regret taking Professor Wood.",1
"Lectures took up every minute of the class. She definitely doesn't slack off. There were alot of powerpoint slides, but that's all I studied. She gave a study guide for the final, which was cumulative. That ended up being the highest grade I made out of all her tests. Finished with a B.",1
"Don't be so hard on yourself when you get a bad test grade from Heather, she grades her test very harshly. All I would recommend is study her power points, and take a deep breath before and during the exams.",0
"Prof always willing to help and doesn't want to move on unless we fully understand the topic. If you aren't that great at math, I 'd take him. He makes understanding the class quite simple. Homework also reflects most of the quizzes/exams.",1
Math is not my strong point.,0
"Prof. Smith is incredibly knowledgeable. While his lectures were informative, at times he went a little too quickly to keep up which made note-taking difficult. Tests and quizzes hold the most weight, but he lets you have a note-card for tests which are a MUST. Make a good note card and you should do well on each test. Overall, a great professor.",1
Very rough professor. Not very understanding to personal issues that may impact class. Do not take,0
Professor Bush is always accessible out of class and loves to teach. He has his own language that he expects his students to learn and doesn't teach most of the necessary elements of Torts for the bar. Exam is doable (open book) but it was really a toss up because he is a picky grader.,1
"Birxy, 48 year veteran on campus. Understands Canisius politics and who to avoid. Grooms you to be in the same league as him, above every one else!",1
Very aggressive,0
Roxi is a tough cookie to crack but a really good writing teacher. Definitely made for an interesting quarter not knowing if she liked me or not. She really cares about class participation so come to class with one thing to say about the reading and she'll love you. Also write with passion and she'll dig it no matter what it is.,1
"If you show up to class and try you can pass the class with no problem, He also ""attempts"" to make an 8 am class fun! I would say take him and try to have fun with it!",1
"It was an 8-week course, each week you had 2 essays, a discussion board, and activities to be done on the online book. If you are taking other classes, family, and/or a job, skip the class.",1
Great teacher. Always available to help his students. Very clear with directions and assignments. Will definitely take another class with him again.,1
"I hated this guy while I had him, but in the end he passed me. This is not to say I didn't bust my backside trying, and in the end that is what made the difference. Study hard if you take him because that is all that will save you. Accounting is a miserable subject no matter who you take.",0
"Ms. Magdaleno is a great teacher, she makes the class and the assignments fun and interesting. If you walk in thinking that it's an easy A think again, because you have to put the work in. There's always something due and it's east to get behind if you don't stay on top of everything. She makes class exciting with her nice sweet ass and purple hair",1
"I had over 100 credit hours when I took her class and it was enough to make me consider dropping out. It was the worst college experience I've ever had. You'll pour days of your life into the project and be proud of the result. But regardless, she'll be offended by your efforts and tear every piece you turn in to shreds with no guidance provided.",0
"Maybe he's better in person, but his online course is awful. There are no lecture videos, no outside materials, nothing other than the textbook and a supplemental packet that contradicts the book, you're just teaching yourself. Leaves constant condescending remarks on turned in work. YouTube is better, take this with a different teacher!",0
"Monotonous. If you need to catch up on some sleep, just listen to his lectures.",0
"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. If you take Stein's class be prepared for no homework (not even optional work for practice), 1-2 quizzes every week, and for him to only lecture about problems he already wrote out. He comes to class with a paper full of work and just talks about it the entire class period. He is a VERY harsh grader on exams and quizzes.",0
"Beware of Mrs. Wang's math classes. You need to be well-versed in the subject. She does not provide a platform for C students. She delves into Matrices and Linear Programming. Taking precious time away from more applicable math subjects. Just keeping it real. Also, you will notice that she does not have 23 people on her waitlist!",0
He is extremely cocky and can make you feel like an idot if you are unprepared for class and ask a question. once you get used to his personality you will do fine as long as you STUDY.. this seems to be true for all lab bio type classes though so as long as you put in the time you will do fine. i recommend his class just dont get on his bad side!,0
don't take her. she has people do the most ridiculous assignments. nice lady but very hard grader. also holds grudges,0
"Mary is okay if you agree with everything that she says. If you're opinion differs from her own, expect to see a drop in your grades. She is unorganized and completely inappropriate in the classroom.If mad enough, she will yell and cuss out the class, and even walk out.",0
"Attendance isn't mandatory but he doesn't upload any of the powerpoints. A LOT of reading, he assigned 5 books for one semester and we read them all. He grades on a curve but he's really rude. You're not allowed to eat in class, use the restroom or leave early. I would never recommend his class to anyone. Only took it because it was available.",0
If you take this class make sure this is the only class you take that semester. That's how difficult this class is! If you are working a full time job and have several classes this is not a class to take. Her assignments disappear after mid night even though she saids the assignment is due next class. Gives so much work even on test days.,0
"Truly the best teacher i've ever had. He not only enjoys what he teaches, but enjoys helping students learn. He also understands that not everybody is a Bio major, which is good. He is always extremely nice and personable with his students. I was always excited to go to his class just because he put me in a better mood. Absolutely take his class!",1
hate this class! test are hard. studying is a MUST with lots of outside help. doesnt give out OLD powerpoints. Rambles.,0
"She is a very funny and kind woman. However, I found her grading technique to be incredibly harsh. I have done well in other English and Comp courses, however this class has been a struggle. She is vague on descriptions of assignments. She sometimes also makes you feel stupid when answering questions. ",1
"The lectures are usually boring, but it's good to pay attention. She usually hints at what the essay question for each of the 3 tests will be, so going to every class is important. She gives out study guides, do them, that is the only way to pass the tests. Define every term you use on your tests or she will dock you points. Be specific.",1
Class is not impossible. Do the homework. Study like she suggests and you will have an A. She is a different breed of person but she cares.,1
"Mrs. V is a great professor. I learned so much and she cares about the students understanding of the material. She is extremely knowledgeable. Record lectures. add notes on a laptop, on her powerpoints. Listen to the recordings at home and add to the powerpoints anything you missed . Make flash cards. Use the book if you dont understand something.",1
"This class was difficult but like all foreign language classes it takes time and effort to earn the grade you wish to get. Attendance is mandatory and it's also necessary that you do online homework daily. Overall, he was a fair grader and expects a lot out of you as a student.",0
Dr. E is definitely one of the best professors in the chemical engineering department. He's really laid back and extremely fair as far as grading is concerned. The textbooks for this class are a MUST so you'll know how to do the excel quizzes. He's the reason I stayed a chemical engineering major.,1
"He uses the phrase ""social justice"" when talking about poor people.  I wish some people wouldn't offend the rest of us with Communist-indoctrination vocabulary.",1
"GREAT teacher, relates everything to real world events! HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend, have him for two classes, and plan on taking him for every class that I can. So helpful, he'll help you on quizes and tests, he wont give you that answer but he'll provide efficient ques so that light bulb will turn on! RECOMMEND!",1
"Knows the material well but is bad at presenting it and fails to make students feel welcome or smart enough to contribute. Lots of reading, but the readings aren't too dense themselves. The material is ok, but the professor himself isn't great.",0
"He's a nice guy and knows his stuff; however, not cut out for teaching. Another teacher (head of dept maybe?) sets what he teaches and I feel this is a downfall for him. Teacher needs to use his own lessons to teach the required information. If you actually want to learn something, take a different class. Looking for just a grade? Take his class.",0
"10 Tests,6 Quizzes,& Lab points=100. Anatomy is a lot of info, so you MUST be willing to put in time as she does put tricky questions on her tests/quizzes. Pros: You can drop 2 tests (100 points each) & 1 quiz (20 points). Few extra credit on tests. Cons: Very confusing on what she is asking on test/Exams are difficult (I studied a lot).",0
"Anyone who says he's a good lecturer, must have had a different prof. He's boring, condescending and vague about things like what's on the exam for no reason. He never recorded his lecture for no reason and never wanted to help us in any way. Snobby and pompous",0
If you like being stressed out and failing classes because of a single pass or fail exam then she's the right prof for you.,0
"Nice guy, but I hated him. I never understood what he was trying to explain. Sometimes would spend whole lecture on problem then say it was wrong, and it had nothing to do with homework or test. Too much theory and not enough examples. Only C I ever received at Stevens",0
"He teaches from PowerPoint slides, extremely monotone. Gives homework but its not mandatory. If you struggle with math, I wouldn't suggest this professor his style of teaching isn't a very effective one. Unfortunately if you go to Armstrong campus he's the only professor who teaches Survey of Calc.",0
"This woman is MEAN. I worked hard and made an A, so it can be done. Terrible experience though....",0
"One of the best professors I've ever had, genuinely cares about every one of his students. Expects a lot of work from his students, but is rewarding if you put in the work. Pretty much guaranteed A- if you work hard.",1
"He's a good professor, he makes it clear on what to do on the assignments, but he can be confusing sometimes, for ex. he gave us 3 different dates for one test and I got really confused... but then he made it clear and warned us, he's not bad at all but he doesn't give us enough time to do our tests and the final exam, not enough time to do tests.",1
"He has gotten a lot better at responding back to his students! I think it takes him around 1-3 business days to get back to you, which isn't too bad. There are short essays that require 150-200 words, 3 longer essays that require minimum 650 words. Which again, not too bad. Discussion posts (150-200 words) every week. Pretty simple. Easy Peasy.",1
"Dr. Tulsian is by far the worst professor I have had in my entire life. Not only does he openly insult students, but he also is extremely rude and vulgar during lecture. This professor has ruined physics for many in the class, including myself.  I would suggest to take Physics with Calculus elsewhere AT ALL COSTS",0
"Participation will win you serious brownie points with her, and you'll need them, she assigns a ton of out-of-class tests/quizzes that are easy to forget about (she let me retake them for full credit). Won't give you fluffy feedback for stupid answers in class. A relatively easy A if you participate and keep track of the Blackboard assignments.",1
"i realized I did not even need this. but the fact that he is actually pretty cute made it, not a total loss! LOL",1
Class is boring and hes very forgetful.,0
"Professor Camarena talks about how he's huge on attendance, but he'll make you waste ur gas by missing several classes w/out emailing his students ahead of time. I think everybody takes his class because he's laid-back and isn't strict. You can use a calculator in this class.  HW 25% of ur grade and Quiz/Exams 50%",0
"Dr. Eager is the best math professor I've ever had. Explains things very well, available during office hours, knows we are all human and makes mistakes which is why his tests give you the ability to try problems multiple times. Calc 2 is a confusing and hard class but I completely understood all concepts with Dr. Eager!",1
We all know who wrote these reviews!! Scroll down for the real ones. At one point she even asked students to write them.,0
"-new professor to chemistry -doesn't know what she's saying half the time (not prepared for lectures) -unclear, confusing -not good at time management when it comes to lectures (will start a new topic like 10 minutes before class ends) -doesn't really answer your question- she'll just confuse you -she is nice though, I respect her for trying",0
"I am NOT a science person, and I got an A in this class. Professor Reddy gives you multiple way to succeed in this class. Literally just PAY ATTENTION and she will give you all the answers in her lectures. Which are still short and sweet. She knows how to pack all the info in an hour lecture. The homework is easy, you just gotta do it!",1
"Sam is AMAZING. He understands his students better than any professor I've ever had. He will answer all your questions and make sure you do well, as long as you put in a marginal amount of work. Even though the class isn't strictly structured, it's HARD not to do well one exams and homework. You don't have to do the reading, just show up to class.",1
"This 10 student class felt more like a 3 hour conversation than an academic class, and that is not necessarily bad. Reading is essential for being able to participate in class and if you do not speak she will put you on the spot. homework was mainly a couple essays and of course the readings",1
CRAZY WOMAN BUT an easy teacher.,0
"Honestly not a good professor. He is extremely rude, uncaring, and gives terrible feedback. His feedback is very inconsistent and mean spirited and he doesn't really even teach anything. He more so gives you assignments and just sits at his desk. I wanted to like this class but honestly he just makes it hard to like.",0
"Dr. Keeling tends to set a lot of homework, however, he doesn't really give meaningful feedback. Furthermore, he is pretty passive aggressive and very strict when it comes to his criteria. As long as you don't turn anything in late or walk into class late, you'll be fine.",0
"I love John Creed with my whole heart. I have never had to work harder for a class, but it has made the learning experience so much better. He is truly a staple for the political science department and I highly recommend him to all students. You will read more than any other class that semester, but you will learn so much. He truly loves his job.",1
"Professor Partovi is extremely informed on his subject matter, but does not always do a great job on making it accessible to students. Some background in the material helps, but otherwise refer to readings. All assignments are take-home; final paper is lengthy, but does not require outside research. DEFINITELY ask questions either in-class or OH.",1
"If you have Temple the best advice I can give you is write down everything he does in his lecture notes. It's the only thing you'll be tested on, don't bother with the textbook or AATC tutors, they can't help. I asked if we could have a practice midterm and he said, ""no I've never taught this class before so I don't want to make 2 exams."" Uncaring.",0
"He's kind of funny, but most people just seem annoyed with his humor. He calls us ""people"" all the time, and makes weird noises when he speaks. Some days I would get lost in counting the time he said ""people, if you dont' know this by now, then..."" and I would completely miss out on the material. Really knows his stuff though",0
"One of the most brilliant minds on the planet.  Beat Bobbie Fisher at Chess and challenged us all.  Brought American Business history to life, and helped shape mine.  I am forever indebted to this man.  Ironic that he died of Brain Cancer.  My sincere sympathy to his family.  Thank you all so much for giving him to us for even a short time.",1
"Professor Fetter is one of the worst professors I have had at Butler. He is a great person and a very enthusiastic teacher but does not efficiently provide students with the material and teaching skills necessary to do well in class. He records notes and puts them online, which are just as confusing. Do not take him or Marketing Analytics (MK 384).",0
Dr. Merrill is the most amazing lecturer I've ever had. He is so incredibly interesting and makes you want to come to class. I never missed a lesson because I was always wanting to hear what he had to say. The tests are easy for a medium grade. To pull an A you've got to work hard though. Only 2 papers and 3 tests.,1
"I had Dr. Orser for Short Fiction.  I loved the course and I really liked her; however, not get fooled by her sweet old lady looks and charm, she is an extremely tough marker so it is next to impossible to get an A. ",1
Judges when you don't understand... Not entirely sure if he understands to be honest.,0
This class is a ton of work. But it's not hard. He is very clear on what he expects right up front. Basically participation is 50% of your grade. As long as you turn in things on time you get 50%. Then the rest is your final portfolio of works and a final exam. Be prepared to write a lot but also learn a lot! Can be an easy A. Took it online.,1
"Great professor!!!! I had a lot of fun in his class. Be prepared to think, not absorb info. He expects a lot in your witting and expects you to be vocal and participate in class, however, he's a great lecturer. He is always around to help you out and genuinely cares about his students.",1
Dr. Lee is a pretty good professor. The class itself is not easy. I felt like I learned a lot in this class.,1
"Very sweet and helpful teacher! Show up to class and you will easily pass. Definitely tries to help everyone pass, so don't be afraid to ask questions. Lets you bring a note card for tests. Definitely do all homework and quizzes for easy A. Definitely recommend!",1
"Not hard but challenging. likes students to work in teams and make decisions oruselves. likes the students who speak up even if they argue with him. he helps if you ask. even comes in on weekends for students who want to work on projects. good guy, but don't mistake him for easy. he is fair and reasonable, but expects you to try to solve problems.",1
SO sweet and caring. The nicest guy ever. Lectures can be boring but study guides are posted before the mid-term and test-just memorize it and you'll get an A. Often plays his cello and other instruments in class. Lots of listening and videos. As long as it looks like you tried on assignments you'll get full credit. FAVORITE CLASS I'VE TAKEN,1
I cannot believe this teacher. She has the audacity to tell me that I cannot make up a test because I didn't have a doctor note for my scheduled C section surgery.I told her this in advance and I didn't get a message back until I delivered my child. She then said that she does not give make up under any circumstances. I feel attacked by this woman,0
"WONDERFUL PROFESSOR.  VERY CLEAR. MAKES YOU THINK AND WRITE LUCIDLY.  TAKE HIM.  IF YOU WORK WITH HIM, YOU CAN GET AN A",1
Most boring class I've taken at UT.  Seriously.,0
This class was useless. It was an absolute waste of time. It took time away from my family and now that I am student teaching many of the master teachers I have talked about this class to have found her assignments outdated and laughable. Best of luck on your 10 day science unit outline. You will never ever use that again.,0
She is a great english teacher but very picky.,1
"Easiest class ever. Three 50 question tests & a 75 question final. He gives you the exact word-for-word questions that will be on the test, which are all on quizlet. He checks attendance randomly 5x for points, so it's not mandatory but I'd recommend going for the 25 points. Sometimes hard to understand, & pretty boring material, but he's funny.",1
"Most inspiring teacher ever. I learned so much from this class, especially from the class conversations. She is very intelligent and really understands her students. she replies to emails almost right away and she is always reachable is you need help. I would definitely take her again and I recommend her to anyone who is willing to learn something.",1
"Professor Wang is a really good teacher.  If you like numbers, then this class will be super easy.  Just study the material and do the homework, as you will learn the material better.  3 tests and no final, but there is a final project.  Very informative and kind.  She will also write you recommendations if you need it.",1
"Wonderful professor, extremely helpful and kind, knows his stuff and is challenging yet also understanding and fun. Great class! :)",1
Extensive amount of homework for a mandatory class for all students. Take any other teacher if you're given the chance. 3 papers throughout the semester which count for most of the grade so put the effort in to those. If you miss more than two classes without a legitimate excuse you fail.,0
"Dr. Costanza varies his lecture material and explanation based on his interests, but expects the student to write in-depth papers on each topic every week. Tough quizzes that are weighted to info or details NOT discussed in class. Costanza's rigid ultra-conservative Christianity can be uncomfortable. On plus side, class is repetitive tasks and easy",0
"Extremely boring class and the way he lectures makes it even more boring, the guy can never stay on topic and talks about research half of the time. Tests were ridiculous cuz theyre on stuff he says and very boring to listen to. Im changing my major. they need a guy who can stay on topic and make the class more bareable. Did i mention its boring?",0
"This was a good class. All the information was on PPT, and those were online. Most readings you could just Google, but for ease of access get the course packet. Group work was meh, but it was a short one. Aizura was a great professor. He was critical and to-the-point, yet enjoyable even at 9am in the morning. Take good notes and show up  A.",1
"Brent is simply amazing. He knows what he wants from his students and is clear about it. If you don't understand him, just reread his emails. He knows everything about film and is so passionate about it. He's a wonderful teacher. don't expect an easy A, but expect to learn a lot. I recommend him to everyone I know. LOVED this class.",1
"This teacher is a nice guy, but teaches at a more advanced level. He gives out plenty of homework and is not the most forgiving grader. He rarely, if ever, will give a student 100% on a paper. If your heart is set on getting an ""A"" in this class, be ready to work for it. There are definitely easier teachers out there.",0
She is very  disrespectful and very unprofessional and unorganized .,0
"Her lecture isn't necessary to attend. She really just confused me more than anything. Go to the review session the week of the test and she'll tell you everything you need to know. Plus her tests are online and open-note. She also offers a lot of extra credit. She's nice and helpful enough, but I got by on just her review sessions.",1
"The group progect was a nightmare. JP decided to be a ""bad customer"" on purpose and make it as hard as possible for everyone to get it done. His tests are also much harder than they need to be. Be prepared to bring every slide he uses on your notes, maybe you'll get a good score then.",0
"Stay away!!! Took her for two online courses and she is a very tough grader. Assigns discussions+comments every week, (not terrible) but she barely ever gives full credit for them. You NEED textbook for her or else she'll give low grades. 3 to 4 tests, makes you work for them. Don't miss assignments or turn in late ones. She WILL flag you.",0
"His lectures and notes aren't clear on what you are learning and what it applies to. Wasn't good at explaining things. However, go to the super tutorials and you will pass this course. You just might not learn anything.",0
"She is an extremely tough grader. I even went to the writing center a few times for her class and she still found fault in my papers, however she is nice and cares to get to know students.",0
"Take notes everyday,pay attention when she is discussing what will be on midterm/final, use tutor on essays or have her proofread, read all assigned stories/poetry, great teacher! wants students to succeed, not a hard class if you take notes and write decent essays so get them done early and have her look at them.",1
I went in to this class knowing that it would be difficult so i studied hard. Probably 20+ hours per test( which were every two weeks.) It did not help. The tests are puzzles and pointless. Does not reflect any of the material that I learned. I have never put in this much effort to a class before and gotten so little out of it.,0
"I have enjoyed Dr. Goldman's class so far. It is mildly difficult, with a few short papers and a presentation required. I've really enjoyed our class discussions so far and I love that she is unafraid to touch on some of the more controversial topics surrounding her subject matter.",1
"She is really into the topics and If you're not into it (most probably aren't) do not take her. She is a touch grader and has quizzes every class, a map quiz, midterm, in class writing essay, and a final. She is not approachable and a lil rude. The worst part of class is when she asks difficult questions and calls out people at the end of lectures.",0
"she rambles a lot and has trouble sticking to the topic. she also kept pushing things back forcing us to cram writing two papers in the last month of classes. we had a week and a half for our final paper because she ""forgot"" to assign it. shes really tough grader too. lots of unnecessary stress I definitely don't recommend.",0
"3 quizzes over terrible movies. 3 essays, final essay is 3000 words (tons of reading involved with these). 1 group presentation, which was stupid. 4 Absences and he will fail you. Very difficult to stay awake in class. If it's not required, don't take it. It's not a blow off and you have to show up, plus there were no good movies on the curriculum.",0
"Seems to not be aware that this is the 21st century and that everybody has phones and needs them for different, but important, things. Also incredibly petty and likes to gloat about his past. Loves to bemoan class about not remembering every detail of the notes. Do not recommend taking his class, but if you do prepare for misery and a bad time.",0
"Not a bad guy, he's at times humorous and obviously passionate about what he does. That said, NOT the professor to take if you are not a math major. His accent and writing can make him hard to follow, particularly at the pace he goes through material. He had a hard time conveying the material to most of my class. Over 50% dropped, more failed...",0
Dr. K is a new professor at Cal State Fullerton but teaches Environmental Engineering 441 pretty well. He is very hilarious and a cool guy. He will answer all questions that are asked and he really cares about his students' grades. If you study and go to class everyday then you will pass. If you don't then you are preparing yourself to fail. ,1
"Arrogant but brilliant. He hates left-wingers though - don't be offended he's just a little pompous and opinionated. Teaches very well, but watch out for his writing, it's awful. I've heard he's an excellent prof for upper-year courses. Genius.",1
He is a great teacher and is always willing to help.,1
"Disorganized. Grading was easy if you put in the work and did the reading however her style sucks. Too many miscommunications and misunderstandings with regards to the syllabus, the group project, and everything else. Worst professor I have ever had. In a lower division course at that.",0
"He's a good guy, but not my favorite professor. He makes attendance worth a test grade (plus some extra) which is nice if you go to every class, but his lectures aren't very helpful. I and most of the people I know in this class only learned from the book. So definitely buy the book.",0
"Sometimes we make opinions about people based on their personality.  No doubt he has a great personality, in front of a group ""when he's on""  But, there is another side.  Personality does not mean great teacher",0
"I had Mrs. Langille for API & loved her! She is a great teacher and very passionate about the subject. Enjoyed her labs and the guest speaker. AP is a tough subject so you have to be diligent, but I think she did a great job with the material and I've never been one to really excel at Science so hats off to her! I made an A in her class.",1
"You will not learn anything from Mingyang's class. She is very confusing, and her exams are impossible. She will help you with the hw if you go to her office hours, only plus.",0
"I had Melaine for Engl100 online and she was a solid choice. The course was fairly easy: 4 essays (in total) and usually 2 forum posts (weekly). She gives great feedback on essays and the marking is clear. Her course requires 3 textbooks, however I only ever used the Wascana Anthology book for the readings.",1
She is a nice professor that will provide help if requested. The whole class she will lecture but she will like to discuss a topic as long as you bring it up. The assignments are not hard as long as you show you participate. There are two essays in which are research papers but she will provide help and exams are the midterm and final.,1
Very unclear about anything.  Handed back assignments 4 weeks after we turned them in.  Makes me want to vomit everytime I am in that class.  By far the most uninspiring teacher I have had.  I have learned something in the class...shes the model of what not to be when you teach.,0
"Fun guy. One of the only Austrian-tinged econ profs on campus. He will stare you down if you try to ask a question, but there's not much to ask about. Also, don't just repeat what he says back to him in exams or essays, it seems to make him angry. Not that seeing him angry is a bad experience. If you lookup his journal articles, they're pretty fun.",1
She's a pretty awesome professor! Her notes are always on point with the test. The notes are easy to understand and study. She tells funny stories that relate to bio. She's very funny and an overall pleasure to have as a teacher! If your taking bio definitely ask your advisor if professor zeman is available !!!!!,1
"The tests are tough, you have to really study to pass. Attendance wasn't mandatory but skipping isn't a good idea if your'e trying not to fail. Wouldn't recommend if science isn't your thing.",0
"Awful. We were asked questions about material that I swear she never taught. Took forever to return assignments and post grades. I never recieved some things back (like the final!) When I asked for help and when other students aked questions in class, she was rude. Was 10 minutes late every day and expecteed to keep us 10 minutes late.",0
"Professor Laws class was great. Attendance is not mandatory. 5 easy quizes and most of them will be take home, 1 easy paper with an enough time amount. If you were absent on the quiz day, he will give you a chance to make it up by giving you the quiz as a take home quiz. Hes super nice and caring. Really do recommend! Easy A class!",1
"Horrible, more interested in where you put a comma than if you got anything from the assignment. Question if he reads the papers or just looks for MINOR grammatical errors. Tests so long you can barely finish. He talks to fast to take notes and then reads long quotes that are needless. ""A"" student that may pull a low B. ",0
"She is terrible. Does not offer any help or assistance and just doesn't care about students.  RUN, if you can!(I really hope that she reads these comments and learns from them).",0
"Truly a terrible teacher. She is a very bias grader, holds grudges for unknown reasons, constantly contradicts herself and offers no helpful criticism or guidance. Hard to believe gets paid to do what she does. My advice: stay far away",0
Mr. May Was rude and screamed at students in class. Was often missing. And did nothing but recite paragraphs from the book. I would not take him as a professor I would instead take one of the many other wonderful computer science teachers in Maple woods.,0
"This is a fun class but you do have to do a lot of reading. She only gives out 2 tests, 2 essays, and a project (but reading the chapters are crucial). She is a very nice person and wants to see you pass the class.",1
Super vague about all assignments then incredibly rude when no one in the class understands what she is asking for. Horrible professor don't take.,0
"This professor is inspiring.  She really knows her material.  Well, she should; after all, she has her PHD! This alone can take 8 years.  The class is easy to get a B in for sure, without reading the texts.  They just boost you up to A+ :)",1
I love Dr. Stauffers teaching style. She is very eloquent and detailed in each topic discussed throughout the semester.  She gives good feedback and allows lots of class discussion to dissect everything.  If you participate you will do well. I wish every professor taught this way.,1
Hes so nice and passionate and I LOVE his accent!,1
"He's extremely helpful! He expects class participation, but he makes it fun. He uses youtube, which is always interesting. Also, he's cute!",1
"I liked Rachel a lot. She is very sweet and treats everyone with respect. She allows everyone to share their own opinions on each topic. The class had homework due almost every day, but only 4 quizzes, which were all open notes. Definitely would recommend taking this class with Rachel.",1
"BEST PROF EVEEEEER, as long as you do the work you will be fine, you actually learn with him not just to pass but for life, he is sooooo funny that makes the class interesting. Also if you need something he will help you he is very caring with his students. This is the first prof. I'm actually going to miss. TAKE HIM YOU'LL NOT REGRET IT!!!!!",1
First day of class stated that she rarely gives an A grade. Doesn't feel that students can write on that level. Don't expect her to put grades into the computer until the last day of the semester. Quizzes for the first half of the semester on homework reading. I would attempt to avoid her class if possible. Formal writing for an informal world.,0
Good exercises provided to practice,1
Personally not respectful to students. Doesn't respond to questions. Extremely rude. Doesn't know her subject matter.,0
"I sat this class almost 20 years ago circa 1998. To this day, my favorite class and professor. If there was ever a professor who was so opposite as I and yet taught me how to think for myself Professor Clarke did this for me. What a hero!",1
"Multiple times couldn't solve basic circuits in class, test solutions were sometimes incorrect, and do not expect him to grade fairly at all. ",0
Facile!!,1
Dr. Strauch is the best. HIS230 (pre-civil war American history) was really interesting; she did an excellent job of teaching the class from a Native American and African American perspective as well. She makes great connection to larger social and political issues. 10/10 would recommend!,1
Your grade is only determined by discussion posts. The instructions are super unclear and he gives ZERO feedback. When I asked for feedback he told me not to worry about it. I posted all my weekly posts on the same day (the last due date) and always got an A. There are zero lectures and zero chances to make up missed points. Really disorganized :),0
He has no remorse. Doesn't teach anything. He just pre-records lectures and makes you watch them on your own time. Every class you have a quiz first thing and then he asks you if you have any questions on the new topic you were suppose to watch for the week. Simply you have to teach yourself calculus 2 while he watches you struggle.,0
Classes where great but marking scheme mad NO SENSE.I have teken high level Engl courses and only got a C+ in this. Seems to have unerlying homosexual themes in everything. Chosses Dark material (Gilgamesh/cosmopolis/hunters in winter)Great classes and a funny guy. VERY understanding and helpful with emails.,1
The content is OK but the prof is helpless. never have homework or extra practice but the final is something beyond the handout,0
Wow. I had his class in 1987 and because of him I took 3 more years of chemistry even though it wasn't required for my degree. He made me fall in love with chemistry and see the world through the eyes of what an electron would do.,1
"AP is one of the best professors Ive ever had at Reynolds. She makes you work for your A bit if you show up to class, be involved, stay motivated and respect her the way shell respect you, youll get an easy A. Shes always willing to help and give feedback, she makes English class fun and hands on. Please take her while you can.",1
Pretty hard Professor. She taught the plant section of BIS2C and her midterms and section on the final were rough. She does test on the smallest details sometimes. She has pretty good lectures if you can listen. Extremely knowledgeable on the topics and respected. Great sense of humor too. Just wish her tests weren't so detailed.,1
"Very caring & explains the material well. Econ comes pretty naturally to me, but the tests were tough because they covered a lot of material. Put in the effort and youll be fine. He offered a couple extra credit opportunities.",1
"One of the worst decisions you could make in your life to take this prof. Unintelligible, lacks knowledge, and his lectures are all over the place. He shows us useless videos and you literally cannot understand what he is saying most of the time. Project/labs are difficult and asks for more than what he teaches. Literally regret taking him so much.",0
Shes good. Old school and she still uses a chalk board. She give a lot of homework but does not really check it unless you were late or absent. Your grade depends on the tests which are a huge chunk of your grade. However everything is on the study guide so youre okay. Attendance isnt enforced but its up to you to learn what you missed.,1
"Not allowed to stand up at all. NO bathroom, NO eating, NO electronics, including if you wish to take notes digitally. His lectures jump around so it makes it difficult to find your appropriate notes when studying for the midterm or final. Studied religiously the study guide for the midterm, did not help at all. 5 books and 5 papers. AVOID!",0
"Either you will like him or hate him.  He is a good guy, you can always get help in turner labs.  The computer lab monitors will help you.  Just make sure you show up for class on time and don't miss the class!",1
Really great professor and one of the easiest classes in the major. A lot of basic stuff that you learned in middle/high school and then some cool stuff like StatPlus and SPSS.,1
"She's a very tough grader but if you thoroughly--and I mean thoroughly--edit and revise your paper's it's more likely to get a better grade. Class was a little boring, and it was mildly tough to pass with a B. She doesn't respond quickly to emails but is willing to help out if needed.",1
"he's awesome..he cracks stupid jokes but hes so nice you laugh just to make him feel good. he gives you the benefit of the doubt and makes it almost impossible for you to fail. the movies are boring though, mostly silent films.",1
"Arrogant to the point you felt her lectures were less about the material but more about how she climbed her way to the top at any job she worked at. Disappointing to hear her say, she took others people's jobs away and how she went about it. Watch out Clark  Professors!!!",0
"I have nothing but good things to say about professor Jassen. I emailed her probably 100000 times this semester and she always responded right away. She really cares about her students, gives you feedback when you ask, and provided opportunities to boost your grade in an already difficult class. Be prepared to study, don't fall behind/""catch up "" !",1
Nikolai lectures very well and even though he does random cold calls he makes you feel like whatever you say has value. He only provides one practice exam per midterm and final so it is up to you to study from the book.,1
Very nice as a non major it was a relief to not feel like the art I was putting out had to be as good as the rest of the class because she understood it isn't the same,1
Although I did enjoy his lecture I think he is kind of rude at times and a bit arrogant with his comments.  He hardly looks at you in the eyes and that is kind of strange considering he is an Interpersonal Communications teacher.  Grades fair and assignments are cool.,1
"Only one thing you need to know. She writes down ""Daily Objectives"" (or hands out). SAVE THESE. As she goes through class, write the answers she defines in class for each daily objective. THEN for exams, she hands out a study guide that is LITERALLY compiled from the daily objectives. Match up your answers, memorize. Ace the test. Very simple.",1
"The class is fairly easy, but the weekly readings are brutal. She assigned at least 100 pages per weeks. Also when it comes to mannerism she is extremely snobby and opinionated and passive aggressive!",0
"His lecture consisted of him scribbling incomprehensibly all over the board.  All learning was done entirely from the text, as he did not instruct in any sort of clear way.",0
"Dont get me wrong this prof is very sweet & kind but she is a very hard marker! Make sure you show up to lecture & do your readings or you wont pass. She also has her favourites that she tends to be more lienent with. She canceled a class, and didnt lecture us on those chapters too which sucked. She was an okay prof but I wouldnt take her again",0
"One of the BEST Instructors I've ever had. She speaks definitely, absolutely and with much enthusiasm about her expertise! ",1
"Tanya continuously changes the syllabus and due dates without letting us know. She crams so much at the end that it seems almost impossible to finish the class. Do not recommend, this class is awful.",0
I have very few good things to say to her besides the fact that she is nice. Her teaching is reading off a PowerPoint and her tests ask the most obscure and irrelevant questions that are not important Big picture questions. When half the class was struggling through with the pandemic she just said suck it up and would not offer much help.,0
"I took this professor online for Pre-Cal and let's just say the work was the easy part. In the syllabus she has a chart that shows you what is needed to be exempt from the final, which also also states that if you're close she will make an adjustment. I exceeded the points, but she failed to realize that and didn't grade my discussion board either!",0
i was awful at the material in this class and handy made it easy to understand and works with you to help you figure it out. she is a sweetheart and even helps students she has no obligations to. you don't even have to have her for a class and she offers you help.,1
"dr. lapresto knows her stuff.  if you are willing to pay attention, and open to learning, you will have no problem in her class.",1
I used to hate life drawing until I started taking it with Kathleen. I learned so much from her because she is so clear with her lectures. Every day in this class is dedicated to something different. She wants the students to experiment with different techniques and find what's most comfortable for them. Take her! You won't regret it! I promise.,1
She is super aggressive. She has an annoying iclicker. The people that say she is nice there lying. Take someone else because she is too much. She gives sooo much work like there is no other classes but her. Aleks is supper annoying and she give so much hw that she could reduce but doesn't care. She has a lot of attitude in her emails.,0
I love her. Shes so open to everyone and shes funny. I took a late night class with her and she made everything so simple. No test given. Just watch videos in class and some group activities. This class made me open my eyes more.,1
She is a tough grader.,0
"Professor Stahl is very helpful. If you show her that you want an A and you put the time in, then she will give you what you deserve. I loved getting to know her this semester and highly suggest her as a professor.",1
"He is very nice and easygoing, but has a heavy accent (Chinese?) and can be difficult to understand. Also, he is not helpful when you don't understand a concept and need to ask questions.. All things considered, I would not recommend him. I had to heavily rely on my book to learn in this class.",0
"Hmmm...well, he was easy, in the class. His paper topics are hard, and you'll never get an A in his class. He is interesting to listen to, and makes funny comments, that are completely unrelated to the book and class. This was for Medieval English 2.",0
"Dr. Hart. Her review slides are longer than the lectures themselves.. babbles on about her personal life more than the protists she adores and fingi she thinks are cool. Save yourself and avoid her at all costs. Or just go off the textbook and skip class, lectures are not worth it.",0
Professor Schlorrt gives excellent and hilarious lectures. You will learn a great deal about history if you take the class. He gives a lot of feedback on assignments telling you what to do better. Some might say the feedback is harsh. I would say it is fair. He gives you good grades and will help you pass by dropping assignments! You'll learn a lot,1
"Barbara was one of the worst professors I've had. Her notes are very dense, aren't really in order sometimes and very confusing for a first level course. Very hard marker, not clear on what she expects. In order to understand the material, expect to teach yourself. Several in class quizzes but the answers you could never get. avoid her if possible.",0
"Have not gotten through the semester yet - wish I had taken this course from another professor. She is nice, but a snail could cover the material faster.",1
"Eric is an awesome professor that genuinely cares about his students. Something to keep in mind is that, while attendance is NOT mandatory he does give RANDOM extra credit points to those that come (by just picking a random day that not many are there). His lectures are very straightforward and he gives you a copy of the notes before class starts.",1
"Professor Calkins is one of my favorite professors at JJay. The course materials were incredibly diverse, interesting, and engaging. Minimal work was required: 4 discussion posts, 5 quizzes, 1 final (MC/Short Response), and 1 written assignment. She's always accessible by email, quick grader, and provides good feedback. A true gem, take her class!",1
"professor rombo is horrible, lecture slides have no information on them so if you miss one class you wont know what was going on that day. gives 3 tests including the final. ridiculously hard grader when it came to projects and assignments, she wont tell you what she wants but then will fail you if you dont magically give her exactly what she wants",0
"Feel kind of bad making this review but I'm going to be honest... She's a nice professor but the workload for pre-calculus is a bit ridiculous. Anyone who has taken calculus knows that pre-calculus is basically an illegitimate subject, so to dump a huge workload of concepts that will soon be replaced is inefficient and tiresome.",0
Nice Guy and smart guy.  Gets you in and out.  Cares about his students,1
"I'm very passionate about the environment, engage in local activism and love to learn. This course is dry and boring. He calls ppl out to answer questions, doesn't engage - instead rambles about own experience and work. I think he is okay as a prof but doesn't leave you inspired or interested. readings are easy, graded by many assignments +exam",0
"There's a reason why this class was still available to add a day before school started! Constantly passive aggressive and will talk down on you. Semi easy, but it wasn't a fun semester at all. Creates a bad environment for writing stories. No talking to classmates, no music, no fun. If you like journalism, go somewhere else.",0
"Professor Ayers is a super nice guy and is really helpful. His assignments can be a little bit difficult, but he makes himself accessible if you need any help.",1
"Its a lecture course, memorize the study guide and you'll get an A. No homework and one 500 word paper. He doesn't need citations or a proper format so, if you hate English class then it'll still be an easy paper. Test are fill in the blank with a word bank and matching art to the artist. Don't take this class after you eat, you'll fall asleep",1
If you put the time into the class you can easily get a good grade. He gave us a study guide for every exam and if you study that and go over the homework questions you'll do great. Overall I thought he was a really good teacher.,1
"Great Professor. You will have about 3 papers per class with him that range from 3-8 pages in length. He grades papers tough but if you get them revised early on, you will make a good grade. Although he takes a long time to get feedback to you on your papers, he gives you many opportunities to re write if he does not think its good. No tests",1
"Professor Carson is literally one of the sweetest professors Ive had the pleasure of meeting. His class is easy and all you have to do is write a few paragraphs. He cares and respects all his students, he is highly respected.",1
DO NOT TAKE HIM EVEN IF YOU NEED THE CLASS!!!,0
"At first, I thought I liked Professor Nelson. Her lectures were good and easy to follow. But then when it came to the paper, an article review, she wouldn't listen to criticism about the rubric and didn't post a sample of what the paper should look like until the week before it was due.",0
"I would not recommend him at all, didn't have any clear set of guidelines, idk if it has to do with being online or what but it was very unorganized and the instructions for the graded assignments weren't clear which is probably because instructions for these assignments are never actually given. Seemed like he was too busy to teach this class.",0
"The best prof I have ever had! The sweetest lady, really cares about her students. So hilarious. She would bring us chocolates around each holiday and Christmas crackers at Christmas. A lot of students would skip which is not recommended, but she wasn't really mad about it. Very generous marker if you know your stuff and participate.",1
The best CBE teacher I've ever had. Do HW and practice exams that he posts and you should be fine.,1
"This instructor was great for the class. He really showed that he cared about us getting to the right project. After I found the project, he showed me very good pointers. A little harsh on the grading but I also missed some stuff. Clear explanations and instructions. I would take another class with him.",1
"This was the first class I had taken in years and I was very nervous.  Lisa was so calm and cool, I felt very comfortable in her class.  Learned a lot.  Took during summer, loved this instructor.  Would take a class with her again.",1
"This class was definitely hard, but you have to know how to take notes according to his powerpoints. He is a tough grader for the tests, but ultimately it helps your writing. USE HIS OFFICE HOURS! He's very helpful. Overall, I loved having him as a professor!",1
"If Dave switched to teaching underwater basket weaving, then I'd want to change my major to underwater basket weaving. ",1
Worst class and professor I've had so far at VSU. The concepts are easy but he makes his tests unnecessarily hard! Not willing to meet with you if it isn't during his office hours. He's very smart but isn't good at teaching the material. Take another professor!,0
Easy A and easy class,1
"While he does know the the subject matter well, he spend most of his time writing on the white board. This is a problem, because his is writing is completely illegible. The hardest part is the tests. All have to be hand written answers to multi part questions. The final took me 2.5 hours and 7 hand written pages. Avoid this teacher at all costs.",0
"Enjoyable class! I took this professor twice and learned so much from the lectures and discussions. The workload is not too heavy, its quality over quantity which was perfect for busy students. Great choice!",1
Spanish sucks and there is no reason to make us take high levels of foreign language. this prof made it bearable.,0
"Amazing, amazing professor. He truly cares about the wellbeing of his students and is extremely responsive to emails. I was not interested in the class at all, yet he was able to engage me in the content. Would take again any day. Lots of pop quizzes, but no exams or projects.",1
Shes incredible .  Amazing lectures and is hilarious and also keeps you entertained . Her class is basically a big open discussion . Id take her class over and over !,1
"If you're looking to waste your time and learn irrelevant knowledge to the industry, this is your guy. If you are a SWE major at SJSU, do not take this professor! Homework is long, he nitpicks grading exam answers, and his material is just outright useless. He teaches you ""Jedi"" his own made up language that you will never use in the real world.",0
"If you want an easy class with not much work, do not take this professor. She has high standards and does not ""dummy down"" her grading because you are at a community college. You will learn a lot if you are willing to work hard, but her standards are high. Other teachers are much easier, but you won't learn as much.",1
College Algebra. By far best math class I've ever taken. Don't be dumb and buy the textbook or the access code though. They have it in the library. We hardly used it.,1
I am a worse person from meeting her. She constantly berated my ideas in both seminar and on my papers. I am a b+ to an A student and I barely passed her classes. she is a tough grader and picks faves. AVOID HER AT ALL COSTS. she caused me to have a mental breakdown in first semester of my second year because she constantly made me miserable.,0
"She might be one of the professors that actually got me into depression. At first, I though she is nice lady, but reality hits and got me worried about my GPA. Thanks to her, I see her as someone who doesn't see her students as worthy successors but instead sees them as failed human beings or she really hated her job working there.",0
Impossible to follow. You can never be sure exactly what it is she wants from you in class or on assignments. Didn't seem to have fundamental knowledge of what she was teaching. Couldn't give clear answers to questions.,0
He went off onto so many tangents that seemed irrelevant to the pieces we had to read. None of the class got to have an input because he was the one always talking. He also was so disorganized and didnt seem like he knew what he was doing. We had a midterm and final.,0
Don't take her. It's hard to understand what she says during class. You mostly will have to teach yourself.,0
"Don't take her class if you can't teach yourself. She usually has you watch voice-over PowerPoints at home and then holds class for about 30 min. She doesn't give detailed feedback on tests or assignments. If you need help you will be diverted to the HAC. If you don't already know chemistry and are taking this class to actually learn it, good luck.",0
Do not take his class. He should have retired 15 years ago and is still teaching. He is an old man who makes the class boring and impossible to succeed in. Also he should be fired.,0
"Colleen is so nice! There was one test and one assignment for each religion and a paper. She cares for students and whenever there is a problem with work, she would help out! Highly recommend her",1
"A very nice professor,  It really is an easy class, just do your work and do it on time.",1
A really good professor! Is always available to help if you need it. took multiple spanish classes with her.,1
Take Biology 1190 with Garyen and you will not regret it. Bio 1190 is generally course heavy but he makes it interesting. His Exams is based from the textbook covering the most important things in his lecture and in his powerpoint which likely ends up on exam. His Quiz is harder compared to his exams and their is is iclicker but they will help U!!,1
"Very knowledged person on his field, tough class and he will test you very well with various assignments which will make you learn a lot. Very kind and caring person too. Only real problem would be that he is a tough grader and hard on grammar. Interesting to talk to as well.",1
"Absolutely terrible. She's off topic most of the time, because she's got nothing to teach, since she's got nothing in her brain. It's sad, but it's the truth. If you want a good grade, might as well stay home and read your textbook. ",0
Professor seem like an overall person but when it comes to teaching she needs to be better prepared. While doing examples of new material she often makes mistakes and corrects them midway with unclear explanations of the changes. Good amount of homework on pearson while will require a code $$$ a few quzzies and tests plus final. Find other options.,0
Easiest class I have ever taken I don't know how he doesn't have a 5/5. Would highly recommend pairing this class with Micro Bio or A&P 1/2 if you need this credit for your degree because it is stress free and allows you to focus on your more difficult classes. No citation required on writings just read the material and answer his questions.,1
hes funny.,1
"THIS PROFESSOR IS HORRIBLE. I STRUGGLE WITH ESSAYS AND  AS I TOOK HIS ENGLISH 21 CLASS, I FELT LIKE I DID NOT LEARN NOT ONE THING. YES, I PASSED HIS CLASS BUT IT WAS A STRUGGLE. I HAD TO DO MY OWN RESEARCH ON HOW TO DO A PAPER. EVERYTIME I ASKED HIM FOR HELP HE WOULD COME UP WITH SOMETHING TOTALLY OUT OF THE SUBJECT.",0
"Sheryl is VERY CARING! I left my sunglasses in her class room after hours and could not return that evening. She went back & got them for me! Sheryl gives her students chances to pass her class if she sees that they are trying. Be prepared to do RESEARCH papers, take quizzes each week, READ a lot. She helps students better understand the course!:)",1
"She inherited this class this sem. it was a rough start. But ended well. She is wonderful in her office, very patient with all ??. She is a fair grader. Essays need to be clean, she is very picky about grammar. Book is hard to understand but after a while I got the hang of it. It was a hard class if you don't study.",1
Sometimes uses real world experience too much.,1
"I have nothing but the utmost respect for Dr. B. She truly cares about her students and gives amazing, thought out, well-explained lectures. She wants you to pass and will go out of the way to help you, just don't expect it to be done for you. I would take her class again in a heartbeat. Make sure you go to class, she wrote the book and curriculum",1
"not response to student's work, can't hear his talking. always lost student's paper.",0
"I took her for Multicultural Issues and she was a very good teacher. I would take her over anyone else. Her classes are very short and simple and if you paid attention the tests are easy. Best teacher in the sociology department, i'm surprised more people dont take her",1
"If you sincerely care about getting the most from your education, he's your guy! He's more qualified to teach Project Management than most and possesses a wealth of knowledge. He's tough, so you can't just fake participation; expect to write a lot. He grades fast and gives real feedback that will help you improve. He can be reached through email.",1
He just talks on and one and on an on. Show up and stay awake and you will pass . It is an easy class just boring.,0
Not a very good instructor. He makes things more difficult than they have to be.His tests include material not covered in class and he hardly ever shows up for class to begin with. WHen he does show up he is always at least 15 minutes late. Might as well be self study for all he cares.,0
Was always there for when students needed help. A very supportive professor and he knows his subject well!,1
Awful professor. Her lectures are just completely boring and she makes no sense whatsoever. Be prepared to teach yourself the material. She states test is based of her PowerPoints however many topics that we were tested on was not in her PowerPoint. Lab is fun but again most of the time students were lost. I am surprised she is rated a 4/5.,0
Mr.Martin was great. No many quizzes or a lot of homework. Just show up and do the work and you'll do great. He's nice. flexible and patient. Two thumbs up for Mr.Martin,1
Good luck with her. She dosent explain anything thats on the test and gives very boring lectures.,0
"Online class is very unorganized. The assignments had the same due date schedule in the beginning, now they change all the time if she even posts anything. Recorded lectures for one or two chapters but never again, then she just links to Khan academy videos and uploads non-detailed powerpoints. Doesn't answer emails. would NOT take again",0
"Thankfully he sticks to the syllabus day by day. NO use of mathlab, all of our book homework looked like (1-89) EOO (every other odd). He doesn't check for accuracy on the homework. There are few quizzes and although the 3 exams are tough, you can 'correct' them and get hella credit back. If you just read the book and do HW its a simple B/B+.",0
"Coop is interesting, funny, and understanding, yet he is extremely hard to understand and follow even the most basic algorithmic foundations. He s a good person, not a good professor.",0
"It's an easy A. He's very loud and enthusiastic about the subject and obviously very knowledgeable. The quizzes are a little ridiculous, but the only part of the course where I didn't always get full credit. For everything written, just hit the word count and you're fine. Final project was annoying, but not hard.",1
Went for one reason and left with a new understanding,1
"One of my favorite classes. The chapters are actually informative and once you do the assignments you'll know off the dome. He's really helpful if you email him about anything. Assignments for each chapter consist of a Quiz, Interactive Study, and LearnSmart. There are also a couple papers throughout ( about 5).",1
"Pretty terrible professor. Completely unorganized, sometimes passive aggressive with his students. Handled the whole transition to online classes terribly. He drones on during lectures. Extremely clueless at times. Highly recommend you to avoid at all costs.",0
"Awesome, awesome, awesome!!!! One of the BEST professors in the English department.  I learned more from his class than pretty much any class at BYU.  Excellent lecturer, funny, actually cares about students and their lives and is always willing to help.  I absolutely recommend Mason to anyone!",1
"I understand that online classes are probably hard to teach, but she was totally AWOL the whole time. I emailed her four times during the class, and she never once got back to me. She would fix and change things but never communicate at all. The class is graded (often outdated) busywork, more time consuming than chemistry or calculus.",0
"Stay away, teacher is very tough! expects too much!",0
"Interesting man, probably shouldn't be a teacher though. Does not believe that grades are important to his students. Class notes are random and unorganized. Tests are nearly impossible because he gives no insight as to what will be on them. Projects are useless, time consuming and have nothing to do what is discussed in class. DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS",0
She was the easiest professor I have ever had. She made everything so much better in my life. I was like Luke Skywalker and she was my Yoda. She taught me a lot. If I didn't have her in my semester it would have been terrible. I would of been a ball of sadness.,1
"Weekend class.  Time well spent.  Excellent instructor, and her knowledge is up to date and prepared to speak about current internet world.  Very patience with students. Will look for her name in other classes. Good handouts. Moderate break time. Interactive computer use. Glad I took the class.",1
"let me start off on saying how im a straight A student my whole life. i managed to FAIL this class. she eye ball grades each lab, you'll never get higher than a 6/10, lucky if you get a 7. her tests are crazy heavy and the average is always 60%/lower. she does not respond or fix anything, she'll mark you 0 on accident and wont fix it. SAVE UR GPA!",0
"Im taking this class now and I hate that she takes so long to grade your essays , you cant apply the feedback to your next paper! She grades the papers pretty tough too. Hard to maintain an A due to that . And she she doesnt have extra credit for you to try to make up for a bad paper. Id never take her again !",0
"I love Madame Nadeau. She made French awesome. At first I thought she didn't like me (and a few other people felt that way) but she does care about all of her students and enjoys teaching a lot, and it shows. Classes are always fun, interactive, theatrical, and I look forward to them.",1
Would not recommend this teacher to non english majors. He knows a lot and wants us to know a lot but most of the time it has nothing to do with the assigned text. He's funny and extremely experienced. Lets you rewrite essays for a better grade. His lectures can be tortuously long if you're not interested in English or history.,0
"Amazing professor, I once mistake him for a student the first time I met him hehe you can tell he is a chilled person. There are 4 out of class essays and 2 in class essays but it's not that hard as long as you do it. He is honestly the best professor I have taken for English and he is the best! You will not regret it I promise.",1
"He'll provide you with about as good a music introduction class as you can get, in a 30+ student class with both music and non-music majors. He explains the subject very clearly, is personable,  and gives fair exams. The best way to ace this class (for a non-music major) is to create memorization tricks and widgets to use during each of 4 exams.",1
"If you want an A you have to live and breath French. Always push the limits of the language during class and with the tutor. Remember all those little finicky rules you dont think youll need (but you totally will). She want everyone to know the exact right way to use french, so remember the rules. Also, learn all the vocab before you useitinclass",1
"Professor Myers is the best math teacher I have ever had in my life. She makes time to help everyone in class individually, and she is personally invested in your success. She doesn't let you give up, she will work on a problem with you until you figure it out, and she gets super excited when you get it. Take her for any math class that you can!",1
"She has favorites, and most of the time they are girls, and it well be extremely clear when you're the only person to have your hand up and get completely ignored. Not sure how you can get on her ""badside"", but if are you're going to notice the difference in grading.",1
He gave no one in the class an A.,0
"Dr. Callahan is great, but she definitely makes you work for it. Don't expect to take her and have written out study guides and cheat sheets from her. Study hard and you'll get an A.",1
doesn't show interest in answering questions . gets rude if we ask questions in class . no part marks and he is a tough grader . he makes the subject the most confussing and difficult . i was not having any other option than to take the course with this instructor .,0
"absolute worst professor i have ever had in my life. I had to retake the class because she failed me with a 72. She may or may not be clinically crazy. Her tests are impossible, she is extremely lazy, she gives you one day to do hw. makes you hate microbiology bc shes so awful.",0
"I feel bad because this Professor is a very kind man, but if you are someone like me who absolutely sucks at math and needs time to learn material, this class will be a nightmare. It is very fast paced and tons of content needs to be learned in a very short time. The professor wasn't willing to help me outside of class either, so I dropped.",0
"She acts nice, but she ain't. She thinks she is funny, but she ain't. She tries to help, but she doesn't. Her classes are sooooo boring, it feels like they only go backwards.",0
"She's really nice and lenient with her deadlines, but her course planning is terrible and is very slow with marking. It's been over a month since her course has ended and my class is yet to receive our final grade from her. While she makes the course easy, you won't properly learn the language. There are other professors who are more effective.",0
"Since her page hasn't been updated in a while, I wanted to add my opinion. Professor Page tended to be condescending towards students and assigned an inordinate amount of busy work. She spoke to us as if we were children, and her attitude made it hard for me to learn in her class. I got an A, but I did not enjoy my experience.",0
"Taylor is an incredibly engaged and considerate prof. His expectations are clear, reasonable, and he will offer great help if you seek it. Lectures are entertaining, and insightful. He also attempts to get to know a little about his students to better teach them. Reasonable marker, and gives good feedback. One of the best profs I've been taught by.",1
"Amazingly subjective grading, recognize that picking your battles in the beginning may very well save your grade in the end. I.E. don't argue about your first grade, argue about midterm and final. Start on projects immediately, they are very difficult for the time constrains provided.",0
"Chem 42. She was very passionate about teaching, and chemistry. Excellent at explaining what needed to be done, is understanding, and cares about her student's grades. Overall great teacher.",1
"One of the worst professors I've taken. Mocked students who ""should've learned the material in grade school"" and was often unwilling to explain calculations in class. Cancelled Friday classes without making up for the time lost and seemed perpetually unhappy. Tests were 2-3 problems and significantly different from homework and lecture problems.",0
"Overall great guy with a liberal bias and too many opinions ; disagree at your own peril.  He sold his soul to RED and will try to sell it to you. Whenever you make your film go for a low-income black lesbian main character and you'll get an A. He is not for everyone, be ready to take initiative with your own education. Teach yourself.",1
"I wouldn't really recommend him because he has a thick accent and made it really hard to understand him a lot. Plus the material was really dry and he couldn't engage our class a lot. There literally was no sound in our class, just him talking. Take someone else!",0
"Has weekly quizzes but they're fairly straight forward if you pay attention in class. Lectures had a lot of content, but exams were easier than expected. All of his classes have group projects (that I've taken at least). Old school teaching style, but very nice guy outside of class. Also none of his classes use textbooks.",1
Ms. Moore is as hard-working and committed as she expects her students to be. I learned a lot about theories directly related to art education and was better prepared for student teaching because of this course.,1
"Very good prof.  Not an easy class, nor should it be; must think very critically and express it in your writing.  I worked hard and it paid off.  I'd recommend her.",1
"She brought life into the classroom. The transition to online was hard for me, most professors went silent for weeks and then slammed us with tons of assignments. I don't think anyone appreciated how much work she put into our class. She was the only professor who held Zoom classes where we could talk and learn. That kind of dedication is rare.",1
"I had him for Ethics in Fall 2019. He is a kindhearted and caring person who loves philosophy. Your grade in the class is 7 quizzes and a paper. Quiz questions come directly from the powerpoints, which are on Canvas. He lets you take quizzes home if you miss taking them in class for whatever reason which is nice. Take his classes if you can!",1
I had him for intro to philosophy and it was probably the most mentally stimulating class I've taken.  He is great at promoting thought on the readings while guiding class discussion and interpretation.  He's a really smart guy and class was very interesting.,1
Don't miss any homework because you CANNOT submit them late and it counts for 40% of your grade. The other 60% is based on the midterm/final. The midterm/final were all calculations. Majority of the questions were from the practice exams. But be sure to study the homework questions as well because some of these questions can show up on the exam,1
"Probably the best professor I have taken at UC Davis. Always on time, lectures are sometimes entertaining and often provides examples from her life which makes everything more understandable and funny. Respectable and cares a lot for his students. So-so readings, one paper, in class midterm, one article critique, and one take home final or project.",1
"This was the first sociology class where I got an easy A. 3 Papers throughout the entire semester that are due whenever you feel like giving them in. He lets u revise it to get an A and he really cares about you. You would be an idiot not to take him. highly recomend taking this man,",1
"Teacher that does not like students despite what he himself thinks. Overall, the class was uncomfortable with an almost hostile feeling to it. He also does not understand modern approaches to software projects. Class also does not have a lot of resources. You will be punished for using internet for help (not code copying). Also no piazza.",0
"Online course, easy, but assignments were boring and ""worksheet-ish."" Almost no communication. Course VERY poorly designed: missing info and instructions, erroneus assignments/dates; she clearly had not gone through the material and had copy/pasted from a previous semester. Grading return time awful (over 6 weeks). Disaster of an online course.",0
Mr D is the best! lectures a lot but you dont even need to take notes because he goes over every question to the test a few days prior. homework is jusy busy work and he grades really fairly. get ready for a 10 page paper! you get to pick your topic so choose wisely. He is a lot of fun and i will be taking 2 more classes of his in the spring,1
"Teaches Research methods and makes it fun. Pay attention and go to class or you'll miss something and be derailed for a while. She moves fast but answers all questions and will take extra time if you need it.  Exams are very tough but ensure you know EVERYTHING and you'll do fine. Lots of work in this class, don't slack!",1
"Professor Birch is a lovely professor. She is always on time and prepared for lectures, very knowledgeable about international business, and she is always willing to clarify issues and take opinions from the class. The class was rather easy, only three exams but the third one is optional, no homework, and assignments are few but very fun. Awesome!",1
SOOO BORING! This class is a joke. If you passed the 2nd grade you don't need this class. It focuses on critical thinking. Do not take her unless you like to sleep in class.,0
"terrible professor, very unprofessional and mean. doesn't tell you exactly what he wants. don't recommend him",0
"Easy A, but the class was pointless. Didn't learn a single thing. She gets off track way to easily in lectures. Exams are just the review questions she posts on blackboard. Class should have just been completely online instead of meeting one day a week. You don't even need the book. ",0
"She is very passionate, which makes the students follow along during lecture. I recommend!!!!",1
"Okay teacher, very talkative. Good at teaching the material, although sometimes he talks down to his students.",1
"The class itself if so easy.  All you have to do is read some ancient story and then he'll discuss it in the next class period. There are mini quizzes everyday which are simple. All you do is watch movies. He cracks down on all cell phone usage, even though his goes off all the time. Wont let you leave until he dismisses you.",0
"Meyer makes you think his class is really easy throughout the quarter, but then he's really obscure about how he grades. Basically, the only feedback I got was A/A- on the midterm and then he dropped an A- on me for the quarter even though I participated and was in class every day.",0
"Tove isn't very clear during her lectures and when you ask a question she gets easily confused and makes it ten times worse. The lectures are long and dry. She's an easy grader though, but just be prepared to teach yourself.",0
"After grading essays, he doesn't point out the mistakes you made. He expects you to use your rubric and compare it to your essay to find your OWN mistakes. Letting him review your essay before the due date does not always help. barely learn the correct way to write at college level. you are basically teaching yourself. A VERY TOUGH GRADER!!!!",0
"Anyone that can make Plato, Aristotle and Cicero interesting has to be doing something right. VERY easy to talk to and always willing to lend a hand. (And yes, easy on the eyes as well). Grades are based on 2 papers and essay tests. Grading was a little on the hard side, but well worth it. Best class I've taken thus far.",1
Class is very long! Very often was not able to get through lecture material and a lot of writing. Class was very interesting but just not a class I'd recommend to take with a full course load.,0
"Prepare to do a lot of research if you take this class. This professor did provide feedback on the graded work, but even with the feedback, I was still uncertain why some forums were marked down and others were not. The tests and assignments are very time-consuming and work-intensive.  Overall, it was a difficult and frustrating class.",0
"Avoid at all costs. Refused to answer students questions on designated exam review days, because he ""didnt know if the questions would work out"". Lectures last an average of 20 minutes",0
He shows up about 5 minutes late everyday.,0
If you don't do great in this class it's because you didn't read any reading and/or are just lazy. There is no reason that anyone should finish with a grade lower than a B.,1
Professor Gray loves what she does but in my opinion she is not the best professor even though a lot of people love her.  She just lectures and has power points that have endless slides.  She often rambles and gets off topic and her tests are extremely hard.  The tests never have anything she taught in class.  Try to avoid her for this class.,0
he was okay i wouldn't recommend him if you speak absolutely no Spanish. hes boring too,0
"I took my first Chem course and got a C, after reading some reviews I tried again with Professor McDougal in a 5 week summer course and got an A! There isn't another professor who cares as much about the success of their students, he does everything in his power to make sure you understand the material. He also answers emails almost immediately!",1
"This class reminds me of high school. It's so straight forward and required the minimum amount of work and effort. Professor Suggs is a cool guy and is really passionate about the topic, but I couldn't help but zone out anyway. 100% recommend taking for a gen-ed. Easy A.",1
Marek is the worst thing that has happened to the education system since the attack on Columbine. His grasp of English is so poor you spend more time deciphering his mumblings than you do taking notes. He seems very ill-informed on the subject matter and generally spends more time confusing himself than teaching us anything.,0
"This teacher is very easy, however, he has a lot of ""war stories"" that he shares time and time again.  THese stories are generally related to the class and are interesting, however, I found them interesting.  I recommend this intructor.",1
"Some political science concepts can be difficult to understand, but Professor Dynes does a great job at breaking them down and explaining them. He genuinely cares about his students' success and gives great feedback. His exams are more about understanding and applying concepts than memorizing random facts and I really loved that about his class.",1
"One of my first Professors at Harper. She is amazing. Her homework and lectures are straight. i.e you will get an A if you learn. If you can't pass the class or find programming is too difficult, I suggest you shouldn't take higher-level CS classes after CSC121. Take time to practice and learn more.",1
"This Professor is OK, but finding out when assignments are due, what needs to be done for them, and those details, are not able to be found online, or in his syllabus. I wouldn't recommend this class. It's really hard as a three hour, and most people spend the time on Facebook the class is so boring.",0
I really liked him. He is very down to earth and the class was very interesting. Only a couple papers and a final group project. Class field trip was fun too.,1
He is very unclear about his papers. The class is really hard and very boring.  He grades really difficult.  You have to pay attention in class to do good on quizzes but a lot of the questions on the quizzes aren't from the readings.,0
"LA is an amazing prof!  she is super helpful and explains things amillion times until you understand it.  She always makes herself available for help if you need it.  If you have to take research methods, take it with Leslie Anne!!!",1
"Although this is probably the most boring class I've been to in my life and he nor the TA were any help at all, It was a fairly easy class. I wrote a book report, about a book that he wrote, and I literally read the first two pages. I made and 88, so if that doesn't say how easy this class is I don't know what does.",0
"The class gets progressively harder over time. The first exam is easy and the second one is a little bit harder. Then, she gives a final exam that is a conceptual advanced statistical final that is worth 40% of your grade. She is weasely and makes you think the class is easier than it is in the end.",0
"Really straightforward class. Log into zoom and keep your camera on and you're good. Quizzes like once a week and they're 10 multiple choice questions, but the camera and mic are on! Honestly as long as you read the quizzes are easy, and even if you blow it you get two attempts and he counts the higher grade.",1
"Professor Hart was very scattered.  She never showed up to class on time.  She would make up our assignments during class, and would change topics frequently.  There was a lot of reading assignments and discussions involved.  Many small assignments could help your grade if you knew what she wanted.  A long paper was the bulk of your grade.",0
She really doesn't care about anything or anyone except for her PUENTE program.,0
"Positives: She is a great professor, she gives good feedback on work and requires you to put some effortdetail in your work. Provides an opportunity to speak to students from other countries.  Negatives: The assignments may become to repetitive or extensive at times.  Definetly need the book. ",1
"I signed up for a different professor and for some reason they gave me him I sat there for a day and was already unimpressed he's very rude doesn't listen to what you have to say, puts you on the spot first hand speaking Spanish if your not good at Spanish don't take him.",0
Sweet person. She grades hard on papers so do them well in advance and/or look over them thoroughly. Some of the material is boring and some is really interesting. She is really invested in students doing well. Overall interesting class but a decent challenge.,1
"I took her for MAC 1106 and I passed her class with an A, she gives really long reviews, but if you complete them, then her tests are really easy, most people never did the reviews, and that is why they failed. She does have a strong accent, but she is still a good teacher.",1
"Literally lectures off-topic the entire course. Always mentions ""if it were up to me the corporate tax would be 0%, that way all the people sitting on their couch, drawing checks, would have some jobs"", and always says something about robots taking over at least once each class. I would recommend finding a diff prof",0
"This teacher is a ray of hope for education in this country. He's not like the majority of the educators who only come in for a paycheck. He is there to teach you a subject, not have you pass a test, and he does a great job doing so. I failed my first applied calculus class, and knew nothing go in, Passed his with a B+ Great teacher",1
SHE ROCKS! quizzes are easy and test are easy. Midterm and Final I both got an A on. I had a 92.5% in her class and she bumped me up to an 93% so I could get an A in the course. I would take her with no doubt!!,1
In all honesty Ted is a nice guy but a terrible teacher.  He struggles to explain the material and makes it very challenging for students.  To survive in this course you have to teach yourself the material in order to succeed.  ,0
"Cynthia is an amazing teacher. I heard people in the class complain about how much reading you have to do for homework, 2 times a week you read an article and answer about 10 questions on it, but it's a 400 level class so it's not as bad I expected it to be. She's very helpful and wants you to succeed, very energetic also and keeps you engaged",1
"Dr. Graham is one of the best teachers I've had. He explains things in a clear fashion, often explaining in a "" how I would do it"" fashion. Never shoots down students ideas or questions, but explores them. Lots of pop quizzes, but you are able to opt out of them if you want. He does not assign homework either. I highly recommend that you take him.",1
I loved this class. I thought it'd be a boring class but Mr. Becker made it interesting. He really knows History. He explains it perfectly WELL and CLEARLY! As long as you do the work on time and participate you got an A. He's very calm & polite. He cares that everyone learns & shows the same respect to everyone. Highly recommend him!,1
She is amazing. She is very helpful. She goes over what is going to be on the exams to the T. I would definitely take her again if i had to.,1
"You have to submit a thoughtful response on 3 pieces of literature each week. That was a lot of work. She posts a video lecture each week (usually a few days early) - watch them and take notes. Read the Essay Writing for Students text to help write essays. The essays were short, but you have to earn your mark. She always responds to emails promptly",1
"Read the text on your own easier to understand. Nice person, boring teacher. Could have been a great subject if it was more interesting and engaging. Assignments not clearly explained, expectations and course content could be explained better. Lost interest in subject.",0
Wouldn't recommend this professor.. Dry boring lectures and exams did not correlate to anything we did. Quizzes were nearly impossible. Do not take this professor unless you are very skilled in acct,0
"I dont know what he is like in person but his online class sucks. He has two sites that for assignments which can be confusing, and no notifications for when he makes a new assignment. For due dates some quizzes don't have a due date while others do which is misleading. Also you don't know if a certain assignment has a due date until it is too late",0
"very bad at explaining the material that he presents in the slides and on the board.  Very monotone, and even sitting in the front row, you can almost fall asleep and the class seems like eternity.  If you can do the homeworks 100% then you will do very well on the exam.",0
"I am not great at math. Anytime a question was asked he would explain it in the same way, he wouldn't dumb it down. He said the gist and that was it, if you don't have a question right away he moves on. Pay close attention, be prepared to go to tutoring if you're not great at math.",0
"Nicest teacher ever. She was very understanding and very flexible. Homework had lots of writing and she gives a good amount of class work and projects. She is pretty clear about expectations but make sure you pay attention when she is going over projects, homework, etc. Usually accepts late work, easy A as long as you do your work.",1
i called him professor fidel nicastro all semester.  the online homework is terrible.  a lot of memorization cause he doesnt give you the equations you actually need.  huge curve at the end becuase everyone fails.  he gets really pissed off if the class doesnt answer questions so just hope theres someone who knows what they are doing.,0
"He was my professor for the animal psychology research lab. He definitely tells you how it is and may demand a lot, but he is also very understandable and personable if you have a working relationship with him. He is extremely well versed in his discipline and I  would HIGHLY recommend learning from him.",1
"She's so bad that she doesn't deserve an explanation, just take my word for it and don't take her classes. Spare yourselves.",0
"The best professor that I have had at Rutgers. The best. Super friendly, easy to talk to, always open to personal help outside. He's understanding about any individual problem you may have...always takes your opinions seriously. Above all a great person. Take his class.",1
Always seemed to be doing homework for his class. Most homework I have had in any class in my first 3 years. Considering this is a 100 level course I was not impressed.,1
Shes DOES NOT put grades online at all. She said she isnt going to.. maybe once we switch to canvas. Do the quizzes before the tests to get an A,1
"Class notes are scattered like the lectures.  He can't stay on point and jumps info all over the place.  Took his class for part of my nursing, no nursing info was taught.  I don't know anything more than when I started except about fermentation which he must like.",0
I took him for all my accounting classes at NOVA. Loved his lectures and explanations. Since the classes are usually small he is very open to questions and will take time to help you understand. As long as you pay attention in class and do the homework the tests are incredibly easy. I would definitely recommend over all other professors.,1
"Rambles on lectures and jumps around topics. Most things we did or he talked about didn't tie into the topic we were on. Don't have to take notes, won't know what to note down. Even though i didn't really learn much, easy A just do the study guide and study it. Can make up tests. If you want to really learn A&P take someone else otherwise very easy",0
"takes a while to get used to teaching style. professor expect students to understand basic trigonometry and algebra (tests and homework are heavily based on this knowledge). tests are hard, but he often drops the lowest quiz and replace the lowest test with the final. good luck to those who takes his class! a lot of tears went along with my journey",1
"Will is an entertaining lecturer. I was always engaged in class. However, the way the class is set out... prepared to be confused. He will give you 7 readings, and a podcast, and youtube videos, that need to be reviewed before class. Knowing what is important is difficult. Also, he refuses to answer my emails. Actually, my TA has yet to respond.",1
all im gonna say is that the mean exam scores were in the low 40's for the ENTIRE CLASS. Highest was in the 50's.,0
had him for 201. it sucked. especially for a class that you're only taking to get your art credit out of the way. multiple chapters of homework due every Sunday.,0
"Honestly one of the worst profs Ive had. Extremely boring and using most of class time for unecessary discussion time between students. Feels like there isnt enough criteria for her to teach, so she needs to fill the time through wasting it. Beware of pop quizzes. She is also very very hard to understand, regardless of how slow she talks. Quiet.",0
"she aight, likes astronomy",1
"A tough class, but a great teacher. Definitely a satisfying challenge.",1
Not very good ,0
Very bad teacher!,0
Jackie is the best teacher ever ! She is the best teacher ever ! Shes SUPER FAMOUS cause of her kindness and always respect her students. She always makes me feel so thrilled every time I attended in the class. She makes me feel like I WANT TO ATTEND TO THE CLASS. Thats the truth. She gave us so many games n if u pass it u will get HW PASS ��,1
"Overall a nice enough guy. Problem is his lectures are very dry, to say the least, and his grading mechanisms are quite flawed. You will more than likely be teaching yourself the material. The one good thing is what he teaches and gives in assignments is essentially the tests.",0
I did not like the fact that I couldn't understand her with her accent so it was very frustrating. I am good at math and I couldn't do it so I had to drop her class and get a better professor.,0
Take this class! SO easy only 3 essays and an optional one. class never went longer than a half an hour we were in the computer lab so you can just play on a computer the whole time. He accepts any excuse to miss class. No homework no final. I hate english and didnt care and still got  C+. If you are a slacker like me and just want to pass take him,1
Neely is monotone and his class is done through video lecture. That is a terrible combination. A 100-500 word response on what you learned that week is due every week and he is not clear on what should be included AT ALL! Don't bother emailing him because he will be defensive and rude if you do not understand the requirements. Don't waste your time,0
Worse teacher ever. Very good at math but shes terrible at explaining the work. Super heavy accent as well so its hard to understand her at times,0
"This professor is amazing, you will need a textbook for the worksheets she assigns as homework. Her lectures are really interesting, and she makes it easy to get a good grade. She only gives two essays the entire essay, this class is really easy and entertaining. I highly recommend this class.",1
"DJB is amazing. She makes class super entertaining and worth going to, she is always available and makes extra time to help students and makes every effort to get to know you on a personal level. She explains concepts pretty well and is flexible for homework deadlines. You can't go wrong with DJB, an absolutely solid choice for 311.",1
"She has made so may people i know cry and try to ruin their careers because she has a horrible habit of choosing who she likes and hates. She hates most girls. She has always been great to me, but when she treats my peers so poorly its hard to think she's genuine.",0
"Mescioglu is a great professor.  He is always willing to help outside the classroom, before & after class. His homework is just like the examples we go over in class.  Just come to class every day and take good notes.   He also is a human calculator. Right now, I have over a hundo in the class.  Study the examples &the final you get a cheat sheet.",1
He isn't clear at all. He's an awful teacher. You don't learn anything but the stuff he gives you is already all in French.,0
"We use DataDesk, a program he invented 30 years ago instead of something more modern. His ego is so big we can't use a real stat program since it was made by someone else. Makes it very difficult to get help cause no one knows how to use his program",0
"One of my favourite profs! He explains everything super well, and repeats important information over and over again. He is very helpful when asked questions, and really encourages questions during class. The exam questions are completely predictable, but the marking may be a little unfair at times.",1
"Mrs. Parker is the absolute best teacher I've ever had. She cares about all of her students and really makes the experience overall fantastic by good one-on-one time, as well as overall lectures in class. She is very patient and will work out any problems you have with you so long as you are willing to work hard!",1
Lots of dense proofey material. I took him for the honors 408D-- mistake.,1
"Matt does a great job keeping class interesting, despite the sometimes dull subject matter. I have really enjoyed learning from him and hearing his own personal experience. Definitely would recommend the class for a 150 gen ed.",1
"His tests are easy, but if you  do a small mistake it's ok for him to get nothing. He is not organize at all. It's hard to communicate with him.  When he grade your homework he will focus about some small stuff that will make you get 50% on the homework.",0
Tough grader and does not return emails in a timely manner. Would not take again. Nor would I recommend this proffessor. ,0
"He made class go by quickly and you learned something before you left each week.  There are a lot of visual aids and he is paperless, so everything is available on blackboard (besides your text).  Read the text and pay attention, homework and tests will be very easy.  The HTML project was really fun and made me want to learn even more.",1
"Best professor on campus! Lectures may be a little bit boring, but you do learn a lot. Plus, the exams and papers are easy; minimal studying.",1
"I find it hilarious how a professor can take the longest time to grade a paper yet can send multiple emails saying that any work turned in late will not be graded unless you are in a ""dying situation."" We are currently in a pandemic and she has missed a lot of classes yet can't forgive her students for doing work tardy. Also doesn't check her email",0
"Dont take her, worst prof ever. She single handedly ruined my GPA even though I put most of effort in her class.",0
He gives us a ton of homework thats way harder than what he taught us. Most of the time he doesnt go through a problem completely he just goes through the method in the beginning but then expects you to know exactly what to do after. Hes also a bit passive aggressive when someone tries to be smart or asks a question.,0
"ECON 227 was a train wreck on the administration side (lost exams, grades never coming back, etc.), but KMack cares a lot about his students. If you go to class and put in enough practice before his exams, you're very likely to get an A (plus you get to hear his awesome bagpipe playing at the end of each semester :D ).",1
"Heather Hug Robbins was a little odd. She described herself as an award winning teacher. I did not see it. She used sexual analogies to discuss content, which was strange. She gave 100 point exams and a 200 point cumulative final. The final can ruin your grade. A 200 point final does not seem to be a good strategy for an award winning instructor.",1
"I have taken a few of his classes, including an online class.  I enjoyed them all.   He is a great instructor who is clearly very educated on the subjects he teaches.",1
"One of the best professors I had at ASU!  Responds to student participation If you don't care about your grade, don't expect a good one. Common sense. The workload is very light-read, blog, show up to class, discuss, open book exams. He's a down-to-earth guy, very helpful, and treats you the same way you treat him.  Highly recommended!",1
"do not take this professor if possible. expect having to teach yourself the material on your own time. feedback is unhelpful, marks down correct answers because you didn't do it ""his"" way.  class average on exams are well below 50%, but that's obviously our fault, right?",0
HORRIBLE PROFESSOR STAY AWAY IF YOU TAKE PRIDE IN YOUR G.P.A! The TA's do all the grading and think they are grading for a PhD Course. Basic information which they make harder than what it should be.   ,0
"This is a HORRIBLE professor! Her tests are way too hard for a principles class, she doesn't allow a formula sheet, will not help you if you go to her office for help. The first test most people scored in the 60's and lower. She completely refuses extra credit or curving grades. This is the second time Ive taken this class...and there will be a 3rd",0
This class was the hardest thing I have done in my life. This class made me very sad and depressed when I thought about it. Definitely prepared me for chem 2 but not sure it was worth the stress.,0
"Professor Rico was excellent, made class really easy. Not much communication since it was online but he was quick to keep us updated and respond to emails. The HW software he uses comes with an etext to take notes so you don't need a physical book. Easy tests, notes were allowed but not the book. About 2-4 things due per week in a summer class.",1
Gives a decent amount of work but instructions and feedbacks are confusing. Lets you resubmit homework if you did it wrong the first time.,1
"17 questions essays to read and 30 words from glossary to know for each exam, and he takes only 3 questions essays and 5 from the glossary. Very hard!",0
He is one of the best professors. He will help you learn and is very easy going.,1
Prof. Jagpal is very brilliant. This class gives you very good understanding of Marketing. Use his book and you will get most out of the teaching. Not an easy class and you need to work with him. Don’t be intimidated to talk. He encourages healthy discussions. He is one of the best professors Rutgers has.,1
"Worst Professor I have ever had. For 1 credit lab, he makes you write 20+ lab reports or else you would pass an 80. Finds anyway to subtract points, gave me a 65 on a 50 page lab report , that took 7+ hours to write. Avoid him at all costs for any class",0
DO YOURSELF A FAVOR; TURN BACK NOW BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!!!  STAY AWAY!!  DO NOT ENTER!!!  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!,0
Down to earth teacher. Clear teaching methods. Do your homework and study the textbook and you will pass.,1
Louis is a terrible professor. He rants about subjects that aren't relevant to the topic being taught at all.,0
"Was very unclear, and not very willing to work with her students",0
"She doesnt teach the material in class, instead she makes you watch videos at home at teach yourself. Videos have bad audio and do a poor job of teaching the material. Exams were long and difficult, good luck finishing them on time. If you use a different method than the one from the videos, she docks tons of points and accuses you of cheating.",0
"He'd be fine for someone who is into reading, analysis, and writing detailed papers but I was really just out here tryna get my 102 credit. He's a good guy but his grading is pretty tough, his directions are so confusing, and you have to read so much of the textbook. So if you can, don't take him but if you're stuck it's not the end of the world.",0
I have tooken Norton for another english class and he is very sweet and understanding. He will accept late work even if he says he will not!!!!,1
"I took three of Prof. Byrne's writing classes, and I was sad that I ran out of courses I could take with him.  He was an excellent writing professor, and he took time to discuss each individual's style. The reading material he assigned was always helpful.  His evaluations of our writing were always fair and honest.  He is one of VU's finest!",1
"I took him for CEE 202 and it was awful. He isn't very helpful, and doesn't post his notes online. The online website we used (WileyPlus) was a hot mess. His tests were also really hard if you've never taken a probability course before. Overall, a very bad experience.",0
Her class is so boring!!!!!! She needs to make this class more interesting!!!!She gives hw which is extra credit towards her exams so I suggest that you do it. The book is very useful. She is very careless about her students and her exams are hard!,0
Bush is definitely the best torts professor at Hofstra,1
She's amazing. Take her class.,1
Great professor. Lets you wear hats in class and use laptops.,1
"Awful teacher. Extremely vague. Says there's no right or wrong way to do an assignment, but when you turn one in, it's not what she wanted. Never gives back papers until you've turned in more assignments with the same mistakes as before since no feedback was provided. Totally ruined my love for writing. Also extremely self absorbed.",0
"Matthew truly cares about the success of his students, as well as the topics he discusses in class. This class was eye opening and I learned a lot about topics I didn't know much about. Matthew created a class community where we felt like we could discuss issues as a class. 10/10 would recommend him.",1
"You have to take responsibility and put some effort into this class, otherwise you won't do well. Listening to the lectures is not enough: you have to read the chapters, take notes, and study. Use flashcards for key concepts: it helps. Daigle is a good professor, and he's willing to work with you, but only if you put forth the effort.",1
"Class is very unorganized to the point where self-researching the quiz/test topics is where I actually learned anything. Tons of topics that are tested on and required to know yet only briefly mentioned in class, so studying for tests became looking up all the given 'key terms' on wikipedia. Lectures skip around and make no cohesive sense.",0
Professor is very passionate about his subject. Gives ALL test questions before test you just have to find answers...which were still HARD to find! Will still need to put in effort to get A/B range but otherwise not hard. Takes 5 random attendance checks for 5 points each. Not as exciting of material as had expected though. More like Earth science.,1
"Graded by 3 tests which are easy if you know how to do the HW. Didn't just read off the textbook like most math profs here. Had prerecorded lectures which were succinct. If you do the HW and watch the lectures, not too difficult class. HW is testbook questions + is optional. Provides solutions with each HW. Great professor",1
"Tends to focus a bit too much on female students. Also has a nutjob following of ""converted"" students. More like a cult leader than a professor.",0
"Melissa is the saint of all saints, highly recommend taking her class if at all possible.",1
Cool guy!,1
Dr. Fontenot is a very uninvolved professor. He lectures every class period but is essentially saying the same thing every class time. The class also required at least 5 books when I took it. He does not really give clear instructions on tasks and is reluctant to work with students who need help. He does end class early almost every day though.,0
"Not a very good professor, lectures would go off topic and could spend the entire lecture talking about something else. expects you to read the stuff on your own and be prepared for quizzes. took attendance almost every class.",0
This class is not bad at all. He writes down everything that he thinks is important on the board as he goes over it in class. Take good notes and that will be the ultimate study guide for the test. There are no surprises with his tests and he usually offers some extra credit questions on there. It is tempting to skip lectures but don't.,1
"Sara is one of the most amazing women that I've ever met! She is so passionate about what she is teaching and you can tell that she really cares about her students! If you have a little bit of background, you don't have to attend class to get a good grade but I found myself excited to go to class because her lectures so interesting.",1
"Terrifying and bizarre experience. ""Accidentally"" marked my answers wrong throughout the semester and then continuously denied it, repeatedly pretending like they had no idea what I was talking about. One of my exam grades went from a B to an A because of these erroneous deductions. Very, very scary.",0
Taking his online intermediate algebra class is doable even while working full-time. He creates videos which give you the basics and book he uses it helpful. Also forums where students help either is really awesome. I would take him again. Final in person exam you can bring your own 1 page notes. Problems resembled Homework.,1
"This class was terrible. He gives no instructions and just expects you to figure out what is due. He is extremely unorganized and never knows what he is suppose to be doing. For the final paper we had to write a research paper based on a group ""project"". We were not given a rubric or any instructions on what exactly he was looking for. Don't take.",0
Dr. Wang is an okay professor. You probably have to sit in front of the class to understand what she is saying. Her exams are easy if you read the textbook and do the homework.,1
One of the best teachers I have had. Very caring and helpful. Grades fairly.,1
The class is really boring. And he doesn't really teach much besides reading from the book.,0
"If you can't draw, you'll have to compromise. Luckily I could draw very well when I took this class, so it was easy for me to grasp the concepts and execute them well. Skipping class won't get you a failing grade, but you should go to at least listen to his lectures about animation principles and techniques. He's very laid back and easy going.",1
"I did the homework got a couple 6/10 and a couple of 8/10. Failed about 50% of the quizzes, and ended up with a B+. The final is EXTREMELY easy just memorize all previous tests. You have to do the Homework so make sure you get the syllabus and show up for the quizzes on Fridays. You have to show up 15% is clicker Q's",0
"She explains things once to the entire class clearly, if you were not paying attention while she was speaking she does not like to re-explain things. I liked her style of teaching and talking with students.",1
Good person has a passion for music however the class was pretty hard to pass.  If your not into jazz and cant dedicate enough time to listen to it daily you wont do well on the exams. The exams are hard and on top of that they are only 12 to 19 questions so it harder to pass.  Lectures have nothing to do with exam. Reminder this is for MUS108*,0
"A true gem, she definitely cares about her students and their success. She makes learning fun, but GET READY TO READ!!!!!!!!!!!",1
PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF YOUR OWN SAKE DON'T TAKE HIS COURSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO. PLEASE. ,0
"When he gives criteria for essays, double every quantity and you'll get a B, guaranteed, if you ever get a grade back for it. If you can avoid him, do so. Sometimes he won't put due dates on things in canvas just so he can copy paste his format and do the least amount of work then canvas doesn't show you have anything to do. He should be fired.",0
honestly would not recommend her. making me rethink what I want to major in.,0
"She is very knowledgeable and helpful regarding the material.  The problem is she is very inconsistent, and does not follow her syllabus regarding when assignments are due or when to expect an exams. She also loaded on a lot of work that was not in the syllabus near the end of the semester.",0
Show up and take notes and you are good. You have to take notes by hand but it's not bad. He keeps things interesting and fun. I'm not a history person but he made this class very enjoyable.,1
"best in the soc dept, by far",1
Dr. Currier is outrageously helpful! She wants you to do well in her class & will spend extra time w/ you if you need it. VERY knowlegable & approachable.  BUT if you dont seek her help out or bother to read the book then you will NOT do well.  She gives a study guide but honestly I did not find it particularly helpful.  Read the book youll do well,1
"This professor responded quickly to emails and graded quickly. However, She does not provide additional instructions for assignments. So, even though there is a good bit of extra credit, you may end up with ZERO points if you don't complete how she expects it. And if you reach out to ask questions, she is somewhat rude.",0
Don't ever take him. Its a terrible experience.,0
Great teacher. Took the time to explain things and will take as long as you need to understand a topic. Will go over things before a test if anyone has questions. All tests were open book(take notes of steps and example questions) and if you have perfect attendance he will drop your lowest test grade.,1
Took her for my 1st and 2nd econ class online. She responds to emails quickly and always answered all my questions. As long as you do your work you will like her. If you turn in late assignments or try to skim by without doing any work she is NOT the teacher for you. You will learn in her class :),1
"DIfficult class, make sure to write down everything he puts up on the board and always do the vocabulary and maps. Go to his office hours if you need help, he will help you with anything. Great guy.",1
Not a good experience at all.,0
I am a full time student and employee. I have test anxiety and this professor is patient. He will let me sit in on other lectures if I miss any. As well as is flexible with letting me take tests later on(and I haven't even told him about my anxiety). He is very nice. He isn't one of those professors who takes a bad day out on you. Very proffesional,1
"AWFUL, BORING, puts you to sleep, tests are confusing",0
In my entire collegiate career (15 years) By far the worst math teacher ever. Goes entirely too fast for those of us who are learners by doing. Skipping steps is not a good idea for calculus (the algebra is just as important). Be ready to teach your self the course. Exams are nothing like the book or his lectures. He gets a zero from me!,0
"I loved his classes! I have taken a few classes with him. The class online is easier due to it being only 3 exams online take him open book. EASY-A both times I took his classes, but his online POS2041 class is easier. Highly recommend, don't believe the haters, ask around.",1
"dr workman is a passionate professor who cares about your understanding and application of theory. when he is at his best, he will give you great feedback on your papers and presentations. listens to you outside of class. a very real dude. also funny",1
"Pros: Relaxed class atmosphere, Seems to remember every student, good looking Cons: Unorganized, Used NYTimes as a primary textbook, Unclear with little to none feedbacks, No grading criteria, gives you final semester grade without ever grading any of our papers, Doesn't seem to plan out what he's going to lecture",1
"He is the best Torts professor. He is a little crazy, but he makes the class interesting and clear. You will know what he wants in the final, and you will learn torts with him. Great professor!",1
"Be attentive, read all assignments, answer all points, do discussion posts by extra credit deadline, use GroupMe app for group interaction, be organized. Its tough but doable. His feedback is excellent. Assignments are clear. Great professor & supportive. You put in the work, you get the grade. 21 extra credit points. Fun & interesting class.",1
"Boring and not stimulating at all. Having the class at 9 AM doesn't help, but I don't want to pay money to hear her drone the book for an hour. I was just hoping for more.",1
terry is worth more than cfa would ever like to admit. i've never once seen him irrational. everything he does is because he cares his students and because he cares about making great music. he is more than just an amazing musician. he's a genuine person. anyone who takes the time to really learn from him knows how great he is.,1
"Ratana tries his best & I respect that, but he still falls way short of being an effective professor for 229. This was his first time teaching 229 so I can only hope this was a result of inexperience of teaching this course. His lectures are unclear, unorganized, & he made frequent mistakes. He also posted our full names next to our grades & IDs",0
This professor is great. She has very clear grading criterea and if you have any questions you can always ask and she will gladely clarify. She takes attendance but she is very lenient. Overall she is awesome and I would take her again! 2 easy tests 2 easy debates and 2 projects.,1
"Professor Smith is a fantastic lecturer and a very funny guy. You have to do the reading and there is plenty of it, but his tests are very straightforward. He is the best professor teaching the 104 series.",1
Best Class Ever!! Just a Midterm and Final. It is just three essay questions with a minimum of 12 pages. The questions are very broad and easy to go way over the 12 page mark because you have to relate it back to your family and self. He will only keep you for an hour tops in a 3 hour night class. TAKE HIM!!!!!!!!!!,1
"Very very nice man, but terrible professor. He does not know how to teach physics at all. Tries to be helpful, but is terrible at explaining things. Lecture heavy! Not much practice with equations, but thats what the exams are on.",0
"This professor is great, I took him for intro and was the best thing I thing. I really learned biology from him he loves what he does. Drops the lowest grade and gives good study guides. I got an A and learned a lot from his class, which there were more professors like him in here!",1
"Professor Schlorrt was a great teacher. He is a bit of a tough grader, but it helps you in the long run. His classes are very interesting, don't be afraid to ask questions. He is more than willing to help you before or after class, you just have to put the time and effort in. Keep up with the reading, and take good notes to pass the class!",1
He literally expects you to understand the readings like that... He doesn't;t explain well in his lecture video he gives out... he uses words that are highly unintelligible & expects us to write ESSAYS EVERY DAY about the lectures most of us are so unaware of! Super disappointed because I expected to have another professor to have but I'm done.,0
Mr. Luckett is a very arrogant and close minded professor. He refuses to venture outside the book thus making him one dimensional. very little assignments but he grades those assignments as if he was grading a paper due for nationals. Miss one step on his discussion rubric? expect a big ol fat 40 for the grade. i would recommend to stay away.,0
"Yvonne is the absolute worst professor in the Art Department. She doesn't trust that you are honest or dedicated, even if you show up and work hard in every class. Her assignment instructions are not instructions at all and her feedback is completely nonsensical. She will try to make your work fit her style instead of clearly outlining expectations",0
Keeps class interesting and remains unbiased. Easily my favorite class and professor that I have experienced. 10/10 would recommend,1
Dr. Rolls is a great Music Theory teacher. He works to make sure each student understands and passes. He is more than willing to meet outside of class to help you and work individually with you. We also have Saturday review classes where he gives up his time for an hour and if you want to go you can.,1
1 word  HORRIBLE. Never take an art with this prof. Its just beyond so many quizzes and the tests will make you fail trusttt me! If your going to take online get ready to literally memorize and study 9 hours a day 63hrs a week to get ( C ) even if ur good at tough majors.. she will never teach you.. This art class is horrible so No for me.,0
"Basically it was like he was speaking a different language. Him and his ""games"" were a waste of time. I just stopped going and went off what I learned in HS and passed. Get Busch instead, the difference is like night and day.",0
"She doesn't try to help you when you need it.She graded an assignment I turned in 2x by mistake 2 completely different grades, A AND C!It seemed liked the more questions I tried to ask,the worse my grades were!When I told her I was going to speak to the Dean, she said she would report me 1st and it would get me no where because she was the teacher.",0
"Very clear and simple assignments, but tests are lengthy and more difficult.  Very worth getting the good grade.",1
"The professor is very kind and always pauses class to ask for questions. Unless you are interested in the subject, the class is very boring. You spend most of the class/semester looking at weather maps on pressure and temperature. Try and make friends at the beginning of the semester because at the end of the semester you have a giant group project",1
"BOB IS SO FREAKING COOL! HES HELPFUL AND FUNNY.. HE GIVES A TON OF XTRA CREDIT AND HIS CLASS IS OK, BUT THERES A LOT MATH REQUIRED THATS THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES THE CLASS DIFFICULT.. IF YOUR GOOD AT MATH YOU SHOULD GET AN EASY A!",1
"Yes, she can be a very tough grader on final assignments, but she offers plenty of opportunities to correct mistakes before submitting work. She is very understanding and very down-to-earth.",1
"Really liked Dr. Kroll. A little hard, but as long as you ALWAYS show up for class, and do all of the work as best as you can, you will do fine. Really likeable guy, and I highly recommend his course!",1
"I was excited to take this class but Prof. Peters quickly changed that for me. The tests were so long and extremely difficult, almost impossible to get an A on regardless of how much you studied. Lectures were very long and dry because she read off her power points word for word. Felt like I was in high school again with the forced participation.",0
Brent is the most talented professor in the Interactive media department... seriously look up his reel. He's so humble and nice that you'd never guess theamazing things he's worked on. If you talk to him one on one he's got great insight about the industry. Best teacher ever!,1
late marker. had to self learn course.,0
"There wasn't much clarity for when things were due. She did not follow her syllabus at all. Moody most days, she would often bring stress with her to the classroom. At times she seemed very sarcastic, & condescending. She was often scrambled, and forgetful so DOCUMENT EVERYTHING U DO. Would I choose again; NO. Perk? No final if you had 90% or more.",0
"Nice lady, but she is not a good prof. Takes days to respond to emails, and it is very difficult in general reaching out to her outside of class, even when she has office hours. The group project is challenging, and I don't recommend her as a prof.",0
As a counselor shes inspired me to change CCs and has shown me why ARC has a transfer rate of only 7% She is late to every meeting 20+ min It turns out Ive been taking classes that arent even transferrable She recommends you change majors because her gf is unhappy in the career youre after & she claims to have not gotten your emails Worst experien,0
"I was one of the last two taking the final exam, when he walked to his TA and started talking about how easy the test was and how bad everyone was doing. Yes, while students are still taking it... Try concentrating while being made to feel stupid by someone who is suppose to be professional. Long story short I didn't do well and went from C to D.",0
Do not take her! Avoid at all cost!,0
"Best Instructor I ever had. Can't say enough good. Sometimes had class at Coffee shops, and in Uban Min. Met at them alot.",1
This rating has been removed as per our site guidelines.,0
"She's a very nice teacher, offers office hours everyday. She wants you to do good, if you do the homework, study, and pay attention (as you should in every class) you'll do good. The way she grades the tests are a little harsh but overall they aren't hard.",1
"He's good at explaining the concepts of French but he is arrogant.  If you ask him a simple question he speaks down to you.  Great prof, terrible people skills and personality.",0
"He is the best teacher ever. If you want to learn, you should take this class. ",1
"During the first few days of this class I was a little worried. Mathi can be hard to understand at first, but you will get used to her accent. She was a really great teacher! I will be taking her again for math 141 next quarter. Homework was optional but I highly recommend doing it. She also gave lots of extra credit out. She about your grade!",1
"I went into Elementary Logic not knowing what to expect. The first day started and I was terrified. But after a while I realized that the material isn't that hard at all. Prof. Ehring is extremely helpful, even spending whole class periods to go over homework. Another plus is that he constantly has the class laughing with his dorky jokes.",1
"I am not sure how she still teaches this class. Her tests were made up of pieced together google tests and EVERY test there were correction errors and sometimes she said ""I would have to google it."".. I CAN GOOGLE IT!  Her study guides were not what you were tested on. Does offer extra credit via corrected tests",0
"If you have her for UI100 RUN!!! This was supposed to be an easy class but we had 2-4 worksheets of homework every day. The projects were also difficult. She wrote her own ""workbook"" you have to use almost your whole printing money to print out and then fill out the pages. We also had to recite these weird pledges to her at the beginning of class..",0
This prof is totally awesome! Amazing teacher!,1
"I mean.. i thought she is very easy at first because i took her class before and then i passed easily. However, if you slack, you can fail. Because she gives you very confusing feedback on your paper. She always says your creative ideas are really good but, she can fail you on very end of the papers.",0
He is really cool,1
"He was okay, wouldn't recommend unless you like teaching yourself - he skips a lot of steps and has a heavyish accent. Also very inconsistent grader and teacher (super tough on me and refused to provide answers meanwhile he was so ""sweet"" to other students). Only plus was there was no homework assignments/quizzes, only exams (3).",0
She gives a lot of reading and very long videos to watch and u have no time to do it because there is another assignment given in 3 days. She opens the assignments 3 days before. I advise you not to take this class while you are taking 3 or more other classes. She doesnt give good feedback and asking her about your grade is a waste of time.,0
VERY BORING! Avoid him if you can and use high school calc notes. I only took Pre Calc and they was more helpfull than anything he could offer!,0
This lady is NUTS! Avoid taking this course with her if you can! Take my advice please! You will be better off taking this course with somebody else!,0
"Great professor! Kind, caring, understanding. Wants you to succeed.",1
"The class is very fast paced. There is an online system used for all practice, certification homework and exams. Prof. Serikova is available to help you outside of class if you need help. She will work with you and come up with a plan if needed to help you pass the class. She is aslo very encouraging .",1
"DIFFICULT. DOESNT USE POWER POINTS VERY MUCH. KINDA JUST RAMBLES MAKING IT HARD TO REALLY KNOW WHAT TO STUDY, OVERALL HE ISNT TOO BAD,",0
"I'm not sure about the course IRL but online it was terrible. The entire course was automated (all assignments, quizzes, and lectures were uploaded from the start) and the only way we could contact our teacher was through email. Lectures were missing information so the class basically came down to reading the textbook and then doing the quizzes",0
Shes full of false promises.Took her my freshman year and she wasnt being too honest about the grades she said she will give us and the grades she gave us.I dobt think she is very friendly to ethnic minorities if you know what i mean.,0
GPA killer . During this whole pandemic he didnt care at all. Homework Heavy and doesnt know how to teach. Constantly tells us if we where to read the textbook we wouldnt be doing this poorly. If your trying to get an easy A because of this pandemic run away. He doesnt curve and changed up everyone's exam so no Cheating.,0
It was an easy A and only had 2 tests and research paper that I got a 100 on because I do not think she even read it. She does take attendance every class. I did not learn that much and was able to do my other work during that class. Do not take her class if you actually want to learn about child and adolescent development.,0
"Ms. Burd is a very good profesor! She is always willing to help and her tests are simple if you study her study guides.  Lecture is sometimes boring because she reads directly from power point.  Overall, great professor!",1
Professor Lombardo was definitely one of my best professors! He made ITE very enjoyable.  He's always there for you if you have questions and replies to emails within minutes. His paperless style is easier for students and the projects/ assignments that are assigned are pretty cool too. I definitely would recommend his class!  +a relaxed atmosphere,1
"Love Professor Sexton. In her lab right now and doing very well. She uses powerpoints and you have a quiz every week. I plan to take her again for AP2 lab if she teaches it. If nothing else, I would take her just to look at! She is beautiful!",1
"Literally the worst professor I have ever experienced. Thank the heavens she isn't going to be teaching again. Mary Lou was 10x better, make phonetics great again. Shen is rude, doesn't know how to teach and even barked at a student for asking too many questions",0
"Seemed like a cool guy which I think he can be, tough grader for being a non art major course. Grading criteria not clear and gives feedback at the last minute.",0
He's one of the best teacher i ever had. i wish he teach other subjects. Also he's very cute. Any one thinking on taken him should!!!,1
"Not present during any of the lectures, very hands off, didn't really provide any support. When I was struggling, I was told to try and rely on outside sources aside from lectures and the book. Single assignments would end up taking 4-5 hours because none of it was thoroughly explained in the lectures. Midterm and Final had questions not covered.",0
"would rather take 3 classes of biology and do a ton of research papers than to take this teacher again, can't explain the material well enough and doesn't give tests that are relevant to the classes point of material covered, students beware...",0
"I am not saying anything bad about his character, he is a nice guy, but this class for a gen ed is way over the top. There are 3 test, an essay, and a presentation. You also have to watch a film every week which most people do not have the time for and participation is graded so harshly. I do not recommend this class",0
"dont know what these people are talking about. Hard professor, if you are not those one or two students who answer every question do not take",0
"Wei is not a good ""professor"" and is too full of herself. She is spiteful towards her students and does not give a crap about them, uses them as a means to an end. Lectures are unclear, not very helpful outside of class, and is an unpleasant person. She also loves to complain about how UW students are lazy.",0
"She has a very thick Russian accent, can be very difficult to understand at times. If you plan on missing class much, she isn't the professor for you.",1
"Terrible professor. Extremely unprofessional, pushed off big assignments for ones that didnt matter as much. She has a lot of experience to share with you, but is very close minded & not open to other view points. IMPOSSIBLE to contact outside of class and not very accommodating. Inconsistent grading.",0
Hard grader (very hard to get a A on anything). Teaching style is very dry and makes it hard to keep focus and learn from lectures. Troys to cram too much information into such a small amount of time.,0
"Dr. Butler is certainly a great professor! She is very funny and caring towards all of her students. Attending lecture will make learning the material easier, but it is not mandatory. Also, she posts review worksheets online that will help her students prepare for each quiz and exam. Very helpful, would love to take again!",1
As long as you watch the videos he posts you can pass the class with an A without ever using the book.,1
"do not take this class I repeat do not take this if he is the instructor , really horrible grader , doesn't try to help, talks around the point and can never be straight forward.",0
"I do recommend Dr. Corona, she had been there for me when I do strugle at her class, specially if you strugle with your english!!",1
DIDNT LEARN ANYTHING!!!>..she thinks she's the smartest person on earth. With her water bottle and fake smiles....She will fail you ..if you sit and understand everthing...u need to stay after school and suck her toes just to get a D,0
"My man Dr. Hazell was the best professor I've ever met. His tests stem DIRECTLY from his stunning and electrifying lectures! I'm not that much of a history gal, but he made it so interesting and made me actually want to come to class. There is no homework other than reviewing notes, and there's only one paper! Amazing professor 10/10.",1
pam does a nice job with examples of what she is teaching.  she gets you excited about what you are doing and realizes we have lives outside of school.  she is tough on grading but it is worth the work.  i recommend her if you really want to enjoy your class,1
"This is the most disappointing class you can take. The assignment requirement was not clearly stated. He is a very subjective marker, and you'd better write something which can fit his political opinions. Unapproachable outside the class, he refused to talk to students in person unless you have something he thinks time-worthy.",0
Uniteresting,0
"This was one of the most interesting classes I've ever had. He's intimidating at first but all he asks is that you come to class ready to discuss the reading. He wasn't fond of testing and only had a midterm and a final, and made both pretty simple. Very interesting and engaging; recommended if you don't mind reading!",1
Sweetha is the sweetest professor Ive ever had. She really cares about her students and wants to make sure they succeed. She goes through each experiment thoroughly and makes sure every student understands the information. Hope I get her again next semester!!,1
"Bias information presented without any acknowledgement of different socioeconomic views. Very limited experience as an 1 of the 2 black   .  In class. Poor representation of the black family, overall discouraging and unhelpful. Grading structure is vague and unpredictable. Consider a different course.",0
"I took this class since the Holocaust is one of my main interests. The class should have been easy for me. However, she goes way too fast for anyone taking notes by hand to write anything down and doesn't like to see anything through anyone else's eyes. She has no formal grading system and is of little to no help on the one paper assignment we get.",0
"Dr. Hollis is a very chill professor. But, his class is very hard. Extremely hard. His tests cover very minute detail from the lectures and they are plentiful. There is a lot to be graded by, which is a blessing and a curse. It helps that there's a cushion for your grades but you also cannot miss class since there is a quiz every Tuesday over Thurs",1
"Not the best professor to start my 1st math class at LBCC. If you ask for help he'll laugh at your face. He teaches his material extremely fast and its hard to catch up. Basically, be prepared to teach yourself using math lab. The notes he gives out are super hard to understand and grading is harsh. Be prepared to go over 3 sections every meeting.",0
"She's really intelligent, but takes English way too seriously than it is. Made us stay in class for the entire 1HR 15MIN for just an English class, was quite annoying. Quite a tough grader, and does not accept work late. If you want to take a more relaxed class to get an easy A, definitely not hers. Don't go to class late, she'll mark you down. ",1
Need I say more read down the page. She is the only one that teaches it at LSC-Montgomery. She cancelled a week of classes before the final emailed us the study guide was online. Get to the final we have a substitute and the review is nothing like the test. This is representative of the disaster the entire class was.,0
Very Helpful,1
I recommend to not take any classes by him. He is such a tough grader in classes that are intro and expects you to know everything about the topic. Let alone he lists his criteria and if you follow it at best you would get 3/10 he expects you to go above and beyond. Most people end up failing his class or devoting all their time to it.,0
A very caring professor. Will make sure you understand the content and will try guiding you down the best path,1
"Professor Bazil is one of the worst professors I have ever had. He is disorganized, does not follow the syllabus, and does not answer emails. He is not clear on what is expected and does not answer questions so its a guessing game majority of the time. Making an A should not have been a problem, but due to his disorganization it was impossible.",0
this course is very tough. Don is really funny and great guy but not the best for finance. I worked my butt off and showed up to every class and the exam had a lot of stuff we didn't learn and a lot of students were very disappointed. the material needs to be reviewed for this class. makes you feel good about not doing the best lol,0
"FSE intro to engineering easy class, he has an accent but its not a problem, you dont need to go to the lecture to learn. grades leniently",1
"Worst Teacher EVER! Not recommended of your trying to learn something. He doesn't care for his students and he is super arrogant. I turned all assignments in and received a bad grade, even though I have always had talent in writing. He is what I call a hater. A total jerk and the most self centered teacher I've ever had. Total fail ! I REGRET IT ! ",0
Great Teacher that knows his stuff.,1
Mr. Luckett's teaching is thorough and matter of fact.   He is extremely knowledgable and expects you to learn the material he dictates.   His passion for Social Work is evident in his teaching style.  I learned a lot in his class.  I loved the structured outline of his class. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone.,1
"I was in a 3-hour long lecture and I did not learn anything. He gives and outrageous amount of reading and does not make sure that you genuinely understand the information. He isn't  very concerned with how you do in his class and takes attendance randomly by asking students to answer questions. It's a boring, frustrating class, would not suggest.",0
DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR FOR STATISTICS. MAKES YOU TAKE WRITTEN TEST THAT TAKES UP MAJORITY OF THE TEST TIME AND IS EXTREMELY BORING.,0
Midterm is the biggest pain ever.  Don't take this class.,0
"Nice lady, but DO NOT take the class. Even if its the only finance class left open don't take it. It's not worth it, half the class fails her tests and theres only 3 tests with no curve, only two homework's so theres no way to get your grade up. She also made sure to remind the class about the withdrawal date...",0
"He thinks he is funny, always makes you feel that you are behind. Miss a class and get a zero for assignment. He cares too much about his heavy lecture but not you at all. He does not care if you learn or not.",0
"Best professor ever! I adore her and admire her so much. Hands down, shes the best professor ever!",1
Professor Sanchez-Bello is cool and helpful. She does have an accent but you'll be able to understand and get the concept of the course. Her reviews are great. I wish more professors were like her,1
"Great prof because he always respect students' opinion and be able to make quizzes and exams according to students' learning progres. Clear explaining of concepts,  not much homework, and doable exams.",1
"Dr. Kim is a nice, funny person, but her teaching is difficult to follow. She rushes through slides, spends lots of time writing mechanisms but that's only 13 of the test. First day she told us that if you make a C or higher in her class, you're doing well. Tried multiple times to meet up with her, but she never made an effort. Avoid if possible.",0
Professor Hartman is a great professor and such a sweet lady. There is a lot of reading and the tests are all open ended questions for the most part so you really have to know the books. Easy A as long as you attend/participate and read.,1
"Dr. Zbeida is very active in making sure you are ready for essays by providing in-class worksheets you do in groups and giving great, detailed feedback on Blackboard for essay sketches. She is extremely nice and likes for participation in class. Discussion boards are not overwhelming and textbooks for this class are cheap overall. Highly recommend.",1
She is super nice but isn't the best teacher,0
He is by far the worst professor I have ever taken. All he does is wastes people's time with the stupid videos he plays which are unrelated to the topic.,0
"An interesting guy. You basically do nothing in class. I took the service learning class and everything was done online. I'm not sure if it's like that for his other classes. He's nice, but cancelled class 4 times. Basically don't even worry about showing up to class more than a few times. You'll just watch movies that have nothing to do w English.",1
Professor Zimmerman is not doing well in the virtual world. She doesnt post assignments when she says she will and gives feedback on assignments after they are due. She forgot to give my class a midterm so suddenly made the final worth 40 percent. On the final she included content she never taught and posted a ppt so we could teach ourselves.,0
Do not take this class online. His tests are about 75 questions each worth 0.15 points. His weekly participation assignments are multiple questions that EACH have to be answered with 150-600 words depending on what he says the minimum is. The exercises arent always answered using the text and his lecture slides aren't always helpful or available.,0
"Best professor! He will help if you need it, very fair, makes the class fun! My favorite teacher! Take his class!!",1
"He literally tells you exactly what he wants in your essays. Do what he says and you'll get an A. Sometimes he even gives you a thesis and tells you to fill in the blanks so you don't have to worry about it. If you ask him for help, he'll gladly give it. He clearly wants us to do well in the rest of our college english classes.",1
"I've never had a more BORING instructor, let alone subject.  For an online student there's next to no interaction and reply and grading times are horrible.",0
"There are so many sweet things I can say about this man but I know I am only limited to so much space so what I will say is, he cares for his students and makes sure you know it. He teaches the lectures in a way that just keeps you so intrigued and will involve the class with his examples to keep it a bit more interesting. His class is def worth it",1
"Arevelo is a terrible teacher. She has a very heavy accent which makes it difficult to understand her lecture, as well as making it easy to loose focus and interest. If you have to miss an exam the only time you can make it up is 2 days before the final(she will not budge with this even if you have a good reason). Test are very hard. DO NOT TAKE!",0
DO NOT TAKE. Whoever wrote she tells you exactly what is on the test is a LIE! She changes wording of everything.  Class average of the first test was in the 50s. Unwilling to explain things. I am an A/B student and I had to drop the class because I had an F. Horrible teacher. She shouldn't be allowed to teach.,0
Notes are unclear as well as her lectures are pointless. Avoid.,0
At first she was ok but as time went on she became less nice. A few times I went to her for help about things  and she acted as if I was dumb.She was extremely over the top about the final exam to a point where it made you nervous. Students had legitimate questions on the test because the ink ran out on some of the questions and she refused to help,0
This professor is very focused and explains the subject in detail. I learned a lot from his class.,1
"He will never reply your email. Whatever you do, he will give you a B.",0
"She has quizzes that she makes up herself in her class, and they are often poorly worded and she expects a lot out of students. She expects you to understand many, many, different types of long charts. She also is a tough grader, and I've had times where she completely gave me the wrong grade and said she had me mixed up with another student.",0
"She provide us with clear powerpoint slides and lecture videos, just read them and do the homeworks on Mindtap then its an easy A, she even give out extra credits and there are so many ways you can succeed in this class.",1
"Very good teacher, willing to work with students and will curve the tests grade. Come to class and labs, do the work and you will pass",1
"Mr. MacCabe is a charming, inspirational, intelligent, and frankly, quite handsome, professor. He knows exactly what he's doing, and I've never had a professor teach something so well before. He's very helpful, and he's one of the most patient people I know. If you have the chance to take this course, definitely do it! It's a beautiful experience!",1
Very arbitray in his grading and is boring in class. AVOID if at all possible. I didnt heed the advice and now have this as my worst class in my CAREER,0
"As long as you are willing to put in the effort for his class, read the directions he gives you for papers, and attend class-- you will be fine. He is great about giving back his thoughts and ideas about how you could write better; he is one of the easier professors here at Union.",1
Prof. K. The worse teacher you can expect taking it. Very hard and tough grader No curving. About 30 quizes in one semester SOOOOO many papers and theres no way you can pass it with B I kept stuying every day/night and still couldnt do it im an A student in Chemistry pretty good at memorizing but this class with this prof. Pls DONT TAKE IT!,0
"Luis is obviously really smart, but is too scattered for a position like this. He relies on shorthand in his emails so heavily that it sometimes hinders understanding. His feedback is late and confusing, and the icing on the cake was when he talked about my class performance with another student without my consent or knowledge. Avoid.",0
"Plant evolution and diversity. Very hard course. Online lecture quizzes after each class and labs. Grades hard. Difficult to understand. When you ask for him to clarify or ask him any question, he does everything but help you. It's like you can't get a straight answer out of him. Very difficult to learn anything.",0
"Great lecture style, but does not post notes online, so you need to be in class to get content. Assignment instructions and feedback can be very vague, but will clarify when asked to. Exams are not difficult, but can be tough in grading assignments. She is different, but not a bad teacher. I've taken her twice and would take again.",1
Professor Kinkel is the sweetest teacher I have ever met! Her class gives you a lot of insight and she does a great job of making it interesting! The homework is done weekly but it is very easy! Her exams are a breeze! Take her class!!,1
"exellent instructor!!! always look forward to his classes. writing was not an interest to me (couldn't write APA style to save my life) til i met this man. Really detailed oriented, you'll enjoy this instructor.",1
She shouldn't be teaching. Has no patience at all. Extremely condecending and treats her students like middle schoolers. She gets upset when you ask a simple question. Does not work well with her students. Strict grader; takes points off stupid things. DONT TAKE HER!,0
makes a lot of mistakes. Funny teacher. Likes teaching. Never take it in the morning class.,0
She was a great teacher and made accounting somewhat interesting. She will call on you so make sure you know the matieral before class (or sit in the very front because she doesn't call on those people). Tests are kind of hard but you get a note card to use. She will also pick on people so beware.,1
"Sinha is not a well-organized professor and does not express care for her students. Not helpful during office hours at all and makes you feel dumb when asking questions:( study guides do not match test at all so don't base studying off of it. Work with TAs to learn the plant material. Try to avoid taking her, wasted studying time on class.",0
"Did not love her as a professor, but she makes the class extremely easy. Textbook use isn't necessary (although the case study book is used weekly) and she allows for notecards on every exam.",1
"Doesn't communicate well, doesn't give feedback until 3 weeks after assignments are turned in.  Took midterm at 5 weeks and hadn't gotten week 3 work back.  Do not take this class if you want to learn accounting.  I'm serious, only if your able to teach yourself , straight A student saying this!!!!",0
"Take a different professor. If you want to pass prepare to go to every single class to take quizzes, because according to her, her class ""has so much good information"". In reality, the class is made up of a plethora of rhetoric from academia. I worked very hard, and bit my tongue, then sighed a breathe of relief when the semester was over.",0
I love his class on poetry analysis and think he's an extremely intelligent professor. All poems can be found online as well so don't buy the book.,1
He is really confusing,0
Don't listen to the rest of these reviews because they are faker than a flying talking unicorned donkey wrestling a rich tax paying man who also does the dishes and his own laundry. Dr. Evan's is a sweet sweet prof. who bless his heart tries his best but.... you know he is special in a not good kinda way.,0
This teacher is pretty good at times.  He digs into your personal life and sometimes does not keep things confidential.  Doesnt have you do much during the semester but make you write 15 page journals...its a JOKE!  Quizes are true/false on each chapter...very easy. Wouldnt recommend but easy A,1
"Every-time I asked for help, she made me feel like the dumbest person alive. She is so smart that its hard for her to dumb things down. If you dont have a strong science background, youll probably fail.",0
"Such a nice, fun professor. Really cares about each of his students and wants you to do well. You have to work in his class, but the way he teaches makes you want to do the work.",1
"By far the worst teacher ever, granted he has no experience (was a TA & is an int'l student at GSU himself) but has horrible attitude. Just doesn't teach,reads through slides, unwilling to help, terrorizes students for asking questions. Purposefully makes life harder, expects you to know phd level stuff & will embarrass you if you said you didn't..",0
"Nora was hands down the nicest professor I've ever had. She is always ready to help you with your lab or direct you in the right way. This class is all lab, 2 exams and a report so make sure you come to class and turn in the homework! Find a table you can work with and split up the group work and you'll be fine! Great class! Worth it!",1
"Don't get me wrong I LOVE Dr. Ingram, but you have to pay attention in his class. His writing is not the best, so I do recommend to either close pay attention or record his lecture (record friendly). Also, he does tend to lose some students papers, so I do recommend to SAVE ALL YOUR WORK YOU GIVE HIM. Overall, love the class and professor.",1
I would not recommend any student taking his class unless you are majoring in sociology! He is a very tough grader and doesnt work well with his students.,0
"I really enjoyed taking Interpersonal Communications online. She is super sweet and caring, and her online lectures are very professional and well put together. The class consisted of quizzes each module and either a discussion post or journal entry and a final. She provides great feedback on all of your assignments so take her if you can!",1
"She is by far the most rude professor I've ever had when responding to questions and never answers the student properly, instead just telling them to read the textbook again. The content of the final assignment was entirely around coding in R when the there has been literally no content covering R until that point. An absolute embarrassment.",0
This is the most difficult class I have ever taken. I spent well over twelve hours a week studying for this class to only get fifty per cent on homework. His instructions were incredibly confusing and I felt like I had to teach myself most of thee material. Didnt seem to care that I had difficulty accessing software due to Covid.,1
"Gotta love his hilarious lecture! Crazy teacher ever I had! If you fell asleep in the class, shame on you! You are NOT going to pass this class if you fell asleep! Simple and plain!",1
"You will really learn a lot from Thorton and his lectures. There's no need to read his notes if you watch the lectures. He will teach you everything you need to do the projects, so don't feel intimidated by them. Weekly exercise sets are not too bad either. He also responds to questions super quickly, which is a big plus. Best professor for ICS 32!",1
Took her Maymester class. I truly enjoyed her class. Very engaging. Will take for my other Comp class.,1
"Don't recommend. Since it is a one credit class, it contains too much reading and there is a Final. Besides, the Lecture is too long that it lasts  for about 3 hours, and on SUNDAY!",0
"if you aren't passionate about gender, get a different teacher. she will give you lower grades if you dont agree with her. she doesn't give exams or any homework except for essays, so if you dont do well, you're screwed.",0
He seems like he tries but he doesn't speak english very well and is kind of hard to understand especially if taking this class early in the morning. homework assignments are once a week and take a while and tests are kind of hard but other than that its okay if you can decipher what he is saying. wouldn't recommend to anyone really.,0
"I dont know why he has such a low rating, he isnt even that bad. I was worried about taking him cuz it seemed like he was hard but that is not the case. His lectures are clear and his quizzes and test are based off of homework. I passed with an A, and it wasnt difficult to do so.",1
"The reading is extremely heavy. You will not cover all the readings most classes. On the other hand, Green is always available for the students to contact him through email or in his office and is a great resource. If you are prepared for large amounts of reading and active discussion, he is a teacher for you.",1
THEE ABSOLUTE WORST TEACHER ALIVE. NEVER TAKE HIM. WAY TOO QUICK. DID NOT LEARN ONE SINGLE THING FROM HIM.,0
He is the best teacher at the university. He is inspirational and if you don't leave his class lecture thinking you are on top of the world then you weren't listening. He makes me go home and work hard to be successful. He cares about his students and is passionate about what he does. He is also in charge of the Engler Entrepreneurship program.,1
"Not hard but not helpful.  All you do is read slides all class.  Tests are the only thing counted for grade 20Q multiple choice and he curves. Didn't make us ""present"" our final project either just turn it in. All in All just an ok prof",0
"Miranda.. I like your sense of style but, your lectures lack information. I do like to hear that protists are beautiful and fungi is cool but, you will never test me on that stuff so why are you telling me it? Miranda, your lectures need to switch gears from strong personal feelings about things to the stuff you plan to test us on..  ",0
She is INCREDIBLE! Genuinely cares about her students and will work with you until you understand the material. She has a passion for ASL.  Also she's pretty funny.,1
A very boring lecturer. ,1
"gives way too much and NEVER clarifies his questions. is very vague and only explains the discussions AFTER theyre due. would not take again, extremely difficult to understand what he is asking most of the time",0
"Professor Olsson is very sweet and cares about students however, shes very bad at responding to emails. She doesnt give much homework but her assignments are difficult, she doesnt respond to questions about the assignment and grades very hard. Her lectures are more or less reading from slides and when she goes off its very complex w/ no explanation",0
The best instructor ever! Wish I would have had her in high school....very patient and kind...made it fun and interesting.,1
This class by all means is horrible. Quizzes are very strict down to the point of accuracy. She gives out a lot of reading so be prepared to be overwhelm in reading. Her class lecture is very heavy on details and all she does it talk and talk. Not very engaging nor does she impact the class. She's very bad at teaching to be organize while she's not,0
Heather hug is the most helpful teacher I've ever had. She really helps you learn and understand the material.,1
Don't take this class! He doesn't teach a thing in the lectures but once a week he'll have one where he acts like he taught everything and no one has any clue whats going on! His tests and lectures are like two completely different classes. The first midterm the class average was 44%!!!,0
"This was a condensed course, so the material was very heavy and full of irrelevant articles. The quiz questions  ranged  from confusing to obscure,  and even though I studied, I still scrambled to figure out what the profs were referring to.I don't recommend taking this class if you struggle separating pertinent material from LOADS of useless info.",0
"The woman literally wrote the book. Dr. Taylor-Perry is an awesome professor. Although she may seem a little intimidating at first, she will always take any questions and will talk to you after class. I had a B in the course until the final exam and then it brought me down to a C.",1
"If you go to class, you are going to do fine. A lot goes on in class with lectures, discussion topics, and group work. She's experienced and thoughtful with her answers to our questions. I want to take another class of her's again.",1
"Enjoyed him, great man and one of the best teachers ever.  Always took time out of his schedule to communicate and help.  Not only that, knew like everyone's name in a lecture hall the size of a movie theater.  Plus, his lectures are interesting",1
He does know his stuff about photgraphy but he tells a lot of stories. Some of them are funny but most of the time they really have to revelance to what we are talking about. He gives you assignments that challenge you as a photgrapher and that really helps you grow. Sometimes his critques are a little harsh but in reality thats the real world.,1
"Thick accent and just moves to hard tricky problems to give for your test. Has a complicated grading system of extra credit and quizzes and tests.  Really beware of pop quizzes, it used to be open book, then it wasn't. Multiple choice tests-very hard and no partial credit for problems (150 pts)",0
"Survey of Modern Math is a course that strikes most mathematics majors confused. Upon first glance, it would seem all the classes math majors take prior do not really prepare students for survey. However, Professor Mynard makes it accessible, affordable (he produces his own text), and clear as to why it is important for a math major.",1
"Super nice guy, he is always available to help and is nice about it. Not too much work and the assignments are explained well. Lectures can be boring but he tries to bring his instruments for entertainment so it is not all lecture.",1
Love her! Great professor.,1
"Take anybody else, seriously, because the tests are super hard, no review, a major rambler, too many surprises, not very helpful, tests formats always changing, too much homework, etc. She has probably done better this semester than the past semesters, but she has a lot more work to do if she wants to be a better professor.",0
"I thought this class was going to be like a Calculus class I took in high school, but no. Professor Gupta truly is the worst teacher I have ever had as he never provided any reasoning for grades and even though I went to all the classes and his office hours, still did not do great on midterm or final. RIP to whoever has to take him next year.",0
"The lectures were boring, long, and he often went off onto a tangent. Being that I am a business major, I want to learn in business courses, but I didn't in this class. He is very vague with instructions and doesn't give feedback on grades. He also waits until the last weeks of the semester to put in grades so it's hard to know how you're doing.",0
"Goes over material pretty fast.. you can do well in the class if you read the book thoroughly and study a lot. The TA's were pretty horrible, and I'm pretty sure they made up the midterm/final...",0
Mrs. Shade was an amazing teacher who helped me get through geology.,1
"Professor Neff wants all his students to succeed, he is truly an amazing professor and wonderful person! Loved the thought-provoking, unique experience in his IH 0851 class so much that I am taking his IH 0852 class. Readings are engaging and he loves open-ended class discussions (makes everyone more open to talking together on their thoughts).",1
"Took him for Western Civilization because I was forced to take the class in the Commerce program. He made the subject interesting. Show up to class, take notes and you will succeed. Relatively easy marker, would recommend.",1
"Picks hard & confusing books to read and assigns reading due EVERY class. Papers are also confusing, midterm not too bad. She is a nice person but she makes the class difficult.",0
"Promises to be ""your statistician for life"" but ends up talking down to students and using the class to inflate his own ego. Excessive number of ambiguous problems from an overpriced textbook he wrote himself. Take another professor for this required class if you can",0
"If u luv lectures you'll luv Prof D. He is vry smart and knows his stuff! We had 4 major assignments (Quiz, Midterm, Resrch Paper, nd Final) He incorporates attendance in ur grade so it ""behooves"" you to go to class! Don't expect to leave early, EVER. U will B embarrased if ur phone goes off. He is best for mature students that are eager to learn.",1
"Professor Hanratty is a good teacher. Although she holds high standards, it really allows you to become more responsible for your work. She is a tough grader. When she provides feedback on your papers, make sure to take the advice she gives you and DON'T blow it off. The comments she gives you will really help improve your writing for your papers.",1
"She gives a lot of readings, and she never talks about the readings in class. The things she teaches in class are different from the reading but she somehow expects you to be able to connect the two together whether or not you understand the readings or not. you can definitely see her if you dont understand the class but really dont take this class",0
"Paul was frivolous and arbitrary in his criticisms and unhelpful with our projects. Instead of teaching a material, he told us what to use and gave a brief demo in equipment. We ended up having to get around using the material instead of mastering it. His assignments were obscure.",0
"I went into this class so scared thinking I was going to fail, but she made it bearable and even fun sometimes. She's so funny and willing to help that I didn't even mind going to class. 100% recommend taking her",1
I took scientific inquiry for science majors. It was very easy and watered down. PAY ATTENTION IN CLASS because this stuff is applicable in later life. Don't just take this class to get it out of the way,1
"One of my least favorite professors Ive ever had at UWT and Ive been there for 5 years... Shes all over the place and is NOT accommodating to students that havent taken a political science class before. Way too goofy and unprofessional, and her assignments sheets NEVER match the online instructions or syllabus. This class was miserable.",0
Debbie is a great professor and works hard with all the students. She also was a good friend and helped me a lot after class at her free time.,1
"Worst teacher ever way too demanding, thinks she is nice, but in reality there is nothing you can do in any of her classes to honestly earn a good grade (and we are talking even a B). Take her only if you feel like doing more work than the classes that actually matter and get graded the harshest you have ever been.",0
"Grade was based on 10 assignments with lowest one dropped (she calls them in class assignments but they're all take home), 5 quizzes with lowest quiz dropped, attendance and two 2-3 page papers. The lectures themselves can be somewhat interesting but only need to show up for attendance. Beware the quizzes. Most confusing worded question and random.",0
"Dr. Hess is such a wonderful, nice lady and it shows when she teaches her classes.  She grades fairly and only wants her students to learn.  She has also helped me with advising and is increible!!",1
"Mrs. Jimmerson is a very good teacher. She helped me so much! She is really funny which makes class go by fast! she gives extra credit! Although she is a good teacher she is kind of a hard grader, she just knows what she wants. You must follow directions in class! If you do follow directions you will do fine! ",1
Interesting lectures. Makes you interested in mental health.,1
"He is a great teacher, cares about student. And he will more than gladly to help you outside of class too. He respect his students. As long as you take really good notes and look over and study the slides, you will do just fine.",1
Smart guy but a bad prof. Doesn't tell you what you need to study. Concepts on exams different from what's on notes and taught in lecture. Just reads off of class notes provided to us. If I had a gun to my head telling me to take him again or jump off a cliff. I'm jumping lol.,0
Can honestly say this is one of the better classes I have ever chosen to take. Professor Bazluki provides a laid back environment as well as some great insight on real skills you will need for any rehabilitation/ injury prevention based career path. Great professor that keeps his informative lectures very interesting with real life applications.,1
"Its definitely intimidating and overwhelming at first. But follow every tutorial she has, step by step and you will make an A, plus bonus point if you do it all right the first time. If not, shell tell you to fix it and give you full credit after. Failed the midterm but aced the final. 3 assignments, 2 tests and EC! Quizlet helps for the final!",1
"Mrs. Stewart is a passionate, inspired, and caring teacher. I highly recommended for beginning learner because she gave extra credits for bonus works, and the way she taught really helps second language students or students who don't have strong English base, and it's easy to get high A in her class. I got 98 on my class average!",1
Worst professor I have ever had!,0
"She shows inappropriate films for the age group. She is lazy and not tech savvy at all. You don't get any feedback until it's too late, she also has mixed material for the class. I took as an elective, she calls herself a ""historian"", I'm glad she's ancient history for me. This class is boring and serves no benefit, not even to a history major.",0
"I LOVE PROFESSOR GIBSON!! Attendance is mandatory the bulk of your grade depends on it. Take her ENGL1102 class its focused on BLACK women and their roles in films, tv shows, etc. And you get to watch shows as assignments.",1
"I hope that someone reports this guy, he shouldn't be aloud to teach with the way he talk to his students.",0
Rammaha is an awesome teacher. He has an accent but you learn to understand him. He is very smart and really wants his students to do top notch work in and out of class. I would recommend him as a teacher because he is very knowledgable and thought provoking.,1
"Absolutely loved her! She's very caring about her students, I will be taking her again.",1
"By far the best prof I've had, a nice and caring person. He understands what hes teaching. Easy grader and his tests are reasonable. He genuinely cares about his students and wants them to do good. He goes out of his way to offer help. He puts more time into his course than any other prof I've seen. Hes doing excellent for a prof just starting out!",1
"Dr. Guerra-Pujol is hilarious! He is also amazing at keeping students interested during lecture by being very animated and passionate about the topic. The grading criteria for the essays isn't clear but if you make an effort, you should get a decent score. There's a lot of reading but he talks about it in lecture and brings it full circle.",1
She was one of the most helpful professors I have ever had. She goes above and beyond to make sure her students are clear on everything. Take her whenever possible!,1
"THE WORST TEACHER YOU'LL EVER HAVE IN YOUR LIFE. she wont help you no matter what you do, and if you ask her a question in class she will most likely belittle you.",0
"Review sheets and in-class quizzes do nothing to prepare you for the tests. She is a great teacher with passion for finance however her tests are insane. She expects you to know how to solve problems that you don't discuss in class. If possible, I would recommend another professor just because her tests are INCREDIBLY hard.",0
"Mr. Fultz is a great guy, and will try to help you any way he can. However, he can be confusing at times, and when you ask for help he confuses even more. He's very disorganized and can be everywhere. His class was super easy, though if you plan on going into A&P classes you may not learn much in his class.",0
"Not the most cogent lecturer and a very harsh grader on homework assignments and exams. That said, perseverance can enable you to do well in his course. Just be sure to rely on Paul's Online Notes as a quintessential supplement to his lectures (which are incidentally copied and pasted from your textbook). Eastern style of teaching/grading.",0
this class was easy for me I made 90's on all of my papers the class are long and boring but shes not very strict to when it comes to drafts and final drafts she worries more about the final paper ,1
"She's a good teacher, class difficulty is about Calc 2.",1
Handed out way too many unrelatable assignments,0
"Dr. Draper's Environmental Policy, Law, and Society class is great. She is well versed in her profession; she delivers clear and concise lectures, and she uses real-world examples. Even with all her credentials (Ph.D., J.D.) she is very much in touch with her students. She genuinely wants her students to succeed in and out of the classroom.",1
It wasn't difficult once you realized you will have to learn most of it on your own. Does not know how to explain things in class. Asking her in office hours is nearly as bad. I recommend asking other professors for help.,0
Mostly all board work and covers 2 - 3 sections a day with little amount of information explained. Doesnt hand out study guides for tests. Expects students to do a heavy amount of homework and hw is graded. The quizzes are timed with 8min to complete it. He doesnt set you up for future success like other professors do. Good luck!,0
"Professor Marlowe is really passionate about history. She'll ask you to write up 3 discussion essays but you can turn in more than 3 if you want a better grade. Quizzes are usually unannounced but she drops the lowest 2. If you want to maintain a good grade, you must participate. She keeps track how many times you do, but overall she's very sweet.",1
"The vast majority of students seem to like Professor Russell, but for whatever my opinion counts, I feel that she lacks to proper knowledge to teach her classes. She consistently makes rather large factual mistakes and often teaches directly out of the textbooks; I would have learned more if I just read the books and never showed up to class.",0
"Dr. McCorquodale was a guest lecturer for Professor Ku's section of ENG100. It was hilarious. I really like how he is. I wish he were teaching full time again. He swears a lot and makes funny jokes, but what is really important is he tells us about industry and what is happening. I think his comments will influence my career decisions.",1
"Trinh is the man. The class is insanely difficult. However, he genuinely cares about you and wants you to succeed. Homework is due once per week, but that's because it will literally take you one week. Go to every single lecture, do every single homework,  and make this class your one priority... if not, you'll get a D or fail. Good luck.",1
"In this section, all the homework and quizzes were online.They are very difficult to pass by your self, although you are allowed to use your book.He is the worst accounting teacher in America!He doesn't care if you know the material by the end of his class, he diesn't even take the time to know his students because he knows they will drop his class",0
I LOVE MS. DENDY. I have never met a teacher who cared so much for her students. She truly loves each of her students and wants each to succeed. She is more than willing to help you outside of class and even sit in the library with you. She is an easy grader and uses all the textbooks often. This is the one English teacher who is flat out awesome.,1
Don't take this class if you have no business learning about marine biology. Tried to reach her many times regarding my grade and if there were things I could do to better it but she was never any help. She loves to talk about herself and is always making rude comments about perfectionists and ppl with OCD me. Not very nice and voice is annoyin,0
"Mr Parineh is an excellent instructor and he knows his materials very well. He provides many real world experiences and quick tips like how to start an LLC, sole prop, etc. He encourages students to invest early and what is safe to invest in. I have learned many valuable info that are useful in starting a career.",1
"the worst professor I have ever taken at Quincy college, four and half hours of class time then tons of material to read which is hard to read and to long to remember followed by lots of computer work. honestly should be an online course. Extremely sarcastic when asked questions. Worst course and professor ever!",0
"She was terrible, annoying to communicate with.",0
worst teacher ever. went to see her for help in office and did not help what so ever. gave me the lowest grades on papers when i worked for hours on them. book readings mandatory. talks to much of herself and does not clarify well. do not recommend.,0
"Easy to learn through her lectures. She broke down every problem, but keep in mind she worked very fast. I am a slow writer so it was a little hard to keep up, BUT she is VERY good at her job. Even if I missed some notes, I was able to remember for the homework.",1
"Professor Ortega is such a kind and amazing professor. Always has office hours and will do his best to help. Ignore all those negative reviews! You dont need to memorize so many slides, just go to class and study a bit. His accent is also not a problem as almost everyone can perfectly understand him. Will even give bonus points for all and cares.",1
don't take her ever . she is not A PROFESSOR  i took her 240 with her last semester. i recommend you to drop her class if you register her class. Take another professor,0
She doesn't answer emails. She gave me a 0 on an assignment that I completed. Only gives two tests a midterm and final which are take home. Never get any quizzes.,0
"I purchased the textbook and used it a bit, but it definitely isn't necessary if you listen to her lectures. This class is easy and interesting. There is regular homework but she has very clear expectations. Overall a very good class!",1
I felt like I was in elementary school again in Tami's class. Graded on organization (I felt like I should have the best judgement on how I decide to organize). She also moved our seats around at one point- I haven't had that happen since high school.  We had a ton to cover and very little time to do so.,0
"Lowers points in assignments if he disagrees with you, even if you did the assignment correctly. Tough grader and very confusing tests. Interesting topic but terrible professor.",0
"I hated this class. Dreaded every test. Assignment due dates would deviate from schedule. Lectures were literally just reading off the PPTs. He NEVER covered examples. Seemed like a nice dude, but you absolutely will be teaching yourself in this course.",0
"Not a bad guy, he just doesn't know how to teach. Seems as though he doesn't even care, he's gone over some of his powerpoints twice and hasn't even noticed. Very difficult to sit through his class and pay attention. Goes on a tangent every 5 minutes. Avoid this prof. if you can.",0
He is a very disorganized teacher and cannot explain the material well. Read the textbook and you should be fine for his class. I didn't go to his class during the second half of the semester and still received an A. Remember to give yourself time to do the homework and go to recitation. My recitation teacher game me quizzes every week.,1
"Not everyone like Prof. G, but I did. He's a nice guy, and he's pretty funny because of the way that he rambles sometimes. He's definitely passionate about what he teaches, but admittedly, his course isn't the best organized. If you're trying to choose between FYSs, I'd definitely recommend this one, because it's crazy easy.",1
"TERRIBLE PROFESSOR!! didn't give me feedback on my paper after emailing her MULTIPLE times. Forcing me to put quotation marks on a sentence that is ORIGINAL and MINE!!!  How does umb even hire such professors, I just don't get it. After putting in ALL my hours into this course I got a B- !!! Seriously avoid ",0
Venkata teaches a Chemistry course for non-chem majors. The books were interesting and he is very good about responding to questions promptly.,1
"Stay away! writes on the board faster than you can write and finishes a problem before you while you are copying.  She gets aggravated when you dont grasp concepts.  Uses MathXL for all homeworks, but doesnt always teach everything that is on it.  She will make you want to cry.",0
"She was a very nice woman but definitely bad at teaching. Her lectures are all powerpoints which she basically just reads off of and posts them, but she takes attendance. She gives extra credit and has weekly homework but they aren't hard. Also gives study guides for exams that are so long. Exams were harder than expected though.",0
Seasoned and smart prof. ,1
"She knows her info, but it's a confusing topic to begin with so you just get more confused. Typewrite everything she says! Ppts are kinda disorganized. Txtbk is not mandatory but good reference. She's the only one who teaches this class (only winter qtrs). Quizzes, midterms, final are multiple choice and short answer (need to be specific)! ",0
"strict grading,very strict on attendance. it's true, he does teach straight from the book, and he is a little overrated on this site. don't like him, but don't hate him. okay as a person, not necessarily as a teacher.",0
"The class was interesting and very esay but the  teacher was prejudice.  She did not like to call on me in class, and when she did she tried to contradict my comments.  When I met with her in private she was not nice at all.  She had a very nasty attitude.  I think the class should be taught by someone else but it is interesting just not the teache",0
"Tests are 75% of your grade, if you are willing to go to him for help then you will be okay.  He does want his students to pass, so ASK questions.  Really do not be afraid to ask questions, and do the additional problems he puts on myclasses.  He does do like one extra credit event.",1
"I made a huge mistake taking Prf. Smith. She is nasty, sarcastic, doesn't give good feedback on papers, and is very unorganized. I should've stuck with my professor from last semester. Prf. Smith runs her class in an ""my way or no way"" kind of fashion. Do not take her, ever.",0
Her exams are tough sometimes just cause missing one question can make a big difference on a test with few questions. She's pretty clear about the criteria and she'll help if you ask her for it. Always has good life lessons ,1
"She makes it so difficult. Deducts 1/2 a point off test for each Spelling Errors! The PP are on Black B, 30% of it! she gets upset when you ask her a question or to go back! she doesn't allow cameras to take pics of PP. A  good voice recorder is a most! If you fail a test, its impossible to catch up! I DO NOT RECOMMEND HER!",0
"Morra is extremely passionate about his field and is very enjoyable to have as a teacher. His lectures are clear, detailed and easy to understand. Only two tests, a mid-term and a final, both of which are essays. Puts his powerpoints up online for you to look at whenever. Easy to pass, provided you give your best effort. Definitely recommend.",1
I love Dr. Cochrane. She's a great professor. She demands respect but she also returns it equally unlike many professors I've encountered.,1
"Professor Hopkins' class was probably the easiest class ever. The class was online due to covid. All you have to do was go over the powerpoints and write a one-page response to a few questions and you're done. We only meet up three times during the semester which was the first day, before a project, and before the final exam. Would 100% recommend!",1
He knew what he was doing. With it being online the quizzes were hard to complete with the short time limit. He was always available for questions. Theres weekly homework and options for extra credit. He also offers final forgiveness so if you don't do well a quiz then the final grade can replace 2 of those. He definitely makes you work for it!,1
Simkus is full of himself with stories about himself only and how great he was 25 years ago. I would avoid ACC255 face to face. If you are planning on taking Careers in Accounting - take this class online. This class is basically about how to build your resume and LinkedIn profile. Or at least this is how Simkus teaches it.,1
Really explains things well and gives you help when you need it.,1
"Does not exhibit clear teaching style, i.e. no grading rubric, no syllabus, confusing lectures.",0
"I had Swift for both in person and online courses. He is really great but is better in person. The lecture videos are insightful. He isn't easy and expects a lot. Go to his office hours, he is very helpful and friendly.",1
"No clue what was ever going to be on the quizzes and our class was often blind sided. Harshest grader I've ever encountered in a math course. Took points off for not labeling ""x"" and ""y"" on the x, y axis. She blows through notes and jumps around so good luck following along. You will need to be a very fast writer. Good luck, have fun and godspeed.",0
"The amount of work required in this class is unrealistic for anyone taking more than one class.  The tests are word for word form the very dense, technical book, so you would have to memorize every word of every chapter to do good on the tests - no real learning is going on.",0
"Professor Peterson is an amazing professor. She truly cares about your writing development. Don't get me wrong she is a tough grader, but it's only to help you write better. I mean that is her job. She is extremely honest and helpful. Don't take her class if you're lazy and not willing to put in the effort. Go to her office hours to get help!!!",1
He is a great Prof. Just take his class and you will get an easy A.,1
"Participation definitely matters in this class but if you simply talk once or twice, she'll give you full credit. Peters is a tough grader but is very reasonable at the same time. She follows the syllabus very closely.",1
"Tells you the average for the class will be a B but really it will be closer to a C. Wastes time in class talking about his own stocks along with other pointless things and will put random stuff on tests hes never talked about. Not a good marketing teacher for 300 but i'm not sure about other classes. good guy, sub par teacher.",0
"GOOD CLASS.  TESTS ON LECTURES, NOT BOOK.  DOES PURPOSEFULLY TRY TO TRICK HER STUDENTS ON EXAMS AND THAT IS SAD.  OVERALL GOOD TEACHER BUT BEWARE OF HER AS A PERSON SHE IS A TOUGH COOKIE.",1
"Great teacher, give this man a raise! Luigi Bless!",1
Professor Meehan's class is pretty boring but the material you get from the class is more than what she provides on the outlines.  Her tests are straight forward but only study what she talked about in class.  Wouldn't even recommend getting the textbook because she narrows down what you need to know.,0
"hybrid honors stat class, by far the best professor .It's 1quiz, 1 hw assignment every week, open notes but in exchange its like 40-60 hw questions that takes 1-2 hours to do. Mostly self taught, but she's very good at explaining. Would 100% take as long as you take good notes from hw and ppt, set for quiz. project at the end for honors. Met 1xweek",1
She's okay. She tries her best but doesn't really do a good job overall in her teaching.,1
Very very tough grader. Challenging and very interesting class but it is not worth destroying your gpa. CHOOSE ANOTHER PROFESSOR.,0
Shauna is honestly amazing!!!,1
"Very energetic, knows her stuff, extremely helpful, and nice.",1
Class is impossible and professor does not teach. Only class I did not get an A in this semester.,0
very interesting even when he is off topic. Very nice guy. Grades hard on papers,1
"This was the worste professor I have ever had!! She is unorganized, unclear in instruction, grades unfairly, expects you to read her mind, and has favorites. One time she failed me and gave another person full credit half way through her presentation. She also refuses to be wrong, so if you ever try to stand up to her she talks like you are two.",0
"Please avoid this professor. You will not learn anything if you take him, especially those who are starting out to code. He is picks on students to do the work for him, specifically girls. There are 5 homework assignments and 2 exams. His homework and exams are very confusing, and some of them are copied from other textbooks. Would not recommend.",0
"I would advise not to take this class unless you really want to and already have a deep understanding of packets and how they are made up. It also helps to have a good understanding of Wireshark, nmap and other Net Sec tools. You will know if you won't pass his class as he sends out 2 different emails telling you if it is possible to pass or not",1
"Dr. Keeling is one of the best teachers at CNU. I have taken her for both children and adolescent literature. She. Knows. Her. Stuff. But while her knowledge on the subjects is fantastic, her real gift is facilitating class discussion. Nothing feels forced for the sake of participation. You will walk out of each class having learned something new.",1
"I LOVE SRG. CONTA!HE IS THE BEST PROFESSOR AT LACC. VERY VERY HELPFUL IN EVERYTHING. HIS TEST ARE EASY, NO H.W AND IF HE DOES, NEVER COLLECTS IT. HE SHARES A LOT OF HIS EXPERIENCES AS AN OFFICER WHICH ARE AMAZING. AND HIS STORIES HELP AS EXAMPLES OF WHAT THE LECTURES ARE. U WILL NEVER MEET ANOTHER PROF. WHO GOES OVER MID/FINAL TEST ?'S THE DAY B4.",1
AVOID & RUN!  RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN from this professor! Save your life NOW!,0
"WOW, you will regret wasting money on her class. Not only is she boring she does absolutley nothing, she doesn't teach, she picks her favs and labels the students she dislikes and harasses them. She is biased, ugly and spaced out!",0
Prof Nelson is a very sweet person. She does give lots of homework but its super easy to do and its to prepare you for the tests and lectures. Her class is very easy and towards the end of the semester she gives out lots of in class extra credit.,1
"Kathy was a great choice for JRN 380. She was funny, and the class was interesting. She was the perfect person to teach this class. The group projects sucked, but they aren't hard. The quizzes are easy and the class is interesting to attend.",1
"Melissa Meyers is the worst teacher that i have taken at ULL since i have been in school. she does not answer questions for you..she test on material not explained in class., and she likes to say her middle school child can do this work so we should be able to do this.. she is the worst teacher ever.. do not take her cause she is very discourraging",0
Hard grader and the test are really confusing and even with the supposed answer you can still get it wrong.,0
"Dean is awesome. Rushes through material, but lectures are recorded and posted online for review. Practice exams are nearly identical to current exams, no answer keys, though. Free online textbook is unbelievably bad, just use google if you get confused. Always willing to explain things in class or in his office if you get confused.",1
"DO NOT TAKE, she is a tough grader and I did not enjoy this course at all. Reports students to honor council for collaborating with group members THAT SHE ASSIGNED. Sucks that my hardest class this year is a gen ed when im also taking chemistry and micro economics.",0
"He focuses on the text book for everything. Doesn't like to be wrong, he's always right because ""he's a professional"". I thought I was doing great and expected a b+ ended up with a C!!!!! he sure is a tough grader. Expects for you to be working on his class all the time.",0
"Quiz every class makes you focus on the reading; outlines of quarter-term and final exams help in studying. Lots of PPTs, complimentary to text. Not an easy subject but he works to help you pass, and occasional ""freebie"" quizzes don't hurt (don't skip class, esp. Fridays). Grade updates every exam. Extra credit available. One of the good guys.",1
"Would not take again. He doesn't seem to know what he's talking about as he would only explain very simple concepts. He also had answer key errors and practice midterms filled with errors. Makes it very difficult to teach yourself, which is what you have to do.",0
She takes forever to grade your essays and work. does not respond to emails in a timely manner. I would not recommend her class at all.,0
"Very lazy professor, have him 2 times a week. On the monday or tuesday class we spend half the time watching videos submitted by students explaining a problem from the hw which is a waste of time. The other day of his class he sends out pre recorded lectures. If I had to describe him in one word I would struggle deciding between lazy or disengaged.",0
"Without the final exam redemption policy where I BARELY got an A (86%), I would've failed this class. Lots of iClicker questions and the midterms were ridiculously difficult. My TA told me that 3/4 of the class got C's and below, the average for both midterms were 51% and 48%. I had to do over 300 problems from old exams and problem sets for an A.",0
"Not only is she very clear about everything (assignments, lectures, etc.), she is a really funny, entertaining teacher.",1
She has an extremely great method of teaching mathematics.,1
"Best lecturer I've seen at U of T; he's clear, funny, and makes Shakespeare interesting. However, he was very quick to anger (don't talktextbrowse the Webfall asleep)--HE WILL CALL YOU OUT. I found his marking tough and his expectations unclear. Extremely arrogant and self-centred.  He expects you to read 14 plays: 4 in 1st term, 10 in 2nd term.",0
"Subjective grading - based on her individual perception of your social abilities. The dumber you appear, the better you'll do. In other words, she wants to assert her social dominance and enjoys when other people look stupid. Also, if you are a female, you will be treated with favoritism.",0
"She was one of the best BIO professors I have had online. She has a easy to follow online course, gives two tries, and provides lots of feedback on the papers. Read the syllabus and know it . Just make sure you do your work on time. I think the other students who complain is because they are late with the assignments (she does not like that).",1
Good teacher. She is very practical and you will learn a lot from her.  Don't skip her class as there are many in class assignments but they are very easy. Her exams are easy too. You don't need any textbook as everything comes from the powerpoint. Just attend her class and get an A.,1
"She is supper hard grader, and also she cares but if she dose not get your work on time no chance to give it to her. She is pretty mean.",0
I really liked her.  Econ is my worst subject but she made it easier to understand.  Offers tutoring if you need it.  She's very nice.  Liked her a lot.,1
She is always the latest professor to grade the exams. She barely leaves any comments on the papers to explain why you got the grade you got! Although she is a great person but she is not the best professor and certainly not good when it comes to grading papers!,0
"Dr. Bowen was very passionate about his class, however, he was extremely scattered. His tests were almost impossible even with a 5 X 7 note card. The labs were long and confusing. Only two people passed when I took his class, myself included. Unless you have a lot of prior knowledge to the subject, do not take his class.",0
"Barely uses Blackboard. He posts homework assignments with solutions that are barely legible and some solutions are incorrect.  Dont bother going to class. He takes the easy way out by just deriving formulas and going through theory, rather than doing examples. 65% of the class failed the midterm and he told those with low marks to drop the course.",0
"Having taken close to 200 hours at the University, I consider Dr. Brooks' class to be, one of if not, the best. He is a professor of exceptional caliber. The class is challenging, but Dr. Brooks is fair and you will learn the material. For anyone who desires to grasp modern finance, this course is an unequivocal must.",1
"Because classes moved online the math dep. was very strict about time limits for quizzes and tests which heavily affected my grade. That being said, Dr. Vutha was amazing and did everything he could to make this semester easier. The notes he makes for his lectures are absolutely incredible and he is very funny. He replies fast and willingto help.",1
"Go to class and truly pay attention to his lectures and you will excel in his class. He is very interesting in lecture and the midterm and final come straight from lectures and the homework readings. Only downside to the class is you have to write summary sentences for each homework reading, but if you do them it gets you easy points toward your A.",1
This was the best class I have ever taken. Paul Coutinho was fantastic. He truly cared about all of his students and wanted them to find joy in life. I learned so much. This is the type of class that makes you look at everything differently. I wish everyone could take Coutinho's class!,1
"You should take Professor Cote if you love science in general and chemistry in particular. The things you will learn and the study habits you will develop will prepare you to succeed in your future classes. You have to ask yourself if you are ready to get serious about your education. Otherwise, take another section and short-change yourself.",1
Profesor McCarthy is a very nice but I would not recommend taking her class! She is an extremely tough grader and will not give out an A. I am an A student and I got a C on my first paper. She allows you to correct your paper which is helpful. You are given 3 papers but she just expects way too much. Assignments are unclear.,0
"get on his good side, if he likes you he will grade you much easier and if he doesnt like you you...well...to bad",0
"Professor Ikegwuonu is a very nice woman. Often times, she goes off on irrelevant spiels and forgets what she's lecturing about. The book is trivial as long as you take good lecture notes. I gave her a 4 for difficulty because the tests sometimes do not follow the lectures making them hard. There''s one 10-page research paper, worth 35%.",1
He is a great professor. He knows how to find ways to make the material stay in our memory. He is really the best of the best. You get a A in his class by paying attention. His study guides are helpful.He gives extra credits and gives you an idea on what it might be. Take him if you want to  get a good grade and learn at the same time.,1
"Really helpful professor, knows what she's talking about and how to explain things for those who are struggling. Make sure you complete the homework and take notes in class. The exams aren't too bad, just don't study at the last minute and you'll pass.",1
"I took Mr. Caldwell twice and he's funny and a great professor. He has witty humor and will be willing to help you. Depending on the class you take it can be daily homework. The homework can be helpful in preparing you for the tests. Also he has an awesome southern accent! I like when he says ""boy howdy!"" He makes class interesting and fun!",1
"Asking questions in class can be difficult, as they are usually met with a condescending tone. While her style of teaching, using hand-written notes and examples, is helpful for students who learn better by doing, she often moves so fast that keeping up can be arduous.",0
very strong accent. very hard to understand.  I didn't learn anything in this class.  He teaches stuff that should be common sense to most people.  If you know  how to use a computer this class should be easy for you.  He gives out multiple choice tests which arent too bad.  pretty boring lectures.   Veryyy easy to pass class just do all the work!,0
"I'm really unsure why people gave him such good reviews. He's a great guy, horrible professor. He only puts up 4 or 5 grades a semester and 4 of them are tests. He teaches his 101 class like a 300 class and goes way too deep into geography. He doesn't teach what Geography 101 warrants. He's also incredibly monotone and difficult to listen to.",0
Matt is a very good teacher. He is very clear and his power points are very good and easy to understand. He really does everything he can to make you succeed. He is easy going and very fair and just a really nice guy. Really enjoyed listening to his lectures. Wish he could teach every class I have to take. ,1
"I wasnt a bio major and it was all coursework a biology graduate had difficulty helping me with. Lots of assignments and for an online class it took more time out of my day than an actual lecture would. Read all course work very carefully if you HAVE to take this class, otherwise dont take it.",0
"Don't really care for Finance, but I think he makes the topic interesting. There are no surprises on his exams. Although he is not the easiest professor, he is clear-cut with his explanation and willing to help you. If you study hard, you can do well. Do NOT buy the textbook. He posts homework online and his notes in class are all you need to do we",1
He was late almost all semester by 10-15 min. His teaching technique is pretty avrg. Only gives a few tests a semester he takes points off for the smallest things such as whether or not you placed arrows on your graph. He didn't update the canvas grade book the entire semester. He has no problem with trying toembarrassing you in front of the class.,0
Hard hard hard,0
"Please, Don't take her class. Even if shes the last option because of registration deadline, just wait until next semester She's truly not interested in teaching or helping you to understand the material. Unless you have a gift in the sciences or can teach yourself, you will be wasting your time and money. Please study with a professor that cares.",0
"Not too bad of a class to fill a requirement. Get the textbook. He wrote it and it's essential when writing papers (basically helps guide you and give serious info on the topic). Lectures are boring and odd, but occasionally funny. He has a coarse and brash sense of humor. Attendance (in this course at least) is 20% of the grade.",0
"I loved this online course! You constantly need to check canvas and know how to use the internet and you'll be good. He has due dates determined since beginning of course. RENT the book, you depend on it! Its not hard reading, its actually interesting. Just make sure not to slack on reading, i highly recommend making time. Its a great course!",1
"In my opinion, she's the nicest, rude person you'll ever meet. Zero student compassion. Teaches clearly but makes the exams very hard. Pretends to care about students but i have yet to meet one other person who truly feels she's sincere with compassion.",1
"Prof. Caldwell is a very specific grader, however he does not specifiy what is expected of the assignment. He can be very rude and insulting, without being helpful.",0
Horrible! She hates her students is the simple way to put it. Never responded to my email from 3 weeks ago. Does not care at all,0
awesomeness!,1
"I took Schultz for a ""D"" semester. By the 6th week of a 8 week course, she has only graded one paper out of 5. Also, she has knocked one week off the course making it 7 weeks (The final was due on the 12/6 and now is due 11/30). All of this would be fine if she gave more feed back, since she does not though, knowing your grade is a guessing game.",0
"Professor Wallace is my favorite teacher ever, took him for both 1301 and 1302. He is  straightforward and beyond helpful. The pop quizzes are short and super easy. And as far as the tests go, just review your lecture notes a few days before and you're guaranteed an A. Prof Wallace made learning about history a breeze, I highly recommend him.",1
"Funny dude, but thats where the list of positives end as far as his ability as a teacher.  Showing up to class was about as useful as watching bill nye the science guy re-runs. Useless teacher so enjoy learning everything yourself.  Hard tests but he does curve. ",0
"C'est la première fois que je prends la peine de noter un prof. Si vous avez la chance de prendre un nôtre professeur, faites-le. Il est gentil, mais pas claire. Tout le monde est mêlé en cours. Je ne comprends pas pourquoi il y a des gens qui l'ont bien noté. Je trouve le cours très difficile, la raison principale est lui. (J'ai eu 90 en sco1250.)",0
"Class is boring at most times though he is a nice, charismatic guy. Difficult political theory material and I'm not quite sure if it attempts making it easier on anyone.",0
"Dr. Cheers is one of the most difficult prof. i've had to deal with. He's rude and there are days where you want to punch him in the face. But know this, he was the only prof. that made me reevaluate my decision to be a journalist. He made me see you have to find your motivation yourself. I'd recommend this class for those who need a reality check.",0
"Prof Dewan is a great example of why people are leaving EMU. He is a professor who has difficulty explaining concepts due to his thick accent and lack of knowing how to reword things. He asked a student if they understood what he was teaching, the student said no and dewan said well theres nothing I can do for you. Very unwilling to help students.",0
"It was so horrible. I had no idea that I alone was the reason for all the suffering of all women. Crazy. I didnt mean to. My bad, I wont do it again.",0
"The most organized professor ever.  Compared to all the other prof's, she was the easiest to understand and had the fairest exam questions.  I really liked her teaching style, and she was very receptive to comments from the class.  One of ym favourite profs",1
"Professor Sumi is fine if you already know the course material going in. If, however, you have questions or dont understand something going on Sumi becomes openly hostile. She also goes off topic a lot and tends to wander. I was not impressed.",0
"Multiple choice tests,no partial credit, 20, 8-16 problem hw. Studying midterm for final is futile. doesn't matter how much material you can shove into a both sided cheat sheet You are screwed. Got tutored, did all the extra credit, showed up every class ON TIME, took notes still failed, Pass is possible if taking teacher twice.",0
"The most disturbing teacher with upsetting points of views, it's all about her complaining about how awful movies are and always saying how great she is. Avoid her at all costs.",0
Pretty hard to understand at times and needs to keep up on the test to pass the class.  hardly any homework but online quizes.,0
"Santosh is a great teacher and has accomplished a lot in his field. He was super passionate to help us learn everything and was ready to give us great ideas to push our projects forward. Sometimes, he's get carried away and teach us something way out of our skill set, but that just showed his passion for teaching. He made things fun and interesting",1
Don't take this prof. unless you want to have your mind blown. He uses subatomic particles to change the laws of physics in class. He also hypnotized me and made me believe that I was a real student and not who actually tried and did the homework and that helped me get the grade I earned not given. I had to do the work for once in my life.,0
"Jose is the BEST professor Ive had so far. He made me realize that I want to be and Ethnics Studies professor & teach as passionately & honest as him. The class is super easy but you actually LEARN. Had him for history of Native Americans & Im definitely planning on taking him for more classes. Easy A but super useful class, really open your eyes",1
I haven't yet completed Prof. Engelhardt's Macro course but a lot of things people say below hold true with how I feel. One of my favorite professors so far at UWO. Doesn't bore you with PowerPoints and ties material with real-world events which in turn makes you better informed. He's caring and has really takes up on students' suggestions,1
Spends half the class talking about herself rather than focusing on important matters. She has a bad attitude. Reprimands students who request guidance through email which is often since she is only in her office for a few hours during the week. She does this because she is not computer literate. Very discouraging to eager students. Awful! Awful!,0
He gives a test every week. He does not know how to use the software for the class. He does not speak English well. He is not a nice person,0
"She's really sassy sometimes, but not in a funny way. She seems to clearly have students that she prefers and kind of comes across as fake caring.",0
"Too much reading. Every session, get ready for a quiz (single multiple choice question). I understand that the reading are for our knowledge but she gave too much reading (two books for a one meeting). If you dont know how to manage those, you will fail. Exams are essay type and not so hard. TA are nice and helpful.",0
"Professor Rice makes this lab very difficult. She grades very harshly, and also waits forever to post grades, leaving you in the dark as to how your doing. Professor Rice gives poor feedback on assignments and is not very flexible/understanding.",0
"This was a required class for my degree and I was so excited for it  and what a disappointment it turned out to be. Tricky tests, tough grader and very confusing lectures. A LOT of reading of articles so get ready for that. If not required, don't take it is all I can say. ",0
She never listened to us when we said we can't see the the notes on the overhead. She would print out a couple notes to give to us but not many. She stammers alot and goes on about stories. Assigns reading and homework for the next topic due the same day as a test for the previous topic.,0
I took his History 17A class online and he makes his tests based on his lectures on each chapter and makes you do essays and fill in the blanks. I earned 80% in this class and he gave me a C because it's a point based class and he took away my lowest score so that made my GPA lower and lowers my chances of getting into the nursing program.,0
"Very passionate in her lectures! You need to purchase topHat. she takes attendances every class meeting, at the beginning and end of class. Lots of reading, homework is based on the readings. Midterm and Final are very similar to the homework. Do the homework and readings and you will pass. Reading are on blackboard.",1
Dr. Britton is one of the best at KU! Her passion for her field of work is displayed through her lectures and her excitement is contagious.  ,1
I loooved this class and I am sooo thankful for this professor. He used the class participation grade to round UP my class from a B to an A and that was the difference of me getting into UF!!! I reccomend his class.,1
"I went into this class very excited but I found this professor to be a taskmaster rather than an educator.  I found her to be rather curt in her replies to students, bordering on impatient.  She seems to genuinely love math, but she needs to realize that she's working with undergrads.  Her attitude is just not one I liked, even though I got an A.",0
"Dreaded going to her class. Sheila was one to get side tracked a lot with arbitrary banter and stories, along with getting caught up with stories from students. A total waste of valuable class time.",0
"Mrs. Rogers is a good teacher. She lectures out of her notes, I never used the book. She assigned extra credit a few times, then counted them as homework, so watch that. Come to class. Whats going to be on the test isnt always clear, but if you study the notes she gives you it should be pretty easy.",1
awesome teacher - great class,1
A ridiculous amount of work each week. No communication with instructor whatsoever. Missed One deadline because it is a class where teacher doesnt email you for months and failed. I got an F whereas I had gotten an A on 2301 with a different professor.,0
"I took his class during the Winter session. He Gives about 6-10 hours of video lectures (boring for non-art history majors) and 90% of his class is exams. You can just use the book for lectures as they are identification, but for exams you must understand the significance of the art piece. Only take the class if you have excellent time management.",1
"She would be great for high school.
 
 PS her name is spelled Miiller.",0
Taking this class online you can thank my sttlab for anything you learn the prof is NO HELP. The tests are difficlt and lng and STATDISK wld be grt tool if you can fig out on your own how to apply it to the ?s. But whn you ask the prof he doesn't even offer any assistance. And w/no tutoring in Tampa and limitd avail for online tutoring= no bueno.,0
The workload is rigorous but Dr. Jones keeps you inspired and motivated enough to get it done. It's obvious that she cares about her students and that her number one priority is to prepare you for the remainder of the program and for your career. Great professor.,1
"He literally repeats the same thing all over again on each class. Also, his spelling and grammar is not good. At all. The classes were boring. I love English, and I LOVE writing all types of technical papers, but this class made me question everything. I did not enjoy it at all.",0
"Bottom line, I would not recommend her.",0
"The class was super laid back! Took her in Spring 2021. However, the quizzes are 10 minutes 5 - 10 questions, but the discussion posts and learning activities are super easy. You do have a semester project that is needed to be done in order to get credit for the course no matter if you pass or fail. Really nice professor as well! NO EXAMS AT ALL!",1
"Truly an unnecessarily tough grader. During the corona virus crisis she did not lower her expectations of us, and additionally stated during class time that she would spend less time grading our work and would give us fewer comments on how to improve. Though through her words she acted sympathetic to her students, her actions spoke otherwise.",0
"So the class itself is not that hard, most of it is common sense. BUT she is horrible at reading and answering emails, She sends the same email to everyone thinking that they are talking about the same thing. It was supposed to be a two day online class but then she changes everything to one day. Discussion board she grades harshly as well.",0
She doesn't teach. She just keep talking about stuff. I have to go through the book all by myself in order to pass. Her class is boring ,0
"Jorgen is an amazing professor he bring a whole new view to philosophy. I loved his class, and would definitely take it again!",1
"Do the homework on time and you can assure that you will pass. I passed this class because of that, and on prior knowledge of physics from high school. I only missed one class and learned almost nothing from him. Tests are nothing like the homework whatsoever. He gets frustrated when students don't understand a concept he thinks is simple.",0
"easy money for him with no effort since he doesnt teach. Each week he post a few brief videos made in 2018 showing him working on problems, with no context. we have to post in the forum if we dont get it, only to just get answers from him or student with no explanation. just the answer... u learn nothing. lots of test not enough time to finish",0
"Amazing professor, he's been teaching for quite a while so he has a grasp on how to communicate the concepts effectively.",1
"The class itself was not hard. The material was pretty straight forward, especially if you read. Lab, however, was not structured well at all, it took months for assignments to be graded, and the professor flew through procedure and was concerned more about keeping up his aforementioned tough persona than actually teaching.",0
Get ready to fail this class. No matter what you do. No matter if you study 24 hours a day. At the end you will not pass the class. Really tough grader and very confusing. tons of homework and quizzes. you will get crazy of studying. Please Please Please do not take a class with him because you wont get good grades nor understand mathematics.,0
"I took the online class. You definitely have to work but it is not too hard. Manageable for a full time class and work schedule. Everything is due on one day, which makes it nice to chip away at all the assignments throughout the week at your leisure. You do not need a textbook but you will be reading a lot every week.",1
"You should only expect an A in this class if you show up to every single class and are incredibly engaged. Don't be deceived by the .5 credit: there are many writing assignments and ""Engagement activities"" over the course of the semester (standard for all dance at duke?). This class was more of an extra academic burden than a dance class for me.",0
"To sum it up, Vannozzi was the absolute worst professor or teacher that I have ever had. He expects you to pass everything in on time, or you will lose 50% of the grade, but it takes him more than a month to pass back homework. He is impossible to make meetings with, he is unclear in his lectures and just does not know how to teach. DO NOT TAKE",0
"Always too busy to help students. Doesn't answer emails. Doesn't care about his students, especially graduate students who are trying to graduate. You have to beg and plead for an answer. I wish I had as good of an experience as some of these reviews, but he's the worst professor I've ever had. Maybe it would be better if he had an assistant.",0
"Great professor.  If you have a question outside class e-mail him and expect a response within a few hours.  Great guy, no attendance policy.  Be your own boss when it comes to learning speed and what you do and don't do for the class.  I loved it!  Would take him any day.",1
The weekly coursework consisted of readings and an exploratory discussion with responses. There is a group project in this class and a final paper. Gave easy As all semester and hit heavy on APA format for final paper.,1
"She always hands out updated deadlines for assignments. Assignments are typically very simple. Expect to do group work. Expect to have a big powerpoint/paper at end of class in place of a final. Good instructor, she has lots of career experience. I would recommend her/take her again.",1
"A wonderful human bean who actually cares, assessments are reasonable. You can joke around with him for the most part. Don't repeatedly click your pen.",1
"Never met him but he sounds nice in his email. Taking this online was a piece of cake. The textbook he used is crystal clear. He even dropped the final, I don't know if he does that all the time but he did when I took it.",1
"ENV 331 is an intro to sustainability course, but Lisa Jo really knows how to make it about building your awareness on the topic no matter how much you may or may not already know. She cares about her students, she cares about the topic, and she knows how to make you care, too. If you have a chance to sign up for one of her classes, don't hesitate.",1
"One of the best teachers for Stats. Much more into the context of the problems, than the formulas themselves. Easy going and attendance is only essential because its math and can get confusing if you don't stay up to date. I would take her for any math class. Lots of homework( statlab), but that is good when the exams roll around.",1
I loved going to class with Dr. Cutler even though I hated chemistry. I was honestly sad when it was over because I wouldn't have her as a professor anymore. She was amazing and I tell everyone to take chem from her.,1
"Annoying, tons of work, and rude. Hard to reach and messy, with an unorganized syllabus. Don't take her. 1/10 from me",0
"Labeled an MBIOS course, but MBIOS was not addressed. This course should be listed as sociology/anthropology. The class only discussed topics like poverty, women's rights, and mental trauma. Teacher assigns a ludicrous amount of reading and writing. You WILL spend every night typing papers and reading about topics not related to MBIOS. Awful class",0
He is the worst math teacher/professor I have ever had. His lectures teach you nothing. He doesn't ever really go over problems to help you understand how to solve them. His tests don't actually test on useful calculus. During class he uses the most convoluted methods to derive his answers. Do not take him. I warned you.,0
exams are difficult,0
"Amanda is an incredible professor and an amazing human being. She really knows her stuff and teaches in a very intense and meaningful way. She is not afraid to be a little tough on slackers, or, uh, really tough. Either way, she's a very powerful teacher. If you have the chance to take a class with her, TAKE IT!!",1
"He is very nice.  He will make you feel like he is judging your every move.  He will appreciate any contribution you make to discussion.  His syllabus, yes, is outdated and his grading is harsh, and he will try to make you care about stupid literature which no one cares about.  There is a lot of writing, and little room for extra credit.",0
"GET OUT WHILE YOU CAN!!! Wasinger does NOT care whether you pass or fail and doesn't care about you as a student/person. If you have to take her, my best advise is to record ALL of her lectures and listen to them over and over again and use the textbook for anything you don't understand.",0
"I found his class to be incredibly boring. The movies and discussion guides did not help me in any way other than wanting to not show up. His class is simple and easy to pass, but his teaching style is very uninteresting.",0
Awful,0
SSSSSuper good professor. Makes BA210 so easy to learn.,1
"Sears wants you to think, plain and simple. Memorization will get you nowhere. His classes have helped me with every other subject I have ever taken because he teaches you CRITICAL THINKING through the lens of immunobiology. This class is difficult, VERY difficult, but incredibly rewarding. He seems scary, but is actually a very kind and caring.",1
"Mr. Riley a good guy, but a not so good teacher. He flies through his powerpoints, virtually reading off the slide, and speaks without enthusiasm. He does give out semi-helpful worksheets, but over all I learned more reading the textbook than anything he actually taught up front.",0
"I had to learn everything from Khan Academy. I have no doubt he might be good in-person but online his videos are 10 minutes for what is supposed to be an hour lecture. He only does ONE problem per section, and his mind seems very scattered. I am not LEARNING from him. I feel like I'm being set up for failure for the future in his online course.",0
Do not take PHYS121 from anyone else. Dr. Westpfahl is a great professor. Tests are also pretty easy.,1
Dr. Krell is a very inconsistent grader.  He can be very hard on papers and other times he can be very easy.  I turned in one paper where I used a particular format for citations and got a great grade with no comments.  I used the same on a second paper and he tore it up and gave me much worse grade.  His message board posts are all over the place.,0
"Enjoys discussing Wacko Jacko.  Allows one open book, open note, open discussion test every semester (very helpful).  Very real, brash and sometimes crude.  She's a cop, not a teacher.  CJ majors, you'll love her.",1
Lectures straight from the book. One guy curled up on top of the table and went to sleep and she didn't care. Good teacher anyways,1
"Yulia is honestly very hard to understand. If you have never spoken french in your life, DO NOT TAKE HER!!!!!!! She has no patience or time for students that don't understand french. She also gets mad very easily when you talk OR use your phone. Overall a bad class that was difficult to get a B- in",0
"I took an online summer course with Professor Hegbloom. She seems nice enough, but none of the work I submitted was graded until there was just a few days left in the summer semester. Considering the course is only one month long, it was frustrating to have no idea how I was doing the entire time and to receive zero feedback whatsoever.",0
"I usually wait until the end of the semester to review teachers but so far, Alice has been the BEST online class I HAVE EVER TAKEN. She is helpful, friendly, understanding, and even at 12AM, responds to emails lightning fast!! What is clear: she cares deeply about her students and genuinely wants them to succeed. Thank You Professor Stevens!!",1
Very relaxed professor who knows Music Appreciation. It's a great class.,1
Don't even bother with this professor... if you struggle with math don't take her.,0
Professor Fry did a great job teaching statistics.  His grading is fair and he is very helpful.  He brought Scratch Cup-cakes for our final.,1
"All in all a decent teacher, however, his accent makes it quite difficult at times to follow along in lectures and understand content. LOTS of quizzes, 2-3 a week.",0
"His class is not for ""average"" CS students. To pass his class you either have to work hard or have access to hw/test ahead of time. Unless you understand every hw like the back of your head, you are likely to get a 0/50 on his tests. His hws are long, tricky and borderline un-doable without google. If you're forced to take him, Good Luck!",0
Be prepared to teach yourself everything or get a tutor. When you ask to get help on a question he will not help you and look at you like you should know everything. He doesn't give you credit for any homework if you miss the class period they checked it in no matter the circumstances.,0
"I love this professor, his grading is easy and not so persist on format.",1
"The WORST professor I've EVER had! absolutely does not care about students success, unhelpful, does not reply to emails and or calls, extremely rude and inconsiderate. AVOID TAKING HIM PROFESSOR AT ALL COSTS!!!",0
"Dont get me wrong, shes a nice Prof as a person.",0
"She was wonderful! I'm not one for these type of courses but she made the class fun, and the readings she choose were amazing! There are essays, but she is always available to help and guidance if you ask. I'm a mediocre writer at best but she helped me through the course. Participation matters! She will know if you don't sing along to Clementine!",1
"He's great to take for an animation class, but when you suck at drawing, you better drop the class. He is absolutely impossible to talk to outside of class, and his classroom wasn't the greatest focus environment for me, so I only attended if there was something important. He doesn't really tell you what he grades on either. Just gives you a grade.",0
He is supporter to you. If you trust yourself you can pick him,1
"She took a whole month before posting grades, she makes smart/offensive remarks when answering questions, grades every quiz differently (can have the same answers as others, Some will get it correct while others get them wrong) and gets mad when students point out her mistakes.",0
Demands alot but knows the information and cares. Tests are not easy but the class was rewarding in the long run.,1
"he is not helpful at all,",0
"Doesn't reply emails, doesn't want to help students, doesn't respect international students",0
"worst professor at IUPUI hands down I will avoid him like the plague. He cannot communicate in written or spoken at all and does not understand how student understand material. thinks what he teaches is easy, and then thinks we all understand every word he says. Stay away from him!",0
"DO: show up to class, take good notes, WileyPlus online hw, study for tests DON'T: be late, use phone/technology, ask questions b/c she won't answer them well Tests are all based on her notes and are relatively hard b/c it covers a lot of material. She's awful with technology, kind of scary yet kind of nice, but overall good teacher.",1
"Pointless class, lectures are boring.  The teacher doesn't seem motivated to teach the class.",0
"Out of the 20+ graduate courses I have taken, this has been the worst class. A lot of (outdated) readings (especially for an instructor who insists materials for the course paper be no more than 5 years old). Minimal work for a grad course. Not challenging for a graduate course either. And who gives tests at the graduate level??",0
"NLP is a great course. I've never taken a class from a professor so genuinely interested in the topic they were teaching. Lectures are very interesting and the assignments are challenging without being ridiculous. Overall, not too difficult.",1
"This class was WAY too hard for a GE. The lectures were boring, and we had a group project that was worth 29% of our grade. The project was anthropology oriented, which had nothing to do with what we were learning in the class. We also had 5 exams while other professors had none. If you have other options, take the class with someone else.",0
Not a huge fan of her. She is very uninterested when you approach her with specific questions or are in need of help. Her midterm was nearly impossible. I studied all the lectures/notes I took in class and readings for hours and hours & still did not know 80% of the questions on the exam. She assigns SUCH long readings and there are always quizzes,0
Just terrible. Does not teach well nor have respect for students.,0
Very knowledgeable professor. He knows his stuff. Only problem is that he goes too fast when showing his slides. His exams are half the quiz and half class notes. Very hard class. Must be willing to memorize a lot of information.,0
Really helpful! Best chem professor so far.,1
She teaches very nicely. I dont have any problem with her language or accent because she actually teaches very deeply and nice.,1
"I had Ms. Quinn for both my English Comp I and Comp II classes, and I couldn't ask for a more kind or caring woman as my teacher.  She genuinely cares about her job and her students, and she teaches so well that one retains the information to help them throughout their college career. Expects students to put forth a decent effort as well. A+",1
"Professor Maynard is a pretty dry as a professor. She is not very flexible with assignments, projects etc. She knows what shes talking about but cannot easily relate to students. Lots of reading. No textbook since its online.",0
"I dont know about these ratings but, she required online text which was highly expensive and ridiculous and weekly quizzes. Pointless to go class but yet she takes role. Mostly for under division students. Overall, very bubbly personality",0
"Her lectures can be pretty vague - often they are based around literary-philosophical concepts such as 'form' and 'nature' that are not very well-explained. As a result, it can sometimes feel like she is talking in great detail about something that nobody (even the TA's) have a grasp on.",0
Very knowledgable. Went through essays with the professor but failed them each time. Have to give yourself a few days to do the quizzes with them being very long and difficult. Would suggest meeting with her very often to go over your essays over and over till she's very happy with it. Would suggest to show up to every class.,0
"Quizzes/test straight from the powerpoints. Didn't need them, though. However... case studies suck, are different from text problems, and don't expect her nor the TA to help, either. She never helped in discussions or private email. I guess she expects the online students to automatically understand the studies, which are 18 points of final grade.",0
"Dr. Sleem is a ""no-nonsense"" professor that is consistent and expects you to listen and participate his classes. No matter how much you may think you know about computers, he can show you shortcuts  that you had no idea existed. His classes are fun because everyone participates, and he shows you exactly what he expects you to do. You must study!",1
"Worst class I have ever been in, your grade will be determined by three impossible tests and problem sets that are worth about 1% of the final grade. He is is all over the place. Problem sets can only be answered using all of his links, good luck with that. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS/PROFESSOR",0
"Hes a good professor. Tells jokes, teaches real life application of trigonometric functions and is very interested in the topic. Overall awesome teacher.",1
"I have taken multiple courses with Nancy and did well in all of them. Fair warning though, Nancy does not care about her students and has no interest in helping you succeed, even when you make an effort and/or are a good student. The classes are worthwhile, if you put in the work you will learn, but expect to do it without her support. ",0
"Jaycy is an amazing lecturer with a great personality, however, her exams are killer. She purposely makes them hard, but she provides extra credit! 1 midterm, 1 final, 13-14 discussion questions, one group project, and a final paper. Participation matters, so go to class. Getting an A in this class is not so easy, she makes you work for it!",1
"This lady was the biggest you-know-what to me, for reasons unknown. The only assignments are pieces of the ending research paper, which was nice, but if you don't get a C on the end paper, you fail the whole class (not her fault, it's policy). She made me change my topic at the last minute, after numerous meetings throughout the semester.",0
"He is a nice person but not so good at lecturing. He is a really strict grader, who has really high expectation to his students. I don't think I will take his course again, because there are so many mandatory small projects. This course is very labor intensive.",0
"Had her for litho, then I had Brian and learned how to do litho.  She didn't teach us things, like how to scrape the rollers, and what the chemistry of litho is... basically came out with an idea of the medium but not any proficiency.  not recommended.",0
"Brown is the worst professor probably to walk the planet. He doesn't give two craps about his students. Four tests make up 95% of your grade. His lectures do not make any sense, as he gets side tracked VERY easily. He makes a confusing topic even more confusing, never answers emails, and overall is just very rude.",0
"She's such a nice person and takes time to learn your name. However, I would not recommend this professor. Lectures are very fast paced and EXTREMELY hard to follow. You need to be in class for the material to make any sense, and it's a tough class to want to attend. Expects you to read 5 books throughout the semester and have 4 tests. Would avoid.",0
"Very knowledgeable, gives clear explanations, and current developments are important to her. Although she's tough as nails at first, she's clear on her expectations of you as a student and shows she wants you to succeed, not only in her class, but in future accounting classes as well. Lots of ""big picture"" thinking. Keep up with your readings!!",1
"Jeanette is one of the most vague professors imaginable. All questions are answered in an impossibly ambivalent manner. Grading is also very subjective. Overall, though, she knows what she is talking about and will better prepare you for the world of business.",0
Possibly the single stupidest individual I've ever been unfortunate enough to encounter.,0
She expects a lot of memorization. SHE DOES NOT LET YOU USE FORMULA CHARTS FOR THE EXAM! You would have to learn the formulas by memory :( She's not a great teacher. Don't take her.,0
HES THE WORST TEACHER EVER AND VERY DISRESPECTFUL,0
"Kelm is one of the best Spanish professors I have ever had. In general he is very laid back. I struggle with Spanish and his class was an easy A. His exams are straightforward, if you study and have a basic understanding you'll be fine. Tip: when taking the exam stay after class and he should help you.",1
"This class was not worth taking. I didn't enjoy the class at all, if you don't understand something he yells and slams his hands down on the table. He is very rude and doesn't help you understand anything in the course. The course itself is hard if you don't understand the materiel and has a lot of math work in it.  Maybe try another teacher.",0
"He's a natural at teaching, and math is his passion. You can see it in his lectures, he's so good at explaining every subject and wants to do what he can to help you pass. The best professor you could ask for.",1
"This Proff was absolutely amazing! She made learning about qualitative and quantitative research in Social Work interesting. Very helpful, and responded to emails promptly. Overall it was a pleasure being in her class! :)",1
This might be the easiest 3 credits you will get in your academic career. He is entertaining and the slides provided are all you need to get through the class. Take this class if you need 3 science non-lab credits.,1
"Took him online via Zoom. His lectures are sometimes a little scattered, but he is a nice guy and lets you know exactly what you need to know for the exam. Participation helps you understand the info better and he gives extra credit for it. Just keep up with the online homework and quizzes and practice before exams and you should be fine.",1
"Super fun if you engage her, just participate in class and you will do fine.",1
I took this class online. Soooooo much work! I mean I get it it's college but we had 2 or more quizzes every week plus an assignment on top of that. Quizzes only worth 10 points of total grade. A lot of group work too. Would not take another class of hers,0
"Isabelle seemed really nice and she was probably nervous as she told us it was her first time lecturing for such a large class but man..... she basically just read off the slide, all her own statements were just reworded what she had just said, and she was extremely confusing. There was stuff on the exam we NEVER covered. Goin to class not worth it",0
"Very difficult exams. He makes it harder than it should be. Tests questions had very little to do with his lectures. The 2 papers were long but not too difficult. He's a nice guy but exams were just horrible. If you take this class with him, you really have to know your bio stuff. This class really made me think about switching majors",0
Tom is like an awkward teddy bear who happens to kick butt at all things math. He is the best teacher I've encountered at Duke. He reduces complicated math lingo to clear concepts. He's also super approachable and has hilarious dry humor. Definitely do not miss lecture; he teaches diff than the textbook. Understand EVERYTHING before testing. A+++++,1
"Prof Chang is cool and interesting, but his class can be extremely disorganized. Your grade depends completely on attendance and answering iClicker questions during lecture. He brings in guests, which is always fun. You have to go see two outside shows, but one is free. Interesting subject, but very disjointed class structure.",1
"Professor Ball does not give a lot of homework. He also doesn't require his students to buy a code or book. The work he gives out is so easy and his lectures are interesting. I never was good at math but his class helped a lot. And he is hilarious! Take him, I promise you won't regret it!!!!!",1
"Professor Adams gives very delayed feedback and is not good with responding to inquiries. There are unclear expectations for assignments, yet she grades harshly. Very critical. ",0
"Pretty solid guy. It's pretty obvious he wants to make sure students feel well respected in the classroom. Don't have your phone out, show up to class, do the online homework, and raise your hand every now and then, you should be fine. You have to put the work in though, but then again, you have to do that in every foreign language class.",1
"Although he tries really hard to make students understand,this class is tough and it only gets tougher.I relied heavily on online and textbook for this class rather than lecture. I don't recommend him.",0
"Basically just reads of PowerPoint slides. Tests/Projects/HWs are extremely easy. Very accessible outside of class + very caring towards all students. He is glad to help you any time. The class would be better if he taught more advanced stuff, wouldn't just read off slides, and make us learn more contemporary Java frameworks.",0
Heather is an awesome professor. She is very clear tells you exactly what is on the exam. Doesn't test over the book only the notes. She compares to real life examples and makes it easier to understand material. Would definitely take her again if i got the option. Sometimes gives extra credit for attending lectures,1
"Although the class is easy, she will decrease your mark just to respect the York University bell curve policy. She is UNFAIR, her lectures are boring, she doesn't give more than 80 on the presentations, she does not care for students. She's very fake and will smile at you but won't hesitate to decrease your mark. NEVER TAKING A CLASS WITH HER AGAIN",0
"Her personality likes to change on a dime, from pure positivity and joyfulness to yelling at someone if they come in a little late. Your grade counts mostly on the essays, and it isn't easy.",0
"Jody is an not that good of a prof. She's very strict and not understanding at all. There are so many assignments and so much reading. You are expected to remember every single detail for every quiz. Be prepared to pull all-nighters for this class. I usually love/look forward to english, but it pained me to come to this class.",0
"Very interesting class, had ""pop"" quizzes at least once a week. If you dont do the reading then there is no way you will pass. No midterms or finals but you have 3 papers to write. Participation in class is a good way to get an easy A in a big chunk of the final grading. Very interesting teacher",1
"Basically a self-teach class. She reads straight off the slides and is very unorganized. There is a quiz after every chapter, she speeds through every chapter so the quizzes are every other day. She says she's always available but has never once responded to my emails. Didn't learn much either. Just study and you're likely to pass.",0
"Although professor Villanueva is very experienced and knowledgeable in the subject, she does lack the understanding that students already have a demanding workload and has chosen to make it increasingly difficult. Especially in the midst of a pandemic she continues to grade harshly and make major assignments due two days apart.",0
She was always sick and blowing her nose. Other than that very kind and understanding.,0
"Posted a file that got corrupted and didn't repost till the day of the quiz on it, never answers emails outside of her 1:30 hour office hours. You will hate this class if you expect it to be easy or interesting. If i could give her a zero i would.",0
She is making students right now (during a pandemic) get a camera for the computer due to academic integrity issues. Some people have autoimmune diseases some have financial situations where they can't spend money on items like that. I think its fine enough to use lockdown browser but really a camera? I hope she realizes what she is doing is wrong.,0
"This man is a real gem. He is by far the best anthro professor on this campus and one of the best professors in general. He always makes class interesting and enjoyable. He makes you work for your grade, but if you show effort you'll be fine. He is one of the nicest people ever and is always ready to listen if you have a problem. 100% recommend.",1
"Reading isn't necessary, so you really don't have to put much work into this class for the first half of the semester. However, after that, you have two big research assignments. Requirements are excessive for an elective course and while she is clear about her expectations, they are very high and she will take off points. Follow rubrics closely",0
"you cover 3 easy chapters in the first 8 weeks of class and then 5 hard chapters in the second 8 weeks of the class. Honestly this guy is a joke, when asked why something is the way it is he just says it is the way it is. 5% of your grade is automatically gone when you start the class because your ""participation"" grade which will be 0% at the end.",0
"I have never once had any issues with any professors at Clark, but Jamey Marsh is not one that I would recommend taking. I would not say that Professor Marsh cares about his students success because he purposefully sets you up to fail. He is not helpful when it comes to trying to understand what you got wrong, and you only pass because of the curve",0
"The professor is very nice, helpful, and provides feedback but instructions are always unclear. Make sure to clarify everything otherwise you will be stuck. Pretty easy but boring class as long as you attend class, do the work and work with your group.",1
"She is a very ambiguous teacher, so expect to have to go to office hours if you want to know what she is looking for. If you like a structured class, I would not recommend her.",1
"He gives a lot of assignments and doesn't always grade quickly, but it's not hard at all to get an A in his class. Also had to complain about a group member going AWOL and he took it into account and went even easier on us. Also midterm is take home, and no real final. Strongly recommend overwriting each assignment and adding details from class",1
"Honestly, wasn't terrible, lectures are pretty boring and the tests are all written questions, no multiple choice and it is not the easiest. The only reason it was okay is because he was super lenient about letting me turn in assignments over a month late and got full credit.",1
.,0
"Makes you work for grade but very easy to contact, clear methods. Lots of assignments over all but helps you understand the lessons. 4 oral presentations, quizes after every chapter and tests. Some group tests. Go to class and do the homework. Very nice and very understanding",1
Just not good take somebody else lame boring. Thompson does a terrible job as a professor he just stands back and does nothing most of the time.,0
"The material is interesting, but I would have taken it with someone else. His lectures and his notes are unclear and not very helpful. You won't understand anything unless you read the book before class. He thinks he's funny.",0
Lecture does not cover what is tested. Discussion sections are poorly structured. She is by far the worst lecturer I have had in my 4 years at BU,0
"Moshe is definitely a professor who has high expectations for his students. His lectures on Tuesdays were great, videos too, as were the discussions surrounding cases on Thursdays. Tests and case write-ups were difficult. The project at the end excellently wrapped up our learning and was quite rewarding. He's good, the class is pretty hard.",1
I loved Mr. Goodman's class. Although he is quite monotone (and he knows it) he is a great teacher. I would recommend this professor to anyone!,1
"Feedback is rude and condescending, makes you feel stupid even when you get the right answer. I was told I used the word ""or"" wrong",0
"Quizzes are basically all trick questions. Multiple choice questions on the final are mainly straightforward, but some questions are tricky. The short answer questions on the final are about the most irrelevant details out of all the material that was covered (when you're studying, everything you think is useless is probably one of the questions).",0
"Lazy & unfocused on his end while very harsh in grading... Like... OMG! Material is all over the place between vids, lectures, and chapter material and they don't always line up - very hard to tell the interpretation he wants! This wouldn't be so bad if 50% of the grade wasn't based on a dozen questions split between 2 exams.",0
This was by far the hardest class I have taken. All of his work is close together. The good thing is he realizes that and works with you on the time frame. Be prepared to STUDY!!! He does not allow enough time for quizzes and exams and they are extremely difficult!,0
"Rude and unhelpful. After I did poorly on the first test, I asked for help with coursework and all he said was ""so are you going to drop the class or not.?"" Obviously  I should've as I failed the course and had to change majors anyways.",0
"His class is deceptively hard. You don't realize it until you start preparing for the exams. He likes comparative long answer questions, with some multiple choice questions. I suggest stay on top of the characteristics for each taxon in the form of a table throughout the term. He was really passionate about the plants. Good professor. ",1
"She is definitely one of the worst teachers. Shes super rude and does not have that teacher compassion aspect. She does not care about fixing her own mistakes. When asking about correctness on assignments/grades, she totally dismisses what you are telling her when its HER fault that an assignment/grade is incorrect.",0
"Well arounded, understanding, humorous, down to earth kinda guy, understands that**** happens so fair with late work",1
"all over the place, hard to follow, nothing makes sense. Nice lady",0
"She was not very helpful to someone who doesnt do well in math. Her grading was unnecessarily tough and she gave a lot of homework.  We only had 3 tests and one group project, though the project didn't even count as a test grade. I found some of her comments were rather rude and unjustified. Overall poor experience and would not suggest taking her.",0
He makes me hate finance. Don't take his courses!,0
"Dr. Curtis is hilarious and informative! Read textbook, tests are super hard if you don't! Tests are only multiple choice but you need to read book! The first test is the most difficult, seek help from a tutor to make it a lot easier!! She's the best but can be a tad scatterbrain. Write down every grade you receive & make sure final grade matches.",1
"If you are a student with accommodations do not take this professor ! When simply informing her about my accommodations of extra time she acted completely unprofessional and did not understand why I needed this extra time, when clearly I have a reason approved by the SSD office! Terrible experience all around!",0
"As a Human Resources major I was very disappointed. Her lectures are rushed and vague, her online tests have nothing to do with the slides she presents, and the criteria for the group project is illogical. It's not a difficult class, but she doesn't know what she's talking about. Needless to say, I expected more from a PhD in Human Resources.",0
"Super nice lady, and very understanding when we had to switch over to online because of COVID-19. Beware, though, lots of the course is just how to use a calculator and it's hard to find help for it online, so you have to go to class to understand.",1
"If you would like to learn anything, don't take this class.  She is rude and tries to make students look dumb. She plagiarizes test and won't be able to answer your questions without Google. Her answers to tests are wrong and won't fix them. Didn't pass any test. She shouldn't be a professor. 90% of class failed. Didn't use online access at all.",0
He's a bad Prof that doesn't know how to teach material. He also showed some kids email in class to everyone saying that he was sick and wanted to email his assignments. Rick then complained about the email for ten minutes. Basically a volleyball coach that for what ever reason for what ever reason was able to land a job as a Prof.,0
"Great teacher, just make sure you complete the assignments by the due date and follow the directions carefully and you will get an A.",1
"Reads off powerpoint, doesn't explain anything. When she tries explaining she messes up and only confuses you more. Students corrected her on every quiz and exam because there was something wrong. Heavy accent which makes her more difficult. No curving, class grades are set lower although. Easiest Ochem professor at CSU although,just teach yourself",0
Most awful degrading teacher. Fails students at all opportunities. extremely unclear grading criteria. often does not show up to her own lectures. picks on students for incorrect answers. if you don't participate in class discussions she will call you out on it. clicks her teeth constantly.,0
"Professor Egan is the man. For Eating Ethics, he's a great professor. The lectures are interesting, and he basically gives you an A for attending class. You have to try harder to not get the A in this class. Plus its 4 credits, requires some writing work in recitation, but other than that the class is soooooo easy. Def. a GPA booster, take it!!!!!!",1
"Soil science is a relatively boring topic but Dr. Ptak makes it interesting, attendance isn't mandatory but its a lab based class so if you want a good grade you need to show up.  We go outside to take samples a lot which is nice because it makes class go a lot faster.  The grading is tough but fair, do the work and you should do well.",1
"Teacher doesn't seem like he wants to teach. He's out of the class more than he's in class. He leaves you to fend for yourself -- your grade really reflects what you do on your own to figure out the material. If you don't know the material, try to find a buddy in the class that knows what he/she is doing!",0
"Math is difficult for me. Mr. C made it easy to understand. Show up to class, do your work, ask questions, stop crying and blaming, do your due diligence and you get at least a B which is what I earned. First time I earned more than a C in math since high school.",1
Keval is a decent/mediocre professor. It should have been a fairly easy course but somehow she made it very difficult when it came to grading.,1
"Does not teach. Goes on tangets related to his political agenda. He does not walk through problems, better off reading the text yourself and not attending class.",0
Shon is a great person and really does care about his students however his teaching style is very hit or miss. He puts excel on the board and tells us to print it out so we can write out our own notes on it but his edits throughout the class are too much and hard to keep up with. I learned more from teaching it to myself than from class.,1
"Dan is absolutely amazing. He is very thorough in class with his lectures, and you can tell he truly wants everyone to be successful in his class. Doing the homework is a good idea because most of his problems on tests/quizzes are very similar to the ones he gives for homework. If you show up and participate in class he'll love you.",1
"I had her for my first and ONLY online class and she was extremely rude. I wasn't handling the online environment well and let her know that, but she wasn't receptive. She would send out email reminders for class discussion but not for quizzes!? She gave others full points for writing a sentence or two on discussion, so feel free to slack on that.",0
"Nice professor overall, but as a student trying to do good in biology, please DO NOT take this professor. Test are all free response questions. Up to 8 chapters in one test. Almost impossible to pass. Lectures are unorganized, and she does not seem to care about helping her students succeed with the little/zero guidance she gives her students.",0
Marks is not a teacher I would recommend. All we do in class is read the book then do homework online which is not helpful at all. I hate going to class and he is a very tough grader. It has made me loathe Spanish this semester. He is nice but just not a good teacher.,0
DO NOT EVER SIGN UP FOR THIS PROFESSOR. He is not interesting or interested. He will not work with you. He thinks the only reason you exist is for his class. There were massive withdrawals for my class. I am an A+ student and I was getting C-. DO NOT BELIEVE THE OTHER COMMENTS OR YOU WILL REGRET IT.,0
This class is so confusing had extremely hard!!! I'll probably have to retake it this course but not with her!!!!!!!!!,0
"Professor Hays is a wonderful teacher. He is very helpful, keeps class interesting and keep you thinking. His use of videos and class discussions kept class from being boring. I can not wait to take another class with him.",1
"I was so looking forward to this class, in the beginning. I enjoy writing, after all. Unfortunately, this teacher is boring, rude, and is unwilling to help her students. Do not take this class, it is unnecessarily difficult.",0
"After 60 hours worth of classes, she is by far the worst professor I've ever had. I took the summer session A&P course and it was the most sporadic and unorganized class ever. She would loose our graded papers,  biased when it came to essay questions, and overall rude to students. She would make you feel unreasonably incompetent if you asked a ?.",0
"Lectures were extremely boring and completely one sided. She refuses to accept the opinions or statements that are different than her own. Not very approachable and kind of rude to students as well! Will never take another one of her classes again, thats for sure!",0
"I've had Dr. O'G twice now, and I like him a lot. He is a nice and very smart guy. He knows a lot about the stuff he teaches and he is passionate about it as well. With him being a liberal and me being a republican, he was always respectful and never looked down on me for that. The only thing is that his tests suck, but he does give partial credit!",1
Chase was a good professor. Although I think he could improve on wording his tests better.,1
nice woman just hard to understand and has a bad structure to teaching the class. she rushes the notes and is impossible to keep up with.,0
"if i had to guess, the worst physics professor at this school",0
The online class 'Intro to Islamic Civilization' was an absolute mess; quiz questions were from material not yet covered or material that was never covered and the prof tries way too hard to be funny. I really feel that I learned almost nothing from this class and online the prof does not look as hot as some have previously posted,0
"Personable professor but the way she teaches is awful. Did not have a course outline, made up assignments along the way and did not stay on course topic enough. Always late and was a tough grader in a course that was meant to be a grade booster. She asked us what we wanted to have for assignments during the class. Multiple things due at same time.",0
"Take this course if you want to be treated like a high school student. Students worried more about his harsh grading instead of learning or improving their work. He likes to hear himself speak so classes will feel never-ending. If you disagree with him, you will not get good grades.",0
"Favourite lecture of my day. Jeff was interesting to listen to, and seemed to enjoy the content he was teaching. Doesn't care if you come to class or not, but I would recommend attending, as he really takes time to explain calculations and charts. He gets a bit miffed if you have conversations in class, so keep it to a whisper.",1
Tests are rediculous. Cheat sheets dont help because he  has stuff on tests that you have never seen before. Sucks at teaching/and tries to fail everyone,0
Best professor at mercy. Knows the material like the back of his hand. Willing to go above and beyond to help students pass not only his class but other classes as well.,1
"Heavy workload. I've always loved my Spanish Professors, but she was something else. Very difficult to communicate with, very harsh grader, very abrasive. I didn't feel like language learning was the priority; pure academics was. New languages are difficult and unless you have an excellent knowledge of the Spanish Language, be cautious.",0
Lectures are useless but random assignments count for 15% of your grade.  Layoun likes to preach ideas that are painfully obvious or that are way too out there.  Lecture consists mostly of putting up passages from the reading and having her read them.  Lots of reading if you actually do it.  easy overall.,0
super sweet.,1
"The textbook used for this class is severely outdated and the professor could catch up with the times as well. Not a good professor for an online environment and honestly feels very checked out, not helpful at all. The course material was extremely dry and boring. I spent the semester counting down until it would end.",0
"Professor Blair was the best teacher I've had in a very long time. She is thoughtful, helpful and so knowledgeable! I enjoyed every assignment we had in the class and she gave such great feedback to each individual student. I liked writing before this class but I found a new love for it during her class! I hope I can take another course from her!",1
"Often explains concepts in ways that just confuse many students; I frequently spent time with classmates re-explaining the concept because Selgrad just rants. He just spouts his knowledge, which is never absorbed because he doesn't provide students with enough opportunities to program. It's a lot of wasted time, but still leagues above Chen.",0
"Silva is a legend. I had a crazy math fear and he helped me a lot. Theres a crazy amount of homework, but it's free points. they're easy and most have multiple attempts. His tests were fair and he was really good at engaging and explaining.",1
Dr. Fujita speaks in such an awkward tone that it it difficult to understand.  I learned everything in my workshop in which the leader did not have anything good to say about her either.  She makes multiple mistakes on her tests. I have had three and there have been at least 2 MAJOR mistakes on each,0
DO NOT TAKE THIS IF you are new to concordia or struggle with doing research. He will not care much if you are in course based stream he only will to care for ones who can invent things like him. Very ignorant to people who workhard he loves talented students and will reward them extra marks. You WILL GET COMPARED WITH THESIS BASED people so DONT,1
Very poor attitude towards students. Weighting of material on test was very unfair. Students were given the opportunity to give feedback after the test. Dr. Balshine was only willing to listen to positive comments and when anyone made a negative comment (true and valid) about something she had done she rudely shot them down and ignored this input,0
"Definitely would not recommend a professor who Is unclear with assignments , finals and quizzes. He made this class harder than it needed to be. God forbid you bring up a topic he does not like. As mentioned before, he makes his quizzes and finals COMPLICATED. Not that I dont expect this with professors, but he went overboard.",0
This was my least favorite college class and one that I got the lowest grade in. Professor Guerrero is a nice guy who wants to help his students but misses the mark by so much. This class was so hard. You end up teaching yourself if you want to pass with this professor.,0
"Noris is a nice guy, knowledgeable, and makes Human Physiology very interesting. He is addictive, I actually looked forward to every class. The class covers a wide array of topics in physiology. Quizzes every Tuesday and he tells you whats on the quiz, so a voice recorded is highly recommended. It is an easy class. There is one research paper.",1
"His short fic class definitely requires the text book, as you must read every assigned story outside of class and bring a typed response for each of them every class, as the story and the students responses will shape the DEEP whole class discussion. Besides that, there are two major essays in the semester based on textbook as well + the exams.",1
terrible.,0
She is nice but unprepared. Most students are confused and remain confused at end of class. Expectsyou to read and understand content before teaching it. Gives homework and a lot of power points.  You feel you are doing all the work alone.  In clinical she expect you to be an experienced nurse.,0
"Six hours of class without a break. The scores of my assignments were almost same as my classmates, but I got C they got B or A-. He doesn't reply email or messages until the day of the class next week. I chose his class because he is the only professor in the summer.",0
"Possibly the worst professor ever. So unprepared. She'd come to each class, and just ramble. She showed up for two of the tests without a test. Once, she had us write the tests ourselves in groups and then she READ them back to us, and gave us about a minute to answer each question. Her excuse? She was training us to be professors. Awful!",0
He's a really good teacher. Lectures are fun and time goes by fast in the class. Would recommend.,1
"One of my favorite professors I've ever had. She's young, makes class a blast. SO smart and passionate. If you don't like to write- ABORT MISSION. You will write from day 1 til the very end. Homework, homework, homework. But as long as you try, and keep up with the work, you'll be fine. Very lenient, very helpful. Gives great critiques. Take her!",1
"She was very active in the class and easy to ask questions to. Taught clearly, and gave clear instruction and was thought provoking. Followed the rubric to a T. This class required 3 three page papers, but wasn't difficult. ",1
"I took his summer Calculus II class and it was very organized. He'll spend the extra time to make sure everyone understands what's going on; lectures are straightforward. As long as you keep up with the homework quizzes and tests aren't that bad, though he likes to test on details. Didn't grade too harshly. Really liked his passion for the subject.",1
"The worst professor I have ever had, doesn't explain anything talks really fast. Do not take her for Int. Algebra!",0
One of the best teachers for language I've had so far.  Extremely recommended teacher.,1
"Dr. Bottomley is very passionate about being an Engineer.  She is so influential and she has really inspired me, as a girl, to engage in the profession and go against the female stereotypes.  I really enjoyed learning from her.  As for the class itself, you have a semester project to work on outside of class and you learn about cool stuff in class.",1
"I'm reading the comments and I wonder if this is the same teacher I took. Overall I would say pay attention and if you don't get it then maybe programing isn't for you. Don't skip class to much or you'll fall behind. You need the book. She has a Mexican accent, but it is understandable. I learned a lot from her 1436 and 1437 classes. Good teacher.",1
I loved his lectures regarding the influences of religion in politics and politics on religion. He can come off as condescending and a bit arrogant but he is brilliant.  This class will require students to work but you do end up learning a lot. You get the grade based on the work you put in though. ,1
Okay teacher I guess,1
"By far the worst and most boring professor I have had here. The lectures drag on for hours and it's essentially a compilation of random facts barely stitched together. The two exams are made up from the books, and the notes in class are worthless and confusing. The lecture is mostly just rambling and videos. Do not take for an easy A.",0
a,0
"Mr. S. is one of the best instructors I've had during my 3 years at SLU. His lectures are clear and easy to follow.  Quizzes are easy if you've done the reading. Exams are reasonable and there are great study guides. You can tell he's excited about the material. Overall, a fun class!",1
"ridiculous grading. Math is universal, but not for him. You not only have to learn math, but also HIS math. He wants you to copy exactly as he does it. Very discouraging as he states that not even D is guaranteed. Avoid. He says and believes that calc is hard and that most people will fail. If you want to succeed, get someone that believes you can.",0
She does not prepare you the at all for anything. As a result the class has a failing average!SWITCH OUT if you have the chance!,0
"Was really hard in the beginning, and slowly start to not care? He let the students teach each other which isnt exactly helpful to every? but not really lecture like. The class seemed like a high school class...",0
"Classes are boring, tough and late grading... Get ready to warm coding skills before semester starts. Otherwise hard to catch up !",0
Professor Washburn is the best teacher at LACC. I highly recommend her. Took her for CD 42 and CD 30 and I got A's both class. Love her classes.,1
"Went completely off the course schedule and scheduled tests and assignments so they were only available on weekends. While her courses were well scripted, she could or would not answer questions. Classes quickly dissolved into tech issues (zoom era, I hope this is over when you're reading this) and into arguments with students.",0
"He was kinda of boring, but knowledgeable. Just a midterm, final, and discussion attendance determines your grade. You don't need the book since he has handouts. Hope you get a good TA, since they grade everything. He has a very very generous curve!",1
"Had Kraszewski back in the mid-00's(!) for Honors Lit.  Even now, I can still remember him ranting about the computer being an, ""evil Satanic contraption.""  :D  Anyway, the guy is amazing as a prof - knew 4-5 languages, and could make dull subject matter come alive.  Seriously, he is a walking wealth of knowledge, and very effective as a teacher.",1
He's A good teacher,1
"Inexperienced, does not give feedback on assignments or quizzes, if there is a technical difficulty it is the students fault, does not have office hours expects communication to be done through emails but does not respond, does not post assignments when she says she will, poorly organized",0
I loved him. He made everything so easy to understand. Plus he's cute,1
Professor Freeman is one of the best profs I've ever taken at UW. He is very caring and understanding of students lives' and lectures are super clear + he's enthusiastic and cute LOL. Class is based on a few assignments and group project. Available if you need him. The class was hard as a beginner new to coding but he is very approachable,1
Ms. Moss is a wonderful instructor and very easily accessible and ready to answer any questions you may have. her PP are VERY informative and the tests rely heavily on the information in those. Read the slides and you'll do just fine! She even gives the option of sending your exam answers prior to submission for verification of clarity/correctness,1
"Nice guy but I didn't exactly enjoy him as a professor. Loves the sound of his own voice and grades as if you should know everything he knows, whether you learned it in his class or not",0
Professor Liggin is extremely qualified to teach this course. His industry and classroom experience allow him to effectively teach how to read and understand complex plans and do take-offs. He is absolutely very organized and straightforward in his lectures. Even his bold language and character goes a long way in keeping the class engaged.,1
She gives good lectures - a lot of detail- but her tests are so difficult! She uses very obscure quotes and themes.,0
"lots of work, but you learn tons. grades papers really tough,and he likes daily pop quizzes on 40 pg. reading assignments; he's an officer who doesnt let the mids off easy",1
"Jon is a great professor. I've taken several classes from him. He does expect a lot from his students (which is fair because he teaches upper division classes). He is great at responding to emails and giving good feedback. Although his class is hard, it is SO worth taking. Just be sure to get a good group. This will make your live so much easier!",1
"gosh, everything people have said was right, i had him his last semester here, class started with 35 ended with 13, the rest withdrew, i was one of them, if that tells you anything about how terrible of a teacher he was, thank god hes gone.",0
"the best teacher around.full of wisdom.his jokes are funny and tells stories. I wish I could take more classes from him.he's a good teacher, willing to teach his students to use logic.very smart good at teaching..if you want a good teacher take Mr. James West.No doubt the one of the few good teachers out there.Take him and you'll never forget him.",1
"The assignments given were very confusing, and not much information is given to complete the assignments. I would not take this class if you are looking for a GPA booster as you put in a lot more work than expected for a first-year course. Would not recommend.",0
"Horrible attitude towards students, demeaning, and insulting. Could not wait to get out of that class.",0
Unrealistic expectations for his students.  INSANELY HARD!,0
Undoubtedly one of the best professors in the MAE department. Clearly cares deeply about his students learning and understanding not just general concepts but everything that he says. Puts aside extra class time just for reclarification of material and questions people have. No textbook but his notes are so well done they are better than a textbook,1
lectures are for videos. the content you teach yourself with the textbook so may as well take it online. weekly quiz based on textbook questions so absolutely need the textbook. overall was very boring but easy class,0
"He might be the worst person to gain the privilege of earning a Ph.D. This dude is so unorganized its unreal, he doesn't know what time his class is. Do not take him if you are a student that enjoys structure and a stable course schedulethe worst class I've taken in 4 years.",0
This teacher does not really teach. Yes the computer exams are relatively simple however teacher not very interactive. Kind of sarcastic but not in a pleasant way. Does not really engage with students and does not respond to questions from students.,0
"The professor was good overall, but I took him via an on-line course. The organization of the class was not great and many times you wouldn't know what you need to accomplish. I think the system he selected changed from previous classes which made everything disorganized. He was very polite and respectful.",1
Amazing professor.  Definately one of my favorites. if you get teh chance take a class with him.,1
Among the best prof. I've ever had. Having access to Christos's brain in office hours is seriously priceless.,1
"As a teacher he will get an F. He does not motivate students to learn more, he does not how to teach, and he uses an obsolete system. Not a great teacher.",0
"He seems to be a very nice man outside of the classroom, but once in class he is incredibly condescending. He does not listen to his students needs. His comments on papers often left students feeling embarrassed and upset. I went to office hours with him but left feeling worse about my paper. Honestly one of my worst experiences with a professor.",0
"Wonderful, caring professor but be prepared to read and work for your mark.",1
You will not be disappointed at the end of the semester!,1
He is the Best ever!,1
"All grades are based off of homework, and tests. Once you get your test back you can correct it and get half the points back, you missed. He is helpful if you miss a class or just need help. He doesn't email back. Calling is how you get ahold of him. You can work on projects and homework with a partner. He posts all his stuff on blackboard.",1
she is great. I am not good at math and i got an A... it was fun class. i will take her again if a have the chance. she always helps and explain very clear. she also help with extra credits. ,1
"I took Managerial Accounting online.  I have never seen a professor show less interest in an online class...  There were no online lectures, and the only real resource was McGraw-Hill Connect.  There is a discussion page, but it was very poorly facilitated and virtually useless.  I would not take this professor again.",0
Best teacher I've ever had recommend him...,1
"The class is more of an art criticism class. Most class periods were not painting. We listened to her slideshows for many class periods, and when it was time to paint she wouldn't let you start painting unless she liked the idea herself. Made me feel bad about myself as a painter. Pushes her agenda on you. Take if you like abstract art.",0
"I honestly don't know why she's listed as a professor for this course because she doesn't teach a single thing. Everything we learn is through a program made by McgrawHill-no content is hers. Several students have emailed her struggling with some concepts this semester and rather than teaching or giving advice, she told them to drop the class.",0
Greta is a bit cooky and the class is a bit boring. BUT she is a wonderful professor and genuinely cares about the well being of her students. I personally just do not care for the class but would take her again.  ,1
This professor sucks all he did was use the Cubs his baseball team as an example which some of us dont watch or know any baseball. The redos are stupid instead of your grade going up it goes down like wow whats the point dont take this professor.,0
"If you are looking for a professor that will inspire you and make you believe in yourself, do not take her course. Dr. Wilson does not present confidence in the material, is a moving target for assignments, and treats her students as delinquent HS freshmen. Spends too much time on powerpoint slides, you're better off reading at home. Bored nightly.",0
FOR ME THE BEST TEACHER IN SWC !!,1
"I highly suggest for everyone who wants to take Int. Algebra I & II to other professors unless if your schedule is fixed. No mymathlab needed. Though he has a sense of humor and shares his personal stories as he lectures us, I don't like his real attitude when he did me a favor, like erasing a whiteboard. I don't deserve to be treated that way.",0
Mr. Hanna was awesome! I had some family stuff going on during his class. He helped me with my essays and even let me take my mid term exam at a later time. He even say there with me and went through how to write an essay since it had been a long time since I had written one. I would take all his classes if I could.,1
"Good professor. I liked the subject & textbook for this class. Only one discussion post per week, but the mid-term was harder than I thought, thus the B, just missed it. Lots of reading, postings were easy!",1
Absolutely awful. Not helpful to students who approach and has the most terrible marking scheme. Avoid her class.,0
Half of the time I have no idea what she wants us to do for homework. And her tests and quizzes are pretty tough. ,0
Professor Zhang is awesome. He gives notes for you at the beginning of the class with examples on them. If you study these examples then you'll do fine on the tests. He has DIY questions at the end of the class where he gives you the answer and helps you solve them as well.,1
"One positive I can say is that she would respond to emails quickly. HOWEVER, she is over the top as a grader. She takes points off your rough drafts for no double spacing, no use of keywords (neither have ever been required in 4 years of my BSN) & her corrections are vague/limited. She made this class WAY harder than it needed to be. Picky grader",0
"yea, dr. laudan is barry's secret weapon!!.....boo ya!",1
"I have no idea why Professor Warden has such a bad rating. She's my favorite professor at this school. You have to be willing to put in the work, but she is willing to help you as much as she can. We had a quiz on most Fridays, but they were only 5 questions and super easy. I LOVED this class. I wish I could take her for all my English courses.",1
"She makes getting up at 7:30 in the morning a piece of cake. She doesn't use webcourses, so it's a good idea to keep up with the grades that she gives you back so you know how you're doing in the course. There are several projects within the course, including a reading journal. I recommend getting started ASAP. Overall an amazing professor!",1
"Accent and handwriting are very difficult to understand, and the lecture slides themselves are visually hard to read. Homework is very bulky and takes forever, but the exams - which are 70% of the grade - have COMPLETELY different content, rendering the HW useless as a study resource, so it's essentially busywork. It structurally makes no sense.",1
"She's a good person. Not that good at teaching compare to other UTM profs... Midterm was easy, final was very hard.  But she does bellcurve the marks. Overall a relaxing course - but don't expect a high mark - but students don't have to study much either",1
"Little to no communication. Easiest A I've ever received. However, if you're looking for an extension or miss a dead line, he will not give it to you, under ANY circumstances. You could be in a coma and this guy will not make an exception.",0
"De Francesco is a mad lad. We stick on one PowerPoint for two full weeks and still learn nothing. Sticks you in groups with classmates even when you tell him you can't work with them. Always finds something to say about everyone, even if it's kind of insulting. Wouldn't take him if his classes weren't required for my degree completion.",0
Amazing professor! Makes it clear that he doesn't want his students worrying about grades and that this school focuses too much on them. He just wants you to understand and do the readings which are very interesting. TAKE HIM!,1
"He is a very good teacher.  I think that he is the most structured and organized teacher at DSCC.  Pre-Prepares everything so that class goes very smoothly.  Is willing to help students while in class and during office hours.  Will NOT tolerate lateness, though.  Overall, very good teacher.",1
Instructor Hebert is a very fair instructor. His course is very well put together. He knows his stuff and clearly explains everything. He makes the class worth taking.,1
"Good teacher, can be quite harsh on marking participation.  You really need to say something each class.  Extremely harsh on absence: 2 unexcused • 2 grade drop! Take notes from the powerpoints because she doesnt post online and wont let you see them again.",1
"She cares and she knows her stuff that's all that matters if you care she cares Cliche, but you get what you give  I recommend her to anyone taking mkt research",1
"I really enjoyed Dr. Mahosky, she really cares about Disability Studies and has a lot of experience. Lots of writing in this class but most are just opinion based so they are not terrible.",1
She does not give feedback on what is missed on homework or tests to be able to study as well as doesn't even release grades unless begged for by students. Extremely unorganized for class and in general. If you have a question don't bother emailing her as she doesn't respond for days at a time. In short don't waste your time w/ her for any class.,0
"I'm a good student & receive good grades. Even though I was interested in the material and ready to learn he made this class unbearable. He is very strict, unforgiving, rude, and gives a horrendous amount of busy work. He's a Christian (you can see his cross necklace through his chest hair) and is bias against the other religions in his lectures. ",0
"The subject matter was difficult & the class was time-consuming, but the teacher is excellent, and if you are willing to put in the time and do the work, you can get an A.",1
"This is the worst class ever. I have learn nothing out of this. The title says ""Software security"" but, you will learn nothing about software security except for stupid malware analysis. I have spent several hours doing Malware analysis which is of no use.",1
She's awesome! I truly feel like she has helped me become a better writer as well as speaker. She went above and beyond to help me every time I asked and even when I did not ask she came to me and made sure I understood everything in class. She makes me laugh in every class and I will be taking her for every english class I ever have to take.,1
This guy is impossible to reason with. Avoid him at ALL costs in the math department,0
"This is the type of professor that will make you question how the hell did this guy get hired. Seriously he is the most laziest incompetent professor I've ever had he can't accomplish the most basic concepts of his job. I caught him copying his tests from online websites instead of making his own, which is a very unfair assessment. Don't take him!",0
I took the night class which was like 3 hours long and he always made us stay until the very last second which would be fine if he wasn't so boring! He's cocky and makes you buy books that he wrote to read for the class. He talks about stuff that has nothing to do with sociology and he doesnt make sense. I dropped this class after the first week.,0
Extremely helpful with any questions or problems.,1
"i failed the class once. but let me tell you, the first time i took the class we had masters students taking the class too. all of the exams were DIFFICULT. you still can pass but you wont be able to get the grade you r wokring for. i took the class again and didnt have any MASTERS students and the class was easy. and i got the grade i worked for. ",0
"The papers are graded weeks after they're turned in. This is very bothersome because you don't get feedback on your mistakes until after you've turned in ANOTHER paper. Also, I'm two days away from the classes closing and I'm waiting for 3 papers to be graded AND the final to be graded. Also, no help. Read, quiz, exam, paper, repeat.",0
Prof. Cummings is great.  She gives excellent feedback and really cares about the work you turn in.  She actually reads all of it.  She's also very easy to communicate with and is very responsive.,1
"Very knowledgable and charismatic with his words. Does not know the meaning of ""conceptualizing"" he does not know the art of teaching. His classes and test are all about specific details which are impractical for students.",0
"Take this class! Super easy! Tests are simple if you study all the notes online. Attendance is not mandatory but it is extra credit on tests. Lectures can get boring, but still a great class.",1
"Most boring professor ever. Tends to go off topic a lot during lectures. The online homework is much more difficult than the in-class exams. Not an impossibly difficult class to be completely honest, but definitely one that drags on and the professor does not make interesting.",0
"Mr Ariail is a great professor! You should definitely take his class! The assignment are easy, just do them and you'll have an A. The simulation game really is fun and that's homework. He has a great way of teaching, not boring at all!",1
"Prof.Mullin is a very nice, intelligent and helpful prof.",1
Literally the worst professor I have ever had!!! She is not clear at all of what you are suppose to be doing. There is a research project that is the span of the class and she doesn't let you know what to do until the day before it is due and then gets mad that you didn't start it months earlier. ,0
"Get ready for plenty of dad jokes. Not an easy A but it's far from impossible, participate in class and do the study guides.",1
Those who say he just wants to challenge you need to realize theyre paying thousands to willfully get their lives ruined by this sad excuse for a teacher while learning nothing in the process. You might as well print out his projects in your free time if you want to feel challenged because youll get the same amount of teaching and guidance,0
"A great professor, a professional software developer and a man of noble disposition. It was an honor to be his student.",1
"During covid, she chose to have her whole class asynchronous. The content is very dry and sometimes copied word for word from the textbook. There is nothing captivating about the class since you only look at the slides and lecture notes and readings. She also clearly doesn't read my emails b/c she doesn't ever answer my questions.",0
"Easy, boring & useless",0
"If rate my professor would allow me to give this woman a 0, I would. Horribly rude and disrespectful. She is one of the most unreasonable people I have ever dealt with in my entire life. The final was nothing we ever learned in class so good luck.",0
"She is a very critical grader (basically an online bully) with homework submissions, if you want any feedback without a bad grade attached you have to see her outside of class. The class doesn't offer any practical opportunity to assess your level of understanding until the tests and projects which comprise of the majority of your grade.",1
"If you follow directions, and show some interest - this class is an easy A. He doesn't use books, only notes for tests.",1
"To start off Dr. Bazil is very disorganized, which led him to not follow the syllabus. When a paper was turned in it would take 3-4 weeks to receive the grade back . He also duplicates the written feedback so it's not a personal feedback response. I would not recommend taking this professor. He does not answer questions that are asked in class.",0
"Casey is definitely talented and knows what he is talking about, but he does not explain through problems well. His study guides were nothing like his exams and he seemed to not have much care for his students and what they actually learned. I know he is a great person and very smart but I would not take him again just because I did not learn much",0
"Worst Professor I've ever had. Might be a smart guy, but he is a horrible professor. Doesn't explain ANYTHING in great detail. Just says you should know it ""intuitively"". It'll be a disgrace if he is allowed to teach at SMU again next year.",0
Professor Bamford is British not Australian. The readings are complex but I enjoyed them. The course touches on topics such as race and gender and is relevant to us now. Based off of that and her willingness to help students I am glad I took this course.,1
"Dr. Baddar is fantastic at getting you to think around the literature you'll be reading, she's extremely insightful, and she's definitely someone I look up to, but she's one of the harshest graders I've ever encountered. It wouldn't have been so bad if she gave me feedback, ever. Save yourself, don't take a writing class from her.",0
When she lectures you'll have zero clue what she's talking about. She will go rant about anything she feels like and its not related to Sociology at all. As long as you show up for attendance points and print out material she emails out for exams you'll be fine. It's an easy A but I don't understand how she's a professor at YSU.,0
Her tests are impossible and she would rather jump in front of a bus than curve your test grade.  One of the most boring classes I've ever taken here at SJU.  AVOID HER OR U WILL PAY THE PRICE,0
"This class was tough but I'm so grateful that I chose Mr. Ariail's Capstone course. If you want an A in this class you will have to earn it. Mr. Ariail is willing to help you every step of the way and is always available, he truly cares. Looking for a Capstone course to take? Do yourself a favor, sign up for his class! Best instructor I had at TCC.",1
He is a very good teacher. His lectures are clearly to understand.,1
I had Doug for three classes & each were a great experience!  He is good at what he does & extremely helpful in teaching his students.  My favorite teacher at NMC... highly recommended!,1
"He thinks he knows everything, he kept interrupting me when I was doing my presentation. I felt embarrassed as he kept interrupting and he I ask him a question, he wont' answer it right.",0
The worst Professor i have ever witnessed,0
Great dude,1
Josh Loar was an excellent professor. We met weekly to discuss the project and he gave great feedback on the progress we had made. He would also go out of his way to research issues we were having between meetings. His extensive industry experience really helped me get the most out of this class. ,1
Well respected and honest to his job. Tests you on stuff covered only. No tricks. Nicest guy and will care for you if you are sincere to yourself.,1
who let this man teach a&p 2?? I'll update at the end of the semester (unless I drop) but it is already awful and it's only week three...,0
Participation doesn't matter. Not a very good learning class? Wasted time on out class debate.,0
"I love Erica Green. She is so nice and caring and truly is super easy going and easy to talk to. As speech can be an intimidating class, she makes it so easy and less stressful. Not too much homework, but the things we do in class are very helpful for the future. I would HIGHLY recommend her. Best teacher I've had at Harper so far.",1
"Professor Young is an incredible instructor! His lectures will teach you so much about the music business, but most importantly, he makes you excited to learn!  If you make the most of his classes, and really take advantage of all PY has to share, you will leave his class feeling inspired every day and with a new perspective on the music industry. ",1
"Took her for both HIST1003 as well and I loved her so much that I took her again for HIST2126. Very likable, gives study guides a week before the test so you know what you have to focus on studying. Semester-long research project but honestly, it's very interesting. Highly recommended.",1
"Avoid this teacher, he's awful.",0
"Professor Lopez always takes the full lecture to get through half a chapter AT MOST. This dude goes on rants about irrelevant things almost every class. 4 tests make up your whole grade. He gives no review classes because he gives you 30+ slides of PowerPoints for each chapter and tells you to study that. Overall just a boring dude, don't take him.",0
"It's no wonder so many freshman are giving her such high scores, her classes are ridiculously easy. I learned next to nothing. She is nice though, and if you want an easy A I would take her for sure. Do not buy the text book, the syllabus says it is required but you won't use it once.",1
"Boring, tardy, unclear and verbose",0
"She is the worst. I cant belive that anyone has actually said that they have liked her on here. This class sucks. She makes you feel dumb. You have a new paper to do probably every week. Her assignments are never clear and shes confusing. Shes also a nut. Save yourself, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!",0
Oh Deb fels. Turned my multimedia in business class into the depths of hell.  no. bueno. ,0
Definitely would take  take a class of his again. Discussions in class are decently interesting. He's always willing to response to e-mails and gives good and helpful feedback. He's understanding if you don't get something. Quiz grading is easy so long as it looks like you do the reading and put some thought into your writing.  Workload is fair.,1
I hate him with a passion. Don't take him. He sucks.,0
AMAZING! I would take his class again if I could. I am not a history major and i was captivated by his lectures. He is passionate and extremely enthusiastic. He has the best gestures and jokes too! you will love him,1
"Hes very rude. Will take off points over the littlest things. Has no filter. Dont know why hes a professor. He has a big attitude problem. He likes to put students on the spot. Will grade you on your participation. Dont even bother taking him if you have things going on in your personal life. Hes inconsiderate. Also, good luck on the essays.",0
"Good professor if you do all your work. You do have to put effort on presentations because he is a tough grader. Easy A, I would take him again",1
"This was an online class. She stated she would respond to e-mails within 24 hrs. She never responded to one all semester, never responded to any message board posts either. Took a long time to grade project as well.",0
"He's a really nice guy. He's much nicer than most accounting profs. He is strict about being there one time, so please just come on time. Class isn't too difficult, just a lot of homework.",1
He did let you replace a test grade,0
She was number one Adobe Professor in the world.,1
"I thought that lecture could be a little boring sometimes but Dr. Galileo has a certain subtle humor to him that I found very funny. Personally, I enjoyed the material which forms a basis of understanding for other classes like molecular or genetics. Enjoyable class overall although quizzes could be tedious to study for with a busy schedule.",1
He is very lecture heavy and moves WAY too fast during his lectures. You're better off learning the material on your own because he explains stuff in the worst ways.,0
"Dylan is a great teacher and a great guy.  He gives assignments every week and they are cumulatively part of a group film package project. Come to every class, pay attention, and read the book. He is helpful; if you ever email him with a question or concern, he responds with astonishing promptness. You will learn a lot and get good experience.",1
"So this professor wasnt necessarily helpful, he did not provide good feedback at all and can be very unfair. The only thing I liked about his class was lecture. Everything else was a disaster. Prepare to be disappointed.",0
Very smart and easygoing person. He will get you involved in lectures and not make you bored. If you show interest and participate you will have no problem passing.,1
Mr. Turner was a great professor! I took this course online and ended up with an A. You write a total of 6 papers that come from the chapter; they arent hard at all because you just write about the high points of what you read. Mr. Turner is amazing and doesnt overload you with tons of assignments! I will definitely take him again in the future.,1
Excellent industry experience and reference. Industry expert guest lectures. No mid-term. Bi-weekly quizzes instead.,1
Gupta's idea of teaching is to read the textbook's provided slides while waving his hands around in front of the class as if the students have come in to class knowing the material. Anything that becomes difficult for him to describe is ultimately left out of the lecture. There is also no curve in the class.,0
I hate her teaching style. She uses MyMathLab.com and she expects everyone to know what they're doing. The homework is pretty hard. If you take this class you might as well sign your life over to math homework because it takes HOURS..,0
The lectures were disorganized. 200+ pages reading a night before the class not discussed. Very tough grader. DONT TAKE HER CLASS.,0
"Do not take this class if you are not a math minded person. She assigns a lot of hw and counts none of it towards your grade. The only thing that counts is if you get good grades on the three tests and exam. I went to tutoring, did every homework and still didnt pass the tests. She knows the class is hard, but still wont count the HW in the grade",0
Great guy who definitely understands that this material is difficult.  He is very funny and very laid back.  Good grading system as well. Take him if you can!,1
"Professor Arnold seems to have a lot going on in her life and her students are not one of her top priorities. She's a wonderful lady, but is very inefficient. If possible, maybe try a different professor.",0
"I was NOT fond of her instructional approach. She seemed to rush through the material. When I asked for assistance or guidance she was not very optimistic or supportive. She's arrogant, not very approachable, judgmental, and called people out when they make a mistake speaking Spanish.  I've never had any issues with any professors, until this lady.",0
"Besides the accent issue, he's a good prof. He teaches the concepts never worse than decently and often very well. The textbook is not necessary but a reasonable supplement for the topics he gives a semi-long proof but not many numerical examples for. Something about his smile and laugh when a 3D function has no critical points: it's priceless.",1
Very enthusiastic about the material. Tutorials are sort of hard to follow but aren't too difficult. Easy up until the final where a lot of the questions asked you to identify who said which quote. Nothing she emphasized was actually on the test. Presumably done because she said the class average was too high. Otherwise enjoyable prof and class.,1
"This prof does not use any technology in her courses. She stands at the front of the class with her  paper in front of her face, and you can't understand anything because of her accent and she does not give a mark higher than a 75, and her midterms consist of 10 or more essay questions. AVOID AT ALL COST.",0
"Why he is an awesome prof 1He is professional, approachable and make the class full of fun.  2Easy marker + extra credits  3 Inspirational, would take any classes from him again ",1
She is too strict.,0
Fowler is an interesting lecturer (animated and energetic) BUT it's really hard to understand what one is supposed to take away from her lectures.  The final for Fall 04 was KILLER.  If you take this class know EVERYTHING for the final b/c she tests on really obscure poems that we didn't discuss.,1
"Overall, I really disliked the class. He talks extremely fast, and is very hard to follow. ",0
I took this class and received an A. There were 4 quizzes and one extra credit quiz if you bomb the first one. The quizzes are timed so it helps to read the chapters or at least skim the chapters so you don't run out of time. The professor is very nice and responds to emails very quickly.,1
"It's very difficult to listen in class. It's very easy to get lost when he's explaining something, and many times he gets lost while explaining something. He's pretty lenient when it comes to grading tests and quizzes. Tests and quizzes are not really hard.",0
"He is an AWESOME PROFESSOR!!! Smart and charismatic, full of quotes and a seemingly never-ending supply of stories and first-hand experience. I am so happy I took his class. He is sweet and nice and I look forward to going to his class every time it meets. Favorite class I have taken thus far!!!",1
"Great teacher! Took his online course. You are going to have to work to succeed but he will tell you how and is available.  I spent a lot of time on this course, but for the first time understand algebra.  He gives extra credit to help you. Devote the time and you can get an A. Taking him again next semester.",1
"Really funny, I thought Id hate chemistry, but with her teaching Ive gotten a lot better",1
The school only offers letter grades. There is no + or - grade. Reviews with these probably haven't taken one of her classes. Dr. Massnick is the most caring and intelligent teacher at the school. She teaches in an unconventional style that incorporates real-life over textbook examples. You get out of what you invest in. She's one of a kind.,1
Great teacher very easy!!,1
"Hilarious- keeps class interesting/worth attending. Hard topic- must study + do hw. Labs + bonus hw saved my grade. Very helpful, reminded us often of hw + tests. Attendance mandatory to pass, doesn't post slides online. Appreciates students who participate. Keeps it real with grades and life. Made accounting bearable. Can't find a better teacher.",1
"Class was simple and easy, but he can sometimes be very unorganized and grades harshly .",1
She does absolutely nothing for her class or her students and shes supposed to teach how to tend to exceptional learners but doesnt practice it herself . Oxymoron of a professor if you ask me,0
"You need to buy SIMnet for this class ($90) cause thats where all your assignments are. Its an easy class, its just a lot of work online with Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc. Also, the text book will help you with your tests so you should buy it!",1
"Just the worst class I've taken at Duke. It's so poorly structured. Homework is arbitrarily long, exams are unpredictable, no supporting materials or practice exams. I was depressed for most of it; I just hope I haven't failed.",0
LOVED this Prof I wish I could take her again for more classes but she is moving,1
"The best choice for EE205. He is excellent at explaining difficult subjects and concepts, his exams are very fair, straightforward, and similar to the review packet he gives out. He readily accommodates student's needs, and doesn't really give that much homework. He is also very available outside of class and happy to help and answer questions.",1
"The class is hard but the professor is very helpful. If you are taking an online class, there are video lectures provided each week. The explanation is quite clear. Two tests and the final exam will decide your grade. Other things like homework, weekly quizzes, and forum posts are graded too but the portion is insignificant, about 17% of the grade.",1
John Shon makes financial accounting doable but be ready to to put in work,1
Lecture was super long winded and sometimes boring. But the material is interesting and he gives you all the information needed to pass with an A plus plenty of extra credit to help out if you need it.  Highly Recommended,1
Easily the worst professor I ever had in college. She is insanely strict and expects you to never make mistakes. Like EVER. There were many nights where I would just start crying because one little thing was inaccurate on my work and she would give the entire assignment an 'F' and be horribly rude about it. She does not communicate well at all.,0
"Dr. Strait is a good professor. The class itself bored me to death, but it's an easy A. He is really passionate about what he does and is really understanding if something comes up and you need more time for the tests & quizzes. All of them are online, and he drops 3 of the 6 quizzes and 1 of the 3 tests, which makes it nearly impossible to fail.",1
He is a professor that doesn't care for his student's grades. He gives the same assignment multiple times and is not specific with what he wants so he will take off unnecessary points just because he feels like it. Wouldn't recommend taking him. Also makes you buy textbook and we NEVER used it.,0
Most examples are from text. Test questions based on homework and notes. Review midterms before final.,0
"Ms Padget is Horrible, This week she taught us how to do MLA formattingn on Work cited pages. This is the second to last week of the class and we were supposed to be doing it all along. She doesnt follow the syllabus and yells at you if you dont do the things on it. She is unclear about everything and cant even answer questions about what she wants",0
"WORST teacher I have ever taken. Very rude, and super unclear. Half of the class time would be spent would be spent going completely off topic and talking about her personal experiences (interesting but NOT related to anatomy or things to help us study). Never learned anything from lecture. Tests are timed and have 5 chapters per test. DONT TAKE IT",0
"She's Awful Awful don't take her if you register her class for now drop her today is last day to drop classes ,",0
I have read a lot of comments on here for Professor Butman and I have to disagree with most of them. I like his class and understand they way he teaches. He expects yo to put your time in your work. He goes over exactly what he grades on in class and gives examples. He does try to help students during class but at the end you get what you earn.,1
rude and unhelpful. tests are hard,0
"She could get a little rude sometimes and she does use ""spicy"" all the time to describe what a thesis or topic should be which is confusing. She grades papers really really hard",0
"Read, write, talk. Good teacher, no nonsense. Cute, too.",1
Do not take this professors online class he will not teach you anything. If you have experience in code you should be able to get a good grade but don't expect to learn much at all.,0
Dr. Wolff is one of the best lecturers I've ever had. Her style is engaging and you'll remember the material because she also has clear outlines for every class and study guides for each exam.,1
"He only used powerpoints, and there were no tests, only three essays.  The final was an essay question that he gave you ahead of time.  He was a nice guy with a British accent.",1
"LCDR Hoffmeister is a really tough grader. He is probably the most difficult instructor for SY201, but everyone says his teaching helps you out later on in the major. If you don't understand something, he'll make sure you do if you go in for EI. If you really care about learning the material, LCDR Hoffmeister is your guy.",1
I am taking the hybrid course. The in class portion can be interesting because he has guest speakers come in every week. But the homework assignments are worthless busy work. You have to write about 1000+ words a week and you are expected to BS those 1000 words because you could get your point across for the assignments in about 150.,0
"This class was the hardest one I have ever taken, it was supposed to be easy but the way he does his lectures is confusing, I am an Architecture major student and for me all the words sounded like a foreign language, he gets distracted very easily with current topics and tht in my opinion killed the lecture. Not recomended if not Bussiness major.",0
"I wish that Prof. Liu taught Calc 2. I took calculus in high school and mostly already understood the course, but she made the concepts so much clearer than I remember learning them. Her accent isn't that hard to understand and she will do everything to make sure you pass the class. Homework is completion, tests are short and the class isn't long.",1
"Great professor. I've taken him for a few classes. CRM426 was very homework heavy, however it prepares you for the exam. He is very interactive, and expects you to be as well. He grades fair, but expects a lot out of assignments. The class was more in-depth than others, but it was still easy to get an A if you put forth the effort. Would recommend.",1
"Very hard course with him, a lot of the class is failing. Tests are hard (avg grade = 35!. C = 50). OK at teaching (2 out of 5).",0
Turnipseed doesnt care about the students. His class is completely self taught with no guidance or assistance from the professor.,0
He's difficult to adapt to. Had a tough time following his lectures.,0
"She's really nice and I can tell she likes teaching. I had her for Writing about Literature and  the first part of class covered Fairytales, the second part was on poems and the last will be the book ""Disgrace"" and the movie ""Fight Club""
 I recommend taking her, but don't take advantage of her because she can be pretty lenient.",1
"Dr. Weiner makes Reading 501 way more difficult than it needs to be. He does not teach, like at all. He assigns groups and has the groups teach for a class period which takes up the whole semester. I ended with a B and there is no evidence of how I got it",0
This guys voice is SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND. I am Hispanic and I cant understand him. So bad. Everything is based off the PowerPoints but they are extremely long.,0
"If you're someone without a life, a job, and a family and you have nothing better to do than study this is the class for you!!! You can spend hours upon hours studying, thinking you know every thing there is to know about it and you'll still do horribly on her impossible exams. Don't miss a lab! 6% auto deducted. ONLY positive: great curver!",0
"This class was really cool, professor Gilbert has these weekly quiz things you have to do, they are really easy and is just there to make sure you did the readings, so don't be put off by that. If you are thinking of taking this class, take it with him, it's really amazing",1
"There is one test which is about 25 questions, all multiple choice, but he gives you a study guide of 50 questions all multiple choice. Try to write all questions on notecards and he may let you use on test if you ask. Weekly journals that he'll grade at the end. One project about your topic of choice as long as someone else doesn't pick it. Love",1
"Definitely one of my favorite professors here at NDSU, he has good lectures and takes the class relatively slow. I would say that he does use a lot of masculine models and examples, and he calls on people a lot. Otherwise make sure you take good notes and you will pass the class.",1
"This course is definitely useful for someone who knows how to code. If you are not good at programming or you just know how to print out ""Hello world"" you should skip taking this course. But if you are a good programmer or java developer, fasten your seatbelt, you gonna have so much fun in the first part. The second part is paper discussion.",1
"Richard is the best professor I have had. He makes class interesting and it is obvious how much he loves his job and truly cares for each of his students. A wonderful professor and a wonderful person. He doesn't use a text book to teach, but instead his own vastly extensive knowledge. Take this class. ",1
"She has a bad attitude. She makes a lot of unnecessary comments, snarky remarks and jabs at students for literally no reason, it makes the class environment uncomfortable and makes you not want to participate. She explains things well. If you listen youll understand. But shes very harsh when even though its only a freshman/beginner course.",0
"Dr. Ayers is a really down to earth, but smart guy. You will really learn a lot about starting a business in this class, and he is very inspirational. He is not a tough grader. If you put in a good amount of effort, you will probably get an A. The group project is definitely doable.",1
"I don't know how you can even call this guy a professor, he doesn't teach anything. His only contribution to the class was the syllabus/schedule, and exam questions. Graders grade assignments. Tests are based purely from textbook reading/memorization. He clearly states that if you have questions DO NOT contact him, contact the grader.",0
"I think Peter is a probably a good teacher, just not one that's cut out for distance learning. I regret taking this class online, but don't completely blame him for how confused I was. You will definitely be doing most of the learning on your own. Trig is an intense subject, but it will follow you around forever. Make sure you actually understand!",1
She is horrible. She did not teach anything in this production. It was mostly a play that was for her tribute to her heritage. We did not learn acting or technical things. We were used for her name and project. But in the end she was blaming us for everything. Run away from this person.,0
"Great teacher.  The material is difficult and for awhile impossible but gradually your efforts and his efforts mesh and a light goes on!  Really, it is like magic.  I wish all my teachers were like him",1
"Prof très très intéressant, mais dans pol1000 il invite des conférenciers pendant presque la totalité de ses cours et ils ne sont pas tous intéressant...Il ne demande pas grand chose et avoir une bonne note est facile.",1
Dr. McCabe is easily one of the best Bible teachers I've had. His classes are challenging and involve a lot of work but you will get so much out of it. He makes learning a ton of fun and his lectures are very active.,1
"She grades harshly and takes off points for minor things. She will find any specific thing to mark you off some points. Impossible to get an A on anything. Psych 1 was supposed to be an intro to the subject and class, but no I was welcomed with mistreatment. If you are a Psych Major then sure have at it. But for those who aren't then good luck to u",0
"She makes me believe in a better world. Granted, I am an ENS major, but Dr Farris is my heart and soul. SHe will accomodate you and lets you have up to 5 unexcused abscenses. Easy A if you put in the work. AMazing woman.",1
"Love her style of teaching. She really cares about her students and tries to make difficult material easy to understand. She wants the class to be fun, and enjoyable, but not an easy ride. Quiz questions come directly from lecture and outlines and test questions come directly from quizzes. Just do your work and you'll be fine.",1
She was amazing,1
"Very knowledgeable at her suject, bu struggles a bit to present it clearly and concisely.",1
"She's really nice, I took Women's studies with her. Keep in mind, you have to do lots of reading and writing...",1
"I get really good grades, but this class was extremely hard. Her lectures on powerpoint are not clear. She jumps around from slide to slide w/o telling you what chapter she's on. She goes very fast in lecture and it is impossible to take notes. Erases everything after talking about it. Doesn't answer emails for help. Class test avg is in 50's.",0
"Dr. Druffel is the nicest professor at UCI.  She genuinely wants her students to do well & provides multiple opportunities to gain points. The course material is a little dry, but that's not her fault! She tries to make it as interesting as possible, and as long as you come to class and do the homework, you will do well in her class.",1
"first day of class when i walked in and saw her i thought to myself ""oh man she looks like one of those crazy mean strict professors"" but i was totally wrong. Although the class can be hard and there's a lot of homework, she makes the class fun and before you even know it its time to get out.",1
"Excellent professor, one of the best.  Very caring and committed to her students.  Extremely intelligent and well read.",1
"Awesome teacher! you get out early, and is extremely helpful if you have any questions.",1
"Ning dosent teach.  You have to be able to study and learn the material on your own.  Attendance is a must, due to the fact you have in class work sheets you have to do everyday for credit.  You can work with a partner on the material and when your done you can leave.  I would not recommend this class if you can not learn math on your own.",0
"This class is straight group activities, group projects, and outside work. Sometimes she chooses to not have class which is AWESOME! This could easily be an online class, as you can pass without studying for anything. The group you are assigned day 1 is the one you stick with for everything, so don't burn bridges. Most pointless and boring class.",0
"To get an A in her class you would have to work very very hard. She gives out a lot of work. Expect homework on the first day of class till the very last day. It might start out slow, but wait till the end, she throws all these work at you. If you are not willing to put 100% effort in her class, don't take her!",0
Her assignments are very time consuming and she is a very picky marker. Her lectures are boring and she thinks that talking loudly will help us learn.,0
The final was 5 QUESTIONS and 30 PERCENT of the class grade!! This is a good representation of how awful the CS department is at UWEC.,0
"Ms. Klebaur is an extremely difficult professor. This was an introduction to psychology course, but I felt that she treated this course as a high level psychology major class. She gives you almost no points for assignments that take hours to complete. If you miss one thing on a discussion post, you'll automatically get a failing grade.",0
I would literally have to make something up about this man to speak ill of him. He is the best & my absolute favorite teacher in the University. He has a passion for what he does which makes it extremely easy for him to make the courses he teaches so enjoyable. I have taken 3 of his classes & plan to take them all if I can before i graduate!,1
Best class ever. The final was literally a combination of the quiz questions from Schoology. Clear grading and it was enjoyable to go to class every night. Shes hilarious and you can tell she enjoys teaching. Take this class!,1
"She is nice but doesn't grade, can be very unclear with what needs to be done, and is slow with any sort of feedback",0
"Very hard to follow, tests are not reflective of material covered in class.  This class was made to be tougher than it should be!",0
I study for this class at least two hours each night and still get test scores in the 60's and my scores are in the top 25%. My normal test scores are typically in the 90's. His handouts are not current and don't match the text material. It is difficult to cross between his handouts and text material.,0
The Tests were extremely hard. Did not prepare you for the tests. Office hours were joint with her other class so she could not give you her full attention. Not that great of a professor.,0
No wiggle room!!!! She doesn't play games. Make sure you site your sources.,1
He might be the first Prof to kick a students ass or the hist prof who keeps breaking his maps.  helped me a lot and has cool stories.  PS I am still parking in the faculty lot,1
"makes you do reflections which are pointless, just teach the class IN LECTURE! the exams are so hard, nothing like homework, I think I failed this class, being my first failed class ever. Retaking with a different teacher, dont care. Awful. Nice guy, but doesnt care if you are failing. No extra credit at all. Makes you do pointless papers.",0
"Ms. Wright is um mediocre. Her class isnt hard, if you show up youll pass (and if u dont show up youll probably still pass). Not too much hw. Her tests/finals are straightforward. She relies on the class to do a lot of the talking, so idk what she knows. Class kinda drags on , I took notes to stay awake.",0
"Don't be scared by pervious reviews of this professor. She was also readily available to help, quickly answered emails and quickly graded assignments. She gave clear instructions on what she was looking for and truly wants to see students succeed. She can give intense feedback during presentations, but it is only to help you achieve a better grade!",1
"Probably the worst class I've ever taken. Lab was awesome because I felt I learned a lot even though he gives A LOT of assignments designed to take over your life and negatively impact your grades in other classes. Never knew what was going on in lecture though and his exams are ridiculous, don't test knowledge, just ability to answer questions BLA",0
"Lectures are not very interesting usually, but he can be funny and make things fun to learn sometimes.  However, he really cares about his students, and he is always willing to help them out.",1
"You may want to throw a test rock in before entering her office. Sometimes she's great, helpful, interesting; sometimes she's stark raving mad (I mean ""Yellow Wallpaper"" mad).",0
DO NOT TAKE DR AYADI! She is a horrible professor who has no interest in her students.  quizzes come from powerpoint and book. there are 3 group projects that she wont elaborate on. I would suggest you have a study buddy for this class. Good luck!,0
This is the easiest class i have ever taken at KSU. I literally made a 100 in the class. Class is mandatory and the lecture is very long but this is an easy A. Dr. G always extended dates and helped everyone. There are very few asssignments so make sure you do them all. I didnt learn a lot it was basically like a review of math 2008 & 3316. No HW.,1
The best class I have taken at CWU. Learned about CJ and law and justice organizations. Studies legislative agendas and I learned alot in this course.,1
This professor is the worst ever he didn't even teach anything in class he talk for an hour about essay like what is a introduction. Which we already know and something about him irritate you. You can't even use the phone in his class when you do he will look at you with his mock face.,0
"By a wide margin, the least enthused professor I've ever had. It is difficult to pay attention in this class even though I love biology. No involvement from the class or anything to keep you on your toes. Just do your homework, read the chapters, show up, you'll get an A.",0
"He makes you buy a book that you will use only one, just because he wrote that book.",0
"Discrete Structures is a boring course made even more dry by Ratana Ngo's somewhat robotic teaching style. He really tries to make sure the class understands, but his presentation leaves many falling asleep.",0
"She's not very helpful and her lectures are HORRIBLE! I'm not sure how she completed her PhD program considering there's a ""teaching"" portion of the program. She simply doesn't know how to teach! What a shame!",0
I hated this class. I didn't like the professor. I love History and Paulette genuinely made me dislike it. I did my homework but for some reason she failed me. She didn't grade a paper and she said she wouldn't give me anymore chances. Her lectures were boring and not at all helpful for the tests. Avoid her!,0
"If you want to fail a course, go ahead and take a class with this instructor. He's unorganized, and his teaching motto is ""I write on board and you figure out"", um okay? Then why have an instructor? English isn't his 1st language so there's a MAJOR language barrier, if he doesn't understand your question he completely ignores you.",0
"Her powerpoints confused me a lot. She's not the type of teacher that gets straight to the point, she wants you to know EVERY SINGLE detail. She often rants abt irrelavent topics too.. No study guides either which made it difficult to know what was on her exams. I regret taking her!!!!!",0
"I can't say enough great things about this professor. His lectures are clear and concise, and he even participates in class discussions, which is RARE in an online class. Although the media critiques and quizzes require some effort, they are not overly difficult as long as you complete the readings. Trust me, this class is an EASY A!",1
"Ok first of all, I put a one on easiness, because Eileen Duffy WILL make you work your butt off. You'll have to learn a lot of music and do forums. Great Professor and person. Hard work, but you will improve you technique 100%. Great for classical and musical theatre training, because that's what she does best. You'll enjoy her voice lessons a lot.",1
Statistics is not an easy class to begin with but he tries his hardest to explain to you what is going on. If you can get another teacher for stats DO SO because the word is that Rayburn is the hardest of the two stats teachers.,1
"For everyone bashing on Heather LaPoint, you clearly have not discovered the magic of prep u. If you are not prepared to put in more work than usual and dedicate quite a bit of time to a NURSING course, than maybe thats your problem not Heathers. If you are struggling and find her material difficult than bless your soul for junior year.",1
"Take this class, it's so easy. All you have to do is show up and say at least two things a day to get an A.  I didn't really participate so I got a B, but overall he's a very laid back teacher.",1
She is so mean and never teach. And didn't be responsible for her students.,0
"I personally hated him, because of his waste of class time, didn't stick to the syllabus and seemed pretty stuck up and rude. It would be an interesting class no matter who's teaching it- I would avoid Chaahan.",0
"continuation from below. I have graduated form nursing school and this to date is the most difficult class and work load of my career. I am going Tuesday to drop it. Mind you, i have no job right now, a partner and two dogs...i have the time but its just ridiculous. She has been late both classes, no real teaching plate-form, demands your life",0
Tres long et ennuyeux,0
I am not any good in Math but I learned so much in his class. He also offered extra credit and it bumped my grade from a B to an A. During COVID classes online Spring 2020 he did a great job in teaching through zoom. Easy to follow online! 100% Recommend and would take again!!,1
"Math sucks. Let's be honest. But Professor Ryburn makes math suck a lot less. She is extremely helpful, nice, and willing to help. You have to finesse ALEKS in order to get good grades on the tests, but her lectures are clear and concise. She does everything she can in order to get you a good grade in her class. 10/10 would recommend.",1
"Class is difficult to understand, at some points as is Kosin. However, he does offer insightful help with the homeworks during his office hours. Read the book and attend class because his tests are based on the lectures, with definitions from the book overall even though its gen ed  a good professor to take it with",1
"If you just want to take the course, yes he's a generous grader. If you want to do some research, you should rethink about it",0
"Poor communication regarding expectations and course information and updates are all over the place, if you can even find it online.",0
"Professor Maizel is a cool and entertaining lecturer to say the least, if you come to all his classes and take good notes on his lectures, you will pass. The content itself is not that bad, the course has no structure as there is no textbook and all content is oral. Beware of his harsh accent, he may only give definitions to terms orally 1x or 2x.",0
"Professor Johansen  makes the class interesting, considering it's 3 hours. She has an odd sense of humor; however,  it doesn't detract from her lectures. She is knowledgeable, and she won't let you forget it! With that, she tries to motivate her students to strive for more than just a grade, but that's important too! She's a good fit for LACC.",1
I would suggest those who are not major in Antropology please dont take classes with him. You are to read books of 350 pages or more for exams on the entire book.,0
"It's evident from her teaching that she's not the BEST professor, but certainly you could do worse. She's known by students to be very rude and generally unavailable. Honestly, if you take this class with her you'll pass and getting an A isn't difficult, but if you can avoid it...",0
"Just an awful class, if you want to see how to do a class wrong this is it. None of the work that he goes over in class has anything to do with the tests. Thompson is very lazy when it comes to being a professor he puts an absolutely the least amount of effort anybody could possibly put in. All of his tests that trick questions",0
"There is a lot more work than is necessary for a 200-level and she requires very specific guidelines that will seriously lower grade if not followed.  Only a few questions on test and quizzes seemed relevant to the class as a whole, the rest were small and irrelevant.  If you're looking for an easy GER or pass/fail class, this isn't it.",0
"Professor Ehinger knows her material! She is willing to answer any and all questions, if she can't answer the question right away she will make sure to answer it. The class is very challenging. It is not an introduction class, be prepared to read a lot and study hard. Class is curved so that helps",1
"Easy A. go to class, do and turn in your work on time and you will pass this with an A. ",1
"The class wasn't as interesting as I'd hope (Oceanography). Majority of students zone out in class. 4 HW assignments, go to Discussion to get help, seriously. One redemptive HW, do it. iClicker points each class. One midterm, one final, not cumulative. Studied the night before and got a B on both. I'm sure if I tried harder, I would've gotten an A.",1
"She is a boring, monotonous, condescending ""teacher"". She was very unhelpful. One of the worst ""teachers"" I have ever had. Avoid her classes at all costs.",0
"TAKE HIM! One of Howard's best. He is hilarious and extremely knowledgable about the topics we cover. It is an easy A, but still take the time to get to know him because he's awesome and a joy to talk to. I will definitely be taking him again.",1
"Hes a little shy, but he listens to reasonable arguments that are made about subject material. He is a good prof to have, looks fresh out of grad school. You have to read the book, but he does offer help about things that you might not understand. Almost no homework.Outlining the chapter the night before is the best way to go in his class.",1
"I have had him for multiple classes and he is very helpful if you come prepared with questions. Hhe is a tough grader, but also gives you what you deserve and worked for. ",1
She is a very poor professor. Gives very little feedback; if any. She does not clearly outline what is expected from your work. Does not respond to any messages. Does whatever is easiest for herself. BEWARE she rates herself positively on here to make students believe they are taking a good class and will learn something from her!,0
This professor was very nice.,1
"Le prof est TRES plate, mais tres intelligent, bcp de connaissance, on apprend bcp ds son cours. Si vous faites ce qu'il demande de faire, c'est A+ assure(41/53 eleves=A-,A ou A+)...Par contre, il prend les presences aleatoirement, et ses cours durent TJRS 3h, sinon, un peu plus!!! Un cafe ferait pas de mal avant d'aller a ses cours!",1
"Lecture are straightforward and he asks the class if they need him to explain the problem again after each one so if you need help, ASK! Attend every class or you will get confused as he does quite a bit in one day. He allows a cheat sheet and tests are similar to notes.",1
"Dr. Ba is a fairly descent professor If you don't mind reading alot. He is fairly easy on grading if you do yoUr homework and study for tests he gives you sample test there is no way you will walk out without a B or A. However his lectures are dry, read off power points, and he has thick accent that sometimes is hard to understand.",0
"Easy A. For a sociology teacher he seems ignorant based on how he talks about women, other cultures, and gay people. Not politically correct. He also allows people to talk, text, come in late, have more than 6 absences, he does not want you to fail. If your a weak student this class is made for you. If you are a good student this class is annoting.",1
"Professor Caldwell was by far the worst professor I've ever had. he would assign five-page essays with no prompt what so ever and proceed to give you a bad grade because, in his words, ""this is not what I was looking for. he was an extremely tough grader and would give you feedback without reading the entire essay first. absolutely terrible.",0
"She's a good person, but the sound of heels coming down the hallway meant the torture was about to begin. It was unbearable sitting through the class. It seemed like she was assuming that nobody had anything better to do than focus on composition. The first half of the semester is back to back papers that could have been more evenly distributed.",0
"If you want to take a class and memorize definitions word for word and get points taken off if you alter one word, hes your guy. Ask questions but beware hell make you regret it. Good luck (:",0
"I was a little apprehensive taking an online ""communications"" class, but I am so glad I did. She kept chapters short and simple and quizzes were straightforward. Definitely recommend!",1
"She's sweet, but I cannot understand her for the life of me. I've tried attending the lectures and she has online lecture recordings but her English is terrible. She's not good at explaining. To do well on the exams you HAVE to KNOW the book front and back and do the online modules and hw. No one did well on her exams, the test averages were awful",0
"Took his class for 131 & barely passed. Idk why I decided to take him for college Algebra ,its useless because he teaches you his way and expects you to know all the formulas already. He makes fun of the students and rants in class instead of doing lectures. He gives very few test thats why I took his class but he doesnt curve grades. Hes awful!",0
"Worst professor ever. Her lecture videos are completely useless. I learned better through reading the course notes. Kept making mistakes in quizzes and penalize students for her own mistake. She has never ever admitted that she made a mistake, even when it's very obvious that the question had an incorrect solution or worded ambiguously. Avoid her!",0
Ms. Magdaleno is not only an amazing artist but she is a wonderful teacher.,1
"Dr. Vazquez has the right approach to being a physics lab instructor. Definitely a solid choice. Show up to class and do the work, and you'll get a good grade.",1
Did not enjoy this class at all. Her lectures are really boring and she doesn't clarify much... She is a really hard marker. ,0
"please do not take this class. mostly just laugh about random stuff in class, may be funny but highly inappropriate and does not pertain to class. the laughs are not worth it. this class is not worth it. take your money and time to a teacher who will actually teach and you can learn. you get a study guide but it's lengthy and you are on your own.",0
"First art class taken at Oneonta and she was great. Open to all ideas, I've never heard her tell anyone their ideas/projects were bad. Even if you're not good at art she helps improve your basic skills. Class focused a lot on compositions and basic art elements. Some work outside of class if you didn't finish a project but no real hw.",1
"If taking a class with Singer, be prepared to consult outside resources for help. He is VERY smart, but neglects to go over the basics of new concepts. I used a lot of YouTube videos and other resources. Once you figure out the basics for certain concepts the problems are not hard, but he rarely goes over said basics before jumping to examples.",0
"If you put effort into the assignments and read all the material, you will do well in Prof. Lawrence's classes. Since I took an online class I didn't have much interaction with him, but his comments were always helpful. In general, it's frustrating that BYU makes contacting your prof directly virtually impossible, but that's the school's fault.",1
"I'm currently doing the 1st 5 weeks summer course in the midst of COVID-19, and so far, it's awesome. Tests are take-home exams (you can use anything), but most of the answers are literally in his lecture messages box. His jokes are alright, but all I can say is that it's definitely worth the 8AM. Lectures can be dry, but you'll def get use to it.",1
"Terrible teacher. Rude, condescending, hypocritical. Does not know her own materials. Could not answer questions on her own test. Has blatant equality issues. Would not take her classes again.",0
Im sure she is knowledgeable on biology but her teaching method is awful. Possibly the worst teacher I ever had.,0
"His lectures are very interesting, engaging and hilarious. He is always willing to see students about questions on papers or just lecture context, which is super helpful. Overall, he's a super approachable, nice prof. ",1
"She's very knowledgable and understanding. She is accessible outside of class, and all assignments are straightforward. She's enthusiastic and cares about her students.",1
"Worst experience of my life!!!!!. He is not clear at all, the things he says are not on the test are not on the test, and he sometimes won't even give you what to study. He talks about his students behind there backs and just does not care about his students passing. He is one of the worst instructors I have had and I am an A student.",0
"Don't recommend his class what so ever unless you have time. If you have a busy schedule DO NOT take his class but if you think you are capable go right on ahead. Just know he doesn't give direct answers to your question and he advises that you memorize his syllabus. In class he has really long lectures, pretty big reading and writing assignments.",0
"I took his class based off of the reviews... wouldn't do it again. You can easily get a C if you dont do anything and you just want to pass. He does boost your grade if your on the edge and his E.C. will get you the next letter grade, otherwise i couldn't EVER understand a word he said and i basically had to try to teach myself the whole course.",0
"This Professor doesn't not reply back to you for days.  It took him over a month to grade all the papers.  This is a self taught class, not help there. Writing papers every week then a final paper plus midterm test and final. His questions are confusing.",0
Lytle is an amazing human being as well as my favorite professor that I've EVER had; I highly recommend her. Just take her class for fun like I did and you'll see! Her class is where 50 min feels like 5 min.,1
"Very easy going, but that could be bad if you are not able to keep up with material.  Good lectures but poor in practice.  Regardless, I was able to learn a lot in a short amount of time.",0
"She does not look at the students when she lectures. As a professor, she is not specific. She reads off of PowerPoint slides, and without them, there would not be much she can say to the class. I feel very drained in this class because she teaches in a very unenthusiastic manner. This is one of the worst classes I have ever taken in my life.",0
"If you want to skate by with an easy class, don't take this one. There are mixed feelings about whether people like Maureen as a professor, she will challenge you and will not let you get away with half ass effort. She expects you to expect the best from yourself and won't let you slide. If you work hard, you will leave her class a better student.",1
"This was my first summer class, so Im not sure if there is naturally a ton of work. I enjoyed the teacher, and her personality. There was a ton of papers due, but hey its english. She was helpful with a family emergency I had and had great feed back. I liked how free she was with an assignment. This made writing the papers more enjoyable.",1
"Do not expect full credit on anything, even when it is deserved. She is a tough teacher who treats you like professional journalists. If you are anything BUT a journalism concentrator, do not take this class anyway. Find something else. I would not recommend taking her, she doesn't teach at all. No tests or quizzes, just articles and blog project.",0
"Save your GPA, don't take Casimir. He's a nice guy and you can tell that he's very intelligent but he isn't a great teacher. You barely hear him when you sit up front and he explains terribly. His quizzes and homework are okay, and he goes over them but his tests are so hard! He always gives partial credit though. Just be safe, and don't take him!",0
sensei if your reading this i miss you soooooo much. i've never had anyone so determined to get me to learn. you made it fun and interesting and awesome,1
"Lots of extra credit. Don't wait until the last minute. Follow the due dates and you will be fine. Small group readings and one group project. I hate writing and reading, but was still able to pass the class with an A. Again do the papers on the due dates, you get the opportunity to resubmit the paper. This was a Saturday class.",1
"I took his classes before, I do not use his notes because even in his notes they don't really describe were the numbers/solution come from. I am a more visual learner so mymathlab helped a lot when it came to showing the work. But Even though when I feel like I did okay on the exams I get extremely low scores. Doesn't give feedback or give you exam",0
Ms. Caron Breckel is amazing you will not regret taking her.  Either online or class she is willing to help you with anything she can. The best advice I can say is choosing her for you class and  the exam are not difficult all you have to do is study.,1
Mr. Horan is a starigh OG. Says what he wants and teaches you everything,1
Her assignments and expectations were vague. She could not explain why she gave you certain grades. The class was stressful and she seemed distracted for most of it. She did not give constructive feedback. In some cases her feedback was contradictory. Would not take class from her again.,0
He was good. He would sometimes let us out early or ask us if we wanted to stay and do class or not. He test grading is like u compete w/ ur classmates and ur test score is based against everyone's else. I got a 69 on my first test and it was a B.,1
Kinda didn't seem like he cared much and just wanted us out of there plus he didn't explain well.,0
"Honestly the worst math professor I ever had. Over complicated simple subjects, ridiculously difficult tests which were also long. Did curve but it didn't help much. The class is already a hard one and he made it even more difficult to manage. Don't take him.",0
"Prof. Brown's ENG 361 Native Writers class was great. There is a lot of reading throughout the term, but I enjoyed each text and the professor was passionate about the material he was teaching and was incredibly knowledgeable about the subject matter. He grades tough on the essays but gives you the extremely generous opportunity to revise.",1
"Worst professor in modern history. Teaching is just not for her. She made up an imaginary periodic table for exams, she doesnt care at all. Im begging every student do not take her classes if you want to learn and pass. She is just awful. I wished I read the comments before taking her class. Absolutely do not waste your time and money with her.",0
"very bad teacher , no examples",0
"My most challenging class so far. Professor Q. does not play.  World Mythology is not an easy class. I always have a workload of homework. However, he prepares for what is to come. Might as well get used to a heavy load of homework. That's what college is about anyway.",1
"Dr. Callaway is a very kind woman, but as a professor she can feel a little removed and intimidating. Her class is sort of dry and uninteresting. The readings are not long but are constant. A VERY VERY HARSH grader, on papers and exams. I personally think the class is not worth taking, but she is worth getting to know. ",0
Dr. Nikkel is the best. No one ever has any problems with him in my class. He only asks that you get the basic understanding of the material and is understanding when you write your papers.,1
"She is a very nice lady that is always willing to help. Essays and readings are quite hard, and I don't recommend procrastinating on the research. There are four total essays, but she explains everything pretty well. The last essay was around 8-10 pages. If you don't get at least a C or higher on these, then you will fail.",1
"Very helpful...tells you exactly what will be on exams by giving homework assignments. You don't turn them in, but it's whats on the exam. Made a B, and I'm horrible in math!!",1
Not a good lecturer. All he does is assign youtube videos to watch at home and tests you on it. His classes consist of answering questions about the homework and correcting quiz questions you got wrong. Only reason I passed is because I took Calculus in High School. I chose to take 75B with him after 75A because there's very little work to do.,0
"Do not take this class if you are not confident in your math skills. He works example problems on the board, but he skips the small mental math steps which can make things very confusing. I had to go to the tutors every day after class. If it was not for the tutors I would not have passed the class.",0
Don't take this class with this professor! No grade updates at all so you have no idea where you stand. Required reading doesn't count toward the grade at all.,0
"Professor Sankara is awesome- good teacher, friendly, fair grader. I totally disagree with the previous comment.. class isn't boring, it's my favorite french class yet at Delaware.",1
"His lectures are generally very boring. I think the discussion sections by his TAs were more helpful for me. However, the textbook which was written by him is well-written and it is very helpful.",0
"She is knowledgeable and will offer 'help' when asked, but is horrible at teaching. Her lectures are all over the place, short and confusing. The book is the only way you will learn anything if you are new to programming. She also likes to cancel classes with no notice, missed almost 3 weeks of class! ",0
I enjoyed D. Dyers class. His lectures were great and helpful. He gives Webassigns and assignments roughly once a week that are usually pretty easy. The hardest thing was the short projects but they aren't worth much. Overall if you put in the work it's not a hard course.,1
This course is a complete waste of money and time. This guy has no idea what hes doing hes terrible. Professor Thompson does nothing more than read off The overhead projector its obvious he has no idea what the cost is about. Long boring lectures that have nothing to do with what youre going to be tested on sad so very sad. Take another class,0
"Nice guy but I hate his class. A lot of homework and projects. Also, have a midterm and final. he grades really harshly and ridiculous. If you're not very familiar with excel and access microsoft don't take his class.",0
She really wants you to succeed! 3 exams that she prepares you for but there is a lot of homework. she gives the homework so you have a better chance of getting an A if you arent a good test taker. the homework is simple & straight forward. great person & professor!!,1
"Great professor. What made the class difficult was the material, not the professor. Her lectures are very interesting and she treats you as if you are all equals and just as intelligent as she is. There is a reason she has a 4.7 on her and for organic chemistry, this teacher should be your number one priority pick.",1
"Hard to understand, unclear of whats on exam, he will ask ""what chapter are we on again?"" (very forgetful) not true to his word .. do not reccommend if you dont need it",0
"A smart teacher whose lectures can be interesting to listen to. However, she tends to go on tangents, and her thought process is hard to follow sometimes. Also, she was not very clear about when things were due.",1
Tancredi is a great guy. He clearly knows his stuff very well and clearly loves sharing it with others. He is crystal clear on everything and isn't hard so long as you pay attention. He is easy to talk to and approach and will help you out with anything if you need it. Also an amazing musician. One of my favorite professors.,1
He is one of the worst professors you can imagine. Talks more about politics than physics. Stay away from this professor if you are actually looking to learn.,0
"You can tell that she has good intentions, but she simply does not teach the subject well. If you don't go into this class with a very thorough background in Chemistry, you're not going to have a fun time.",0
"Kendra is a wonderful instructor. She's always positive, gives great feedback, and is more than willing to meet with you outside class for extra guidance. Plus, she's very engaging in class, which is a rare thing to come by. Terrific experience in grad level poetry workshop. Would love to take her every semester.",1
"tends to rant about random topics in class. He'll pick out really obscure historical events and focus on them for days. Not too bad, but definitely not fun. One time we actually talked about the rap group fu-schnickens for an entire class period. other than that though it kinda sucks. research papers are the only grades. avoid him.",0
"He is not a bad guy, he's just not a great professor. Gets off on tangents like every 5 seconds, and if you make the mistake of asking a question, be ready to hear a 45 min answer. Basically makes you direct the class. You read a chapter a week and then talk about it in class, but he usually has no material. You have to have question ready 4him",0
"Very tough grader. If you dont do the work with the exact method he teaches he marks it all incorrect. Tests are way to hard, he does simple versions of problems in class, but exams have complicated problems. Would not take again. Do NOT take if you are not a math pro.",0
"This class is amazing, and Prof Floyd made it 10x better! If you are trying to figure out who to take MKTG 304 with - TAKE HIM. Grading is easy, mostly group projects. He makes the material relatable to real life. He is extremely clear about exactly what will be on quizzes and tests. Show up, participate, and you will get an A.",1
If you take her class be prepared to teach yourself. Very hard to understand and she does not explain anything.,0
"AVOID. She is very confusing and does not respond to emails. You will have weekly quizzes. The final is nothing like what you are being taught in class. There are 2 major projects that you will be required to do, the first one is very easy but the second one is very confusing. I had to teach myself the information because she provided no help.",0
"Prof. K is absolutely an entertaining and helpful teacher. He focuses on composition, and if you focus your art work on composition, you will get an A. As long as you try, he will see that. I thought he was hilarious, and his class was fun to attend. Overall, he's a great professor, I wish he taught more classes at UMBC. He is brilliant",1
She was one of my best professors I have ever had!! She was very kind and caring! If you show up and pay attention to her lectures it'd be hard to not get an A (you don't need to take notes bc she posts her Powerpoints on bb). I highly recommend her!!,1
"If you looking for easy way to pass cmsc411,take his course. exams are 99% same if you go to the exam review. HWs are really simple if you spend some time searching through his note/google. Projects is the hardest which is not very challenging. I doubt any can fail in his course. Easy A with effort.",0
This was an easy class before I got to this guy...He made everything difficult and made tons of mistakes which made me have to follow up all the time just to make sure that I got the grade I deserved....I was doing my job as a student and his by constantly having to correct everything...Forget it...,0
"Very passionate about her course, was a lawyer for years so she knows what she is talking about. Attendance is 30 percent so if you go to class it helps out your grade a lot. If you don't want to go to class don't take her. The only downside is she is not good with technology so she needs some reminders about that, but she is very fair.",1
Love Kathy! She actually cares about her students and is very understanding. Offers a lot of extra credit. The classes are pretty repetitive but not hard. Book used for weekly online quizzes.,1
Hot teacher. Highly recommended!,1
"Professor Swartz is one of the best professors you will ever have. Don't get me wrong, his grading is very frustrating, but you will learn and become a better student because of him. He'll work w/ you before exams to go over concepts you don't get & spend his own time in order to help you learn. You'll be scared at first he's a god. Word, dawg",1
"Awful. Basically spends the whole class ranting and tells you how if you don't know one very specific thing you won't have a job. I'm stuck with him for Functional Verification. Doesn't help you if you ask for anything, doesn't teach material relevant to the homework. So atrocious people stopped coming to class. Avoid like the plague if possible.",0
"Good lecturer. Class was a bit slow, but that wasn't he professor's fault.",1
"Doesn't teach how to write syntax; primarily only C/C++ theory. The professor is very knowledgeable, but if your new to programming, your going to have a HARD time. I believe this class should be an intermediate course rather than an introductory one. You will NEED to study outside of class and learn how to code yourself.",0
He's not good at teaching on how to write a paper.,0
"She's awful!!!!! I had an online class with her. Slow response, & because she wouldn't response quickly to my email. I would do homework incorrectly & endedup getting a bad grade.  She's awful!",0
"This guy is great. Honest and funny. He gives valuable real-life advice/information along with class material. Knows his stuff. If you have a chance, take his class.",1
"Honestly, I really expected more from this Professor given that he has really good reviews but Im really disappointed. His lectures were clear for the most part but the hw/tests werent always representative to the lectures. He throws curve balls. He doesnt really reply to emails either. This class was not really enjoyable whatsoever:(",0
"BEST TEACHER EVER. Super frinedly, upbeat, and always has a smile on his face. always willing to help,great positive personality. TONS of extra credit, can't leave this class without an A or B.",1
"Dude, you are teaching an INTRODUCTORY class to ACCOUNTING, one of the toughest subject ever. Students just don't come in and pick up debits/credits or balance sheets right off the bat. He really screwed my accounting GPA over.",0
No heavy work. Make sure to reply to at least 6 or 7 students in discussion posts to get full grades. There were two multiple choice exams. It is an easy A class.,1
"Took the WebCT course. Disorganized and unclear with instructions, Prof. Popovich fail to respond to your question in a timely manner and when he did finally respond the answer mada no sense to the question you had asked. I would not recommend this class unless you have no choice.",0
"After speaking with other students in other 101 sections, it became clear that I hit the jackpot by being placed into Krutz's section. Wish I could take him for more classes.",1
"Love is an AMAZING professor! I was lucky enough to have her my last semester at CSUN and I have never benefitted from a class more. She is very supportive and funny which is a rarity. Honestly, she is a complete jewel and if you have the chance to take her, she will make you shine. Maybe I am being a little sentimental but I just love her!",1
"A tough grader and will nitpick your assignment for any flaw she can deduct points on. Tests are relatively difficult and you only get 30 minutes to complete them. Does offer extra credit and provides semi-decent feedback on each assignment. Failed to submit final grades for the class by the due date, so I still don't know my grade yet",0
Love his class.,1
" The class material was extremely boring.  I tried to follow and learn from the critiques she gave me but I did not see any improvement in my grade. Her critiques are vague, this was one of the most frustrating class I ever took. I do not like her teaching style and I do not recommend her to anyone. Boring , frustrating & prof not interactive.",0
"I was excited to take this class, she has a lot of work experience and it shows in lecture. Her lectures are very boring, dry and granular. Not a very good communicator. Too strict on time limits on exams and has ripped them out of my hands several times. Putative, obtuse and very short on empathy. Not sure what her motivations are for teaching.",0
I was unsure about her at first but she was an ok teacher and she is nice. I didn't learn much in the class but there weren't many assignments and she is an easy grader. She can be hard to understand sometimes and struggles to communicate what she wants from an assignment. Her class is pretty boring and we really don't do much while we are there.,1
"Very confusing about the projects, looks for specific she never mentionned.",0
"She posts podcasts of her lectures which is really helpful for off campus students. The tutorials are boring and pointless, but the content in her lectures is very interesting. She is very passionate about what she is teaching. Her tests are also super fair, just do the readings and pay attention in lecture",1
Inspiring professor! Best and most useful class I've taken!,1
Tries to cover way too much within the 75min class. having the homework & quizzes online makes it very difficult to keep up with assignments because she gives no reminders of due dates. she is a very nice lady but a horrible teacher... would definitely NOT recommend!,0
He is a very nice guy. The class is relatively easy. They expect you to learn it on the essential calculus application though. The material is not really taught in any of the math classes. They more just expect you to learn it yourself. Nice guy though and is definitely willing to help if you ask.,1
"Horrible, don't even know why he is the only acct 102 professor. Does not help you in any kind of way and just expects you to know it and if you don't then tough. Wish there were other professors teaching this course so i could have switched... now I'm stuck with him and he is useless. He doesn't teach and doesn't explain anything.",0
"If you ever get a chance to take academic success with Caitlyn, do it. She's extremely caring, inspirational, and funny. She truly wants you to succeed in academia and in life. She's extremely approachable and walks you through everything. Small groups were fun. Definitely an instructor who has impacted my UofM experience. Highly recommend!!",1
one of the easiest A's i have ever got.,1
"Brilliant man, probably a tough grader, but always fair.  Lots of reading, but if you do it well, you should be fine.  I recommend anything w/him.",1
"He clearly knows what he's talking about, but I wouldn't suggest ever taking his class. I've never had anyone rip apart my writing like this guy. Got mostly Cs on essays even with office hour help. Not to sound conceited, but every prof I've ever had has praised my writing and he hated everything I did. Unless you have no other choice, AVOID.",0
"very clear in what is expected, very enthusiastic",1
She gives back to back homework!!! Everyday!!!,0
Professor Pantaleon is a very chaotic and messy teacher that cannot explain the easiest aspects of the subject. His lectures don’t cover test materials and his grading system is unclear. Don’t count on his help after evening class because he rarely has time for his students since he has to make it to the train station on time. .,0
supposed to be a bird class but he made it really hard,0
"Dr. Santos is amazing, period. She is incredibly respected throughout the English Department by faculty and students alike. She's really a gem and I wish I could take more courses with her. She's brilliant, nice, caring, and a feminist. Does it get better than that?",1
"Don was pretty intimidating at first, but he's a really nice guy. He's really quick witted and he makes a concerted effort to learn about his students. I took personal finance with him. The material wasn't particularly difficult, but I found the midterms to be hard because they're very detail heavy. Tough marker but his expectations are clear.",1
Class is thought-provoking; Pynn is passionate about what he teaches. Oddly attractive and fascinating to listen to. Would take again if I had room in my schedule.,1
"I cannot learn from just reading a textbook, and thats how he teaches. I'm failing because he does not explain anything, he just stands up there and erads the book to us. I didn't pay for an online course, I want a teacher!I was so excited to start classes, and now I'm ready to quit.",0
"She's rude. Does not know how to engage in conversation. She looks down on her students. At least, made me feel stupid. I agree with the person who mentioned that she discusses student's personal stories in front of everyone. Very invasive. She also does not challenge the students' thinking. Class is super easy and basic. Didn't learn anything new.",0
"Mrs. Wolfsen's a great instructor, her classes are inspiring and not hard with the work load. She's has a lot of videos that relate to class, especially for Gender Communication, so don't slack off! Do the work and you'll get a 4.0, love her!",1
English 101: I will no take him again. He can't give feedback and has a very hard time explaining what he would like from you in your papers. I had to asked him for an example of a college thesis for the first 2 months. Also he takes way to long to grade paper. It took him a week to grade 8 days to grade a paper that was required to be done in 2.,0
"Very relaxing and funny lecture, totally a enjoyable time. ",1
Coolness,1
"She'll give a quiz every week, but by half ways through the semester, she won't post the slides from lecture until the day of the quiz. And if you're like I who has a class at 9 am, and then her class at 10:30, you're screwed. She has only given one bonus question on 1 quiz and gives 1 on exams.",0
"If I had the option to describe this class in one word... it would be HORRIBLE. Tests are super hard, attendance is MANDATORY so if you miss three or more times, you're down to an 80% for attendance. She is not helpful and gives horrible lectures. I would NOT recommend her whatsoever. Save yourself and do NOT take the course with her",0
Two classes in - and amazing. Knows real life applications. And also - DREAM. How did WCTC get this guy??,1
I recommend taking lower biology classes then go into BIO-168. Eric expects you to know biology like it is the back of your hand. He rushes his lectures.,0
"Amazing professor! She really pushes you to your full potential. Although she doesn't always use her powerpoint during lecture, she keeps the lecture entertaining and makes the material easier to understand. As a clinical professor, she is fast paced and keeps you on your toes. She may keep you past lunch so make sure you bring a quick snack.",1
"I've taken Will's class from LFS250 to 350 and found myself lucky for not required to take LFS400. He is the most unaccessible teacher ever in my whole school life. No email response, and he's not willing to help students.",0
"Dr. Ranft is by far the least caring professor I have ever taken. He didn't show up for half of the semester and when he did, he gave incorrect, confusing examples and went on irrelevant rants. He purposely added confusing wording to questions and was not fair in hearing students' concerns. You'll never get him to respond to an email either.",0
I found this class quite confusing. The lectures never seemed to match with the tests and seemed to be mostly a distraction from the subject matter. A vocabulary lists words and definitions that are surprising since most are never addressed in class.The links to Wikipedia prove especially annoying since I'm not paying to have Wikipedia teach me.,0
"She does not use her lecture time very well. She spends a long time on a particular topic, then has to hurry and cover other material in a very short period of time. Takes points for attendance in lecture and discussion sessions once a week. Overall a nice teacher, but I felt she made an entry level Biology course incredibly too hard.",0
"he doesn't reply to emails often, but makes the effort if a student is in need of some attention like retaking an exam and such. His notes aren't that organized, made grand mistakes on poppers and deadlines so this is pretty much self taught. College alg is decent, not too hard not too easy either. Just study by yourself honestly.",0
I took his Math course and absolutely loved it!!! Actually understood the material and looked forward to this class.,1
"I took Mr. Raigoza's classes CSCI4 and CSCI25. He is awesome! I saw the other reviews from other students but if they gave him a bad rating they are probably ""noobs"". His classes are for hard-core computer geeks. If you want to push yourself and really dive deep into the material, take his classes. He gives loads of extra credit for determination.",1
I had 30 people in my class. 4 people passed and we all got C's. I had a private tutor twice a week and sat at the communal math table all day. I worked as hard as possible but still barely passed. Do NOT take math with him! wait until you can have a different professor.,0
he is horrible,0
"Her class is not suitable for beginners. The instructions for assessments are not clear. The focus points on each class hard to follow. Unreasonable time management for each project. Hard to communicate. Useless feedback. When you ask her a question, her feedback is not what you asking, her feedback is what she wants to say, and this is not",0
"She's a great teacher. Gives a lot of hw and have to read a lot but it's english so it's part of the course. A lot of essays but break it up in sections. Go to class, its part of your grade. She really want to help you understand the material so will make sure you understand before moving forward.",1
"Ms. Campbell is a TERRIBLE professor. After she told me I should drop out because I shouldn't be in university (instead of offering help or helping in some manner), I pushed through for two more years and then took a few years off before completing my degree. Her criticism not only set me behind but sent me into therapy. Avoid Her!",0
"The main issue with this professor isn't his teaching style or course content but the fact that he always sounds angry. I don't think he's actually mad, but it's hard to feel comfortable in a class where the teacher's normal speaking volume is shouting. Expect to spend a lot of time on the labs and homework. The exams were very straight-forwards.",0
"Very bad. The class is supposed to be aboud culture, but she ends up teaching mostly history. Is unclear, lectures have little to do with exam material. Without discussion sections, the exams would be utterly impossible. Accent sometimes hard to understand (she's Polish) and rambles in lectures on nonrelated material.",0
"Very much loves his personality, and loves attention. Talks about him more than the actual class. Does not have much experience, and does not have many examples for the class. Give tests, but leaves the room. Intentional late. No care for the students unless they are female. Grabs women in front of all the class, and has not a good reputation......",0
"Dr. Hale is one of the best professors I've had at APU. If you do the work, study for his quizzes, and pay attention and actually attend class it should be a piece of cake. Reading the material is a must! He's entertaining and sweet as a person. I would one-hundred percent take Dr. Hale again!",1
"COM 408 is the capstone class for COM majors and it is a really hard class. But Mark made it very clear. He loves what he is teaching and knows the material so well because he loves teaching it. He is a very hard grader, but if you show up to class and work through the lectures with him everything is extremely clear.",1
"I have no idea what those others are talking about saying shes a bad teacher. The only way youre getting an F or a low grade because you dont pay attention in class and not doing your homework. I failed two math classes because the other teachers were horrible. Prof Choi Baek, not only a great math teacher, but shes a great teacher overall.",1
Worst Prof ever. Class average for exam was 46.,0
"VERY funny professor, makes everything super clear, and does a great job of relating the topics to his students. Great class!",1
"You will work for your grade in his class, but you will be appreciative for it afterwards. I've had him for two classes, both of which were tough, but I came out truly knowing the material. Gives solid feedback on the homework - which there is a lot of, but I actually liked it! TAKE HIM!",1
"Wonderful professor! My only complaint is at times she can be too easy to pass. If you are not self motivated to learn the material, you can still get an A with very little effort while learning very little. Otherwise, helpful with good lectures and very easy to talk to. ",1
"Teaches out of the book, but does not understand what the book is teaching. Graded heavily by exams that are very difficult. Most of the class was failing, so he made the grade entirely dependent on the final which I got a C on. Extremely boring lectures, monotone.",0
I took Professor Fink's course for the Understanding Historical Change requirement and she was a fantastic teacher. I'm not a History person so I was nervous about taking this course but her assignments were super straight forward and her passion for the material really motivated me to put in the work. One of the best Professors I've ever had!,1
"Class is mandatory, you will take a quiz everyday to verify you are there, there is alot of homework that is due every week, the homework is time consuming and you use excel heavily, if you are looking for an easy class this is not the one for you, tests are just like the homework there are 4 exams- very doable class i recommend it as an easy A/B",1
I think she is a good teacher and funny too but she needs to learn to be more respectful of students and more understanding!!,0
"prior posts correct. very cagey re test format, what would be covered etc. material given cursory treatment with focus on theory, as if goal was 2 cover all of book as opposed to understndng rules. unclear as 2 important points, as if all about a case was important. last class insisted on talking about irrelevant material not on exam. AVOID!",0
Very funny lady. She lets you know if your work is good or not. She has an accent and it is very hard to understand her sometimes. She will help you if you ask. It takes me hours to do projects for her class AND we work in class too! Her grading is a little harsh with all the hours you spend working on it. But overall i enjoyed going to class.,1
"One of my favorite professors at Bentley. Intimidating & can be a bit much at times with his comments, but you will get used to it. He knows his stuff & is extremely active in state/ local politics so you will learn a lot. 4 essays, the first is challenging as he has a specific way he wants them. Definitely taught me some new strategies in writing",1
Easily one of the best teachers i have ever had. She is super knowledgeable in human services and creates a warm and welcoming environment for students. She is so caring and creates a bond with each and every student she has. I learned a lot and it was 100% enjoyable. A true class act.,1
"If you want to major in literature, this class is for you.",0
"I took this course in class in spring. Just listen to what this teacher is saying in class and you will learn a lot, assignments are clear and easy. 3 tests from quizzes and you are set.",1
"Marc is a very nice guy don't get me wrong, but I took him for geography and physical science. The test are mad hard and the study guides do not help. Half of the stuff on the test aren't even on the study guide.",0
"This guy doesn't know how to explain anything, he is a harsh grader, and doesnt know how to speak English, dont take him.",0
"Lots of extra credit on tests and quizzes marks leniently, best computer science prof at nipissing.",1
"Very disorganized, late to class and not the best person to explain a course to students who aren't good with math in general. I would not recondmend taking her but I would recommend Michael green.",0
great professor but get ready to read you have to work smart in her class not hard. She always reviews what is going to be on the quiz and its almost the same as the quiz. If you listen to her lectures go through her power points and follow instruction its an easy A. Awesome professor,1
"Okay, he's a great guy and hes funny, and hes a good prof. He gives you space to think for yourself and be creative with your own work. This is a pretty hard class though, and hes a relatively tough grader but its an interesting class. He uploads his slides but some slides are taken out, most likely to encourage people to attend class.",1
Easy class. He curves a lot too.,1
He's a down to earth professor and loves to get along with the students. Is willing to help and usually available. If he continues teaching biomechanics there is no reason for you to get lower than a B. Lectures may be boring. Do well on the midterm/final and your presentation/project and you should get an A. (He brought donuts on finals day!),1
"Rare combination: understands advanced math concepts AND can explain things to people who aren't great at math!  Amazingly helpful during office hours.  Patient,  respectful, and non-judgmental to questions, responds well to feedback.  Genuinely wants students to succeed. Study guides for tests.  Tests reflect HW and class content.",1
"Mrs. Bowlin does not teach at all. she just sits there and reads the ""questions"" that will be on the test. i have not really learned anything in the class. and we don't have any type of disscussion. any time that there is an attempt at disscussion from one of the students she shoots it down.",0
"You will lose points if you skip his class. But you dont have any choice but to take his class because he is the only graphic design professor, which is infuriating because his sense of design is so off, he thinks textbooks from the 80s are ideal and has no idea about current trends. he still hasnt let me turn in my 1st project!",0
"This guy was a terrible and is always ""right"". He will doc you points for things he didn't ask for. We can't read minds.. you will also never get 100% on anything.I have already learned all of the material before but found a way to doc me points",0
Malcolm was my first college teacher and his class was great. His class is easier than any high school classes I've ever taken. Does not do attendance and no quiz or finals. Three short papers in total. I found the lectures extremely interesting and Malcolm sparked a newfound love for economics. I missed class many time and still got a 108.3%.,1
"This lady is supper sweet, but she clearly has nothing else to do than make you so homework. She seems to forget that this is a 100 level course and that we take other classes. She assigns too many readings, projects and essays. Do take her unless you like that.",0
"He said he is CPA. He is CPA, CMA, which is so different. He doe not have a finance background. He is not CFA and does not have a degree in Finance. Do not expect to learn anything from him. He has a really bad attitude towards students.",0
This man is very sweet but very out of touch. Online teaching is definitely not his format of choice. He rambles a lot and I found myself doing better by not attending lectures.,0
"Don't take him for math! He's a computer teacher, not algebra, and he can't explain anything. Despite this he was very nice, made lots of beer jokes, and tried to help as much as possible. He was just not meant to teach math. Only take this if you need math courses beyond it or remember a LOT from high school algebra, otherwise take MATH127. l",0
"Prof Asbell taught this class with Stahly/Sosa and her section was incredibly easy to understand. She went over exactly what would be on the test and told us what to study during her lectures and after videos. The material was really interesting - gender fluidity, hip hop culture, etc - and was approachable and easy to talk to if help was needed.",1
he is very nice to everyone,1
"DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS! Very confusing and all over the place kind of teaching. His teaching is to give you 2 different textbooks and watch you tube video lectures-which he states not to pay too much attention to! Tests-essays on 450 pages of info but no specifics The ""reviews"" for the quiz/test are paragraphs and can't relate to the texts.",0
"The content is interesting but gets spoiled by the teaching. All the material assigned as reading is recovered in class in long-drawn-out ways. The rhetorical style is boring, causing most students to get sleepy until being cold-called in the middle of a class to answer a specific question. If you do a lot of work you'll do well, but it's a pain",0
I've taken Krutz in the past and always enjoyed his classes so nothing against him. Learned essentially nothing in this class though.,1
"If you are to question this professor about knowledge surrounding a newer topic, be prepared for him to walk around the question. All of the labs are spelled out word-for-word. Do not expect a challenge The way this class is taught, it should be a 200 level class. This class is a disservice for all students that may want to do offensive security.",0
"She is passionate about Academic Dishonesty! In other words do your own work! It was a horror show for this class specifically. The class is easy, pay attention, write down the clicker questions - they are in the exam. Learn the content. Her test are average as long as you study the review questions. NO LAPTOPS! Or phones she will call you out!",1
"only one thing to say: a final exam, in college, consisting of 11 fill in the blank questions??????? you decide.",0
"He is a nice person but a not very good professor. His tests are extremely difficult. Try to do well on the online quizzes, and the BP that's the only thing that can help you have a decent grade in this class.",0
Really funny and somewhat entertaining,1
"Sister Gallini is fantastic! Very helpful and responsive. This course is the same no matter who your instructor is, it's an already prepared online class. There is groupwork and each member gets a turn taking the lead in the group. I had a conflict on the week that I was supposed to be the leader and she easily accomodated me.",1
"My class was online so, I expected great challenges knowing that math is not me friend. All homework assignments are in mathxl which isn't user friendly when needing to round. However, he was always there; ready and  willing to go the extra mile. ",1
Do not take this professor. She is a tough grader and quick to give out zeros to her students. She does not respond to emails and she is not approachable and will give you attitude if you need to talk to her about something. She is not a fair professor at all.,0
"I absolutely loved Professor Doroshenko. She is super nice, and is willing to explain any questions you have. I do wish we were in person, but over zoom the class was still amazing. She has us use TopHat for homework, but some of her other classes used a different platform. She does have an accent, but you just used to it.",1
"I don't recommend this professor. She's the type of person - if one student is doing something wrong she takes (whatever it is) away from everyone. To punish the one who did wrong, she punishes the entire class. The class is tough enough as it is. Unless you are fluent in French, you will not receive full credit on any assignment. Not caring at all",0
This professor has experience and knowledge in/of the business world.  She stays up-to-date on many topics and keeps the class interested and throughout her lectures.  She also has many theories on teaching and how students learn and apply them to class.  She also takes real-world scenarios and applies them to her classes.,1
This guy is the hardo of all hardos,1
"MWF exams were 5-7 questions, about 20 points, average never exceeded 50%. Average gets curved to an 80% but it's not a bell curve, so one bad exam screws you over big time. The final was 2 hours and out of 200 pts with same level of difficulty so many felt inadequately prepared. Sweetheart as a person, very difficult to follow in lecture though.",0
"Nice guy, replies to emails, and is pretty lenient with assignments. He practically gives you the answers for the midterm and final, and if you do the assignments it's an easy A. However the lectures are incredibly boring. He reads his PowerPoint slides word for word and it's obvious he doesn't know how to teach, result: didn't actually learn much.",0
"3 exams, basically gives the answers to 75% of the exam, the other 25% you can google on quizlet. Textbook mandatory for HW. Honestly, his accent is really bad. His handwriting is equally just as bad. Nice professor. Encourages students to participate. Loved his positivity during these hard times. Tried to do his best with what he was provided.",1
"Even though I didnt do as well as I had hoped, dobrin was helpful and great in the class",1
"His powerpoint slides are poorly organized. His explanation does not make sense. The test was hard, and he likes to test on something that he didn't talk about in the class. In the class, he just mumble on and on. The laboratory program is also unorganized and is lack of sufficient guidance. All in all, he doesn't like teaching and not good at it.",0
The tests were extremely difficult had a 46.5% average. I would of had a B in the class but right before the end he said APLIA wasn't working correctly and completely dropped the homework grade causing me to drop a letter grade.,0
"There is busy work, but not difficult at all. Keep up on your assignments and submit ON TIME. Easy A. The textbook was ""mandatory"" but I never opened it.",1
"Third time with Pell. She is such a sweet lady who really cares about her students. She got a little carried away with electrochem (like usual) but the exams were a lot easier than they could have been, and she is known for making hard exams. Good course over all that wasnt too challenging. Engaging lectures and she is just really nice to talk to",1
"She made working w/SPSS fun & easy. Youll be assigned to a group where all the labs will be done. She tends to fall behind on a lot of grading, so be ready to stress over not knowing what you got. She also likes to use a lot of humor in her lectures, which can rub people the wrong way, but shes devoted & wont move on until everyone understands it",1
"He's not a bad teacher, but this class was just way too much work for a stupid theater class. I had a 4.0 GPA until this semester, and would have kept that if not for this class, which is definitely going to lower my gap because of the stupid quizzes we get ONCE A WEEK and the midterm and final!! I suck at math and I;m doing better in Pre-calc!",0
"He is strict with deadlines, grammar and structure. However, if you keep up with his pace it should be relatively easy to get an A. He does have a clear way of guiding the students on the papers, and he's very accessible in case you have questions.",1
"He doesn't follow his syllabus and has trouble connecting with his students on an educational level. He will talk endlessly about a subject without allowing students enough hands-on experience, which inevitably bites you in the ass when the end of the semester rolls in and he realizes you've done .5/10 of his intended projects. Nice & funny though.",0
This class is way too much work during a pandemic and when all our courses are online. This woman acts that we only have her class to worry about!Her explanation for projects is horrible! Would make it easy if she can actually clarify what she wants. Expects way too much. Only class that I have numerous extra stuff. Dont take her stay away!!!,0
"Her lectures are interesting and engaging, she makes sure everyone is on board and understanding the material, and she provides clear study guides for all her exams and assignments, as well as valuable feedback and flexible office hours. I really enjoyed this class with her, and look forward to many more!",1
The class is very easy as long as you attend class and do most of the readings. Thangaraj is very interesting and helpful. I took his class to meet hours and enjoyed it so much that Sociology is now my major. I would recommend it to anyone.,1
Expects you to know everything. Difficult to understand and knows most of the class does not get it and still does not try to make us understand. If asked a question he will only repeat himself and make you look dumb. Horrible Prof.,0
"New teacher. Very disorganized. VERY. I like to be prepared for the semester; knowing expectations, assignment %, weekly breakdown, etc.  Every week, a new assignment is given. She is very nice and charming, but is not an educator.  She comes from corporate-level IT job, and the transition is terrible. God will need to help you if taking her class",0
"Noland is my bestie. She is one of the best professors I have ever had. Her lessons mixed with her humor and quick jokes keeps the class fun, and makes you want to continue coming back to learn. She also has a lot of great life advise and really wants to see you succeed! 10/10 she needs an award for being so great.",1
"McEvoy is very intimidating when you first get into the class, but she is great. She has a dry sense of humor and is willing to clarify any questions you may have. She's been doing this for a long time and definitely likes to do it her way, but go to class and participate and youll be fine. 1 midterm, 2 papers.",1
Has been messing up lectures for so long that I have not learned a single thing. Better luck learning online if you can find anything on his topics...,0
Very inconsiderate and answers emails with an attitude. She doesn't care about what happens with you if you struggle. She also doesn't tell you how she translates number grades to letter grades (65D-). TOUGH GRADER! Little mistakes MATTER. Petty and fake. You will not feel great after her class. I've NEVER felt so bad about myself with a teacher.,0
Worst teacher I have ever had in a class period. I cannot believe the work load she believes us to carry for a gen-ed when we have multiple other classes and tons of other homework. I thought I would take an easy class for gen-ed credits and it would be a breeze but she gives you 60+ pages of reading before every class. Worst teacher I've ever had.,0
bad,0
"Prof interessant. Divague souvent. Toujours a son bureau. Ça m'a pris 3 cours comprendre c'étais quoi le sujet du cours: la Méthodologie. Fait des premieres corrections de vos travaux si necessaire. Moyennes tres hauttes, attendances aux 3-4 derniers cours mandatoires pour passer. Questions de lexam donnees en classe. Tres drole et sympathique",1
"Peris is a fine choice if algebraic math or former chemistry courses came easily to you. Otherwise, he moves to quickly through the material. Although he asks for questions his condescending demeanor discourages participation. He has command of his material but is unaware of his weaknesses and spends a lot of time bragging about himself.",0
Awful prof. Not approachable at all. Do not know what is going on in class at all. Exam is mostly study guide.,0
"Mostly the purpose of this class was to promote the instructor's own curriculum. Sometimes it seems like this is the whole point of the whole First Year Writing Program. I think that is a sad, sad thing. Student writing is served by the dedication and one-on-one help of the GTA's and Lecturers who teach 110, but this course doesn't help them do it.",0
"He's so extra. If you can put up with him and his unnecessary attitude, it's pretty much an easy A.",0
"Okay, normally college professors are bland and just assign assignments, grade them, and give help when asked. Professor Reese is completely different. He is outgoing, vibrant, and hilarious. I actually look forward going to his classes, and I never want to skip because of how entertaining he is. He is awesome and take him if you can!",1
Took 4 week class. Somewhat challenging since it's new material. Need decent algebra skills and very good reading comprehension skills if you want to excel with just reading the book. She doesn't really teach at all just manages the class. Great option to get this over with over the summer.,1
"This Professor is a devil in human form. She is very rude, with great accent. When you ask questions she laughs as if students don't know anything. She thinks that she knows it all but i am not surprise that she is not married and don't have kids. No one can live with a difficult, rude and heartless person like 'Subadra'.",0
Explains things very well,1
"While mr. Fu is nice and is very knowledgeable about this subject, I feel like he is not a good teacher. I had a hard time understanding him because of his accent and broken English. He seems to prefer outdated ideas over modern ideas so beware of that. He doesn't give very good feedback either. I don't really recommend his classes.",0
Best professor of my first semester. Exam was such a nice break because he made it very easy.,1
"Lamkin is not a good professor as others students rated.   I took her BIO47 and I learned everything by myself.  She didn't lecture much and her tests are nothing related to what she lectured, hard to get what she means.   Bad teacher in bio, anatomy. ",0
"He's horrible, he pretends to want to help you, but at the end of the day he kills your grade with ridiculously harsh grading on  everything. Worst part is hes the only one who teaches the class. HSC department can condemn you to this class but can't help you with anything, no tutor for SPSS, no tutor for this course. Horrible",0
"Mrs Davis cares about her students success. We are able to help each other during lab while she walks around to make sure we understand. She is very pleasant, accessible after class & encourages us to come to her if we need help. Homework is the usual for a Statistics class. Her study guides before tests are very helpful - long - but helpful.",1
"This lady really makes us do an essay with 3 drafts, I'm not sure about you but that seems very unnecessary. On top of that she makes you do a letter of reflection on your paper to basically repeat what you said in your essay, so you basically gotta sum up your essay in four paragraphs which is so stupid and unnecessary. I DO NOT RECOMMEND>.",0
"She is passionate about chem and wants you to succeed. Her ""Chem Survivor Guide"" condenses all pertinent and tested info into one manual, which is also the basis of her lecture. She is extremely approachable and caring, and clear about what she wants on the test. No surprises: pay attention to lecture & take time to study the guide, you'll do well.",1
if you're having a hard time for the first few days. dropped the class! just drop it!,0
Does NOT grade in a timely.  Will not grade assignments for four to six weeks.  Very hard to determine what Cyd is looking for when you are not receiving feedback from her.  SAD!,0
"Only english professor to bring the historical context of the work to light.  Most english professors are so narrow sighted/minded they can look through a key hole with both eyes open, not MacArthur; he has a better crasp of where the writings 'fit in' to a given culture.",1
"Probably the worst teacher I have had for first year, hardest grader unnecessary work for an elective, trash professor responds in a week time",0
"Mr. Rodriguez throughout the semester assigns weekly supersite quizzes, an oral presentation, mid term, and a final. He tries his best to answer your questions, if he understands what you are asking.  He values participation and attendance, and will give extra points to those who participate and attend class. He is overall a good professor.",1
"He is very opinionated, unorganized and annoying at times. But he seems to know his stuff. I took the class in the summer and its very difficult. He skips sections and veers off on other topics that have nothing to do with the course.. If you want to pass you have to read the book; the entire book. Front to back. Cover to cover.",0
Hawks is the platform used to teach math from module 1 till 11. This class is COMPLETELY self taught. The test grades very precise so if you dont answer the question in the format they want you 2 you will get the entire question wrong. Prof Hunter was great. He is willing to help if you need that extra push. But you have to put in your OWN WORK.,1
He's great at making the lectures more understandable and fun. He was super helpful whenever you need help with the material and makes sure to go over it in a way that you understand. You could tell he cares about his students succeeding. Definitely recommend this professor!,1
"Dr.Sandra Corona is ans excelent teacher. I think she is the best teacher in child development that Southwester College had. I learn a lot from her lectures. She gave us a lot of homework and assignments, but she is there for helping each one of her students. I wish one day be like her. She is my role model to follow. I love how she teach.",1
"This is by far the hardest Statistics class to understand just because of the layout of the class. Exams are nothing like the HW problems in the book along with Wiley Plus. He drops an exam out of 3 still not helpful. The notations from his lectures to the books are different, which makes it harder to understand.",0
"Not the greatest professor in the world, but he is pretty up there. He gives interesting lectures and is fair on his grading. He likes it when students utilize office hours!",1
You use wileyplus instead of blackboard. It costs extra and honestly is pretty confusing. He barely remembered to post anything on time. Honestly for as little as he did to teach us I think he should have gave us all As. Dont plan to learn anything in his class. Not good for students who do not want to teach themselves the material.,0
only gives tests and not nearly enough time to complete them.,0
Decent teacher. Not the best but not the worst.,1
Horrible student feedback relationship experiences when typing up poorly written via e-mail communications; stumbles upon discussion entry assignments marking off participation points (penalizing students for mistakes); limited availability outside of classroom environment; and final essay exam must be completed for achieving full accredited units.,0
"Each essay is 6-8 pages and he doesn't seem to care what you write as long as you write it in his format. Hard to figure out what he's looking for but once you do it's pretty easy to get an A. Loves to hear himself talk, repeats everything he says. Doesn't appear to actually read journals. Ask about writing essays based on news articles.",0
Takes forever to grade.,0
Very nice professor. Easy A. Must take her!,1
"Class consist of attendance, pop quizzes/in class activities, 4 tests (drops the lowest), and assignments. Assignments are written and are short. Beware of pop quizzes though. The first test was online at home, the second test was in class with no use of notes or the book, the third exam was in class with notes, and the fourth was online . Got an A",1
One of my worst professors so far! Does not explain things. I personally could not get specific explanations for things. Would not take her again if it was up to me. Openly says she does not usually give As in this class and its seems shes proud of that. Not something I want in somebody that is teaching me anything.,0
"If Tim is teaching a class you are interested in taking...you MUST take his class. He is extremely adept at conveying the fundamentals of accounting clearly and with real life examples to boot (he is from the industry, not just teaching from academia). I have had other teachers who do not explain concepts well at all making it difficult to learn.",1
"I heard good things before, but she was AWEFUL! Rushes thru lectures, not prepared& just tells you what 2 teach yourself. Gave wrong date for the final, some people had to take the final 2 days early, but she only gave the study guide 48 hrs before we took it. Tried 2 ask for help & she told me 2 wait for study guide. Easy B but not a good teacher",0
This professor is doing nonsense thing! She asked me to rewrite my essay twice just because she didn't tell want I need to achieve at once! Now I have less than a week to write a final essay! It is killing me!,0
horrible teacher. ,0
Amazing class- material and professor- wise.,1
"This was an online class that I wish I could have taken in person. It is clear she loves History and it is reflected in the materials. There is a lot of reading, but it is all extremely interesting. I have left this class with useful knowledge and a better understanding of the World. Do the work, put 100% in and you will receive an A, hands down.",1
she knows her material but she's absolutely horrible at teaching. makes you pay for webassign and gives test/quiz problems that she has never gone over. horrible at explaining answers to questions that you have.,0
"Super hard for a CORE class, cool guy but VERY high expectations.",1
"LOVED PROF SPEARMAN! She is awesome and makes every class interesting. We had two exams and one article analysis to write. There is a quiz everyday to take attendance which means you cannot skip. Spearman is an English prof that knows her stuff and has a great relationship with her students. Take her, you won't regret it!",1
"She is a very nice lady, always in a good mood and knows every students name, but she makes the material but more complicated than it needs to be. Be prepared for lots of online homework and quizzes in drill almost every week. Attendance is mandatory or you cannot do well.",1
"Dr. Hale is a very difficult grader and requires a lot of his students but if you actually care about history and are interested in the subject, there is no other teacher that I would recommend more. I have learned so much in every course I have taken with him. He also cares and is realistic.",1
"Just a great professor and a great guy. Really wants you to learn the material. Passionate about the subject, he has a somewhat sarcastic sense of humor that is refreshing in class. Lots of reading but he is definitely worth studying with.",1
I hate to not say nice things about people so I will just say Dr. O'leary makes it non-stressful to go through these classes. Having been out of his classes for a few years now I have relearned everything he did not teach us. Unfortunately you can learn semiconductor devices much better on Google than with Dr. Oleary.,0
This professor is amazing! His lectures are funny and engaging. His workload is not heavy only a few assignments. He provides a study guide for the two exams in his class and has a couple of quizzes due throughout the semester that are super easy. I highly recommend taking this course to get an easy upper division done.,1
"Valuable course. Imparts much knowledge and wisdom about linux system administration. You would not come close to replicating the value of this course through online tutorials, so it's well worth tuition. Every class is a follow-along lecture; there is no structure to homework other than working on your own to make sure you understand things.",1
"She tries and fails to relate to students. She lectures about the exact same topic day after day, ad nauseam. She is probably one of the most boring lecturers Ive ever had to sit through.",0
"Instructor was inaccessible all semester, checked in once a week in a 6 week course, which led to a lot of assignments with no submit links, or being posted the day before they were due. Assignments are convoluted busy work, that she grades harshly for something she isn't available for questions about. Students had to answer each others ? instead.",0
"His lectures are hard to comprehend. You must be willing to read the book and watch videos to understand the concepts. His HW are unnecessary, just copy them, but understand a few. His exams are doable, study the past and know the concepts. Easy Subject in General Communication. I think Electronics & Signal Processing are tough. Keep Studying!",0
Mr. Hays was by far the best teacher I have ever had! Love him!,1
Learned a lot about China and transition to capitalism.Good course.,1
he's a good professor. the class is discussion based but as long as you participate a couple of times your grade will be fine. the readings aren't bad and the oral final was easier than i thought it would be,1
"He is a very difficult professor, He makes you do quizzes Every 2 chapters. Import lane mid term and the final combine. Where you have to re learn the information you learned in the beginning to even passes class. My recommendation is to not take him. He does not give you enough time to study. He gives you the study guide day before the final.",0
"She cares about your improvement but she certainly makes everything way too difficult for the first ENG class you take in college. I thought I was a decent writer until this class. I definitely learned, but at the cost of enthusiasm and good moods. She's not very encouraging. Wouldn't take again.",0
Dee is a great teacher but has a smart mouth and is extremely rude towards some students... She makes a huge difference in students and has her picks. Her rude CAN BE VERY OFFENDING!!!,0
"Nic is a funny man who teaches his lectures with on pictures. You are supposed to take notes on what he says with a picture in the background. The exams were fairly easy if you take good notes. However, each exam was made based on what was said in class, so they may fluctuate from year to year. Overall an interesting class in my opinion.",1
"This man goes on random tangents all the time, most of the time not even relevant to the class. I've never gotten a bad grade in English but this time I'm riding on a C. He has you write essays about who you thought was the better writer and says there is no wrong answer, but beware: if you don't choose the writer he likes, you pay for it.",0
"He's such a nice guy. He will give extensions if you are sincere. He cares about your time and will give you good feedback on papers. If you follow his rubrics and advice, your grades will reflect it.",1
"She's not a bad teacher exactly, but she isn't clear on what she wants. She does cancel class sometimes and isn't specific about what answers she wants on exams. I think I'm doing well in the class, but she's very hot and cold depending on the day. There are only a few writing assignments, but the exams are difficult. Participate and it's fine!",0
Very intimidating. Best to not take.,0
"Terry means well, but sometimes you can tell that he doesn't have an education degree. Though he's an excellent player and guy, he sometimes lacks the skills needed to show how a student becomes a player like himself. Don't get me wrong, I love him to death as a person, but as a teacher he's not as talented.",0
Took chem 101 and physics 104 lab with her. TOUGH PROFESSOR!! Either way I earned an A in both classes,1
Fantastic class!  Instructor loves teaching and sharing stories about his experiences around the world.  GO TO CLASS!!!,1
"Dr. Amundson was a great professor! She gives good lectures that keep you interested. You have to do a fair amount of papers, but none are too demanding. Two books are assigned, wrote a 200 word paper on a chapter or two due every Friday, and a discussion on those chapters every Friday. A book report on each. Tests were not challenging.",1
"He is the worst professor I've had in my whole college experience. He expects you to go out of your way to see art pieces, know the proper way to critique it, and makes you write so many papers that are pointless and a waste of time. His grading is so hard, it's almost impossible to get an A anything. If you get him as a professor, GOOD LUCK!",0
DR. A ROCKS,1
Extremely difficult  tests were over vast quantities of information and the 30 questions on the test were usually not emphasized. To be fair she did email prior to indicate this course was very tough,0
"Hated this class first half we did scripts and I couldn't ever get them to work so confused. Last half of semester was installing VMs of Linux. Ultimately I passed and glad I took it with Wade otherwise I really don't think I'd had passed. Quizzes weekly, labs weekly, very helpful will show up to school 2 hours before labs just to get more lab time",1
Inconsiderate and  i wish Could give him a 0 out 5. Really tough grader.,0
"Honestly, I am fairly confident that she wrote all of the positive reviews herself. I am an 'A' student, but I don't know anyone who would speak well of her. She is unclear in her expectations, terrible to communicate with, and doesn't understand student questions at all. I got a decent grade in the class, but I would seriously NEVER take it again.",0
"She is really nice but attendance is mandatory for a 50 minute class. She spends 20 minutes talking about nonsense (bamboo toothbrushes, etc.) She will record the lectures but will only make it accessible to those that have an excused absence. I taught myself and it felt like a waste of time to be in the lecture.",1
"Anyone who gave her bad reviews don't put effort. More hands on projects than HW. HW is watching YouTube videos. It's true that she doesn't teach, but who likes learning? She's less about teaching and more about students learning new things. Take lots of notes because you can use a notebook during quizzes and tests. Bad grade? That's your fault.",1
He has a very strong accent and talks very fast. This makes it very difficult to figure out what he is saying. His hand writing is terribly sloppy too. He does not even try to write neatly. He also often uses dried out white board markers and is rude if you ask him to switch markers. In general he can be quite rude and insensitive. No feedback too.,0
"Amazing professor. Everyday she brought food for the class. But besides this, she took the time to read my essay and fix them. She offered to come to school on a non class day just to sit with anyone who wanted help with their final essays. This is a professor that will help you succeed if you want to succeed.",1
"Interesting class, not flexible in any capacity Too much busy work but I did learn a lot.",1
"It was an okay class, but he gives work every single day and you have to attend two events for two different papers.",0
"Her class is easy but you really have to hit the book and study if you want to pass. She does not help you, give extra credit assignments, or make up tests, no review.dont expect her to teach, you have to read on your own. if you do no undertand she will not help you.",0
"He is not fair. I was expecting an A and I received a B. I never felt so treated unfairly like he did to me. He does not help, does not listen. I truly hated his class. It was his fault that my GPA went down.",0
This course is a tough one. Sister Derby takes a very long time to grade the projects which makes it difficult to improve the next project. She's not very helpful until after the projects are turned in. Again this is frustrating when you are not aware of the many resources available to research until after the project is turned in.,1
He is funny and the best professor ever.,1
"Professor Wu is not boring, rather very interesting and easy to listen to. He knows how to keep your attention and I liked his style of teaching. Every point counts in this class, so make sure to do well on the online quizzes just in case you need those points to boost your grade. Oh & try ur best to attend all classes. I would def. recommend him.",1
Your whole grade in the class is based on tests and quizzes and there are no study guides. She does offer office hours if you dont understand but she is kinda standoffish. Hard class dont take,0
She managed to take an interesting subject area and make it very boring and dry. She is not the best presenter yet she marked our online zoom presentations quite harshly for things like enthusiasm and eye contact ( with a webcam...). She does often end class pretty early which is nice. If you are really interested in the subject try and avoid her.,0
"She is amazing...She can teach, she has lots of experience to share, and she likes to help the students.",1
 he didn't clarify much and he's a very hard grader I wouldn't take him ever again,0
Show up to class and email her with any concerns you have. Make sure you read the stuff she gives you.,1
"I took this as an online summer course so it was 6 weeks long. This instructor does not give feedback throughout the online course.   There's a discussion board every unit, but the professor does not respond to them ever. I had no idea of my shanding in class until the day grades were finalized. Would not recommend",0
Hes alright but his quizzes and projects do little to no boost to your grade and small assignments affect most of the whole grade. The dates for assignments are confusing. Expects you to know when things are due when there was little to no mention to them in class.,0
LOVE PROF and would definitely take him again. Text book and attendance is required. Hes so witty and funny and I wish I had class with him in person. A lot of quick writes so if you cant write an essay in about an hour or if you dont like writing dont take this class. A lot of groups projects and all the questions in quizzes are from the class,1
lots of class participation at 8 AM,1
"He mumbles too fast to understand anything, it always feels scattered! I have needed to read the textbook to understand a concept he tried to teach a few times in class. Quizzes/tests are inconsistent in difficulty. If you are thinking of taking astronomy, take it with the other prof. She's much better. I'll get a good grade but its so frustrating!",0
He is a nice guy but should not be a professor. He does not teach anything and expects people to know the material before we even mention it in class. His idea of teaching is going over problems that we have not learned yet. Avoid him if you can. The only saving grace to taking him is the curves you will get since the tests are so hard.,0
"I really enjoyed the class discussions and it it seemed that as long as you show up, participate, and do the work you will probably get an A.  There was a substantial amount of reading, which can be a bit much if you have other classes with heavy reading.  Overall she is lovely, knows her field, and makes class fun.",1
"Not a very helpful professor. Doesn't care about his students. If the choice is between him and Falzone, go Falzone, or go home.",0
"she is really nice and because she is young I guess she understands, her class is not boring and she wants 3 books and u do read them so read her midterm is easy if you read and pay attention during presentations i recommend her the research paper its a bit confusing in the process of doing it",1
"Do you enjoy being belittled, laughed at or talked to like you are 5? Then Professor Randle is the gal for you! Please, take anyone else. Even if it delays your gradation.",0
"All of these good reviews below are fake/made by him or his favorite students. Ahmad is the worst professor you could have for orgo. The man cant even speak English properly and his hand writing is terrible. He does not care about his students. If u want to help or protect your GPA dont take him. He ruined my 4.0 GPA with a 3.0, but i deserved 3.7.",0
"Sam is amazing. If you are a music major, you will see him plenty as the Double Bass Professor. Every Wayland resident loves him. He is kind of awkward, but it's really okay, he is so passionate, caring, and very funny when you get him to open up. Make sure you appreciate this man to infinity. (I have never taken his class, I just know him personal",1
"Trina is a very upbeat, friendly person and is a great chemistry teacher. Her chem 130 class is absolutely loaded with assignments. We usually turn in a minimum of 2 things per class period. This isn't a terrible thing because it allows you to boost your grade if you do poorly on exams, but she nitpicks everything she grades. Material is easy tho",1
"Ferguson is an amazing lecturer. You have to attend class in order to complete daily in-class short answer assignments that count for attendance. Take good notes in class. Study a decent amount and make A's on exams, study the night before/day of and make B's.",1
makes class fun.,1
Useless teacher - I had her class and wouldn't take it again!!!,0
"Talbert is a great lecturer. He takes a lot of Roman history and makes it very manageable for a semester. 6 short papers, 2 quizzes, 2 tests. Seems like a lot of work, but not if you keep up with names, map, progression of events as the class progresses. Grading is done mostly by TAs. Very detail -oriented tests and quizzes though. lecture heavy",1
"Worst class I ever took in college. PLEASE FIND SOMEONE ELSE TO TAKE. This class is a waste of time and money. She has no reviews, the practice quizzes have nothing to do with the real quizzes, and she deducts points off your labs for no reason.",0
"Awesome professor and warm individual inside and outside of class.  If you make the effort to get to know him it will mean wonders to your outlook as a developing scientist.  DO come to class, DO ask questions, and DO attend the student lead study sessions.  They help a mil for exams.",1
"Had her for New Venture Lab, really horrible class. The whole class is your group project where you're forced to come up with a new product (something that takes people their whole lives) and make it ready to market in time and accordance with syllabus dates... Unrealistic. Professors seems unorganized as well. Regret taking this class.",0
"Lectures are long, does not explain material well. Does not give clear expectations. Answers emails fast. Book is useless, he provides a free pdf version.",0
Amazing professor. She really wants everyone to feel comfortable with the class. She gives alot of different ways for you to make sure you are understanding the techniques and material being taught.,1
He refuses to use Canvas or email so contacting him outside of class is a hassle. He rarely takes time to explain the lessons so he almost expects you to know what he's doing. It's honestly easier to learn from the textbook than from his lectures. His tests seem simple but his grading makes it difficult. Just horrible and difficult.,0
"Didn't post the syllabus until a month into class, sent an email taking us all by surprise saying our reading load had doubled for the night, expects you to get make-up notes before class when you don't have people's numbers/emails and cannot get them until class. He's very unclear. AVOID. This /WAS/ going to be my research area. Ruined it for me.",0
Would not recommend at ALL! HE DOES NOT DO POWERPOINTS HARD TO TAKE NOTES HOMEWORKS ARE VERY HARD AND HE  MAKES YOU WORK FOR EXTRA CREDIT AN WILL NOT  GIVE YOU LOTS OF POINTS!  I ALSO STUDIED  VERY HARD AND ENDED UP  FAILING CLASS,0
She start confusing me after a few classes.,0
"doesn't answer emails and her rubrics are very vague, pointless, and don't make sense",0
"Lois is a great teacher, I wish I could have her again for a political science class. The class was easy to understand, I would say the only hard thing were the essays for the midterm and final. If you go to class, cite your work and try to have an open mind you'll pass.",1
"Professor Donato is the worst professor I've ever had at Bentley or elsewhere. Most lectures in class end up not being related properly to assignments and exams. take home exams can take 6+ hours to complete, prompts for assignments are crazy vague, and he will give mediocre grades for exemplary work. Bad professor makes a good course bad DONT TAKE",0
"To put it simply, get ready to teach yourself Orgo Chem I and pray that the massive curve at the end of the course will save you. Only 4% of people in my 200+ section made A's.",0
"I found this class to be very easy, but had a problem with ONE ASSIGNMENT and my A went to a B.  Had he answered my questions that I emailed, I definitely would have gotten and A, but due to deadline ended up with a B.  You pretty much teach yourself everything.  no help from professor at all.  Book is stupid and hard to follow.  ",0
"Awful prof, he doesnt teach, he only goes over whats in the book once and expects you to know it fluently. Expects you to be fluent in the oral exam(its a requirement to get 100%), give hours worth of homework a week. Exams all open ended, will give a zero On a problem for missing a letter in a word,no word Bank. Class runs over almost everyday.",0
As long as you follow the grading rubrics when completing the weekly assignments youll do well. Laura posts all the modules for the semester at the beginning of the semester so you can work ahead. She gives good feedback when grading assignments and is easy to reach if you need clarification. Be prepared to read if you want to do well on quizzes.,1
"Where to begin *sigh*. I'm a solid student, I make A's. She makes it IMPOSSIBLE to make an A in this course. She does not hold lectures, only Zoom/Webex meetings once a week-which are impossible to get into if you have a life outside of school. She is snarky, she's very picky with how she grades, and you basically teach yourself everything.",0
"When Dr. Anderson taught this course, it was Harry Potter and Homer. Easily one of the best classes I've taken and he is prob my favorite professor. He will challenge you to think outside your comfort zone and look at literature in a new way. He might have ruined Harry Potter for me but I'd take his class again in a heartbeat.",1
Super helpful and understand. He tries his best to make the class comfortable and to ease speaking anxiety.,1
Willing to assist and meet you online if you needed help .Wonderful teacher,1
Took him online in the summer. One Discussion Board and one quiz. TAKES FOREVER TO GRADE THE DISCUSSION BOARDS!!!!!!!! Doesn't reply to emails. He would tell us a grade would be up the next day and its never there,1
"He would not answer any questions I had on any papers that I wrote. He talked to everyone in the class like we were babies, which is super unprofessional. He does have interesting topics though.",0
He helped more more than any of my math teachers before.,1
"Ryan is incredibly unorganized during lectures and his quizzes/exams do not reflect his teachings or readings in class. Many mundane examples are used in class that blurs together; furthermore, he fails to identify and properly explain core class concepts. I highly recommend dropping any class with this man as the professor.",0
"I loved this class! I learned alot about the real world and the law. What he says is true, its experience talking. I'll tell you a secret. Mention food in class and he may proably dismiss early (depends if hes hungry enough).",1
Doesn't follow the syllabus. And depends on high stake Testing.I personally do not  recommended his class.  ,0
"She is all over the place, she tries to assign us homework that we've already done. I don't blame her though, all the busy work she gives us is the same. She gave me a 0 on accident and I asked her every class period for two weeks to change the grade on moodle and she still hasn't. Get it together girl.",0
"Patty definitely does love the subject she teaches, and is a very nice person.  However, her classes are very dull and boring, and usually cover material that never appears on tests.  Her marking is also really hard! I would avoid taking a class with her at all costs!",0
"Don't take unless you want to learn from the book and YouTube. Lectures are barely helpful, overcomplicates the simple things and rushes through the hard parts.",0
"Dr. Kopacz talks to all of their students like we were in elementary school. She once spent a whole lecture explaining why we have seasons based on the tilt of the earth. Another time we spent a whole week learning how if you add energy to an ice cube, it will turn into water. Her class is boring as hell but attendance is 20% of the grade.",0
He says it like it is. He provides interesting lectures. All you have to do is raise your hand at least once a class and you will get an A.,1
"Very unclear in lectures, but explains well one on one. Don't miss a day or you'll be very behind. Exams often do not reflect the study guide. Typically, 20 page multiple choice homework due every week, test every couple weeks covering multiple units. Tagged him under ""get ready to read"", bc I found myself teaching a lot of the subject to myself.",0
The hardest class I took in my 4 years. The exams were near impossible and the discussions were graded tough. This class was a mistake and if you need to take a class for a natural science credit this is not your class.,0
She was very friendly to me and always willing to help me even when i made stupid mistakes. Great teacher and always got her point across.,1
I personally liked this class. She always introduced new material which kept the class interesting. Lots of assignments but not hard. Is very strict on attendance.,1
"wow, who would've thought a class called Intro to theatre would require you to experience...*gasp!* THEATRE! how shocking! She's a great woman to work with and a good teacher who KNOWS costumes and you'll learn a lot.",1
"Professor Zabowski is amazing. She's interactive and very caring. Unfortunately, it was online so we didn't get to eat goodies, but I had the best time in her class. She really does a great job of making everyone feel included. No textbook required would definitely take again!!",1
Very nice prof but shouldn't be teaching anymore. You think you understand but during the exam it feels like you don't know anything. Would recommend taking another prof for ECON 227 since it's mandatory for Econ majors. Go to his office hours and work A LOT on your own if you want a good grade.,0
Dr. G is one of the few professors that I can say made a profound impact on my life. I am so proud to be one of his students. In June 2013 I will graduate with my PhD and he was one of my inspirations. The Env. Studies degree was one of the best decisions I ever made. It allowed me to have a minor in computer science which complemented my Env Ed.,1
Hard to understand at times. BUT he is very funny and very nice. Always has a smile. Doesn't give out as much homework as other teachers. He is very helpful. He Knows he has a weird accent and doesn't mind repeating himself to help students out.,1
Mr. Emshwiller is a caring and respected vocal instructor.  I will continue to take lessons with him.,1
"Professor Linda, is such a great professor. I really enjoy having her class. If you do not understand something, she will definitely take the time out to help you, and she is very understanding. I just love her, the best prfessor at Community College of Philadelphia.",1
"Jason is so nice as a person and respects you as a student. As a class, it is pretty straightforward - go to class and study the PowerPoints and homework - you can score high. The labs tripped up my grade the most because the TAs are harsh graders, so just beware.",1
"Dr. Amid is really good at teaching difficult concepts and keeps class fun/engaged. I actually felt sad when his classes for week were done. You look forward to his class. Helps struggling students, shows respect, keeps explaining if he has to. Best! of all, his humility/friendliness towards students makes him an amazing and respected prof.",1
hes really nice and funny,1
"She is brand new but she is pretty great.  Professor Peters is honest and tells it like it is, and she also makes you completely aware of what she wants on assignments.  She is horrible at power points but makes class fun with her great sense of humor.  She is a fairy easy grader but a stickler for APA. She can spot 1.5 inch margins a mile away!",1
Best teacher I've had so far. He makes everything easier to understand. Definitely recommend.,1
"This was a well organized online class, and I learned a lot. My main issue was that I could not reach him by email or blackboard. He rarely responded to messages. Nevertheless, if you follow the homeowner, the quizzes are easy. I did not use any of his lessons during the course so I don't have a comment on that.",0
Dr. Finelli let his class do his work for him. I was most frustrated at the peer reviewed assignments that determined my grade. It seemed as though my randomly assigned peers would sometimes not even read my essays and arbitrarily give a mediocre grade. Many noted a lack of detail about certain things that were actually clearly shown in my work.,0
"So I liked the course content even though there'too much reading. Good news! Pop quizzes aren't hard at all. Professor A looked unapproachable and she was sometimes harsh with students. I don't recommend this class, the content was great! but the vibe was just not right.",0
Coolest professor of my semester.,1
"She literally gives you ""short answer assignments"" but in reality its 2-3 paragraphs per question and there is 5 questions. Its just so dumb of a professor to do that. And during a pandemic. No sympathy. Avoid taking her",0
"sometimes too impulsive, expects student have a great interest in just his specialization of electrical. doesn't care much if you fail or pass; popular with his see you next year line. heavy on homework. Past questions will save your life, but try to know your stuff",0
"Does not even deserve the 1 star rating. Really bad professor, no enthusiasm during lectures, really heavy on readings (20+ pages every class), and sometimes she gives pop quizzes on the readings. It was a really annoying experience to deal with her in general.",0
"She tries to be helpful, but sometimes fails. It's pretty easy, but don't skip because it does count against you. You do have a textbook which is either online or if i remember a hard copy as well. You have much reading to do to complete the assignments. Her tests are very short in time so i recommend studying and knowing info before you start.",0
"rien appris dans ce cours, trop de travaux en équipe, jai trouvé Decoste pas pire comme prof...",1
DO NOT TAKE HIM FOR BIODIVERSITY. I had him for bio 2 and he was fair so I thought this class would be a good one to get my ecology credit. NOPE biggest regret. He tries to teach us everything he knows which is very overwhelming and we end up not learning anything. About to graduate as a bio major and this is the hardest class Ive taken.,0
"Based on the emails and Blackboard posts, he struck me as one of those professors who took pride in failing students. The exams are nothing like the homework and review sheets; the prerecorded lectures don't prepare you for either exam or assignment. It felt effortless on his part and based on most reviews here, this has been a pattern for a while.",0
"Is obsessed with the ""chi square"".  It is funny when she gets upset for no reason.  A strange woman.  Yelling ""MRS. WILSON"" for a lab exam to begin was like begging for candy.  Interesting person.....",0
"She is one of the smartest professors I've had at OSU. She is great to learn from.  Her lectures can feel long at times, but the material covered  in lectures are imperative for her tests. In my experience, she is a fair grader as long as you follow her expectations and rubrics. I would highly recommend taking her for WIC course requirement.",1
"I took this class online and we would have a media reflection and discussion board to complete each week! Personally, the book was a blessing to have and I'm not sure how some people took the class without it. It helped that she prepared a study guide for each exam, but make sure you study because the exams are a little hard if you don't read!",1
"Save yourself and DO NOT take Bio 211 with him. His 2 assigned papers are all single-spaced, up to 4 pages long and one of them being a partner essay. Exams are difficult and too in depth to where his lecture material sometimes doesn't match what's on the exam. Either take Bio 211 at a cc or with a different professor at CSUSM.",0
"This was the most disorganized course I have taken. Prof Lai did not teach the material well. He often talked about topics but did not explain the theory or solve any problems. The textbook chosen was also terrible, and did a poor job of explaining topics. He tries to make the course easy by giving lots of hints, but you end learning nothing.",0
"She is very knowledgeable, experienced, well read qmd caring. I was very impressed with how prepared she was. She was kinda funny.",1
He talks too much about unnecessary stuff for Eng 101. he should focus more on explaining things that are really important for class.,0
"He purposely leaves out content in the slides so that you have to go to class. No participation grades. Interesting subject, uninteresting professor.",0
"Shira is one of the most interesting people Ive ever met. He told us so many griping stories about his life that related to the topic of the material we were studying. He is extremely supportive and caring, and really takes time to listen to his students. This class is very easily passed as long as you do what is assigned.",1
"Really knowledgeable in his field, caring professor. Easy, and not much work to do, only 1 case study, 2 papers and the exams. The case study is done in a group. I got a 90 in his class. Extremely easy grader on the 2 papers that are take home finals. Do not listen to the bad comments, take him if you want a good grade. Easy to get extra credit",1
"One popquiz the whole semester. Tests were pretty easy in my opinion, just study from the sheet he gives you. DO THE HOMEWORK at the back of the chapter as he spontaneously checks them. Overall, he's offensive. he says inappropriate things in class, but I managed an A without trying too hard.",0
I DO NOT recommend this professor.,0
He lectures the entire class period and is very boring! He is very scatter-brained and goes off on random stories about his life. His tests are very hard!! and there is a lot of memorization and reading involved! but he did give you study guides for the tests.. that were 30-40 pages long! definitely dont recomend!!,0
"She might have been having an off semester, but could have given some more feedback. Feedback was pretty sporadic. Assignment due dates were mostly unclear or changed at the last minute. Useless syllabus. Project instructions were vague, which may have encouraged creativity, but definitely inspired frustration. Probably needs to improve rapport.",0
"Dr. Nevil is a great teacher!! She is so entertaining in class and makes class fun!! Just do all the journals and assignments she gives you, she's really strict on the deadlines but as long as you do them, you will do well in her class!! Very easy class!! I got an A!!",1
Professor Huerta was super kind and caring and I loved her. Her class does require a lot of time and effort because of the labs and module projects but they are not too difficult. There are a lot of readings but show up to class and they are all discussed. Would def take her again she gives many extra credit opportunities and wants you to pass.,1
very easy teacher. just show up to class and pay attention. she takes off a lot of points for not attending which will affect your grade. book is useless. you probably do a couple of assignments from it but that's all. not worth the amount i paid for it in the bookstore. it doesn't even have to be the csun edition. there are no tests taken.,1
"Great physics teacher! Has accent, but you'll get used to it quickly! The way he teaches lets you to truly understand the material. He does practice problems in class and assigns hw and make sure you pay attention because the bulk of his test come from these places. He is really helpful and wants you to do your best! Get on his side and he can help",1
"His grading is terrible, most of the people in my class are complaining already. Honestly feels like he lacks the compassion because he marks everything off even if your answers are right. I wouldn't recommend taking him.",0
"Some people don't mind Dubovskiy's teaching style, but I wasn't a fan of it. He came to almost every lecture unprepared and when he taught, he improvised and flew by the seat of his pants. Although he's helpful when you ask questions, he was rarely in his office, didn't respond to any emails, and was all around, a very irresponsible professor. ",0
Extremely SCATTERBRAINED! Lets you use cheat sheets during tests but not the final! Tells more stories about her family and illnesses than the actual info you need to know. Group work with a different group every time! Always changes due dates and be ready to have multiple mistakes made when grading your tests! So hard to follow! Steer Clear!!!,0
"Took LFS250 with him, and thought that was the worst he could do. Prepare for LFS350, cuz he would give you even more unorganized course websites, even more confusing wordings in online quizzes, and assignments that are totally waste of your time.",0
I agree w/ the last person. She’s a nice lady & very understanding but she makes Spanish harder than it should be. She has made her students feel stupid and that bad when you are learning a new language and the teacher makes you feel stupid if you don't get it the first time. She’s a great person just not that good of a teacher.  :  (,1
"Read word-for-word from Powerpoint so didn't really teach the material. Tests were extremely difficult in comparison to her level of teaching and included trickily worded questions. Was very vague when it came to project instructions and would then grade very strictly, claiming aspects where missing that she didn't ask for.",0
"She is extremely picky about grammar. I do put a Lot effort and end up with A-. It is really unacceptable. Her classes are long and boring. Choose another professor, if you can.",0
My first class with Dr. Major and he has been excellent.  Enthusiastic and excited to teach.  Hard grader but loves discussing the material he assigns.  Definitely worth taking a class of his.,1
"I took this class online. Each week there was a reflection paper, a short reflection about an article found online that related to that textbook chapter, and a 12-25 multiple choice question sheet due. I was able to work ahead. Just be ready to read and type up many papers!",1
"Harry seemed like a very sad, old man.  :(   His depressed nature took all the life out of me and made me feel like skipping his class every week.  But, I went and instead found myself coaxed to sleep by his grandfatherish tone.  DO NOT take this class with him!  The subject is easy, but he makes it very difficult.  Your GPA may not survive Harry.",0
"He really cares about student success and was very accommodating. He took the time to explain concepts to me whenever I had questions, and this class has been very pleasant. Definitely an amazing professor!",1
"difficult to understand, unclear instructions, never graded projects through out the semester, so had no idea what final grade would be.  Spent too much time doing attendance each week. lectures too long and not enough work time during the class. Jokes were not funny",0
"new to teaching and it ,changes his mind on what needs to be done in assignment hard to know what he wants",0
"Not a professor i would want to take for Math 201. Very out of it and always did things that wouldn't help someone out as a teacher. She made a lot of problems harder then what they were. She would teach you different ways and you had to use those ways! Study Study Study if you haver her, tests are killer!",0
"Great professor so far. She has a very laid-back, easy teaching method, and it works. She knows her stuff very well, and is very willing to help you figure something out, without giving you the answer straight out. She often looks over homework and quizzes when turned in and points out mistakes, giving you a chance to correct before it's graded.",1
"Take lots of notes and pay attention in class! This class was hard for me. Grades are based only on Exams. If you do well on the 4 exams, then the final is optional. He posts lecture notes but will take out the photos. Some of the photos will be on the exam so take good notes. He is very nice and funny. I enjoyed his class! Do not skip class!!",1
"She is so bad. Doesn't teach you anything, if you don't know how to do makeup or sew youre on your own. You learn mostly through videos that are 15 + years old, and if you do something wrong its always your fault because you didn't pay attention. She treats her students like crap. If she continues to work here, the students will suffer even more.",0
One of the best professors at Keene State that I have had all 4 years of being here.  Makes a subject matter that would normally be boring very interesting with group work and interactive learning.  I highly recommend taking this class not only if you need it for your major but as an elective as well!,1
"He is old school. He is very personable, but not the best instructor. His test are ridiculously hard, but he grades on such a steep curve that I received a 100% on a test that I missed over 25 questions. I learned enough about the economy to say it wasn't a waste to attend his classes. I would recommend him.",0
"Makes philosophy as interesting as it can be, and is helpful in all aspects.  Interesting class.",1
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! Tests us on chap. not even gone over in class. 30pgs a chap. 6 chap. a test. Long and boring. No homework except for reading. I was excited before taking this class but not now. Please dont take it.,0
"Her class is project heavy so be prepared to put in a lot of hours. Her quizzes are what makes her class little challenging but she gives review slides for preparation after each lecture. Quizzes are short answers, not multiple choice. Memorize it. If you need an A, then you would have to work hard. Period. She is brilliant and knows her stuff.",1
Catherine is truly amazing! She picked some great texts (but be prepared for a decent amount of reading sometimes). Your grade is based on 3 papers and participation- it's a pretty easy gen-ed but there can be a lot to read occasionally. Her accent is a huge plus and she's super sweet and understanding! Take this class!,1
okay teacher.,1
Awful. Not recomended. Too much reading for 3cr class. Books expensive. Feedback either harsh or just not helpful. Getting an A but didn't learn anything. Isnt even teaching sociology. Teaching philosophy. Actually hurts my education since I now have to teach myself classic soc theory (which is what I paid for with this class).  Never taking again.,0
"Do yourself a favor and STEER CLEAR of this course/professor. She has terrible rapport with students. Unpredictable, unkind. And this coming from someone who did well in her class.",0
"Very good teacher, gives ALOT of work though. As long as you work and work hard you will be ok. Answers emails fast and is helpfull",1
I loved his teaching style. Managerial Accounting could be difficult subject (especially reading the book) but his lectures made it so much more easier to understand. He leads you through subject by emphasizing essential points of Cost Accounting. He also has a deep but energetic voice so no way you will fall asleep. Highly recommend.,1
This class is easy but is usually at 8 am which makes attendance low which he realizes so he does not take attendance. Going to class helps a lot and makes the tests easier.,1
I just finished Mr. Baker's American Government mini term. He is a fantastic instructor! Mr. Baker is clear about his assignments. We were allowed to use our textbook and notes for the quizzes. The largest part of your grade will be the discussion posts. He provides a study sheet for the final exam and will answer any questions you might have.,1
Jennifer is rude to her students for no apparent reason. It makes learning very difficult.,0
"She's very sweet and honestly, if you really care about your grade she will be there to assist you in any possible way. Definitely keep up with your notes and read the chapters so you won't fall behind. She's a good grader and provides a lot of extra credit.",1
"The whole class is based on religion. Class is pointless just study before the exams. You only have 3 and its just two or three short essays (paragraphs), graded by TAs.",0
I hope he teaches forever,1
Makes you do unnecessary work and is super extra. This class will make your life harder than it should be. Also dont bother asking for extra time because hell ask you for evidence on why you need it.,0
This instructor lack clarity in her instruction. The class was on-line and the instructor seemed more concerned with making things convenient for herself rather then student success. When I would ask for help or clarification she simply offered sarcasm as if she was bothered by the fact that she actually had to teach. What a waste of time!,0
"This professor is a very hard grader, points are taken off tests because of not writing parenthesis, or an equal sign. He is very disrespectful, the very first day of school he told us he was only trying to help and that we could look at him as our favorite grandpa, three weeks later he refused to answer questions. PLEASE DON'T TAKE HIM!!",0
"So Ibrahim is a great guy, but I will warn you of two things: First is there is a LOT of reading. If you're a history major, you are already used to this, if not, just be ready. Second, because the subjects are so passionate, sometimes students get into arguments and he just sits back and waits instead of managing the sides like he should.",1
Cynthia is a bubbly and interesting teacher. She really cares about student success. Kind of a lot of difficult reading (with homework attached) but it's always talked about the next day if you don't understand it. You get points for attendance. Really liked her class!,1
His tests are ridiculously hard relative to the rest of the class.  No homework except  3 group projects and 4 quizzes.  LOTS of memorization for the tests.  English is reallllly hard to understand.  He intentionally makes the project descriptions arbitrary and  confusing.,0
"Great guy, but makes the course very tough. Gives you weekly homework which is not bad, but then the exams do not contain anything from the homework, they are just from his really long lecture notes. Not the most interesting class.",1
Extremely helpful and caring. Loves his subject and it translates in his class. AWESOME!,1
"Professor Berkson is the best professor I have ever had. He is so knowledgable about whatever subject is being discussed in class and nurtures many student-led discussions. I never considered majoring in Religion, but after taking Berkson, I might switch my major!",1
"final exam was a joke. focused a lot of class time to things that weren't even on the exam. the group project was so time consuming. he is not a nice person, doesn't have time to help you, doesn't answer his emails for days. avoid taking any class with him.",0
"Has an accent, but while it is easy to discern what words are coming out of his mouth, it is impossible to understand what he is talking about. He spends every lecture covering the board in equations and theorems that will never be used on any problems and does not explain what they do. After the first test the class becomes impossible do not take.",0
"Loved Prof Fritsche. Very clear structure for the entire course. HW is from WileyPLUS and he gives you practice exams for each exam. Avg for exams are like 70%, but he makes it the material as clear and simple as possible. Not easy A, but you can definitely earn the A. I'm sure he's a nice guy, but doesn't relate much w students.",1
Very good prof overall. I found his notes quite clear and material easy to follow. Tests and exams can be hard but are fair.,1
"This professor is by far the worst human I have come across in my 19 years on this planet. She has no teaching ability and I am fairly certain I learn more in my sleep than I do in her lectures. She docks marks for memorizing the information because she wants you to ""think deeper."" Justifies giving marks like 5.332. Please UBC, find a new professor",0
"He has the ability to be the best professor, but his attitude towards students and his rudeness already makes some of the hardest classes, harder. He is nasty in how he responds, refuses to help, and treats you like a moron, yet you don't get any other options.",0
"I learned a lot about marginalized cultures and their values. The class open my mind to thinking as a global person and not myopically American. The professor, Dr. Olufemi, was very emphatic about student use of critical and creative thinking and less of rote learning. The topics entail videos, discussions, online activities, projects, etc.",1
Very helpful and makes lecture extremely interesting.  Tough grader for the two paper but his class is definitely worth taking.,1
"Juan teaches a required 1st semester m-tech course. Be prepared for a professor who really doesn't give a heck about students, and gives confusing mixing advice and nonsensical tests. just keep your head down and you should pass fine. He won't take the time to remember your name.",0
"Lots of assigned reading (with notes), incredibly tough, her feed back is often delayed and gives no direction.",0
"Dull and unhelpful. Homework is assigned with little instruction. This class comes with little joy, and I enjoy English courses.",0
it was a good class really,1
I would avoid taking her class.,0
"Ms. Gordon will work with you and she explain the work.  IF you do not show up for class she will drop you,(makes room for the ones that want to learn). Very easy going and I have her for all my math.",1
"Dr. Nelson was an awesome teacher! I am a journalism major with no interest in science and I really enjoyed the class. Make the effort to get to know him and you will have a good time in this class. There is not an attendance requirement, the tests aren't awful, and the textbook is really not needed.",1
Awful teacher all around. Confusing lectures and very little enthusiasm.,0
Not a hard teacher. Her classes are not a big deal. Nice lady.,1
Love her. She's an amazing professor her class is easy and reviving an A is the easiest to get in her class. She is the best professor you'll ever meet and if English is your weakest subject she is one that won't make English a weak subject :),1
"Not an easy class regardless of who your professor is. You will have to spend hours studying on your own or you will not do well. Dr. Levitin is very smart, knows the material very well, and is willing to help you. He has a super dry sense of humor, but if you don't take his sarcasm too seriously you'll find him very funny. I highly recommend him!",1
"Heard many great things about this professor and was excited to take her, but the class is completely different online than it was in person. She made the tests harder and gave us old practice tests to study off but was not helpful. I understood the material from her teaching but if you do bad on the exams you will not pass the class.",0
"Fischer, while passionate about philosophy, rambles. However, if you go to discussion and actually read the assignments, you really don't even have to listen to him.",1
"It is impossible to understand her, and her spelling is horrible. She often has to ask the class what a word is and how to spell it. She never stops talking, talks over her students, and always goes off on random tangents. She is a very easy grader, however it is not worth taking one of her classes again because it is impossible to learn anything.",0
"Never take this professor. He lets you have a page for exams to write down anything you want, but it doesnt help because tests are designed to confuse you, my class avg for the 1st test was a 28% and the extra credit offered due to this was hrs worth of hw for a max of 2%. No point going to class because you usually will spend the time watching TV.",0
"McGee is a great instructor! Quizzes once a week over lecture notes, easy as long as you study some.  A total of 4 tests and then the final.  She is keeps you entertained during her lectures so you aren't falling asleep! Just study and pay attention, you'll be golden.  One of the best instructors by far.  Take her!",1
Theres daily readings for about 1/4 of the given book. Lectures were given by student instead of her. You may even be able to plagiarize as she lets it slide. Nothing is posted online so dont expect to keep track of it. Never went off the syllabus.,0
Dr Harland was an amazing prof. Math is not my strong suit but Dr Harland made this course a lot easier than it could have been. His videos explaining the topics were very thorough along with the examples done in class. He made sure to answer any questions anybody had and was overall a course I enjoyed attending.,1
"An excellent teacher! He explains concepts very well verbally and also draws/uses visuals that I thought really help information sink in. The study guide questions reflect what needs to be known for the exam--thoroughly answer all in prep for the tests. His lectures were very interesting and engaging. Honestly, the best professor I ever had.",1
"While he wasn't a bad teacher by any means, I just felt that he was really bored with the class this semester. I don't blame him, as most of the assigned material was not interesting (and I love literature!) and there was very little meaningful class discussion. Quizzes you every class, so don't miss. Do the work and you're going to pass.",1
"He is hard to understand and gives difficult multiple choice/open ended exams that most people get 50s on. He also fell behind on material. However, all the talk about his curve is true and will raise your grade by like 20%. Do better than the average and you will pass comfortably but it's still orgo, so it definitely isn't a cakewalk.",0
Boring class.,0
"Is unfriendly and condescending based on mood, quizzes are memorization which dont help with writing or speaking the language. Midterms and finals are from worksheets but even after studying everything he manages to twist the exams so that everything the students studied for werent actually on the exam or were replaced with something else.",0
"Super nice teacher. Information was very interesting. No text book, just read case studies, discuss, and write papers. Would recommend this teacher to anyone.",1
Terrible subjective grading and do not try and bother trying to follow his feedback. He changes what he wants every week and nothing is good enough.,0
"His accent is hard to understand but besides that he's a great and funny teacher. The lectures move very fast but only because he has so little time to teach all the material. When given a chance to take it slow, he's great at explaining. Homeworks are difficult and you will need to spend time studying before/after class, but it's well worth it.",1
Great Professor. Wants students to learn and does not care too much about grades. Very interesting and Practical way of teaching. Open book exam. Fair grader. ,1
Do not take a class with this professor!!!!! She is unorganized and unfair. Her tests are mostly written answer and what you put down is sure to be wrong. If you ask a question or see her after class she will talk in circles never giving you any clarity. Avoid this women you will struggle!!!!,0
Well so far the notes don't really match up with the test. Its as if he wants you to master all the info for every test. The book does not seem to help. The average for exam 1 was just above 70...most ppl I talked to made in the 50's... vary hard class lets hope it ends well...only take if you really really need to.,0
"A funny, quirky guy. Only grades are tests and there were three this semester so make sure you do well on tests. Tests weren't proctored. Textbook isn't required but I recommend since he doesn't lecture out of the book but puts stuff from the book on his tests.",1
"Very rude,mean,disrespectful to student I don't know why he hasn't been reported to the art department !",0
Do not take this class if you aren't passionate about music. She is an inexperienced professor who does not structure the class well for those who aren't familiar with musical concepts. Discussions aren't helpful for the quizzes and she doesn't post lecture slides. A lot of the people in my class agreed this class is too difficult to be a GE class.,0
"Federal govt Pros: Free txbook, hw& exams (2attempts each) are easy, found on quizlet. Cons: Not enough time given on quizzes & exams even if u use quizlet, hw takes hours to complete. 4 writing assignments 500 word each, & graded harshly Going to class is pretty useless, login in daily. No extra cred or makeups. 3 pts from a B. Avoid her class.",0
"This has been without a doubt the worst fire tech class I have ever taken! It's an online class so we have a quiz every week after completing two discussion boards and reading the textbook. The PowerPoints with ""notes"" are useless since nothing in those notes have anything to do with the questions in the quizzes. Just take it with someone else.",0
"The best business teacher at MU. Incredible person, sincerely cares about you, where you came from and where you are going. His classes are generally fairly easy. All tests and quizzes are online. He lectures throughout the class but keeps them interesting. For any business class you should take regensburger if possible.",1
"Mr. Miller is an excellent teacher! The book is confusing at times, but his lectures helped me ALOT! He would use real world examples and make it easier for you to understand. Always there to help even after class hours while people were studying in the lab. Read the book, attend lecture, study, and ASK questions!",1
WORST TEACHER EVER! she took points off assignments because of stupid things like forgetting to put the feet sign. and not just one point when i did this but 3.,0
"He is simply one of the kindest people you will ever meet. He is so open about everything and really makes everyone in class feel comfortable about sharing personal experiences. He has a huge background of schooling and knowledge. He really knows a lot and teaches you in a fun, easy way.",1
"I don't think it matters how hard you study- in taking her tests I used information from her slides, the textbook, and information from other class textbooks and still received below a B on all exams. She doesn't tell you what you did wrong, just takes marks off. She can't use technology and trails off in the middle of her sentences.",0
"Very nice prof, enjoyed his class but very detail-oriented! Also theres a lot of uncertainty in this course with a 30% lab final and 40% lecture final both scheduled in the final period so basically 70% of your mark is decided in the end.. But I enjoyed it and learned some interesting stuff. Also, its important to go to class.",1
"First day of class then dropped out. Discussion heavy, heavy reading, expect to write  3-4 pages of reflection papers. BEWARE",0
"Dr Harvey truly is a master of chemistry. Her class will break you down because there is so much hw and the exams really are difficult, but I assure you, pay attention in EVERY lecture, do the assignments, give it your absolute best, and you will learn so much. My only qualm is that she can be a bit feisty if you ask too many questions",1
"Not accessible outside class (and class was ONLINE!) Brings in a salesperson into lecture just so he can sell us LSAT prep material. I literally PAID to listen to an hour-long ad. Is strict on deadlines, while she herself never follows them. She gave us feedback on our papers 24 hrs before the final was due! Avoid this course. A true WASTE of money",0
The written portion of the exams will be those random videos during the lecture so if you didn't remember it you probably won't get a good grade on that. The multiple choices are usually easy as long as you study. He made you buy Packback and MyEconlab which is also kind of expensive in total. But it's not hard to get an A if you study.,1
"Chester was one of the worst teachers I had this semester. He would drone on in lecture doing the same problems over and over, while making tons of mistakes that he wouldn't fix. If you haven't taken calc before don't take Chester you won't learn anything. If you have, you'll be fine but you'll be insanely annoyed.",0
"The Test are hard in the beginning but as you go along they'll become easier. In order to pass you will have to study, you will learn in his class. He has good lectures and he's caring. All around he's solid",1
Bad professor.,0
"One of the best teachers I have ever had. He is clear, fair and really loves teaching. He is easy going, makes you feel like you ask question and no one fails. Would love to take another class with him!!!",1
Mr. Humphrey is a really good instructor. I highly recommend taking this course. You will learn a lot from him.,1
"Okigbo is an awesome guy. Go to class and you will learn a lot, he knows what he is doing.",1
"Try to avoid him. The class is lecture heavy so if you skip you will be lost! He never tells you what is on the tests. In class you will learn mostly math, but the tests are all conceptual short answer. His tests are harshly graded because he is very picky about what he wants. Print the slides and write on them as the notes. Write down everything",0
"Chemistry is already a hard class itself, then you add a professor that is unclear with each content. It's hard to understand him, He's very smart, but his smartness does not translate to  a teacher than can make the students understand the content. Overall I was disappointed with the chemistry class, and I don't recommend him for a 209.",0
She is one of the best professors at PGCC. I feared i won't do well because i didn't like biology but she made it very easy for me. It felt so amazing to be in her class. Her lectures were detailed and her class was very easy to pass. She literarily tells you everything to study for on her quizzes and exams. I would take her again,1
"Dr. Schellhorn is a very nice woman and clearly knows what she is talking about, however she think everyone should just automatically getitand if you don't she essentially tells you that you shouldn't be in her class.  Also, grade depends on just 3 exams with unfair grading scale - if u get just 5 wrong youre already at a 60% and she does not curve",0
"lovely human being. wants nothing but everyone to do great. fantastic speaker and conveys what he needs to efficiently and does not waste your time. i really enjoy this professor, and i have taken all the classes that i was allowed to take- provided i was not a business major at all. great guy would rate 10/10.",1
Good class overall,1
"Teaches well and knows his stuff. Somewhat easy grader. However, at times he can be unapproachable and almost never returns email.  But he teaches you a lot. Take him!",1
"Celia is a no-nonsense prof and wont tolerate anyone who isnt committed to ASL. If you are fully invested in the language, she is an amazing prof who will help you improve and will help you in any way she can. Would recommend attending her office hours.",1
Good online class.  Professor was willing to work with you when problems came up.,1
This man is the worst person and the worst professor.,0
Keeps you motivated. Exams and class works are very reasonable. Very knowledgeable teacher! Fun classes!,1
Best professor!! Nothing bad to say about her,1
OMG why didnt i listen to those comments below. she is terrible. if you hate professors that try and trick you in exams and try and confuse you then you should take her.,0
"I love her. If you show up to class and learn you will have a great time. She is super sweet and cares about her students. In Bi 121 Lab she does grade on spelling, but that is a good thing. It makes you better.",1
"Out of all my classes I have taken overall, this has been the most disappointing. The overall course setup is very unclear and the lack of explanation on assignments leaves you guessing on what needs to be done. Every test period she was absent from, and the syllabus was changed 5 times and still the final two weeks of class were left ""TBD"".",0
Kind of boring. She's a nice lady but a BLAH teacher. Didn't really learn much when I took it.,0
"! He is very intelligent and knows all the material, issue is how he teaches. He will work out 3 problems from a section and move on. Then he will assign hw problems with numerous problems we never went over. HW will take you hours to complete. I asked to help many times and was told to read the book. Moves to quick and seems bothered my questions.",0
I took his course as an accelerated summer class and it was the biggest mistake ever. Seriously take these reviews into account because this guy is a terrible 'professor.' He gave us five exams with five essays due after each exam. So if you have a life that includes working or a jammed schedule avoid this guy at all cost.,0
"3 tests, 1 final, no homework. Have to teach yourself. He is convinced that every problem in the world is caused by Obama. I'm a republican, but the banter gets old.",0
She is very harsh and a tough grader. Don't be humiliated. She has a lot of expectations. Doesn't give proper instructions. Horrible professor.,0
"To be fair, Madame Petcoff was pulled in as a replacement for a prof who took ill. That said, she was extremely disorganized. She often promised to put notes on Moodle and only remembered once, wasn't available for office hours, didn't respond to emails, and changed the contents of exams the day of the exam or two days before. It was rough.",0
"He's not a difficult prof. but he sucks at teaching and likes to hear himself talk. He'll go off on tangents that have no real importance to the subjects and its unfortunate he's the only surveying lecture prof. I don't know what he's like in labs, but be prepared to deal with a lot of nonsense in his lectures",0
"Very hard,does not give no breaks do not take his class,he does not give feedback. You will fail his class!!",0
"Very hard to contact! Does not answer emails and is very unclear when he does! He makes it very difficult to succeed in his class, and he lets you know that as a student! We are beneath him as students! Stay clear! Avoid at all costs!",0
teacher is very laid back but helpful.,1
"This class is not bad at all. If you already have practice in health science or basic bio, a lot of it is just review until you get into the nervous tissue section, which was the only section I had stuff I've never seen before on it. Its 4 exams and a final, and everything on her exams is from her ppts so if you study em you'll pass. Ended w/ a 95",1
"Glenn cares about his students, cares about their grades, cares about the material he teaches, and cares about the class. The class size was roughly 16- interesting daily class discussions and debates and easy quizzes on the reading. Never homework besides reading. Being good at speaking is not necessary to do well Coolest professor I've ever had",1
Danish is tough but Paul is pretty bomb diggity awesome. He is there to help when you ask for it and is willing to meet with you outside of class. His assignments and exams are fair and he does his best to prepare you for the exams. Plus he is a native speaker so he understands the culture and the language. ,1
"Fun online lectures, flexible dates on the online class. Probably the best Professor I'll ever have!",1
"I took Calc 2 with him and really should have dropped his class. Not a bad guy but is a horrible teacher. Gave no curve, no extra credit, or even extra examples for practice. I worked hard in this class and still failed horribly.",0
Dr. Krell has been very helpful while writing my dissertation. He provides resources that is very helpful. Dr. Krell is an excellent professor,1
"It seemed like this was the first time she teached in a classroom, but obviously not, after reading everyone else's comments.  She was always at least 5-10 minutes late to class, unorganized, WAY too much work for an intro class, and she couldn't keep the non-interested students from bothering the ones that wanted to learn.",0
"Great class, Professor Neff really encourages everyones ideas and contributions and is a really fascinating guy himself",1
Unclear with expectations. Expect to teach yourself most of the subject matter if it's important to your education or career. Double check HIS work...,0
Dr. Buck really cares about his students and wants them to succeed. I highly recommend taking his class. He covers the material very clearly and is an overall excellent instructor.,1
"this guy is a freaking moron, and it is a shame that you must take classes with him...he doesn't teach **** and expects you to know everything..should be fired",0
"I never took chemistry when I was in high school, but I understood it just fine. If you attend the lectures and answer questions, he makes it pretty easy to understand. He provides a study guide for each test. The homework was on Sapling and that was usually all we had other than the occasional studying.",1
"This woman knows her stuff. She is a super tough grader, like an english teacher. Her online quizzes are easy. You HAVE TO SHOW UP. I skipped one time and my grade went down. Hardest teacher. Also, no phones in her classroom.",1
"Though hard to tell, this professor enjoys Physics, and will work with you. However, his grading criteria is very unclear and leaves you guessing often. He puts formulas on the board during tests but seldom do they help. Being in a lecture hall his mumbling does not make his lectures any easier to follow. Content on tests don't match lecture.",0
"Dont take if you care about your mental health and GPA. Run. I really dont know how people give him good ratings, they must only have time for his class. Worst professor ever, shouldnt teach GED classes.",0
"he rambles on and expects us to do lab assignments and homework AND turn something in at the lecture AND gives us WAY too much pointless homework. hes never at the labs, he has is TAs do it because he is way too lazy. he doesn't grade that hard, but he still doesnt know how to teach.  he expects us to know everything already.",0
Very boring class. The work you do in her class has nothing to do with computers. She gets mad when you try to ask her questions DO NOT TAKE HER.  She is the worst professor i have ever had in my college career!,0
"I've had this prof many times, and each time it just gets worse. It's impossible to get office hours. Don't even try to get feedback on a paper before you submit it. His handwriting is gibberish-so feedback on assignments  and his notes on the board are scribbles. The quarter also ended last week and he hasn't posted any grades yet. He is a mess.",0
"MATH122 is hard enough of a class as it is, especially to teach, but if Argerami is teaching it AVOID LIKE THE PLAUGE. The content of our class never lined up with SI, and Argerami was hard to understand with the way he went about doing his examples.",0
"She's a good teacher. However, sometimes she will tell you to change something on your paper and then take off points when grading because that part didn't fit. Also, not very clear grading criteria.",0
This guy is a total jerk....Really offensive and demeaning.,0
"His class is not that easy. Basically he doesn't teaches the course he just tells you go and read it if you don't understand then i will explain. All around the place goes from chapter 5 to chapter 2. Exams are T/F, multiple choices, and 3-4 problems to solve.",0
This class was fairly easy. The syllabus is your bible. Everything is basically set up for you to prosper. The professor does not allow himself to be first responder to emails but he has helpers that answer all your questions . The class was fairly large.,1
"Professor Fash is hands down one of the best professors at BU. Make sure you attend class because she goes over everything you need to know in detail. She really doesn't want you to fail, and can see that you are trying if you simply go up to her after class, before class, office hours, or even just participate in class. I would 100% recommend her!",1
She's a decent lecturer but moves fast so you gotta pay attention all the time because accounting really sucks if you don't. I underestimated it and got pummeled for a while. There are only 3 tests so if you're not careful you'll get destroyed. The homework is barely worth anything but you gotta do it in order to succeed.,1
"He's a really nice professor and he usually will give you the answer to the in-class iclicker questions. If you show up to class and do the work, you'll be fine. You do have to buy the connect online textbook which is kinda spendy.",1
I was so incredibly disappointed. I took her for online semester of psych 002 and she responded to the class maybe 3x. I had to call the psych dept. and even called and emailed the dean. She never clarified why she wasn't giving us lessons or exams or homework. Halfway we were given a new professor (Monica B Coto) and she's an angel.,0
Solid choice of a professor! throughout the summer course you have a 12-14 page paper as your only assignment other than the discussion boards. Quizzes and exams are simple as long as you study the online lectures/quizlet/textbook. Always responsive to communication and gives good feedback. Very easy summer course while also learning a lot.,1
Class discussions were good. Deadlines are not flexible unless you ask ahead.,1
He won't let you use a laptop to take notes. Waste of time.,0
Gives you many videos and lecture that do not help. She is okay with responding to emails. But does go the extra mile so pros and cons. The textbook is useless with the work given and would not take again.,0
"this is an online class; teacher made it very clear and easy to follow.  I was afraid to take an online class, but after this experience I am sure that I will take others. Tests are difficult but fair.  If you read, study and stay current you will do just fine",1
"More than half of the class got D's or F's and Dr. Stone confirmed it in an unprofessional letter to the students. There is no mathematical curve in this class. So if everybody gets below a 60% as their final grade, they are all getting D's or F's. And he said doing the homework and easy quizzes are count as a curve. Avoid this guy at all costs!!!",0
Dr. Mark was absolute hell to deal with. This courseload is beyond ridiculous and she is not understanding about you being in another classes that require your time. She does not respond to emails and if she does she is beyond rude to you and does not offer any help. There are major projects due each week. Her husband also attends every class.,0
"She is a decent professor and sometimes funny, but she definitely wants you to agree with her ideas and isn't really open to other perspectives. She grades tough so make sure to do the readings. Get on her good side and do the work and you'll be fine",1
"Dr. Krueger is the best! As a Human Resource Management major, I felt that she was very knowledagable in the subject and gave great examples from her real-life experience in the field. Her exams are based off powerpoints she lectures over (which you will get your own copies) and there is also a group presentation that's worth the same as one exam.",1
By far the worse professor that I have ever had! His classes are extremely boring. Attendance a must! Gives way too much material to read & expects you to have it all memorized. Gives weekly pop quizzes! He raises his voice & talks down to the class. He's unclear on his assignments & grades very tough. Gives last a ton of last minute assignments!,0
Amazing teacher. I should have taken his Math class in the beginning that way I would have passed the first go round. He really puts things into perspective and makes you understand the material. I went from dreading Math and failing to passing his class with an A. I would def. take him again !,1
He is not at all helpful if you don't agree about grade,0
"Her lectures are useless. She points at models and babbles off a whole list of anatomical terms leaving everyone confused. Her quizzes invoke anxiety because you have to answer 1 question in front of the whole class. The cadavers are cool, but she tricks you on the practicals. That makes her lab very hard to do well in, very frustrating.",0
"I had to drop this class. I don't know Spanish, so it was even harder. The tests were impossible (completely in Spanish, even the instructions). Even people who do know Spanish failed his tests. He doesn't give any extra credit, even if you beg. *DO NOT TAKE*",0
"I love having Alisha. She always is willing to work with you and walk through steps that are confusing. Things can seem to be a lot in this class, but they really aren't that bad. When you have Alisha she always will make sure you succeed. Highly recommend!",1
"I found this class really difficult personally. I studied hard and still really struggled though I typically struggle with math. The lectures only further confused me and only helped me when he would rarely go over the word problems. Homework was heavy, Tests were hard and timed to where you didn't have time to look through notes and on honor lock.",0
"Wasn't a big fan of Fetter.  His class consists of asking questions and watching Panoptos out of class, not the way I like to learn.  Quizzes and tests are lengthy and hard.  Likes students who ask questions and seem interested.  Doesn't really go off grading scale and curves, but class is difficult.  Go to review sessions and go to class.",0
"Honestly I really enjoyed this class and learned so much. I was intimated by the subject of organic chem but Kiesewetter put my fears aside and really made it understandable. She gives you the notes, just go to class and follow along with the examples. Extremely test heavy but you can drop the lowest exam. Take this class with her she is the best!!",1
"Eric is a nice enough guy but he makes all of the students go up to the white board and do problems. Not only is this juvenile, almost mid school like, he does not give us time to write things down in our notes, because we are ALWAYS up at the board. He also, constantly makes technical errors constantly.",0
"Zamora is one of my favorite teachers ive ever had, hes very charesmatic and actually wants to know whats going on with you to help in some way and is really understanding, hes very passionate about why he teaches and there isnt one time i was ever bored in class. School isnt my thing but his class always made me wanna learn more in it:)!",1
I never say this but Dr Gaffin is an awful Professor. I am an A student and I unfortunately will not be passing this class. Good thing i took it pass/fail. Save your time and DO NOT take this class. Tests are way too hard and he expects way to much out of his students for a 100 level class. Rambles on and on about one thing for the entire class.,0
Took him for the basic linux class.  Within the first couple of weeks we had already covered the entire course material the department chair taught in his class.  We then started doing heavy bash scripting and customizing our kernal with little explanation on what exactly we were doing it for.  Taught material way to advanced for a basic course.,0
Extremely hard grader. He is very smart and lectures the entire class. He gives breaks in the middle which last about a minute. very hard to follow and gives a ton of information. only take this class if you love reading the textbook every night.,0
"Paul Kirz is the smartest man you will ever meet. He is a music machine! last but not least, he is HOT!",1
"The class is pretty interesting.  He sometimes calls on people randomly, which can be annoying.  He knows absolutely everything about music history.  His tests are very hard, but he curves them a lot.",1
She grades so hard and is useless. Terrible class and terrible teacher.,0
"I have never studied harder for any class I have ever had. This class was honestly harder than ACTG one and two combined. Regardless professor Sarver was still a fine instructor of this very difficult subject. I took this remote class so I was able to rewatch any lecture I needed to. Personally, I wouldn't take him on campus.",1
He's a really great professor! He takes attendance and says you can only have two but he really doesnt care as long as you dont miss like 10 days. Class is just a lecture about pretty interesting stuff. He asks you to read some books but you can pass without them. All you have is 4 tests and thats it. YOU NEED TO SHOW UP TO PASS. TAKE NOTES!!!,1
"This professor may be ok in person but DO NOT TAKE HER ONLINE CLASS It is so hard I literally can't get over a 70 on her quizzes. She gives no extra credit, and is not helpful at all!!!",0
"Professor Epstein was a really fun professor, but the subject matter of LING 209 was limited and relatively uninteresting after a few weeks. That being said, this is a great intro to linguistics and I'm glad I took his class! Lots of readings and he always indicated exactly what would be on the exams.",1
Professor Reese is the type of professor that each teacher should strive to be like. He is ultimately the best teacher I have had while being in college. He totally understands the material that needs more attention and focuses on the criteria that is necessary. He is very understanding and always communicates well when there is a problem at hand.,1
"He is totally useless. Plain and simple. I never solves the examples, just gives you the formula then the answer and says solve it after class. Completely useless, worst professor I've had in all my three years.",0
Prey is an amazing and unique teacher. We learn the human body in all different labs that make learning fun. He gives us different learning activities to help us improve and learn the criteria better and easier. He is always there to help if needed and gives you many opportunities to learn and grow. I learned so much in his class.,1
"I'm another student disappointed that he will not be teaching 494 in the spring. I was looking forward to this. I did 446 with him and LOVED it. A lot of work, but, hey, isn't college supposed to be hard work? We heard that the dean did not want him to teach because he always catches the plagiarizers. What does that say about WSU Admins?",1
"MOST BORING PERSON TO EVER LIVE. monotone lectures are better than white noise for sleeping, reads the textbook, and does exercises, no initiative to ask students if they're learning, don't even read the chat if people have questions! HW and Exams are via 3rd party. no need to attend cuz he can care less how many ppl join, hell teach an empty class",0
"His tests were rather easy, but contained random bits of information, not the major concepts and ideas that you would assume. -WORST- speaker I've ever had. He rambles about previous lectures for half of the class and then goes off on a whim and manages to get nothing done. Overall, useless professor, easy grade.",0
Dr. V is such a positive role model whom I myself look up too amongst many more other students. I have never met such a caring understanding loving person let alone a professor like Dr. V. I LOVE how she makes a person feel so comfortable and loved. I can only speak for myself and from my experience with Dr.V. I would definitely recommend her.,1
She is not an easy grader. Her test ask random questions about half in her powerpoints half from the book. The amount of Studying I needed to do to get an A was the most I have ever needed to study. Others will study for hours and only get a C on the exams. She is not the professor just be prepared for the class I guess.,0
"His class was easily the most informative class I took while at UM. Lots of required reading, and lectures while not mandatory are incredibly dense and need a ton of notes or you wont pass. My one big turn off is he seemed to be more proud of who he knew, and had dinner with than the actual subject itself.",0
AWESOME TEACHER! Alex was a very fun and outgoing teacher but still taught the material. She provides you with everything you need to do well in her class. Just do the work she tells you to do and make sure to fill out and study the study guides! Highly recommend!!!,1
Lecture heavy but good class and easy,1
"Had Angie for Clincial. She expects a lot, but is willing to help. Feedback is delayed but as long as you are improving she will work with you.",1
Mrs. Padgett is the worst teacher I have ever had. She is EXTREMELY scatterbrained therefore can never stay on topic. She claims to go by the syllabus but never does. She also picks favorites which get graded differently than the rest. Her grading varies by student or what mood she is in.  She is very unprofessional and inappropriate.,0
"Be prepared to do A LOT of homework (2-4 MyMathLab sections) and 1 quiz each week! Unlimited attempts with the homework, and 2 attempts for each quiz. Straight forward, the homework and quizzes are graded so heavily that you absolutely CAN pass with at least a C- even if you bomb the exams. DO YOUR HOMEWORK until you get 100%, quizzes based on HMWK",1
he has us do so many Tableau projects that are peer-reviewed and graded pretty harshly. On top of that you have many readings and you are not allowed to email him or he will lower your course grade. Who does that?!,0
"Even though much of the class was failing, she would say that this was baby bio in comparison to the Biology course she took in college. This was demoralizing and humiliating. She also would discourage nursing students who have children, which I thought was odd because Goodwin is a career-focused college with a lot of students who have families.",0
"Very vague with grading criteria. Not clear whatsoever with grading and assignments. As a person who has never enrolled in a geography course prior, I would not recommend this instructor. Sobie grades hard and does not hold himself to the same standard. What a joke! This school should look into just how terrible their online instructors truly are.",0
"If you learn well from a teacher who sits behind a projector all class, scribbling on paper, she's your lady.  Half the time you could barely see what she was writing when she was going through examples. Horrible class.",0
"not sure why Professor Tavvs gets great reviews for his lectures.  He is a very sweet guy but his lectures were not for me.  If you see on his syllabus, his notes are very in depth with a lot of problems that are not necessary  (70+ pages).  Tavss does put in a lot of effort and do his practice probs! I Prefer Guerra or Kimmel.",0
"Crumpler was great, he gave examples during class that really helped see what he expected from us and also what we would expect on the exams. At least one of the problems he went over in lecture would be on the exams. He is a little intimidating but as long as you don't ask dumb questions, you should be good.",1
He may be a smart man but no one can understand him.  He has not done anything to qualify him to be an entrepreneurship professor.  It's amazing that he still has a job because after four years i have not learned a single thing from this man.,0
Gave assignments with no direction and everything was subjective grading. You will probably be fine if he likes you but his style is ridiculous and i would never take him again. Was not an understanding guy and it was always his way or the highway.,0
"If you hate math, she is great! She is very easy to comprehend and she tries hard to help you. She's so sweet and I appreciated how helpful she was. Never miss a class and ask lots of questions and you'll be fine.",1
She was a super great ENGL 100 prof! She gives very good feedback so you know exactly what you are doing wrong. She had a weekly forum or zoom meet (you only had to do one). There was a lot of reading but it was worth it and the essays are fairly open topic (lots of topic choice). She also answers emails within a day.,1
"Hands down the best class I took all semester. Wessel cares a lot about her students and gives great feedback on how to improve and do well. Tons of extra credit options and one of the exam grades is dropped, so if you do well enough on the 2 midterms, you don't need to take the final. She's incredibly smart, and I really enjoyed the lectures.",1
"He's friendly but boring. He just reads from the powerpoints and talks about random things. I could never understand what he was saying. Bring your laptop and do work for other classes. Lectures are pointless but he does take attendance. 1 quiz, 1 case study presentation, 1 take home test & a final. Super easy if you study a bit.",1
"Teaches by saying ""Look at your notes."" No help when questions are asked. If you have a good grasp on the subject before the class, he is fine. Not too much homework. If you do not know calculus 2, do not take him.",0
I took her 0314/1314 class this semester. Her teaching methods are hard to understand because she would teach the long way for problems. She teaches you 4-5 chapters every class period and then wed have a test the following week. She provides notes for the lecture and does go over the test review. Shes a nice lady but I would not take her again.,0
My opinion is that this professor is not strong in the classroom.,0
Hate all the class activities waste of time and exhausting just stick to material keep it simple,0
Glens the bomb! He gives awesome feedback and his classes are interesting. Good guy 5/7.,1
"Wish I had the experience some of these other reviewers have had, he is awful! Didnt grade a single thing until the first week of April for a class that started in January! No feedback, takes forever to respond to emails. Just does not seem like he cares at all about graduate students",0
She is a great teacher.  Makes you think outside the box a lot.  Plus you don't need the text book!,1
"He made it very clear at the beginning of the semester that he didn't care about any of the students. When a student had a question instead of answering it for us, he made another student answer it, down-grading the student who asked the question. He gave no homework, so i hope you're a fantastic test taker :) if you have an option pick a dif prf.",0
Awesome teacher. Explains really well. Laid back but makes sure the students get the topics he's teaching.,1
"Don't hate him cause he gives vague instructions. Don't hate him cause he is unprepared. Don't hate him cause he put emphasis on the unimportant things and glosses over the important ones. Hate him because his middle name is Lick. Overall good teacher, set aside time for the class, just do your work, have fun, and it's that simple.",1
"Her tests and quizzes are extremely hard. Even if you improve and try hard at the end, if you don't reach certain points, you won't pass. She's not student friendly, imo. There's no extra credit. She write/drew notes on board until the class end. This class need 100% attention or gg. Won't take her class ever again. Not a fun class.",0
Fantastic teacher that cares about teaching each individual student even in large lectures. Very approachable and knowledgeable; answers any and all questions clearly. Also attendance isnt mandatory but the lectures are so fun that you end up wanting to go to each class! Love this guy. Almost changed to an astronomy major because of his passion :),1
I really loved the class the only thing i disliked is that our final counts for so much of the grade (30%). If you don't do the homework in depth you won't know the material for class. He will know everyones name by the second day and HE WILL CALL ON YOU. Do your homework every nigh because he does walk around and check and does give you a grade.,1
"class was absolutely useless, so was the homework. Read the book in each and every detail, because it will be asked on the exam. HORRIBLE teacher, do not take Stats with him.",0
Sara pushes you. Don't expect to take her class and do the minimum to get by. She genuinely wants to she her students succeed. If you are not putting in the effort to grow then she will not be able to help you.,1
"Extremely passionate and knowledgeable! He will make you consider becoming an ecologist like him. The classes are very interesting and he tries to have multiple field trips, which are always relevant and helpful. The class is very easy and effective. Definitely my favorite professor at CSUDH.",1
AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!! I have NEVER had an online class with as many assignments due each week. If you take this professor you might as well quit your job if you want to pass. Professor also wants nothing to do with the students so good luck getting in touch with her. Also all tests require computer lock down and webcam.,0
"This man is an amazing person who teaches you lessons of life and being a good person! Also his lectures are rich and concise and you learn from every single word he uses! I would definitely take other classes with him! Very intelligent, helpful and humble! ",1
This professor grades as if literature is your major. I took his summer class and his expectations were too high for the time allotted for our assignments. He expects you to know the depth of what has taken him over 5 years to be familiar with. ,1
He's smart but he is too intense when he is in his lectures. He doesn't care that you have other classes and assignments because he only gives you mon - fri to do a long and hard assignment. I have not had one assignment that was interesting. Nice guy but makes me regret going towards my major in english since he has taught me nothing at all.,0
"I have never written a review in my life, but this time I would not let it go, Bruce Cohen has no idea what he is teaching, no material in the class, the class goes by bad jokes and arguments, and he is the most racist Professor in the USA.",0
Cant follow along during lectures at all. Stay home and read ur textbook,0
stay as far away from her! she dose not know how to teach!!!! when students ask questions she just says every one is right and dose not give a complete right answer.... she dose not know what she is talking about and she forgets everything she dose and says...dont take her class you will regret! she is not helpfull and she is soo baD!,0
"Hardest, worst professor. Do not take her class if you can avoid it ",0
she expects too much from an online HISTORY class. like girl it's an 8 week course and you want us to put 4 sources in a discussion... bye. dont take her if u can help it,0
"Horrible. Dont like her teaching style, couldn't understand a word she said. Read off the slides and that was it. If I saw she was teaching another course I wouldn't pick it",0
"There are a lot of quizzes and assignments, which means lots of opportunities to get points. She makes you work, but you will get the grade you deserve for the amount of work you put in. She's very good at entering grades into Canvas as soon as she grades an assignment, so you always know how well you're doing in the class.",1
"Professor Keller-Perkins tells you what you need to pass her quizzes, exams, midterm, and final. Do the homeworks, always refer to your notes, and study the examle pictures in the OCR; they will save your life. If you don't understand the material right away, then speak up. The professor will explain it again. Visit the tutors and form study groups",1
Meh,0
She's awesome. Just do yourself a favor and take her class. You won't ever want to miss a class. Trust me.,1
"The first quarter is difficult cos you have to get accustomed to her teaching style. She isn't looking for your work to fit into specific guidelines, just write anything basically has yo do with the topic she assigns. If you turn in work and participate you will get an A. Great class great professor. I'd love to take classes from her in the future.",1
"Danae is an amazing teacher, and has so much passion in her teaching. She is one of my favorite teachers. I took her class Tuesday nights and expected it to be and learned so much! She is an amazing teacher, and made the class very interesting. I loved everything about the class. And homework was enjoyable. I really recommend this class with her!",1
I hope that she teaches better in person than she does online. I have struggled through my entire semester with her online and I would not do it again.,0
A pretty good amount of work for an online class. Must buy the textbook to complete work through that and on Canvas. Weekly discussion boards and the exams are particular but he teaches exactly how to do them. You have a 3 hour window to complete the exams once you begin.,1
"she set me up for failure, did not give grades back until the drop date, if you have a different opinion than her she will fail you, my whole class is basically failing now, have to meet outside of class and graded on it, have to come up with your own exam questions and even those are not good enough for her. exams have too much for the time period",0
"She didnt teach. No lectures, PowerPoints, & rarely communicated and this is an online class. All the assignments were on Connect & you basically had to teach yourself & read the text to learn. The midterm & final were proctored & you arent able to use any notes, the textbook, or search engines unlike the hw. Avoid her if you can, hard for GenEd.",0
"This class was a lot more in depth than I expected. If you plan on going to law school, you should probably take this class. If you are not, then probably avoid this class. 90% of grade comes from two moderately difficult tests. Smith himself is a nice and funny guy.",1
I'm gonna get strait to the point. Lovely woman but definitely do not recommend taking her class unless it's mandatory. I often find myself showing up to class and doing other course work during her lecture and getting all the info I need from the slides come exam time. Her labs are incredibly convoluted and barely relate to course material.,0
he was not helpful at all. was trying my best in his class and drop me supposly becuase of my absences B.S.,0
The wrong prof. for SU. He is way ahead and should work to a more challenging environment. Very smart and hard working prof.,1
"Tough grader, not helpful at all. Class moves very fast pace. Unless you are already familiar with accounting do not take this class. She expects you to know what you did wrong.  I think she has been teaching to so long she forgets some people are new to the accounting field.",0
The best professor I have come across in college by far. Super understanding and helpful. Patient and Fair. Super funny and makes the lectures fun and interesting. Helped me understand science and like it again.,1
"Doesn't really follow either of his two textbooks well or really provide examples in class, then gets upset when you don't know what you're doing.",0
I had Professor Dattolo for Spanish 2 last semester and he was amazing. He is very intelligent and his lectures were organized and very easy to follow. He would go out of his way to help us and his respect for his students was greatly appreciated. If you take Spanish 2 be sure to to take Professor Dattolo,1
just the best,1
"This rude lady suck! Half of the class dont understand her ""English"". You wont know what you do in class. Give you suprise that she never taught you in class during final exam. GRADE STUDENT ON HER PREFERENCE.",0
"I took Ms. Barclift for three classes during my four years at JSU. She's always very helpful and the classes were pretty easy. You learn a lot of cool information dealing with her experiences in social work. She's very open to talk to and although she comes off as intimidating, she's very sweet.",1
"If you really want to learn, dont take this class. She teaches the class like if its a middle school math class. She moves on to fast and doesnt make the lessons clear and understandable. So much homework . Horrible math professor",0
"difficult class, but he is an awesome prof and will make you think!! excellent class to take!",1
"Lectures are very heavy. Gets off topic. Theres roughly 46 classes in a semester. For attendance you start off with 100 points at the start of the semester. Each time youre late, absent, leave early, or on your phone during lecture he takes off 10 points of that 100. Our final wasnt worth as much as attendance... Pick a different professor.",0
"My 2nd favorite professor out of all my semesters at hostos. She's understanding, funny, & makes the information understandable & super fun to learn. Highly recommend you take her!",1
She is a Student Teacher. Took Spring 15'. Exams were exact questions from textbook that she tells you to study off. Tough subject overall.,1
"Great Professor.  The material isn't earthshattering or really hard to understand, but expect to work hard.  The things you learn in this class will be of use to you throughout your life, whether you go into business or not.",1
"She takes forever to grade things. It took her a month to grade simple quizzes to test. She waits until the semester is up to grade. She does not give extra credit, and does not help you when you mess up. She does not care if you fail. I never had a teacher like her. She is a tough grader on her papers. Takes forever to get a reply back. ",0
"Like another review said, Marek is an overall good person and a good engineer, however he is an absolutely terrible prof. As said, he's a very nice person and will answer your questions if you have them. But that's where the good ends. Pointless lectures, constantly stutters during those lectures, mind-boggling grading criteria and so much more.",0
Keeps it interesting and tries to have fun. Pretty easy class. 9/10 would recommend.,1
"He is not the expert instructor in his job, and doesn't have the knowledge to answer the tests of MCSE exam. Actually, he doesn't know anything about the Network, and just spend the time of the class with nonsense words, and cannot teach anything. He is terrible.",0
"In my opinion, she took a ridiculous amounts of points for items graded and was clearly unfair in her grading.  Her grading comments were very unclear. An example, post 2 responses for discussion boards to meet the minimum requirements. The she takes a point because you only posted two.  How can you take points for meeting requirements?",0
"This class is way hard. TAs are very bad, too. If you get nice TA, then you will pass. Do not think about getting A from this class.",0
"Dr. Heske is really funny and ALWAYS in a good mood. He is more than willing to help his students, and he knows what he is doing. He tries to keep the class interested in the topic at hand, and tests are based off homework questions so if listen very closely in class, read the book, do the sample problems at the end of the chapter, you will get an",1
Really sweet woman!,1
"Worst professor I have taken at UCD. Her tests are very subjective, and she's a tough grader. You can literally rebuttal every question on her test. She has a horrible memory, so make sure you don't ask her to repeat herself (because she forgets). She is also very rude, HATES when people walk in late, and gets distracted easily. Avoid her!!",0
"Patti is one of my favorite teachers here. She's kind, helpful and very understanding. It's so easy to talk to her and I have had no problem asking for extensions on assignments. I would definitely take one of her classes again and recommend you take her class.",1
"I loved taking this class, the teacher is extremely organized and lays out the material in a very clear way which makes this class a lot easier. You can tell she really cares about her students and will do anything to make sure they succeed in this class, and she also provides several extra credit opportunities.",1
"He's very nice but KEEP IN MIND he's a harsh grader on the speeches. My major is journalism and I've received A's in all my writing classes, i'm a great public speaker I never get nervous, but he still gave me a B even though I did all my speeches and came to class. The girl next to me missed half her speeches and did a terrible job but got an A...",0
"This professor is super hard and doesn't really "" teach "" persay, you want history to be like well history and not english. there is a TON of work, and if you don't read the book you are screwed. she doesn't give notes and what she does give its words here and there, i hated this class and she makes me glad i'm not a history major.",0
"The OB course was very demanding, the group project was difficult at best due to the restrictions for communication placed on it. The midterm and final exams were very challenging. The prof was primarily hands off and learning was primarily group discussions and posts. The course structure forced serious independence and leadership skills.",1
"Professor Noimann should not be teaching an online class or any college class for that matter.  Her assignments are convoluted and do not reflect her grading policy.  She does not respond to students until it is too late into the course. As a professor, she does not offer any advise or constructive criticism to improve an assignment or final paper.",0
"Go to lectures, he posts notes via blank word docs which he only fills in in-class. Ridiculous grading. If you miss one point you lose 90% of the marks. Went to him about a midterm during office hours and my mark went up 10% due to him marking stuff wrong when it was actually right. Marking scheme makes no sense. Slow and repetitive lectures. Avoid",0
I have taken this class twice before and failed it because professors don't know how to lecture. Professor Hercules does a great job explaining the material.,1
Material seems unorganized for a class that is about organizing. Lots of reading and reading reactions as homework. Sometimes the assignments would not be posted until a day before they are due. The lecture slides make sense unlike the reading. Gives many chances to do extra credit.,0
"She's rude and very serious. She has a very strong accent that makes it very difficult to learn from her. She goes very quickly and with the combination of her speed and accent it makes taking notes difficult. There is 3 tests + a final, homework on every chapter. Do her test reviews and read the book and you'll be fine.",1
Final grade  Test 1 + Test 2 + Final + In-class-quizzes. Take this prof!! She makes it easy to get an A and genuinely cares about your success. You will realize after a couple of weeks of attending lectures that you can skip class and study her posted lecture notes. Not difficult material.,1
"It was bio lab class, with a quiz in the beginning of every lecture. She gives a review before every practical because she genuinely wants all of us to do well and pass. However, not all of us do well, so she tries to make it easier for us next time. She's great but it may be hard to understand her sometimes.",1
"Great professor, she presents everything very clearly. Her assignments are graded fairly and easily for the most part, and her exams are straight forward. Its easy to do well in her courses. I recommend taking any class with her. She made stats a breeze",1
She taught straight from the slides so if you have the lecture manual you could basically teach yourself everything and still pass. She does not know how to answer abstract questions (if it's not on the slide she does not know the answer). Homework load was a lot but not too difficult. The textbook was not useful but the lecture manual was.,0
"This class has an extremely heavy workload that does not enhance the concepts or themes of the class. Assignments are unclear, rubrics are useless or nonexistent. Lisa tries to help, but the workload is huge and the assignments are really just busy work to her specifications, not knowledge enhancing or helpful. This was my worst class in my field.",0
"If you like being yelled at and lectured like a child then take him. Self torture is the best kind of pain, but he will add to it. If you don't do your work then he will straight up ask you ""why are you event here""? He will kick you out of class, ask you to leave, and dismiss you. He will tell you ""get out of my face"".  extremely rude.",1
Great teacher!!!actually goes thru steps on a pace that i can grasp ///Absoltely love her!!!,1
Ive taken Baker also for PSYCH. Ive taken both classes online so its always more work. He added Connect to his assignments but it pays off. I currently have an A in this class and got an A in PSYCH. Replies fast to emails and always gives you reminders and tips. He wants you to pass the class and cares for your well being.,1
"Quizzes are based entirely on the readings, of which there are far too many each week, but you only get questions based on 3 of them and you won't know which ones. What is the point of even going to lecture? Wastes the first third of class just getting herself organized. Prepare to be indoctrinated. Class was a waste of my time. Don't waste yours.",0
"She is a great teacher, and made Survey of Anatomy and Physiology a lot of fun. She does mock lecture test and practicals before the exams, so you know exactly what to expect. She also gives extra credit as well as curves if she sees fit. I highly recommend her.",1
"Issues are understandable, but this professor does not take his class or himself seriously. The topics he discusses in class do not provide enough information to answer exam questions correctly. His questions feel malicious in that they are made to mislead and confuse students, while also being highly subjective. I could go on. Avoid him if you can",0
please. for all that is holy. do not take this women in any class ever. I got an A and I would get an F if it meant I never had to take this class. Don't do it guys. There's better out there just don't do sonntag. please please don't. Tests are cruel. She is cruel. There are a lot of better profs at dearbon. Shabeb walla ma tekhdoua.,0
"He always complained about our class's integration skills. He assured me since I aced the 3rd midterm I'd pass the final, but then put gotcha questions and exception to the rule questions on the final. Doesn't not help you work to keep any scholarships, etc. Aced MATH 106, 107, & 208 with ease, but his teaching style hinders any chance at an A.",0
Trina is an excellent professor. She is extremely patient and she is good at explaining the topic. It is not necessary to attend class because she doesn't grade you on that but she is very good at explaining the notes when you're in class so reviewing the notes for the day by yourself might be a bit confusing. She is really sweet and understanding.,1
The whole grade is 2 projects a mid term a final and a quiz at the start of each class. She expects everyone to figure out what she wants through her mediocre instructions. She illprepared to say the least and should not be allowed to teach at a college level since she doesnt know parts of the criteria her self. Find a way around having to takeher,0
I had a lot of hope for this class and this professor. I have found Dr. Saunders very condescending when you are asking questions and seems aloof despite trying to make jokes in class. He flies through the PPT and excel examples. He says attendance doesn't count but will hand out random extra credit on a whim. Class is a drag and I am disappointed.,0
disorganized,0
"Professor Thielo is the worst professor I've ever had. She completely stopped responding to us halfway through the semester. With COVID and all online classes, you'd think she'd try to at least stay in touch with us, but no. It was supposed to be a 1000 point class, but ended up being about 200 because she stopped responding. Would not take again.",0
This professor was very hard to understand his needs. Doesn't follow syllabus and only took 2 test the thoughtout the semester meaning the final was a high stake test!,0
"Ning can barely understand a word you say to him. If you're looking for clarification on anything your only recourse is to ask your classmates, or pray that he understand you on accident. On top of the language barrier his understanding of the course material doesn't seem that great either. I had him for Intro to Programming btw.",0
"Attendance was optional for my class, and I opted out. This means I can't speak much for her teaching style. The material was not difficult for me, but many struggled. She gives many extra credit opportunities and her tests were always reasonable. Her homework method was tedious, but it saves you $200 on some AcctLabPlus access code. Lots of HW.",1
"Prof. Stevens makes you feel stupid when you ask questions for clarification. For EGR106, he assumed that everyone in the class had previous coding experience so he skipped over the basics which screwed me over because I had to figure it out on my own while doing projects similar to my friends in 300 level classes. He assigns a project once a week.",0
"I picked her due to great reviews, BUT that may only be in class. DO NOT take her online! Had her for Summer 2. Only 4 assignments w/ a low grading scale (15,20,20,20)- No room for human error. Doesn't care to give a good feedback even when asked. Non-existent. Not her problem. I'd never take her again! I've had way better online class experience",0
Very vague. Not a lot of feedback given,0
"fair teacher, but she's hard to understand with her accent, and her study guides are poorly done. In class her slides are barely done and she often talks about other things. The course in general didn't make much sense. we had a sub (dr. day) for two classes and learned more with him than I ever did with her",0
"She's a sweet lady - well described by someone earlier as resembling Ms. Honey from Matilda...she posts printable lecture notes that breaks down book material very well. She wants her students to do well.Clicker questions make class mandatory, but help on tests. Do the online hw, come to class, and do the study guide before exams and you're golden.",1
"The worst professor ever in NC state. He doesn't teach, and he's not organized at all. Try to avoid him whatever costs you!!!!",0
a very good professor. Helps you use your ideas to create terrific work. Real chill dude also,1
"Julie gaudet is an awful teacher. She makes the minimal effort required, and I cannot even call it teaching. I had her for a research course. The course was so poorly put together, and Julie did not help. Any questions asked by students she would say ""it's in the textbook"". Her required readings for lessons did not match what she gives on exams.",0
"She does not go by the syllabus. She doesnt give any lectures. She did one exam review and refused to do more, even for the final. Its as if this class doesnt have a professor.",0
"Sheryl is strict but as long as you do your work and go to class, you will be fine. Make sure to talk to her in advance with problems and questions. You never want to wait to the last minute with her. That's what makes her angry.",1
"Had us read 20 pages of a statistic book every week, and asked us 3 random questions regarding chapter. On top of that was having us research, write draft, and final within 3 weeks and didn't offer much help regarding the papers. Also wouldn't grade my finished work over the spring break because one of my sources couldn't be printed.",0
She is very chill and tends to end class early which I loved. My class was from 10 to 10:55 and I usually would end up leaving at 10:15 instead. The work was all participation so if you finished it you got 100%. The assignment were never anything you couldn't finish in 30 minutes. Just show up to class and turn the work in and its an easy A.,1
"Kristi always tells us to communicate with her if there are any questions/issues, but she never replies. She isn't clear with what she wants and is a very, very slow grader. Wants us to have long responses to other people's posts but there's not much to talk about. Lectures are just videos after videos. Why am I paying money just to watch videos?",0
"Class is extremely easy. Its made up of 4, 600 word papers written in free form. There are no MLA or any other notation requirements. She uses Turnitin as a plagiarism deterrent, but as long as you put subjects into your own words there wont be a problem. I highly recommend her class for an easy A!",1
"Aced the class, but he's a terrible teacher. You don't learn anything. The class is basically one big tangent, and the grading is a bit random too. Got a perfect score on the final w/ spark notes.",0
I am not a science person but I'm so glad I took my science courses with Christy. She was so patient with helping me understand each lesson. Her lectures were so thorough and clear! I would deff recommend her!!!,1
"Fantastic prof, and always willing to help. Wish he taught other classes besides cis120!",1
"She did a video presentation at the beginning of each week, but did not really explain anything just read off the instructions that we can do, not really going into depth. Also, didn't really answer the questions on the discussion boards, I learned the answers to things from other students in the class. It was not clear what her expectations were.",0
"Inconsistent & unreliable-says one thing & does another. LAZY-doesn't answer emails unless threatened, didn't update the syllabus from last semester so we had no test dates & no schedule all semester-we never knew when the test was, as of wk 12 still no graded labs or papers. Group projects so he doesn't have to grade more papers. Disappointing.",0
"Her exams are extremely difficult with no help from lectures. She's a tough grader and her assistants are even worse. she's VERY kind, very attractive, great personality etc but as a professor, she's a wolf in sheep's clothing. 100% AVOID.",0
I had her at UNL. She is absolutely one of the most caring professors I have ever had! She is one of those professors who doesn't spoon feed you but she gives you the tools you need to succeed! As long as you do the readings and take good notes in class(NEED TO SHOW UP TO CLASS).  350 characters aren't enough to describe her. She's simply amazing!,1
Tbh his teaching is not that good. He can't explain concepts well and it is confusing even to me as a student who have taken calculus before. But he is very organized in his class and test schedules. He give extra credits. Has a lot of hw to do. Tests are not too difficult. Wouldn't recommend taking him if you don't already know the materials.,0
I took his Intro to Music class and it was the worst teacher I've ever had. Without fail each one of his quizzes would have one or more mistakes. He also refused to put grades in Moodle which made it difficult to know my grade. He is also hard to reach out to. He still has not forwarded the email he sent to everyone but me in my class.,0
She is a really hard grader. If you take her class be prepared to  do a lot of studying. There is a lot of reading and her tests are hard. Attendance counts for quite a bit so don't miss any classes if you can. I wouldn't recommend taking her class. I won't take another class by her. Other people in my class also found her to be a tough grader. ,0
Melissa is an awesome teacher. Her online course was well organized and I was rarely confused about what I was expected to do. She is clearly very thoughtful and cares about her students. Would highly recommend!,1
"This was no doubt a tough class, but Dr. Fan really cares about her students and wants you to attend her class! She drops the lowest test grade, and it really comes handy towards the end.",1
"I'm not one to give such a poor review, but this is truly the worst class I've ever taken. He doesn't tell you how to do well, games are often unclear, way too much reading. I was so excited to take an untraditional class, but the stress and confusion was overwhelming. Don't recommend if you need structure, reasonable class load, or applicability",0
"He is a very nice guy, but he has trouble explaining things. I didn't learn much from him, had to learn it all on my own. His test are not to bad he is great at giving partial credit. If you are not really good at physics I would not recomend taking him.",1
Professor MJ was by far one of the best professors I have ever had and hands down the most inspirational person Ive ever came into contact with! She takes the fear out of public speaking and does it In a very fun and creative way. I absolutely loved this professor.,1
"Nurick is the GOAT. He's a Bentley legend, been here since the 80's. I loved this man's class - very fair grader, not too stressful and he's so accessible outside of class. I loved going to his office and just talking with him about life. Overall, my favorite professor at Bentley. If you have the chance to take him, you'd be foolish not to.",1
"The material on the exams are not based on understanding, but on stupid memorization.  He also injects his political and religious views into a chemistry class--no small feat.  He is extremely arrogant.",0
"Class is relatively easy if you read the book. Tests are based on items not really from lecture but more so from the book. Teacher doesn't make an effort to be there for students, GSI's are more helpful/nice.",0
Im disabled and he was very understanding with me and my situation. That helped me a lot. But he is very considerate.,1
"It would be very helpful if there were reviews prior to each test, such as worksheets or crossword puzzles throughout the course. When it came to the Geographers, the test could have been clarified to match the notes.  Tests and book reports should be returned in a more timely manner.",1
"She assigns work daily to turn in the next class. She does not accept late work, nor does she grade on time. If you want to go the semester not knowing your grade by her or BB she's the one. This is a SELF LEARN COURSE!!!!! Only took the class because it was substitution for Stats II. Should have took my chances with Stats.",0
"I had her last year and she was great! She was really clear in terms of what her expectations were and she's great at explaining things. I wouldn't say the course was difficult, but there were a lot of readings, so make sure you keep up with those.",1
"He  doesn't give you handouts, but if you do the work he's fair. He's very upfront about his expectations,and gives plenty of help if it's needed. I took him for two semesters. I would definitely recommend taking him if you're a college freshman.",1
"Dr. Polster is an extremely skilled teacher, and her method of teaching a foreign language is probably the best I've ever seen.  If you're interested in German or just need a foreign language, take Dr. Polster's class and you'll learn something along the way.",1
"Professor Russell is the best professor at Vandy, in my opinion. I would recommend any of her classes to anyone interested in political science or law. She's really funny and knows everything there is to know about Constitutional Law. She is always willing to help students and it a really great person to talk to about legal careers.",1
I took this class with Bob last year and I liked it. I felt like I learned a lot. Sometimes his directions could be a little clearer but he treated us like college students and not like kids in high school. I appreciated that about him. I would take another class from him. He is no pushover but that is not a bad thing.,1
Kathy is VERY smart. She has worked for many newspapers and she loves what she does (teaching). She has a great attitude and will work with you if you miss an assignment due to missing class. ,1
"Great Professor, has a passion for African history and it translates to her lectures. Her assignments are straight forward and her marking is fair. Seminars produce great discussion and love her bringing clementines to snack on. Also love the variety of reading types from documentaries to songs instead of just readings.",1
"Dr. Hadavas is a great professor. This is a just a hard class overall. You will put in countless hours practicing. Please take advantage of office hours. He's one of those smart professors that can dumb something down and you still may not understand. However, he's very passionate about this subject and is willing to help you understand.",1
"Although I was not in her college class at ECC, I was participating in her college level Calculus course at Bartlett High School. Her class is very difficult and it may take months to get A's on her tests. As far as flexibility for help, she is usually avalaible.",1
Professor Connelly is awesome!,1
"Garyen is an amazing prof, he really cares about his students. He is super funny and understanding. I always looked forwards to his lectures, so if you can take HSCI 1140 with him!",1
super funny. Honestly dont think ill have a better teacher.,1
"Tammie is very specific in what she wants when it comes to assignments. Ive learned more in this course than any other English courses. Lots of papers and readings, but also plenty of extra credit opportunities. This course is not an easy A since Tammie is a tough grader. Go to office hours, shes always there to answer questions!",1
"You'll work your tail off, but overall, I did better in this class than I did in Micro. He's not the type of professor that just teaches you useless facts and has you regurgitate them on the test. He expects that you learn the theories behind the information and then be able to apply it. Don't take him if you're a ""c's-get-degrees"" type.",1
"He's a good guy but I did not enjoy his teaching style. His instructions were clear but grading style was inconsistent. I would ask for one on one time with him to improve my papers throughout the semester. He would give feedback, but it was more negativity than constructive criticism. Nice guy, but an average professor.",1
"Clearly a very intelligent and capable professor, but he expects a lot. 6 week summer course and there were 3 novels and textbook reading, plus 4 discussion assignments, lots of audio lectures, an essay, reading quiz, and 2 writing heavy tests. Really brutal for a lower division course. If you work a lot, this is even more of a struggle.",1
"Not a good prof.  Materials she teaches in class have nothing to do with Management Info Systems.  You will learn nothing in her class.  She will give you directions on how she wants assignments done, then she will still punish you anyway regardless.  Very unnecessarily cruel and evil prof.  Shame.",0
"I'm not one to post on this cite, but I just had to warn the next gen about this professor. I have GPA above a 3.0 so believe when I tell you to avoid this professor at all cost. He is really vague and a tough grader. He only wants things done his way and no other way. He will remove points if you don't do questions his way. Worst professor ever.",0
"The subject is so dry that it really doesn't matter what instructor you get. It's going to be rough. Communication is tough at times because (like the rest of the IS teachers) he does have a strong accent, but I would bet Prof. Cheng is the best CSULB has right now because he's young, pretty funny, and really makes sure you get the material.",1
"The nicest gentleman and very very experienced. He is a super easy grader, but you must turn in everything and participate online. He lets you turn in papers late and great for lazy students, but not so much for the students that do their work and on time. Tests, essays, reports and more!!! You better have a lot of time on your hands..",1
"Just one word ""amazing""",1
"Lectures by powerpoint, but breezes through it too quickly to take notes. He posts it online, so print it out before class. Vocab by chapter is required. Quizzes are always tough. Exams are multiple choice and a little easier (tests for comprehension). He curves heavy and will let you know what to study for the exam if prompted.",1
"Worst class I have taken at TCU. I almost reported her for being unbelievably biased when giving lectures. She is uninterested in hearing opinions other than hers, and her quizzes and exams are not easy by any means. Lots of reading and effort for a class I hated, and didn't even lead to a good grade. Would stay away 100%.",0
Put in the work and you will pass.,1
"This class shouldn't be as hard as it is made. Exams are confusing and a few questions were incomprehensible on each one. To make it worse, no specifics are given as to what will be on the exam, just how many questions from each chapter will be on it.  If you have the time to do every single reading you can do well, but you won't be able to cruise.",0
"professor gaffin is very unspecific in what he wants us to study, he can generalize at times he tends sometimes make people feel uncomfortable, my advice is to come to class and read the readings and study then you will not have to worry about failing.",0
"She's so helpful. 2 reports, 2 exams, group debate, and a final. Discuss all the readings in class. A bit hard on grading, but gives good feedback. Exams are open ended and she really listens to the student's ideas and helps them elaborate them further. Amazing professor, I would recommend taking her for PHIL 284. ",1
"def. something is a little off here. although he is very smart, nice, and has great ideas..you will never tell because he gives you NO WORK.  he's a lot of fun to talk to though..and you watch some movies.",1
"Professor is harsh and tyranny. DO NOT take you phone out in class, he will call you and throw you out. He is very dry and the material he covered was interesting, but his delivery was not. Easy class to pass if you do reading and come to class. No papers, and the final is not cumulative.",0
She is my all time favorite,1
Really nice guy who really just wants to have a debate. Come to class and you'll get a good grade,1
Just keep your homework on track and your Gucci,1
"He's a laid back professor. Especially with attendance. If you read the book, you don't have to show up to all of the classes. Some call him a hard grader, but he actually has his own grading scale that makes his tests easier to pass. Good with getting grades up quick. Occasionally his tests are hard. Don't expect his lectures to be interesting.",0
Chet is a very nice man but he doesnt stay on track with his lessons. He tends to rush through the topic of what hes teaching and doesnt necessarily provide the student with an answer to their question. Chet also makes mistakes when grading exams and often gives you a lower grade than what was deserved.,0
The greatest professor I had met in UW!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
A very nice teacher!!,1
"Prof. Kolluru is a good professor. However, I believe she is bored with teaching. Her in-class lectures are great, she engages with students. The tough part is the exams. They are nothing like homework or practice material. She will ask you to remember formulas never covered in her class and has questions and has sections designed to trick you.",0
"Material is so unclear and when you ask for clarity the teacher gives you his opinion. He will ask you your understanding of the material, don't raise your hand... its a trap. Unless its his ideology its wrong.  Extremely repetitive and covers nothing.  Also he has a serious attitude problem.",0
"Might be the worst teacher I have ever had.  This is by far the most difficult class I've ever taken and it is only because of the professor.  Looking back at the semester, a fish could teach better than she could.  She assigns ungodly amounts of homework and does little to help us understand the material.  Outside help is the only way to  do well.",0
"Great Prof. Cares for his students and wants everyone to succeed (Even tries to know you by name). Very approachable. A lot of time is needed for this class, though.",1
Love Dr. Chalk!! Great class that is always interesting and sparks class discussions. Can't wait to take another class with her!,1
"Saralina is one of the best professors I have ever had. She is amazing at getting the energy of the class up and the discussions are always high quality. I did have some trouble getting A's, though. She's a pretty picky grader. ",1
He's not as bad as some people say. Just get used to his style. Find his video-lectures on iTunesU - they were very helpful. Answering questions is not his strong suit - can't answer to the point.  But I like the way he structured his course although I had to either read the book or find some other learning materials and read after each lecture,1
"Dr Deason is the best! She gives good examples in class and makes the content easy to understand. She includes everything from the readings in her lectures, so you don't really have to read the book. The exams are easy, mostly multiple choice. She is funny and adorable, and a REALLY good professor overall, and the class itself is very interesting.",1
"Exams are very tough but his curve is awesome! Notes help you understand where formulas come from. However, for exams, make sure you write down the final form of the formulas in your cheat sheet. Knowing trig really helps especially for the first 2 exams. Overall, possible to do well if genuine effort is applied.",1
"I love Dr. Hartman she is so caring, and helpful. As long as you put forth effort she will help you with whatever you need help with. She is so understanding, and easy to talk to. She likes to talk to her students and check in with her students to make sure they are understanding the assignments and are doing a good job. Very easy.",1
"Love this professor, office quizzes and TIA chapter quizzes can attempt 3 times, midterm and final can attempts two times, grader projects can attempts unlimited times until you got 70%, she also post the grader project video on her website, note: if you got less than 70%, you will got 0, super easy to pass with B or higher, I hope to take her.",1
I don't know if it is him or the class itself but it's VERY difficult. Makes you feel stupid when asking questions and poor office hour times.,0
"i dont think this class was easy. like someone said, u cant come into this class without prior knowledge. and hw assignments were very unclear and difficult, tests were hard! i dont like this class!",0
Not recomended if you can help it will not be a enjoyable class,0
"This class made my day! His lectures are so interesting, however many think that you can do well on the test without reading the textbook. Some of the questions on the midterm and final are not covered in his lectures. This class was easy and a great learning environment.",1
"very friendly, but the work load is a lot. tons of reading daily and if you don't do it you will absolutely fall behind in class. Her political bias slips into her lectures when given the chance as well.",0
"Dr. Lim was not the best professor for this class. Avoid him like the plague if you can. I got a 67% on the final and that was the average. There was no curve in the class whatsoever, the only reason I passed was because the TA was amazing and gave a lot of partial credit. Multiple people cried during his final.",0
He was great but he seemed distant and I relied solely on the other teachers for help,1
Worse professor I have taken at FAU. This is a graduate course and out of all the professors I've had he is the worse one! There are 2 tests throughout the course--midterm and final and are worth 50% of your grade. He also has quizzes but is worth 1-2% and a research paper. The exams are taken in respondus lockdown w/ webcam. WORSE CLASS EVER!!!,0
"Very encouraging, he convinced me to 'stay the course,' when I  considered leaving TESC due to issues with administration and the school.  Great instructor, informative, helpful feedback.  Thi s was a guided study course so there was only email contact but he went well beyond what was expected.  Highly recommend, I'd take him again if I could.",1
She was very well organized with her lectures and her slides. If you missed class she would always record the lecture so you could easily access it. On top of that she would also make extra videos so in case you didn't understand the lecture you could watch those. She gave plenty of extra credit opportunities. A Very Kind Prof. overall *chef kiss*,1
"Professor Chidinma is very thorough , her 'A' does not come easy and you are unlikely to fail her class  if you show some seriousness.",1
"Her concern for all of us truly makes me feel like she actually cares about the human beings we are. The way she teaches this class, audio lectures coupled with her personality toward me, made all the difference in completing this course.",1
Get what you need in the class. The professor would help a lot.,1
"she is such an angel. trust me you'll do good in her class, she really wants the best for everyone. shes super approachable and i wish i could give her a thank you hug",1
"Dr. Keeling is obviously knowledgable about toys and games.. but she changed the topic of the class after registration from a topic I was interested into toys so I went from being really interested into the class to not. She is an okay grader for papers, but a lot of the class is busy work. Participate lots bc its part of your grade.",0
"DONT TAKE HIM!! LAST SEMESTER AT HCC, COMPLETED 60 HOURS AND THIS CLASS WAS MY FIRST C! GPA DROPPER! HE GRADES YOU RANDOMLY AND DOES NOT EVEN USE THE EXTRA CREDIT FROM EXTRA CREDIT ASSIGNMENTS!!",0
I did not like this class at all. Her tests are extremely hard! You have to study every waking minute of the semester to even get a passing grade...,1
makes you speak in front of the class a lot. tough and expects you to learn spanish almost immediately,0
"Really hard to understand, mostly because he talks so fast and his accent just adds to it. He keeps his tests the same from previous years... His part of the final is hard and once again most of it was the exact same from the previous year.",0
"Her teaching style is for you to learn the material yourself, on your own. She is very disorganized. She drops tons of paperwork on you at the last minute. This semester, over half her class is failing the department wide tests. A ticket to her class is a ticket to failure. Go with another prof; don't waste your time with her.",0
"The class is really easy, but you kind of have to teach yourself.  He is confusing in lecture and he even confuses himself most times.  If you ask for help on a question he either does it without much explanation, or he gets it wrong and another student has to complete it for him.  I think he is very smart, but isn't the best teacher.  ",0
She was absolutely one of the worst professors Ive had at GSU. The only positive thing I can say about her is that she gives extra credit yet she didnt grade some of my classmates extra credit and classwork until the grades have been finalized. Grades would have been better if she had graded the assignments before the final date for grades.,0
"To keep it simple... I received an average of a 74 with Prof Conner for Intermediate Algebra. The next semester in College Algebra I got a 95. Wasn't a fan of her style, pace of the class, or patience. Went at her own pace and got annoyed if you asked her to work out more problems to help you understand.",0
"LOVED HIM.  His class was one of the hardest I ever took, but he was hillarious and really helpful.  He always reassured.  I would definitely take him again.",1
"I ENROLLED IN THIS CLASS 6/29/2011 FOR SUMMER B SESSION. I READ REVIEWS WRITTEN BUT DECIDED TO TAKE A CHANCE. BOY I WISH I HAD LISTENED I STAYED IN CLASS FOR TEN MINUTES AND HURRIED TO DROP. PROFESSOR WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE, FAST SPEED AYOU COULD NOT UNDERSTAND ONE WORD SHE WAS SAYING... HOW DO EDISON EXPECT YOU TO LEARN LIKE THIS!! DONT TAKE HER!",0
you have to do learn smart!! its just a lot when your taking 4-5 classes. tests are not easy at all each questions talks about 2-3 different topics so its confusing at times ... GOOOODLUCK WITH THIS PROFESSOR U'll need it for anatomy 425,0
"I had Sander for Bio 108 lab. Extremely tough grader and not clear on material. She is not very clear on feedback. While she is a very nice person (I liked her personally but not professionally) I would not have her as a lab instructor again. On a positive note, she was very willing to help during non-test labs.",0
Unfortunately he is not at all a good professor. he has numerous war stories that dont pertain. Also he will send you emails but will never respond to your emails. Also do the papers that are assigned in the Syllabus. He will not mention a word about them until the last second & not give you the criteria for them until the day theyâ??re due.,0
Lots of assignments that seem like busy work more than anything. Took her months to give feedback. Her feedback was useless anyway. Never wanted to help students. She made herself very unapproachable to avoid doing more work then said had to. I would just avoid this teacher at all costs,0
"This instructor has only one volume when teaching, it's yelling.  There's a reason why her class is the last to fill up during registration..... Avoid taking her!",0
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS FOR CARIBBEAN BIODIVERSITY!!!!! Class grade only dependent on 3 exam grades out of 4 (1 is a cumulative final). The average grade for the last exam was a low D without the curve. He asks questions that are very specific about something he said during a lecture that he barely mentioned. Very unorganized way of teaching.,0
"reads straight from textbook for lectures, very monotonous",0
"He's an excellent educator and mentor. He clearly knows what he's talking about and he's passionate about it too, so it's hard to get bored or lose interest. He'll keep you busy but he's very empathetic towards college students and extremely approachable if you need anything. As long as you put forth an effort to do the work, you'll be fine.",1
Shes so nice doesnt explain that well but shes an awesome teacher and the class isnt that bad,1
"Get ready to teach yourself. She gets off topic ALOT and does NOT teach what will be on exams. The only hope you will have to pass is to go to SI sessions. The SI leader will teach more than Walling. She treats the class like kids, ex: congratulates us over knowing what H2O is and such. She is very nice, just not great at teaching.",0
"Professor Appel is truly one of the best teachers I have ever had. I took her Math course at ASU and she explained everything, took the time back to respond to students questions, was quick in replying to e-mails, and made me feel like I could succeed in Math. Her teaching style shows that she really cares about her students. Best Professor!",1
"He is a nice guy, but the class is impossible unless you are already a biology pro. He talks crazy fast and covers about 5 chapters each class. No assignments or anything in the grade book, just 4 really hard tests. He also doesn't give extra credit or round grades.",0
"For those who rated him low, they are just lazy! It's college, you will need to put effort to get a good grade. No teacher will hand it to you. He is a fantastic professor, and knows his material well. Take him if you're serious and not lazy. 10% extra credit if you do them all! I recommend him!",1
"RUN. Nice demeanor, however she is new to teaching. Requires odd-ball assignments no one has ever done or heard of. Does not really know what she is doing at times. WRITING INTENSIVE!! Group project/PowerPoint, textbook reading, 20+ pg *purchased* case studies, and Memos all expected all to be worked on at the same time.",0
Too much sass. Very disrespectful. she made one of her students cry. Shows no remorse. Speaks in 3rd person. worst accounting teacher  ever. look somewhere else or you will get the worst time of your life.,0
"Boring and stiffly well-mannered (not friendly). A teach-yourself class; lectures consisted of the captions of the pictures in the text, verbatim, nothing more. Lecture exams didn't always follow the text, so you couldn't fully prepare yourself since the only way to teach yourself was from the text. No help given during labs.",0
"Funny professor makes class interesting.  If you attend and do the online hw, theres no reason not to get a A.  Recommend taking the class",1
"Randy is the bomb as a sculpture teacher, inspires you to do your best. Is a very relaxed teacher that gives a few tests but not a ton. Randy gives you freedom to create your version of the projects and appreciates effort. Not everyone in the class is an ""artist"" or has the skill but he makes u feel u do.",1
"Easily the best math teacher I've ever had. HW is mostly for extra help if you need it, and the tests are pretty tough. All around a great instructor",1
"the worst class I've taken in college. Professor Lee was not only harsh but extremely critical and mean, and would publicly shame students in the classroom. The directions were VERY unclear, assignments were never given correct due dates and there was no feedback ever except for harsh criticism. This class interfered with my health & psyche",0
"Her tests are hard, but if you study the lab book a lot you'll get a good grade!",1
"extremely nice professor! Class was kind of confusing, but the online homework really helped. Study what is on that to help with the tests. Easy assignments as well. Very glad I took the class with her, easy A.",1
"His grading criteria feels random. A paper a week (yes, theyre short, but theyre so frequent!). If your paper is perfect hell nitpick it and find problems anyway. I spent more time on homework in this class than for my 4k level classes. Even though it wasnt hard it was tedious.",0
"I would definitely recommend Mrs. Hanratty. She is kind of hard, but not too demanding and is always willing to help. If you take her class seriously enough, you will do fine. She does not give too much homework, but she holds you to a high standard as every teacher should. Mrs. Hanratty is a very good English teacher.",1
"Bliss is so helpful and really strives to allow students to do well. I wouldnt use Skoolers, it honestly doesnt help much for this class. Just know how to do the homework and attend the study sessions and youll get an A!",1
"Fair grader, nice guy, but never bothered to learn my name. Kind of discouraging when the class is so small. ",1
"Confusing in lecture sometimes, but is a good overall professor and is helpful when you have questions. Attendance isn't mandatory but is helpful for exams.",1
Mr. Burt is the worst professor that I have ever taken. His tests are hard but would be doable if he actually taught in class. He gets half the example problems wrong during lecture then when students ask questions he tries to dodge them by answering something he actually knows how to do. Lab is bad because he does not know how to set up the lab.,0
He is by far the worst History teacher I have ever had. His grading scale makes no sense at all. He will grade your assignments on literature and grammatical errors instead of the history. I felt like I was in English 101. Never taking him again.,0
"She is the best bio teacher ever ! she is kind, forgiving, thoughtful, clear and you I never left her class feeling confused",1
"His lectures are not prepared and are just him rambling on. They are long boring and he does not stop to explain anything. Homework is assigned randomly (not on syllabus). The exams are hard, but he usually give pretty good hints about the types of questions on them. The 4 exams make up 80% of your grade. I hope I never have him as a prof again.",0
"Nice man and a great chemist, but I found his lectures to be all over the place. He rushes through examples so fast and skips mathematical steps, so if you plan on just learning from lecture and not reading the book... Good luck. A lot of out of class effort is required for this class, I found it harder than organic.",0
"Mr. S is a great lecturer, even as just a grad student. I have never heard of anybody having a problem with him personally, and I found him to be respectful and unbiased during class. Whoever wrote the review below is a complete and utter moron. It is sad that a person like that is able to gain admission to SLU.",1
PROS: 1.) automatic 50% for just turning in assignment. 2.) Automatic 100% for submitting completed assignment. 3.) Plenty extra credit! CONS: 1.) Little directions on how to do assignments 2.) Gives mostly busy work 3.) Portfolio worth 50% of grade 4.) Don't miss class for any reason,1
"Prof Roberts' class changed the way I think about the world. I'm not an Anthro major, but I've still found myself using the ideas from this class throughout college. Take it if you get the chance!",1
"This class is a really solid introduction to archaeology or anthropology overall. There are a lot of quizzes and readings, but if you don't read you don't lose points. The class isn't overly difficult, but you still definitely need to study for exams. The lectures are really interesting and the professor is pretty approachable. Overall a good class",1
"Littlejohn is a great professor. Those who tend to complain are typically students that put in minimal efforts and expect to be rewarded for simply showing up. If you take the time to participate and read the (actually) interesting course materials, she recognizes and appreciates it. She provides you with ALL the tools you need to be successful. A+",1
"Newhouse really cares about people's opinions. He will listen to you and appreciate everyone's perspective. Even if your class has nothing to do with indigenous people, get ready to learn about indigenous people. Its intertwined in everything he does. Sometimes his expectations are not 100% clear on assignments. His discussions in class are great.",1
HORRIBLE TEACHER. The worst I have ever had .,0
"Mrs. Calvert is a tough nut to crack. However, once you get past the first couple classes, she is great. She puts on a tough act in the beginning, but she is an excellent professor. She is very knowledgeable. She may seem like she isn't approachable, but she actually is. She is very helpful and willing to answer any question brought to her.",1
Awesome teacher! I took a lot from this class! Highly reccomend :),1
"My rating may seem harsh and to be truthful, I didn't fully mind the class, but there were some issues. For one, the syllabus schedule was out. We got off topic so much the schedule was no longer relevant. He can also come across as condescending. He makes it very clear when you are ""wrong"" with his mannerisms. Not what I expected out of this guy.",0
75% of the semester was her having us get in groups and Google the answers to topics ourselves. She doesn't use PowerPoint and talks way to fast and quietly. Hard to follow her and shows up late a lot but takes attendance.,0
"Dr. Vohs was a great professor.  He was very helpful when I needed him, and I thought he explained difficult concepts very well.",1
"Your grade is based on one exam, weekly quizzes, recitations, and homework. The professor flies through lecture slides, but lecture recordings are posted. She makes a lot of mistakes in class and can be rude to students. We had to fight for extra credit that was in the syllabus. If you have the option, you might want to choose someone else.",0
"This is the absolute most disrespectful person I have ever had to encounter. Extremely rude, unsympathetic, and name calls. Completely unprofessional, and you need to have some proof that you were tardy else she will mark you as unexcused absent causing your grade to be potentially affected. Avoid this professor at all costs.",0
"HORRIBLE TEACHER, SNARKY AND RUDE! Take anyone else. No textbook, she just posts crazy long articles that are longer than a chapter in a textbook would be. She hardly even taught the class, she just wants to have class discussions, and she doesn't even contribute, just says, ""ok"" to what people say! Really tough grader, thinks she teaches english",0
"Regret taking her pilates, very picky person. though she's dedicated it's way over the top, especially for something students are just taking as an extra curricular exercise. She comes off as rude. when I emailed her for clarification on an assignment, she told me to look at the syllabus even though I had and was the reason I had even emailed her",0
"had her 3 times would take again, ended the sem. with over 20 extra pionts to my final grade meaning that i could have failed the final and the midterm and still pulled an a. I spent all of 3 hours outside the class each sem. Got all A, and learned a lot of relevent info. She also knows a lot, so if you have any leagel questions shes got answers.",1
"LAURA BOTTOMLEY IS THE MOST HELPFUL, KIND, AND EDUCATED PROFESSOR IN ENGIEERING.  NCSU is extremely lucky to have her.  Gives the best guidance and advice.  SHOUT OUT TO DR. BOTTOMLEY, SHE DA REAL MVP!!!!",1
"I feel like all the good reviews on this website were written by her. She doesn't give guidelines on any of her assignments. She's a narcissist, she teaches very different from the book, the final will be hard. She grades groups based on who she likes. The group in my class that didn't finish the pres got an A. vs everybody else's C. Shes nuts!",0
"Proffesor Lovio is a pretty laid back teacher , class can get a little boring but its a good intro class and helps understand criminal justice his tests are open book and he has no hw also he only has 1 written assignment",1
"Overall, she knows her stuff.  You have to work for a good grade, but she's not a hard grader most of the time. Most of the weight rests on journals, and one of her exams is take-home. Reading is a must in her class, as is participation. Talk and do the assignments on time and you'll be fine (she even allows rewrites).",1
"Sara is so passionate about what she does and it's obvious. After taking her intro class, I changed my major to social work. As long as you come to class, do her extra credit assignments, and study for her tests then you'll do really well in her class. I would highly recommend taking anything from her.",1
This instructor gives out low grades.,0
"Nancy is not a consistent grader.  She picks out the tiniest mistake in a paper. She is not motivating. Does not provide you with examples or guide you in the right direction with assignments. You have to do things on your own, pretty much teach yourself the material. Not a very friendly, approachable professor.",0
Honestly the course is challenging but I love this professor. If you go to class and do most of the reading than  you should be fine. If you go to his office hours he is very helpful he will answer questions and even take the time to help u grasp the content wether it's with helping link my flash cards together with the time period and terms or just plain explaining it to me he was very helpful. Great teacher if u like a little challenge take him!,1
"No recorded or live lectures, basically teaching yourself the material. Have to watch a show (paid by student) and 1 season per week plus reading and then homework on the show and readings. Little to no engagement with students and assignments seem non-educational and unnecessary. Grading is late & professor is unorganized.",0
"Sheri is an exceptionally kind and intelligent teacher. She really cares about her students and wants them to succeed. She makes sure her tests are fair and goes the extra mile to make sure everyone understands the material. The class was good to go to, even though the material is inherently dry. Easy A if you're determined and decently intelligent",1
"The professor used the class as an extension of his ego, funneling all talk through himself, using half of each class to pontificate, and belittling anyone who did not agree with him. He is easy, but nothing is worth spending time with such a character. Learned next to nothing. Very poor professor. Do not take him.",0
"Tests are very tricky.  I thought I did really well on the final until I saw I got a C because he recycles old midterm problems, but slightly changes the wording so don't expect it to be the same answer. My advice would be to write out all of your homework and save it when studying for tests. He replaced our lowest midterm with our final exam grade",0
Professor Nadri was an excellent professor who incorporated films and handouts into his course to help retain what was read in the textbook. He was enthusiastic and his papers were fairly easy to accomplish.,1
"Professor Carson was one of the greatest professors I have ever had. He was so caring and helpful. Rather than going straight into talking about school, he made sure to take time to check on each student and even remembered things they told him from days before. He is so kind! Very easy grader but also a great teacher. Looked forward to this class.",1
I took Garrigan for psych101 and I loved this class. All the information was there from power points and notes. There are no tricks on the quizzes. If you study the material it is easy. Lectures are interesting. Not boring at all. I would most definitely take him again. Getting up early for his class is not a problem. ,1
"DON'T BUY THE TEXTBOOK. SAVE YOURSELF THE MONEY.  She gives her lectures based on her own notes. Keep your notes organized and you will be fine. Smart woman, she knows what she's teaching. She uses her own PowerPoints, shares her personal stories that relate to the topic, and she presents us beautiful quotes here and there. Great 3 hour class. ",1
"Great professor, very helpful. Take home final, 2 critiques and a proposal. Everything on the final should be in your notes. If you listen and take good notes you will be fine, i got an A.",1
"Worst professor I have ever taken. Contradicts most of what he says which makes writing any essay hard when you don't know exactly what he wants you to do. Always finds something to nitpick on, downgrades just because he doesn't like the way you worded something, even though your way isn't wrong.",0
He's my favorite professor and my role model; my goal while at Bradley is to learn as much as I possibly can from him. Expert at technical animation. Lots of wisdom to impart. I plan to take Independent Study with him multiple times. Talk to him outside of class! His teaching is slow but I don't mind. Very understanding with assignment due dates.,1
Space shot!!! Never heard a professor talk about twearking before until now. Easy class. VERY easily sidetracked. Easy assignments.,0
Professor Katner's lectures in class are very fun and she spends a lot of time explaining more difficult material. I highly recommend attending lectures as often as possible. You will get participation points from clicker questions and learn a whole lot! There are two major exams that make up the majority of your grade. Find a study buddy!,1
"Professor Blake is a real asset to Northern Virginia Community College. A man with great advice not just on Spanish, but academics in general and will always offer support if you decide to seek it on your part, I haven't had a better teacher at this campus. Be prepared to take notes and be active/pay attention in lecture.",1
Prof Calkins is a super sweet lady and loves her students. You can easily get an A in this class if you are willing to do the work. LOTS & LOTS OF ASSIGNMENTS! DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU ARE LAZY! That being said most of the work is easy and straightforward. The class is 1 day a week so attendance is mandatory. You need to be self motivated.,1
"I had his class, and its a lot of work for just one class. Constantly have to be on top of the syllabus or you can easily fail. Not a teacher I would recommend. Attendance is so strict, and grading can be harsh.",0
Really enjoyed the class. Great Professor,1
She give you a easy a,1
"Some people shouldn't be able to be professors. She is a lovely woman, awful prof. Everything is confusing and disorganized. Unclear what she expects and marks very unfair. She doesn't actually teach anything in class, spends 40 minutes talking about issues in the world. Just not a good prof, take someone else.",0
"He is extremely lecture heavy. However, hes just reading from slides that arent even his! When he goes off script, he just confuses the class. He knows what the topic is but hes not good at articulating anything. It feels like hes still stuck in 1972. Theres no curve too and he LOVES saying it too. Avoid him. Hes not mean just a bad professor",0
"She explains the rules real well and writes the elements on the board. She grades based on your ability to analyze rather than rule parrot. She also passes out lots of helpful materials.  However, I think we should get a refund on the books because she required the revised edition, but used the old one.  Great class. Corner seat best.",1
"She's a good professor, who really cares. I learned a lot in her class. She is very knowledgeable in the law field.  I found her to be reasonable and fair.  The workload is challenging. I would love to take another class with her.",1
Lectures are boring and will put you to sleep but you'll need the attendance points. Don't buy the book just take pictures of the pages needed for hw. His study guide is ok however it only covered about half of the exam. The average grades for his exams are in the high 80s. This class is an easy B but you'll have to work hard for an A.,1
"A good professor, sometimes difficult to understand, and tests were extremely difficult.  Luckily, he had practice tests in the library that were modeled off of his actual tests.  I did learn a lot from his class though.",1
"I'm taking his class now. He is a great instructor. You can tell he knows what he's talking about. He's very enthusiastic about the subject. He makes silly, cheesy jokes which I find absolutely hilarious. I have to stop my self from bursting up laughing. If you show up for lectures & study, it's an easy A. His notes prepare you quite well for tests",1
"I never went to a single lecture but his notes explain the programming concepts really well and in a concise manner, only had to refer to the official documentation a handful of times. Too bad he wouldn't let us use more advanced programming concepts not taught to us on the final but it was still easy. Otherwise he's a pretty good professor.",1
"Mrs. Jackson's class will change your life. She is easy to talk to and exceptionally willing to help you and will make you feel at home. Some classes were a little like group therapy, and she gives you tools to lead a happier, more mindful life. I was nervous about taking this class, but it has had a huge impact on my life, and I'm glad I took it.",1
Lesley is great. shes super helpful and really talented!! i had her as my lab instuctor for photo 001 and i took her 49A field studies class. she is the best! i recommend her fer sure!!!,1
"Mr. Brooks was not my favorite, he was very monotoned so when you are in class it is very hard to stay focused. When working from home/online he is very short and not helpful in the slightest. Once working from home he would assign tests but not announce to you that you had an assignment. they were hidden in folders and not made known to students.",0
"Very unfair professor. On a major paper, he had no criticism of my content but graded me down for not using a specific format he apparently liked. When I pointed out that he had never told us anything about using a particular format, he shrugged but still wouldn't change my grade. Ouch!",0
Awesome and very Professional! I am able to use everything he taught me.  He keeps it real and exciting! I would love to work with him the field.,1
Lab reports are impossible. If you miss a lab or are late you are screwed. Five minutes after lab starts she wont let you turn anything in. She enjoys taking points of of everything. If you have an option do not take this professor.,0
"Dr. Fetter is my favorite professor in the Butler MBA program thus far.  It is extremely evident that he genuinely cares about his students.  He tries to lighten up dry classes (such as stats) with humor.  He is clear, concise, do what he says to do and you'll earn an easy A.  He makes himself available to you when you need help.  A++",1
"This course was useless. The only useful thing I learned was how to write grant applications. Dean was a boring professor who only talked about his area of expertise.... FORESTRY! He has a lot of experience working abroad in natural resource development, but is not interesting at all.",0
"BEST MATH TEACHER EVER! ignore whatever you have heard about her, I promise she is the best. She knows exactly what she is doing. A lot of homework and quizzes and tests, but it is all worth it. The quizzes come from the homework and the tests come from the quizzes. DO YOUR HOMEWORK. She is an angel though. She wants all of her students to succeed",1
"Patient, knowledgeable and accessible. Pushes you to do one step more than you thought you could do. Good at bringing out people's talent. Excellent teacher. Professional at what he teaches as well.",1
"unclear policies and grading methods, failure to hold attention of class, misdirects TA's to lower grades of students",0
"As a response to the earlier comment about Tim ""talking down to students"": The only reason he has to do this is because he is on a completely different level from any of his students. Dr. Goodwin is so incredibly smart that it's hard for him to talk with us like he talks to colleagues, to he actually has to dumb it down.",1
Easy A if you do your weekly online quiz and short reflection. One project and it is a super easy A on the assignment. Should definitely take this class for an easy A. Make sure you check to see if there is an activity to see whether you NEED to go to class.,1
She is the best Biology teacher I ever had.  You study and you will pass.  I learned so much in her class.  Ms. Smith is always available for questions.    I wish she taught Bio 252-254!!!,1
"The only reason I am doing well in this class is because I took anatomy last quarter and because I've taken genetics with Dr. Kageyama before, so I know what to expect on his tests. If you are NOT a science major, save yourself the stress and don't take this class as a GE. It is so heavily in depth into neuroscience that you will be overwhelmed.",1
HE's awesome!,1
"Kate is knowledgeable, wise, caring and commands respect. Her class isn't easy; she pushes you to become a better teacher and sometimes that means stepping out of your comfort zone. But she guides you through every obstacle and is always happy to help. I am so grateful for her mentorship and guidance and I hope to one day teach like her.",1
"A very caring and happy professor. Puts real value on the grades his students get and their well-being. If you don't get a good grade the first time on a paper, he'll sometimes let you submit revisions. Class participation matters a lot, he takes note if you come in late too much or obviously didn't read.",1
Easy A. Enough said.,1
"Professor Liu is an extremely tough grader. The reading assignments are  long and difficult to understand at times, but this class really broadens your knowledge on the complexities of restoration ecology. The tests are much harder than they need to be, extremely specific. Overall, not terrible, but she makes you work for your grade. ",0
The guy really knows what he is talking about and knows a lot about what's going on in todays politics and economy. Your grade is only made up of tests and he gives you an old test to study from which is similar to the real test. If you don't have the notes from class you won't get an A. Not structured very well but gives interesting lectures.,1
"What a boring and horrible professor. He just stands there behind the podium using powerpoint. While not a philosophy major, I need a good background in this stuff for my further studies, but this guy basically made me HATE philosophy. He attempted it cram way too much complicated material in one semester. might be nice, but he stinks as a teachers",0
"The course was very interesting and made more interesting through the professor. Normal online class things, discussion board, reply to others and make sure you do your readings.",1
"Just reads from the text book, there is no outside of teaching except for him to talk about his political views and finance world. The class is Federal/State Taxation which is not being taught what so ever! AWFUL TEACHER, BEWARE",0
"This class was great, I had it MWF so it wasn't too bad, class often flew by. Dr. Kendris is great, if you need help don't be afraid to visit his office hours, he's very helpful and will work with you to make sure you understand what's going on.",1
Peter Daley has become one of my favorite teachers.  He has a fun and interesting class.  There are 4 tests and the last test is your final.  the homework is related to exactly what he says in class.,1
"This professor literally reads off of his powerpoint and does not teach or explain anything in any way. By far worst professor I have ever and I highly recommend that anyone taking him to get out immediately and switch classes. Otherwise, you will be spoken to like an imbecile and will be teaching yourselves throughout the entire semester.",0
"Phil is my favorite USC professor. He really cares about his students, and makes the lectures relevant to real life. His lectures are really entertaining, and he's funny. He gives weekly quizzes, but if you review the notes from the week you will be fine. DO NOT buy the textbook, he tells you to return it if you do. No exams, one final paper.",1
"Professor Law is a sweet and caring instructor. He makes his class easy and understandable for everyone. Even though attendance is not mandatory, please show up and give him the respect he deserves. He puts in a lot of effort for his lectures, but it is sad to say that most people take advantage of him by not showing up.",1
"Lovely lady. Nice, patient - no complaints. If you are falling behind - send email - keep her informed and you'll be fine. As for course content - all sections teach same material - she may have input, but she and others teach what is decided by chair and others. Take her! you wont regret it...",1
"she was a really hard grader and often confusing. never clearly explained the assignments and if you asked questions she never gave a clear answer. crazy work load too, my other classes suffered as i tried to keep up and she takes points off your assignments for no reason and no explanation",0
"Bio 101 is like taking Bio 435, expects you to know all of the information. Tests are 50 multiple choice questions and 50 points for short answer. Doesn't give any partial credit, basically you have to know the information which he makes it impossible. Cool guy just makes class difficult and stressful! Exams are 50% of your grade. Pass of Fail! ",0
rude. rude. rude. he gives 10 point quizzes every week that make no sense. he's awful and miserable. do not recommend. I thought it was easy and I paid a lot of attention.. wrong. don't bother buying textbook. ,0
Im not happy at Elizabeth's grading  It was an easy A but I felt that she barely skimmed our papers and didnt give any feedback at all    I felt that this class was a waste of time and i didnt improve my writing I would rather have had a harder professor but it helped my gpa so i cant complain,0
"I took this class as a GPA booster and boy was I wrong. For the midterms, Mary gave us the format and told us to review the 16+ lecture slides. Too much information and I didn't know what to focus on so it was hard to study for the exam as it was too broad. The info was also all mixed up and hard to follow :(",0
"Ferguson is a typical old fashioned and opinionated professor, and he is definitely a character. I found the class and content interesting, and his personality contributed to that.",1
"I personally loved taking his class. Although the tests were pretty difficult, he curved them in order to keep everyone's grades up. The quizzes were easy and used to boost grades as long as you show up to class. I learned more from his class than most classes because he challenged us and actually made us work for the grade we wanted, surprise!!",1
"I loved his class! He is a great professor and really knows his stuff! I learned so much in his class, especially grammar, which he is huge on! He gives a lot of assignments but they are all designed to help you learn the material. There are also tons of extra credit opportunities.",1
Best Art Teacher. Brilliant and Caring.,1
Okay teacher. Has a very monotone voice that can put you to sleep. Sometimes takes attendance,1
i never showed up cause his lectures were boring and i couldn't keep my eyes open. So i would procrastinate and i still pulled an A in the class cause he has a policy where he drops all of ur lowest grades if you score high on the final. Would recommend 10/10,1
I LOVE PROFESSOR CARINA!!! she's soo awesome she lets you be yourself all the time even in your essays. She only gives short assignments every week and gives some reading that ARE NOT BORING! and she gave a short report by the end of the semester and THAT' IT! participate and be yourself and do small work and that's it. She's really funny + awesome,1
"Excellent teacher.  Not a breeze, but not too difficult if you put forth effort.  Great class.  Limited homework.",1
"An absolute gem. She gives you all the information you may need and much that is explanatory for further questioning. She lectures but is very interactive. She checks in with students, makes jokes, and gives you more than enough time to do the little assignments she requires.",1
"In order to do the assignments, you need to first buy the text book. I didn't buy the text book in the beginning so I wasn't able to do any assignment and received bunch of 0s. This class is a self teach class because all of the stuff we learn is just reading text book. I don't understand why I pay all this money to just learn from the text book.",0
"BUAD 205 is not a difficult class. Attendance is taken for a grade, so by just showing up everyday you can earn 100 points (600 total points in the course). Dr. Ranft is a friendly guy and does an excellent job guiding discussion. ",1
"I cannot stress how horrible this professor is. He will leave you hopeless and confused. Even with the copious amounts of tutoring I attended nothing could have prepared me for those horrid exams. Save your money, save your time, and save your enthusiasm for an actual professor. Avoid at all costs, even delay your graduation. Its worth it.",0
He díd a great job.  I really learned a lot in his course.,1
He was an awesome teacher. He gives you the exam questions beforehand and if you read the material he puts on BB and go to class you should be able to get As or Bs on the exams. If you miss any class though he deducts points but gives you extra credit opportunities. Definitely one of the best classes I've taken!,1
"She is amazing.  Always available whether by email or in her office and always helps.  She is very understanding and down to earth.  Doesn't even like being referred to as doctor.  Young, funny, very intelligent and helpful.",1
"Your entire grade is based on midterm and final tests (aside from research credit), and tests are almost all based on textbook readings. You can get by in the course by never going to class and reading the textbook. When I did go to class, he was very knowledgable and well-versed on the content. Lectures did not help me do better on midterms.",1
I took her class online and she would not help. I advise you to NOT take this class online unless you really know accounting.,0
"Professor Hug is by far my favorite science professor I've had in the past 3 years. She made the material very straight forward and provided us with helpful analogies. Go to class even though it's not mandatory, sometimes there are extra credit assignments!",1
"Decent professor. Her workload is not the easiest, but its reasonable. Shes a tough grader, but her expectations are clear and youll be fine as long as you meet them. She also offers a good amount of extra credit if you fall into a hole. Some of her homework can get a little left-wing, but for the most part its not excessive.",1
"Pretty easy class! 3 assignments and 2 tests and by the end of it you have yourself a working website! The assignments have video tutorials so all you gotta do is follow them and you'll be fine. For the tests, I just used quizlet and also merged all the powerpoints together and just control f searched everything and made A's on both exams :)",1
"If you don't get him for corp 1 you are making a huge mistake. Best prof. I have had at CU. He wants you to succeed, you will learn invaluable information from this man. Plus he's funny",1
"Maybe for the English language courses she's worth it, but not for any Spanish language courses. This woman can not even pronounce certain spanish words incorrectly. She needs to stick to political feminist college classes in english rather than intelligent spanish classes.",0
"Your grade is based on 4 exams alone, doesn't collect homework, give extra credit, or even collect or grade quiz's. There's no room for improvement if you do not do well on all of the exams. He doesn't use MyAccountingLab online but it is there for reference, more than half the students in the class aren't aware of it and neither is he. ",0
"Very clear with his expectations. Must go to class in order to get clickers. Sit towards front for chances for extra credit. Takes breaks in lecture to let you relax. One test is dropped which is great. Doing the reading really helps. Great professor. If you really want to LEARN econ, this is the professor for you.",1
never take him stay away.  useless professor.,0
"This was not a beginner's course; there were concepts taught that required some background in music. But the big kicker was that if you asked the professor for clarification, he would just reiterate or have you refer to the syllabus/course notes. His responses were just short of condescending. I wouldn't recommend this professor to any student.",0
awful...seems nice in class but not helpful at all! NEVER responded to emails regarding my grade on a test. tests were so random and you had no idea what would be on there..awful!,0
"The class was exhausting for me. It's very difficult not only to keep up but also to understand what he is saying even if you were at the whole lecture. The exams are the type that have a crazy curve because they are so difficult. On multiple questions, I wasn't sure where to start yet still seemed to preserver. Never again though!!!",0
Awesome!!,1
"Very passionate professor.  I really enjoyed this course... Take notes, read and you will pass the course.  One of the best professors that I ever had!!! ",1
"she's a nice prof that knows her stuff. her teaching style really let's you learn the material. don't come in expecting to not take the class seriously, but she'll always help you if you need it. tough but fair grader. those that think she's bad just don't read and complain.",1
he is very fun and understanding im definitely going to take another one of his classes,1
"This is the most failed class in the Education department here. Her tests are 100 questions and after the first test she will sit down and say ""now you see you can't study for my test you just have to know it."" I believe she said she was retiring this year though so good luck!",0
The best professor I have had so far. Keeps it interesting. Cares deeply for students and always replies to emails promptly. He is hilarious and understanding. Overall great man. Take his class!,1
"He makes you work ridiculously hard for an A, and all of the comments he writes are 100% illegible. I went to his office hours and he could not even read the comments he wrote on my paper. He also gave me a B on a paper because he thought I used an incomplete sentence and then he realized I didn't but  didn't change my grade. He's a nice enough guy",0
He was nice in person but would roast me on my essays and never actually told me what I did wrong,0
Great professor! Even though the project s are a lot harder than the midterm and final.,1
This class is not terrible but his teaching style is so dry I have to drink a large coffee to stay awake most days. I recommend taking the online course but overall it is an easy A as long as you do well on the exams,0
"Great facilitator... makes you think.  Very fair.  Entertaining, funny, witty, and knowledgeable",1
"Truthfully, I don't know how she has a rating of 4.2 here. I work exceptionally hard on every one of her assignments and it's basically impossible to get an A. she gives grades like 9/10 and 15/16, even when you follow the rubric exactly. She says ""great! but what more can you add?"" If you need this course to get your GPA up, find someone else.",0
"It really seemed like This professor just picked up this class in her spare time, but didn't really care about it. She showed up to our lab section once the whole semester, and for about half of the lectures she brought in guest speakers. The homework was inconsistent and seemed arbitrarily selected.",0
"This is my last semester with Professor Bertens and I hope I can find someone as clear and helpful as him. Two homeworks a week and a quiz every other week. His instructional videos is very helpful, he will teach you helpful ways that would make sense.",1
Prof Hofreiter was one of the best professors I have had so far. She's caring and understanding but she's honest and blunt. She doesn't give a lot of homework but if you do it all she notices. She just has 3 main papers and she gives a straight forward promt. she also makes sure you have feedback and learn from it. oh and she's halarious,1
awful teacher. would never take this class again,0
"If you're not already good at sight reading while singing, you're in for a hard time. I was sick for my final and she failed me without letting me re-do it when I was better. She's super harsh with how she grades your singing, even though not all of us are choir people. And even choir people had a hard time. I cried after this class.",1
"Betsy is literally the most down-to-earth person out there. She lets you choose which questions to answer on the test and sneaks in extra credit when she can. I personally didn't find the lectures interesting, but it depends on what your interests are! Take her if you can!",1
This professor is a terrible example of what college will be like.  She doesn't tell her students when assignments are due(and they aren't on the syllabus)and then blames them when work isn't done. She also favors certain students and gives them extra cred for running coffee to her. Complaints have been made on her evaluations but PHSC does nothing,0
"This was one of the hardest classes I've ever taken.  Bailey is extremely knowledgable but does not communicate the information well.  Chemistry is hard no matter what, but I got very little help in class.  I had to go to the science lab, and even had to hire a tutor to get a c in the class.  I was thrilled with the c too!",0
Did not seem to show much enthusiasm in teaching her class and gives large amounts of homework with out properly explaining the lessons clearly.,0
A good teacher. In class group assignments that are easy 100s but the assignments make u attend class. Notes come from powerpoint and she gives u a studyguide a few days before the test. Take notes and study and read the book enough and it will be an easy A or B.,1
Arnold is obviously very enthusiastic about science. But the class... boring and a waste of time. I would have ditched if attendance wasn't mandatory. The 10-day unit plan we had to create - a burden that I won't ever look at again. The whole unit assignment needs to be revamped somehow.,0
Took a class on social movements with her and had a great experience over all. Each class was based around discussions about assigned readings along with two weekly reading logs. There are multiple 4-7 page papers leading up to a final project but you are given ample time to complete it. Maria is awesome so as long as you do the work you will pass.,1
Dr. Chalk made a difficult class very interesting!,1
Andrea is an ideal perfect professor she gives great feedback and wants to see success in her student body. She puts in extra hours all the time and gives plenty of options if you need to make up for a missed class however don't make them up you won't pass which you wouldn't deserve to this is COLLEGE! Loved her she's funny and very smart! :),1
"Melissa's the absolute best. I was in her first class at Mizzou, I took her 2880 class too, and I'd have taken her 4880 if it was offered at the time. She's so kind and chill and clear and she's not a hard grader. Her class is 2 1/2 hours and it's a joy. Also yeah, you'll totally fall in love with her.",1
"A very heavy course, but taking it with Dr Rogers makes it a lot more bearable. She is extremely passionate about the subject, and makes it hard for you to not be at least a little interested in it. Even for someone like me who went into the class dreading chemistry.",1
"My previous review was deleted, but I still stand by my opinion that she is unclear with directions. I got an A, but her rambling instructions were frustrating. Also we didn't have the benefit of receiving graded work before submitting another report. Still, you can rack up pts on quizzes + exams, so at least that was objective.",0
Not helpful at all! She expects the students to know everything! Don't take her class!,0
"Parkhurst is an amazing professor!!! Very caring. His lectures are easy to understand and are intriguing. He seems to genuinely love what he does. Make sure you read!!! If you dont, I promise you he knows. DO NOT SHOW UP LATE. He will lock the doors and not let you in if you do.",1
"Dr. Galileo is truly passionate about teaching and his research. This class is a lot of material and there is no curve either. However, if you memorize the slides, you should be able to receive an A. He is a really talented professor! Take this class :)",0
"I have taken Ms. Bentley a couple times. I enjoy her lectures and the assignments are not too difficult, but they do take time to complete. Although there is a textbook requirement for her class, I did not open it once, I wouldn't recommend purchasing it unless you feel 100% it would benefit you. Attendance matters! She is very professional.",1
"I had already taken Chem before and I skipped Chem151 to take this class. His lectures are EXTREMELY dull, and I spent most of the time taking my own notes on the exact lecture he was lecturing on for 3.5 hours. Exams were easy for me, but any questions I had were not answered well, and it seemed like he never understood how to answer a simple one.",1
"Yes she's a good teacher and Yes she's very welled prepared, but for some reason her teaching method didn't work with me or other class mates in my class. She teaches the longer way of a problem. And in one calss period she goes through 2 chapters of the book and never repeats it. I had trouble understanding her concept.",1
"Don't listen to what anybody says about this class being ""difficult"", you basically need to show up, hit a clicker button in the beginning, and at the end for attendance. You can miss like 4 lectures, and the ""papers"" are 1 double spaced pages a week on easy stuff. a 75% is an A in the class, and you truly have to try to not get an A",1
Dr. Hoffman is THE BEST!! Don't even think about taking anyone but him. He is more than fair in regards to what he expects you to take away from his lectures. He is extremely engaging and really tries to make everything understandable and fun. He also has office hours after class which are helpful. I LOVED this class and wish I could take it again.,1
Simply a great professor,1
U will be shocked of his TOO complicated & unorganized syllabus! he says it is 3 short writing assignments short means(2500-3000 words)also u need to do a project with many requirements. U need to write one analysis paper (MC) as HW every week. he let u do Lots of reading then he never talk about what u read. u will be confused of what he wants.,0
"At first I thought she was mean and honestly kind of scary, but after awhile you warm up to her. She is a hard teacher, but one of the better ones I have had. She really lets you experiment with your writing, which made the class really fun for me. Overall I had a really good time in the class!",1
"Monica Hall is an amazing professor!  She is very clear when explaining different topics.  BIO 121 is a very difficult class, but she makes the material make sense.",1
He makes you feel very dumb no matter your question or concern. His test are about 15% of what he goes over in class. Talks about everything that isn't on the tests. He spends more time on the 'unimportant' things. He wants you to devote ur life to the class. With him its more of a self taught class and A&P is defiantly not the class for that.,0
"He gives the worst grades ever. He lectured on A thing and mark you down for doing literally the exact same thing. He's good I give him that but doesn't allow him to be rude when giving comments. His instructions are unclear and his requirements are just too much. He's asking for too many things, even if you're doing everything asynchronously.",0
"Professor McFaul sincerely cares about the success of his students. It was the hardest class Ive ever taken but its a good experience! The class doesnt get really hard til week 12 when you do your first essay but its doable, DO NOT PROCRASTINATE these essays take several days to write! My opinion is that you wont find a better 1C prof than him",1
"Very, very helpful. Always has time for questions.",1
"WORST PROFESSOR IVE HAD AT DAVIS. Im a math major. Temple is not a good teacher. He may be good at his research, but he is deplorable at teaching. Look at all the other reviews. I cannot think of one thing I like about his class. No textbook, no homework, no feedback, no communication, no planning. Only take him if you are an effective self-teacher",0
"He is extremely passionate about what he is teaching, which makes you more excited to be there. Sometimes hard to follow, due to amount of material covered in each class. Assigns LOTS of readings each night, but do the readings! Things will make more sense in class and he gives pop quizzes.",1
So hard to understand her. Lecture's don't make sense. She attempts to be humorous but fails. Half the people in the class could care less of what is going on. During a class discussion she wouldn't let us talk about our views and would always try to correct us.,0
Terrible,0
"He is not very good at speaking/lecturing, but his tests are really hard and not straight forward.",0
"FUNNIEST BLACK TEACHER EVER! She comes off as strong at first but just respect her, WRITE EVERYTHING DOWN shes extremly clear, and REALLY helps students to understand! I recieved a C in this class due to her grace upon me. Im so thankful i took her. WORK YOUR HARDEST, and she'll work hard for you(ie. extra credit/retests/notes4quizzes) No MyMathLab",1
"GREAT teacher by far my favorite! Really helpful and understanding. Makes jokes in class, he is one cool dude",1
"Majority of the class was failing the entire semester. More than half the class dropped. Not a bad person, but clearly needs to work on establishing clear criteria and realistic expectations given the course level and needs to effectively communicate what they want from the class.",0
Prof. Lane helped me succeed. It isnt a good idea to Miss classes as all the notes will matter. Every thing he warned us about was on our Exams. Go to office hours if youre struggling. The patience he has to teach is priceless.,1
"Very fun!!!  If you ever get a chance to take his classes, do it.  And if you ever have the opportunity to see him in any of the schools theatrical productions, go to it!  He is a very talented person and wonderful prof that I would recommend to anyone.  He is very helpful and knowledgeable.",1
"Hard class, but prof. Strange made it worthwhile. He's humorous and tells stories that are entertaining, yet sometimes have nothing to do with the lecture. He is very well informed on what he teaches and is passionate about teaching it. Only take three tests, but a good amount of extra credit will save your grade if you attend class.",1
"Profesora Norton De Evans is a great Spanish professor. She is helpful, clear, and articulate with what she expects in the class. I would definitely take her class again.",1
Awesome professor. Class is super manageable if you are willing to do the work weekly. Always accessible by email or phone call!!,1
"He cares about your success and wants you to pass his class. HW is not too bad; maybe 3 to 5 problems a week. The homework is very helpful; it is similar to the quizzes and exam questions. We usually do a 1 ? quiz a week and he drops at least 1 quiz. Lecture is very interactive. 3 exams, similar to hw and in-class problems. I recommend taking him!",1
There's a lot of group discussion for an online class. First time in an online class I felt like I got to know the other students. That's good if you had a great group like my class was. I can see where it could be bad with a worse group though. Textbook is not necessary.,1
"Scott is a good guy, and a great professor.",1
"Knows his stuff, but is a very poor lecturer for intro. Takes a very long time to say very little.  The bulk of his slides are of very little value and does not explain complicated concepts very well.",0
"professor rombo is a very nice lady but honestly a horrible professor. she is very smart, but goes off topic in class and ends up lecturing about god knows what. her tests are kinda easy even if you don't study (if you're fine with a mid 70 - low 80 grade), but shes a super tough grader when it comes to projects and assignments.",0
"Often rude and unapproachable in class.  Ask a question and the answer usually be of a condescending nature.  Does not seem to want to be teaching. On the contrary, visit him in his office and he's very helpful and amicable, takes time to clarify what you need.  The text wasn't mandatory, but thats where I learned most of what I needed.",0
This was by far the worst class I have taken Its her way or the highway Super tough grader she has a certain way she wants you to do everything She uses weird formulas that are hard to find outside of class if you try doing a problem with the book it uses a different formula If you dont use the specific formula she wants she docks points for it,0
"Horrible professor. Might as well be an online course since the only learning done is through youtube. Lecture isn't worth attending, since all he does is grunt and mumble in lecture. Take literally anybody else but Kelm for any calc class he is eligible to teach. And this is coming from someone with 2 years of calc experience.",0
"He is the best teacher that I have ever had. He is a tough grader and will make you work for your grade. However, the class is worth it. I do warn that you will have to write essays and he is a tough grader. There are only take home exams which are easy.",1
"i know im not the best at chemistry, but Dr. Bushey was very rude even when it not intentional, writes everything on his screen so its very messy and hard to read, an tests and quizzes are very difficult",0
Dr. Squire's Hardware Course is pretty simple and straight forward. He does everything he can to help you pass the course.,1
"Every time I emailed her, she would take forever and then answer with not helpful information. Literally reads over the power-points and doesnt explain much. Youre pretty much on your own unless you study with a group.",0
"The homework, you will need to fix his spelling errors. Whilst the homework assigned is long, the homework is easy. However you may completely understand the topics being tested yet be cruelly graded.(the general layout of class is efficient and he gives great lectures) No response ->emails, takes too long to open Dropbox too",0
"The class is disorganized, assignments changed at the last minute.  Lectures aren't mandatory, but they are minimal at best.  Expect to write at least 6 papers, no tests.      If you expect an organized class that follows the syllabus this class isn't for you.  I would not recommend this class.",0
Had this class online. Professor Bazil does not communicate much and this caused problems sometimes. You watch his lecture videos for a certain module and then take a short quiz. There are 4 papers throughout the class. The online setup could have been better. Easy A though.,0
"Failed to stick to syllabus/course outline. Never did any assignments in this class. Met in groups and talked about the same thing every day. Often made class awkward. She wanted so badly for people to talk and share their opinions, but of course no one would since she always belittles you. Very unorganized!! Disrespectful to students also.",0
"This guy is awesome, he cracks me up every class.  He's got a weird sense of humor, and a great attitude.  Always willing to help and you can tell he really wants everyone to do well in his class.  Average about one homework assignment a week, only take you about 2 hours max.  Gives random in class extra credit so be there!  Highly recommend him!",1
"He would be better as a guidance counselor then anything. He was willing to help students on rewrites if they didn't do a good job on their paper. However, he was very strict on grading. He talked a lot, and the class was a very bad experience. My recommendation is to NOT take the class from him, unless you are a history buff like him.",0
"This teacher needs to get a clue. I don't know if anybody passed this class with higher than a C.  I don't if she is trying to prove herself, but I seriously didn't learn anything because of her lack of teaching skills.  Essays questions don't make students learn, good teachers make them learn and this teacher doesn't make that mark. DON'T TAKE HER",0
I had him in the early 1990s and Hofstra was fortunate to have him.  Published a book every 9 months and had a national reputation in business history.  An outstanding model....,1
"Dr. Fontenot is a brilliant man.  However, he's incredibly intolerant when it comes to others' opinions and monopolizes the class discussions.  I don't recommend him, but if you must take him, just try to keep your mouth shut and do what he says.",0
I really enjoyed this class! If you read you will get a good grade!,0
He was always glad to answer questions after class and course requirements and expectations were clearly defined.,1
"She doesn't care about individuals. if you ask for help she tells you to go look it up or says ""I've already told you how to do it"". She isn't helpful at all inside or outside the class room.",0
"It is a very interesting course and Professor Robert's is very knowledge on the subject. She is also a great lecturer. The material it itself was very dense and theoretical. I would advise against taking this course during a rough semester, particularly to all those that are Pre-Med. She assigns a lot writing and tons of readings.",1
If I had the chance to go back and tell myself not to take this course I absolutely would. She is the worst possible teacher you could get at this school. All students fail her exams and she gives no help because even she doesnt understand the material. Cant even answer questions in office hours because you are expected to know it already,0
"She is a wonderful professor. I wish I had her for all my classes because she really does explain the material very well. She could be better at grading faster this semester but considering the situation, she gave much more than most of my professors. Her leniency in accepting late work this semester gave me the courage to continue with class.",1
"He has no time for the class, too busy with his day job! Does not grade labs, you have lab exams instead and he is not good about explaining how they work. Never know your grade because he takes forever to return exam grades.",0
"He is a very boring professor, he asks trick questions on the tests, he brags about people getting low grades on his tests, he makes study guides that have nothing to do with whats on the tests, theres little to no extra credit in this class, and he doesnt round up grades at the end of the semester",0
Talks really fast and is hard to understand at times. Simple class though. Lots of online homework.,0
"After reading other reviews on Professor DeLuna, I decided to take GOVT 2306 during the summer as a 5-week class online. This class was honestly a joke! Only 1 quiz each week (roughly 50-75 questions) and all of the answers are on quizlet. I didn't even bother buying the textbook and I was just fine.",1
"If you show up on the every class, read the textbook, and do the assignments, you will get A.",1
"Dr. K is amazing! I loved her class so much! Lots of reading/writing, but that's to be expected for an english class. She truly cares about her students and wants them to succeed. She does give out reading quizzes, but they're not difficult if you've read the material. I wish more professors were like her!",1
"Very Very Very, I mean EXTREMELY picky. Nitpicks through anything and everything. The feedback given is good but very petty. She does not know how to use Word to format anything properly but gets mad when you reformat her poorly formatted outline templates.",0
bad teacher,0
The BEST teacher at Saint Louis University in the theology department. He has a none biasist way of teaching and is open to ALL points of view. No matter what they are. Take him!,1
"I had Dr. Lim for both Thermo 1 & Thermo 2 and he is by far one of my favorite professors. He provides written notes for all of his lectures and they are EXTREMELY thorough, even including some example problems. His tests are not that difficult if you know how to do the homework problems and the example problems in the notes.",1
"Dr. Yamazaki is a very knowledgeable teacher and knows the information she is teaching. Occasionally she has a hard time putting the information into understandable terminology instead of bio/physio jargon. She will help her students as much as she can, but you need to put in the work and asks questions if you have them",1
"She is such a terrible teacher. First test covered 12 chapters of material, class average in the 60's and she didn't curve. She doesn't really care if you're doing well or not. So lazy. Lab and HW bring up your grade if not no one would pass. Started to make lecture mandatory. Some test questions can be found verbatim from the online HW tho!!!!",0
"If shes the only option for microbiology, dont get too discouraged right away. Reading a lot of these ratings can definitely discourage you because it definitely happened to me when I read these before taking the course. Yes she is a very hard teacher and honestly doesnt teach well, but just put attention to lectures and you should be okay",0
"I wouldn't recommend his class to students who like to ask questions. You can tell he cares about minute details which is irritating when you are completely lost. He cracks jokes and sure, they help time go by but it doesn't help you learn. If you have the option choose a different professor",0
"ethics of education is sooo boring. she is very monotone and unclear. the tests are ridiculous (and i went to class and studied). the readings are ambigious and very boring. the only fun part of the class is going to teach at the school. and that's mostly bc dr. wike isn't talking. she's very smart, just boring.avoid if possible",0
"Professor Guttmann is very knowledgeable, he will ask you to understand and explain all the materials to him. The lecture is amazing, you will learn a lot. Take him! The exam is a little bit hard and homework will ask you to write a lot (discussion board), but if you write more than he expects, you will get extra credit (will boost from B to A-).",1
"I'M TELLING YOU NOW, IF YOU NEED TO TAKE MORAL CHOICE TAKE IT WITH THIS PROFESSOR. He is super easy and chill and while there is homework weekly, it's the easiest thing ever. I'm pretty sure of the thirty people in my class no one failed. I ended with a 97. He's super chill and even if you do work late you'll still get a good grade. TAKE HIM.",1
"She is a good teacher. Provides good examples and explains stuff well. She just uses her slides all the time, if attendance was not mandatory you would still pass her class, since she likes to do quizs and test of her slides and practice questions. Do the practice questions will help you a lot on tests, since majority of examples comes from there",1
"Oh Sheryl, where do I begin? If you've had her, you're ready for what this class entails. However, if you haven't, get ready to be open to criticism. Papers turned into her will come back with tons of ink marks and suggestions. However, her suggestions often reflect old AP style teachings. She changes her mind and criteria a lot as well so listen.",0
"Weekly online quizzes super easy b/c you can use your book. Lectures often off topic but he is full of interesting stories (read chapter before class). Papers fairly easy, much like book reports. Make the corrections he gives you and get an A. Tests are all essay and difficult. Be sure to put time into the sample questions he provides.",1
"Pass on this Professor. Doesn't teach, is rude at times and expects the most from students. Heavily graded on discussion boards and participation.",0
"Brandi is very rude. She does not give clear instructions, she changes due dates and does not feel the need to tell you,  she plays favoritism, and makes the class so much harder than it needs to be.",0
"Dr. Mueller employs a workgroup, experience based, workbook method in Ochem. It does not work. He doesn't teach. The class is absurd. I am getting an A in the class but only because I study the book and other professors notes. You do not learn much in class. He also comes over quite arrogant.",0
"Well, the class in itself was easy. She was very hard to understand, would not give good feedback or review tests. Would not recommend. Even though I got a B, the class was more self taught than taught by a professor.",0
"His tests are a cryptic mess. Over half of the questions are unclear and have little to no connection with what he covered in class. Same thing with his homework, all the questions are unrelated to his slides, which is what he reads for lectures, or the textbook. I feel like he taught what HE believes is good software engineering, which is garbage.",0
"I enjoyed this class as well as the professor. I was dreading taking this class after reading all these negative reviews but honestly, it was great class. I learned a lot and it wasn't any harder than some of the other online classes I've taken. The class was very organized and straightforward.  Do the work and you'll get a decent grade.",1
"Do not under any circumstances take this course online over the summer. There is a lot of forum responses to be made; however, the biggest problem is that he expects them to be done basically on the daily and you can't do them ahead of time. This made my weeks miserable as I couldn't go anywhere after work bc I had to go home and write a response.",0
"She's a real cool professor if you have the opportunity to take another class with her, grab it.",1
Amazing!!! Take her if you can! My favorite professor and favorite class  this semester.,1
"GREAT PROFESSOR. I truly had no desire to take this class but she helped me open my eyes to a beautiful language. She is extremely funny, kind and will help you succeed. Although there was ALOT of work (fitting both ITL 101 and 102 into 1 semester)and it met for 2 hrs 3x/week, I do not regret taking this class in the least. Worth the 6 credits!",1
"She is a very intelligent professor and teaches unique ways how to write a paper. However, she only had the class out of 100 points and a 91-100 was an A. I am a 4.0 student and got my first B in this class. Very hard grader on essays (only 5.) Not doing the readings and posting discussions would only count against you, not for you. ",0
P. Marsh is very clear in communicating the information in his lectures. In a 200 level science class the lecture and information presented is challenging so efforts important. In group project he graded me down for my information being to detailed and presenting too quiet. To me we should be graded for the precise info not how well we present.,1
"Great guy, very scary at first but after the first lab when he really opens up. One of my favorite and most helpful teachers I have had so far.",1
"Have never gotten an A before in college. Don is the best. He keeps class really interesting. Wish some of the profs in nursing were this good! No surprises. Just a decent guy, funny and obviously knows his stuff.",1
Absolutely the hardest and worst teacher I have ever had. I don't want you to think that I'm some student who does not care I have a 3.5 gpa. the sad thing is he will never change and faculty department will never replace him. the highest test average was a 52.,0
I've taken pre calc with this professor twice (once online and in class) and still couldn't pass. The professor teaches a bunch of other math courses at the college and honestly spreads himself too thin. I recommend taking the class with a different professor.,0
Great guy!,1
"Try not to take this class if possible. Her lectures are so irrelevant and she often isn't prepared. She canceled class 3x in 3 weeks & we were expected to learn everything on our own. I honestly don't know why I showed up to class. If you are a self teacher and don't want to show up to class, this might be for you. She's very nice but can't teach.",0
There is so much i can say about this professor. to make it short and sweet i will never take him again! lectures a lot yes but cant understand him. if he makes a mistake in grading labs he will not correct them. he does not help students during class and all he does is read from a power point that students have access to. not helpful at all!,0
"Awesome Teacher!  She makes calc seem easy, and shes HOT!!!",1
Dont take him !,0
Wouldnt accept google docs because I couldnt get Word to work on my computer,0
"She was great! took both of her online classes Anthro 1 and 2 and I love them, especially 1. She cares about her students and is very nice and understanding. Loved everything about the class.",1
Not a good professor. She'll show up late to lectures and leave early from class. This makes it such that the TA's end up teaching everything. The TA's are really the only reasons you'll survive this class! Not a good person and not helpful. 0 stars.,0
"very good teacher, but she makes you read a lot and do a lot of quizzes.",1
"HARD CLASS!!! His lectures are really interesting but totally different from his test. The book didn't help either. GO TO EVERY CLASS, even though it is not mandatory. He is a great teacher and helpful, but with the difficulty of his test, I would just avoid the class all together. I'm an A student, but this class totally destroyed my GPA :(",1
"I had her for my thesis class.  I wasn't hugely interested in the Holocaust but once I found my topic, I became really fascinated.  As I worked on my thesis and argument, I feel like she wanted me to go one way when I wanted to follow it another way.  She didn't seem overly open to new points of view or thinking outside of the norm.",1
"His voice is soft, and hard to hear.  Cantow is lazy, so when he grades, he grades real easy.  Funny guy, too.  Really wants to get done with the lab.  I'd recommend him for lab, easily. (=",0
"She is off topic during lecture and gives lots of trick questions on her exams. Her reviews are not helpful, so it is really hard to study the right things for her exams. I recommend going to class, even though it is not mandatory, because she gives clicker point extra credit.",0
"Douglas was a good prof, she has clear expectations. No textbook but you have 2 hours plus of readings each class that you have to do because you are quizzed on. They are interesting though, essay based final graded fairly. I'm not an econ major/minor and I did well. Bit disorganized but with covid she tried her best. She is very sweet/caring!",1
"She was clear in her expectations for the class, but her midterm and final exams didn't match the content of the chapter tests. Pretty much be prepared to memorize the whole book!",0
"He seems intimidating at first but when you truly need help, he is there to help. He makes his class very clear and simple. His second test is the only hard test but the rest are easy (IF you study). If you put work in I dont see why you wouldnt make an A. Chemistry isnt for lazy people. Its not the teacher thats bad, you just to put work in",1
AMAZING TEACHER! Very helpful. She expects a lot of her students but she is always their if you need her. Very knowledgeable on her subject and gives real life examples. Very interesting class!,1
I decide to take professor choi for fall and let me just tell you she is so the most careless professor i have taken at elac... she doesn't care about her students passing not to mention she'll only provide extra opportunities until the very end of the semester and constantly has typos in her lecture notes. DON'T TAKE HER!!!!,0
"A true gem of the University. I came to this school, because of Professor Lunn. Other students who previously took her course, told me that, she is one of the best students they ever had. Taking her class this year, I would definitely have to agree with that! Thank you. My college career is off to a good start, because of you.",1
I've always been good at English and writing. This teacher grades hard so do not expect anything higher than a B. I would never take her again.,0
"Dr. Westpfahl is the sweetest and I loved taking this class with him! He lets you ask random questions anytime and for however long you want. There are no tests in this class. Only group projects, homework, and a paper. It's really easy to succeed and his class is very interesting. He cares a ton about the students and is always willing to help!",1
"Garver's classes are really tough, but you learn so much! Make sure you go to class and pay attention though, or you'll fall behind. If you're interested in anything technical, take his classes!",1
"Hellmann is a wonderful and caring teacher. She is also Deaf! You may think it would be challenging, but working with someone who is patient like her, there is no language barrier between her and students. Her patience is greatly appreciated. Make sure you also practice signing out of class. If you show the effort it will be noticed!",1
"She isn't a tough grader but she's very politically correct. Often brings up discussions about race, discrimination, and the like which can sometimes make you uncomfortable. She's a decent professor overall.",0
"Not accessible outside of class. She rarely answers emails, missed many office hours without giving notice, and does not post most grades. The tests and quizzes were very error prone so make sure you check all of your assignments. However, she makes it extremly difficult to do so. The class was much easier before we transitioned to online though.",0
"Kelli is seriously one of the coolest professors at UNL. Coming from out of state especially, she was always extremely welcoming and open for help. JOMC 101 is taught in multiple different ways. We have industry exercises, lecture, videos, etc. There are so many different ways that she teaches, so no matter how you learn, everyone will understand.",1
Hardest class I ever took! I dont know how people do well in this class. So much to read! I read multiple times and took notes on everything and would still fail tests. He gives so many tests!!!,0
Contradicts herself constantly. Pretty much one of the worst online professors I've ever had. So if you want to deal with a B take this class.,0
"Great teacher, fun and entertaining she covers the material on the test very well",1
"Awful, one of the worst teachers I've had. She wasted the 1st hour of every class talking about nonsense. we'd always run out of time when we finally started the lecture. She consistently marked us down on things that she herself didn't do in the examples. Class is an easy A but I didn't learn anything for a 3000 level course I expect to learn some",0
"This was my most challenging class by far.  Quizes on most days, make sure you read before you come to class.  His tests are tough.  No Extra Credit opprotunities.  He is helpful if you ask him to help you during office hours.  Challenging class.",1
is not clear on the assignments that are given. Do not take him,0
"She is a great teacher for lab. She starts the class with a short lecture to introduce the topics of the lab, then we break off into different stations to do different activities at each. She gives a study guide for the test and gives recordings for the models which are very helpful.",1
Good teacher.  Makes the class fun.  Uses powerpoints.  Always helpful and understanding.  Gives extra credit for homework assignments and quizzes.  Tests are multiple choice.,1
"Constitutional Law was a lot less stressful than I expected. Good overview of the topic and intro to law assignments. 2 hypos (papers), short answer/essay midterm and really fun moot court exercise. Quite a bit of reading but super accessible outside class and fun stories during lecture. Helped spark my interest in law!",1
"Curses, always cancelled class, never emails, never gives criteria for work, has walked out of class",0
Take her class! She gives a lot of extra credits and you will get an A in this class.,1
Overpaid,0
Best Prof Ever! She is amazing and fantastic! And her research is also awesome! She knows everything well and taught you in all the way you need! Love her so much!,1
Dr. Lane can be extremely rude. He's not the worst but not the best. Assignments are easy but pointless. Take class with someone else if possibl.e,0
"Very hard. He is not willing to work with students, and not willing to admit he is wrong. Expects a lot from all students and if you are not willing to work very very hard you will not do well in his course. His lectures were good, and I think I learned a lot, just feel like he could have been just as good of a professor without being so hard.",0
Miserable time. Felt invisible. Eventually had to drop the class after she upset me.,0
"He is a very hard professor.  He does have favorites, but he does not punish those who are not his faves.  His tests are ridiculously hard, but he does it to make you think through what you learned. IF you are up for a challenge and really want to learn something- he is the prof for you!",0
Ask any female student!  He is hot!,1
"Big nerd with a big nerdy ponytail, and an awesome professor. Genuinely loves what he's teaching and it rubs off; very helpful and understanding. One of the best at GCC",1
Lots of reading and basically all lectures. New teacher so he has been rough edges but honestly cares if you put in the work and show him you want to do well.,1
"Lots of case studies and a semester long project. No individually created lectures, all the content is pulled from HBS. Poor feedback and grading system.",0
"She really is a great teacher. Shes hard but she prepares you well for nclex as well as the real world. In the real world not everyone is bubbly and nice all the time. Shes very real and doesnt care if you like her or not, shes there to teach nursing and thats what she does. But dont piss her off! Shes a great person and teacher.",1
"Terrible regarding grading in a timely manner. Didn't have anything beyond three assignments graded until the very end of October. Doesn't actually teach, just has you and the class follow pre-built questions on Canvas & the reading. No actual feedback beyond a unhelpful rubric, made no attempt to hold any office hour. Avoid at all costs.",0
"She obviously did not want to be teaching the course, her attitude to the students was dripping of condescension and a lack of respect.  The material was interesting but presented slowly and the class was often unbearingly boring.",0
"She always has an excuse for why she couldn't return promised feedback and for why she is not prepared. She will give you a B or B+ on almost every project regardless of how well it is prepared and given. She'll also sometimes go on rants describing how ""Men do this..."" and how women are discriminated against.",0
"Dr. Ferguson really is such a nice professor, however, his teaching style is VERY fast and you MUST write down everything he says because that is what his tests are based on. This was a challenging course and I did all things necessary to succeed, I went to his office hours, had perfect attendance, and attempted to write every word he said down.",0
"I had Tokunaga-sensei for both 110 and 120. The class isn't that hard, there's no reason you shouldn't be able to keep up. She's nice. Never in a bad mood. It was a pleasure to be in her class this year. arigatou gozaimasu!",1
"On a scale of 1-10, I would give her a -0.1. I would go lower but there's not an option to do that. ",0
"Hardest class I've ever taken. Average exam grades seem to consistently be below 60%. Luckily, the discussion section counts for a large portion of our grade and you will probably do fine with the curve.",0
"I'm sure she's a great person, but man is she a terrible prof. Lectures unclear and hard to follow, going to class was, in my opinion, a waste of time that could've been spent elsewhere. Lecture recordings, although just as hard to follow, are easier to learn/ take notes from.",0
"I thought the class was easy, he explains everything multiple times which kind of gets boring at times. I read the chapters from the book before the test and got A's on all my tests. Hes a really great teacher.",1
THE BEST! Very easy to talk to and is very great at explaining the lectures and assignments. Just read the chapters and do the hw so you can pass,1
"This man was awesome. He was a super nice guy, kind of qwerky, but probably the best professor I've had in a while. While he did his best to make the class interesting, it could get boring every now and then. However, Mr. Todd always did his best to help you succeed, and I would take him again in a heartbeat.",1
"She's an amazing professor. Definitely one of my favorites at Duke! She has all it takes and more to be a great professor-- intelligent, great personality, clarity, passion.",1
"She is a terrible Accounting teacher, she reads straight off of the powerpoints and expects you to write out entire balance sheets on a blank piece of paper with no help. If you're going to take this class then go to every single PAL sessions because she is awful. She doesn't answer any questions without being rude and freaking out at the student.",0
She skims over explaining how to actually do things and just expects you to understand. Assigns lots of online homework in bulk but you have a week usually to do the 15-40 problems. Test vary in difficulty and the final is under 30 questions but adds up to 200 points and 20% of your grade and she takes points away for every little mistake...,0
"Most people like him, he was ok but tests are extremely difficult, I'd go in knowing I was going to get an A and end up getting Cs and Bs. He even got mad at our class for having low test scores. I wouldn't highly recommend him if you're aiming for an A",0
"He was using an old exam for the first midterm, and he sometimes does this for the final midterm. I know students who studied only an old exams have passed the first midterm and the course with a decent grade. While some people tell you to study hard, I tell you to find as many old tests and practice them over and over.",0
" Prof Chii is definitely a modern professor ,she tries to make sure everybody is engaged. but be ready to work. I made a B in this class",1
"Loved her, but she was really unorganized, which was her only flaw.",1
"Online class was a piece of cake. You have to show up to a weekly chat session, where you discuss the lecture that you read and ask any questions you have. Do the essays (there are 3), post in the discussion boards, and you will pass with an A. Prof. Piluso is AMAZING. Very understanding and very passionate about what he does. Highly recommend him!",1
"Prof Burnier is ok as long as you are writing what his interpretation of the readings are. If you are, he will go above and beyond to help you - sending you articles and sources you might need, explaining certain concepts, etc. If you aren't, not only will he not go out of his way to help you, but he will be on you about what his perspective is.",1
She always gives so many homework questions and she takes them up as part of your points with your quiz grades. There are quizzes at the beginning of almost every class and she only gives 10 minutes for them. She takes off points for the SMALLEST & STUPIDEST things. She will be the reason you'll fail the class or drop out if you're not on top of it,0
"Dr. Barnes is really funny and passionate but for a required freshmen course, she grades way too harshly on speeches. She doesnt realize we arent all communication majors. Also her stories are funny and interesting but classes are pointless because she spends 5 minutes on the material and then talks about herself and her family the whole class",0
"She was really nice, she just wasnt truly helpful or harmful in any way.",1
"Lisa's class was very interesting, and she made all the assignments relevant to the field.  She was not very clear with any of her instructions, however, and she confused you even more when you asked for clarification.  She is very knowledgable in her field, but has a hard time teaching that knowledge in a classroom setting.",0
She is a very nice teachers sweetheart even. But she doesn't know how to speak English very well. her test are easy if you understand what she taught you. I basically had to either teach myself or go to the math lab like everyday. Because I didn't understand her I ended up failing.,0
"Organic II can be a hard course, but it doesn't have to be. She's very nice, but as a teacher she lacks the ability to communicate material effectively. You feel rushed, as if Organic Chemistry is some trial-by-fire all scientists must endure. It's a ridiculous notion to expect most students to absorb the material given presentation style.",0
"McCullagh grades none of the homework that he assigns. His GA may as well teach the class. He assigns long papers, loses them, then gives you late. He's very forgetful and has to be reminded that papers are due and where we are at in the lecture.",0
Instruction was awkward. Bo reads directly from the slides offering vague answers to students' questions. Online homework is tedious and time consuming offering little explaination.  Two group projects were riddled with busy work.  Weekly posts for online discussion forum was insightful for financial current events.  Final exam held in class.,0
"Mary is one of the best teachers I've had so far! She truly cares about her students and literature! She has lots of projects but everything has a clear due date and a clear rubric to follow. She explains things wonderfully and the discussions in class are inspiring and enlightening. Go to class, read the books, and do the reading responses!!!",1
"HORRIBLE. LONG BORING LECTURES.  NO visual aids. She doesn't do powerpoints, instead she puts up pages of articles on moodle to read., which are harder than her lectures. She said book isn't needed but it definitely IS (READ!!) When asked to use put up powerpoints for us she says ""I dont know how to do that, so I'm not going to"" ...... DO NOT TAKE!",0
Il n'explique pas bien,0
"Only the grace of God was able to deliver me through this course. Just remember, if there is anything you should know about the REAL WORLD, is that you do not owe any form of kindness to someone that makes it a challenge for you. Even for authority.",0
Emailed them to put me from the waiting list to the class roster for financial aid reasons. They replied saying they could register me on day 1 and email my advisor. First day rolls around & I email them 1 hr prior to class for the zoom link since I noticed Im still not registered. No response. I email them again the next day & still nothing.,0
"Smart, teaches economics and finance more than  marketing----but that's what marketing really is.  READ everything before class and you'll do fine.  More a class in strategic management actually than marketing.",1
"He is a prof at George Brown College, he's amazing and very helpful and understanding with deadlines and assignments.",1
"Two weeks into class I dropped out because I had no time to complete my other assignments whatsoever. Lots of reading, lots of writing, and shes a tough grader. She will call you out in class. She does less teaching, and more talking. Will cite someone for plagiarism without warning. Everyone struggled. She had 30 students, then dropped to > 15.",0
"Had professor Rice for lab, many people claim to really dislike her, I found that although she is rough on the outside she isn't that cold and heartless on the inside. She is a stickler on the rules, so always follow her directions, come dressed appropriately for lab, read the lab manuals,  and read modules before class and you will be just fine.",1
"Prepare to spend 10-15+ hours outside of lab on the lab hw. Exams are quite difficult. Requires that you know how to apply what U've learned. No info regurgitation tests. Class hw can be moderate-difficult. ALWAYS work in groups on labs. Dont miss class, not everything makes it on slides. Cooperate. Trade notes, study etc w/ other students to pass.",0
"She was not able to answer a lot of questions from students because she was  not able to understand them. When she doesn't understand your question, she makes other students to explain, which is sometimes inaccurate and hard to understand because they are also puzzled by inadequate explanation.",0
You haven't seen a great professor until you have had this guy! I had him back in 2011 and here I am writing a review to let everyone who's reading this now to know that his class is fantastic! I miss having him as a professor! Love you Mr. Martin!,1
If you want to experience a condescending instructor who believes that the only way to test students is via hard essays this man is for you.  If you just want to learn and have a good experience avoid him like the plague.  If you take him dont ever miss class or he will fail you for not coming to hear his sermon.,0
If you want to be thoroughly confused and question your entire life I guess this is the class for you. So many assignments that arent worth much. Kinda feels like a waste of time. I would rather swallow a jean jacket than take this course again,0
"Danielle Miller is really passionate about her class. I learned a lot and my writing has definitely improved. If you want to learn and not just pay for a class, but actually get your money's worth, then this is a great class. However, this class is not easy.",1
"Great Profesor, very easy to get along with, has a fun loving sense of humor. Excelent teacher very easy to learn from.",1
"Guy was consistently rude and openly disrespected even quiet students for no reason. Assigns and collects homework daily. Makes no effort to create or post aiding materials (worksheets, practice exams, etc), using the excuse that it encourages students to not come to class, which is ironic considering thats exactly what his bad attitude does.",0
"Barrett is the quentessential professor: approachable, challenging, and a great sense of humor. Be prepared to spend at least 10 hrs plus a week on reading, problems, and writing assignments. If you put in the work, you can get a good grade. Would take again in a heart beat.",1
Lectures were confusing and long winded. He is a nice person and tries hard to convey the information however he loses the students in the process. I have been to every class and still do not know what we have been doing. I literally put in random numbers on the homework assignments and do that until I get the correct answer. There is no hope. ,1
"I have had worse professors, but I wouldn't say he's amazing. Lectures are really boring, which makes it hard to come to class. He has a very strong accent and can make the lectures harder to understand. Overall, he wants his students to do well and curves a lot and drops one quiz. He is also willing to help. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE ONLINE QUIZZES!!",1
"Dr Jasmin is passionate about organic chemistry. He mumbles a little, but he is very clear in his explanations.",1
"12week DL spring 2019: I am not a huge reader & not big into history. Yes, theres hmwk. Expected. Everything is very clear and to the point. Do the work and you'll make an A/B. Hmwk/Test come from your book. No testing center required. Take test at home. Discussion board every other day per week-no wknds. Not that bad. EVERYTHING COMES FROM BOOK.",1
Best teacher I've ever had for such a hard class :),1
"Waste of time...class is extremely easy, but she discriminates against certain students and likes to have control as if we're in Middle School.  She gets too gassed about being a teacher- class is boring, but an easy A...try to take online if possible.",0
"Good professor, a little monotone though, making his otherwise good lectures a bit hard to listen to. Take a lot of notes, tests are very hard. Extremely long-winded in answering questions. Still a good prof and a good guy.",1
Professor Gronlund is an amazing professor! I took her nutrition class this fall semester and it was such a fun class to be in! Make sure you watch the lecture videos and read the textbook to be successful in her class.,1
Very knowlegeable and brilliant professor for those who follow him,1
Such a good English class. Was my first class English class of college and was a breeze. 4 essays over the semester along with a well defined Syllabus. She explains things clearly and her tests are easy as long as you pay attention. Make sure to read for the book for reading quizzes. Loved her and would take again.,1
"I recently had this professor and the class was a hybrid class. It was very disorganized and he changed his mind very often. He would also teach one way, then do it a complete different way saying the first way was wrong. He wasnt very understanding of the class and didnt help anyone who asked for it. He seemed careless and didnt show support.",0
"His tests were almost impossible unless you reallllly understand Physics.  If you made a 7.5/15 on the test, you had a A.  The stuff on the tests isn't covered in class.  I would recommend taking someone else!",1
"Melissa is a gem! Yes, she assigns work that sometimes may be challenging but! She'll do her best to make sure you pass, she has immense care for her students. She makes the class enjoyable.",1
"Professor McEntire did an outstanding job instructing the Film Appreciation materiel. He is easy to talk to. Must have the book. Exams are a bit hard if you don’t put the study time in. Honestly if you have it together, and do your work, you're golden. If you’re just a seat warmer, expect to fail hard. He will drop you for not attending class.",1
"She was ok, but really doesn't try to understand her students. Goes off on her own tangent. Classes are extremely boring and she is very repetitive. Takes extremely long to return papers and is very confused in class. Personally, I did not find her a helpful professor. But not a lot of tests or essays which I like",0
"Avoid this professor,  tests are very wordy, so if English is your second language you will not get a good mark. If only she could bring her enthusiasm into her actual teaching abilities.",0
"This is not an easy course, she will MAKE you learn. Sometimes you may want to scream or walk out of class but in the end it's evident that she is just trying to make sure you learn the material without taking any shortcuts. She is approachable, and will stay after class to help you, responds to emails quickly too. I enjoy her class.",1
"This professor does not know what he is doing in a classroom. Do not for the life of you take this class. The material is extremely simple, but the way he grades makes it very difficult to get a good grade. Be prepared to teach yourself.",0
"Without a doubt, the worst professor I've ever had the privilege of being ""taught"" by. Graded our single paper for the class harshly,  taking off points for my ""poor grammar"" (note: I'm an English major on the Dean's List) and advising grammatical rules that haven't been acceptable to use since 5th grade. Save yourself and don't take this class. ",0
"Very poor lecturer. Makes many mistakes and tries to do problems ""his way"" which ends up confusing students even more since his explanations are never adequate. Too bad there is only ever 1 section for the classes he teaches so theres no way in getting around him. Learn from the textbook or youtube and do ample example problems for each section.",0
"He is extremely rude, and does not show any intent of having the students best interests. He does not answer questions in any helpful manor. He even snapped at students during the semester, raised his voice multiple times, and is generally an unwelcoming professor. He was the only one available so I had no choice unfortunately.",0
"This is one of the worst classes I have taken at the U. Berger gave a quiz during dead week. Made countless mistakes when teaching the material and class was not very helpful. The first three weeks of class were pointless, learning about the history of computers that and never being quizzed or tested on this material.",0
There is no document of civilization that is not at the same time a document of barbarism.,1
Greatest professor I had at W&L...reason I was a politics major.  Wrote me a wonderful letter of recommendation that got me into Law School.  I highly recommend that everyone take him.  Don't listen to anyone that tells you otherwise.  I had him for several classes and loved every one.  Extremely helpful and once you get past Pol. 100 very nice.,1
Awesome professor!  She really wants you to learn.  Prof. Clausen takes the time to ensure that everyone knows the material.  She does cold call but gives you the questions before class.  Take her!,1
Awful teacher cares to much about attendance even if you have a good reason to be late or absent. Boring lectures and quizzes are easy but gives pointless homework wouldn't recommend,0
"Class is way too dark, exams are very difficult, she puts things on the exam that are not in the book or her objectives. She also gives 80 page powerpoints that have nothing to do with the exams. She talks a lot and most of the time its about things that are not on the exam, and it takes her 3 days to get through one PowerPoint.",0
"This class was on the holocaust and we had to watch/ read/ think about some really horrible things that have happened. There were lots of quizzes on language and key terms/ concepts, too. Catherine was really good about telling us expectations and was so thoughtful about the material. It made a shi*ty subject a lot easier. Earned my respect 100%.",1
"Awful guy, would rate 0/5 if I could. He is so rude and inconsiderate. Office hours are a joke. He'll dock you a point every punctuation error on the lab reports.",0
"Doesn't care about you, your life, or your grade. Lets the book and lab work do all the teaching.",0
"Professor Lopez is an incredible speaker, very intelligent, and has many interesting points about Shakespeare that you will not learn anywhere else. He's also surprisingly funny. Grading is fair. If you like Shakespeare, you'll enjoy it a lot!! Kept sleeping through the 9am lectures, though, and missed all the days he handed back the test aha;;",1
I severely dislike this teacher for his lack of effort and bad attitude. Also doesn't respond to any emails even though I emailed him over and over,0
"He's one of my favorite professors I've had so far. He's so funny and his class is the easiest GPA booster I've every taken. I highly recommend you have him as a professor. He's blunt, but he makes you think about your answer and makes you explain your answer. He's not afraid to play both sides of an argument so be prepared to defend your answer.",1
"Classes are discussion based, not lecture based, which means you don't always get clear answers. It's a lot of memorizing different psych studies, which wasn't very interesting for me. He doesn't believe in multiple choice, so tests are all short answer and essay response. Quiz at the beginning of almost every class, so you have to do the readings.",1
glen is awesome! he makes his classes entertaining not dull,1
"Her attention span is very small. One cough and she'll stop the whole class to talk about our flu shots, then she spends an hour talking about that, then complains that we're so behind. She's unorganized. She'll come to class late and leave because she forgot our work. She made me delete a whole paragraph because the ""vocabulary was much too hard"".",0
"Her lectures can be very confusing, and her extremely poor handwriting doesn't help at all. Because of that, quizzes were pretty hard. But if you study on your own and pay attention in the lecture class, it makes the class a little easier. Brittney is super nice and fun to talk to though. Cool person. Mediocre teacher.",0
Not a good teacher at all.,0
"Maybe an hour or two of homework per week. To get an A: - go to class - complete and understand the homework - the above will allow you to get good grades on the quizzes and tests If you dont get an A, you were probably too distracted by her attractiveness.",1
"Honestlyonly take this class if you already have some photography/adobe premiere experience. His assignments forced me to get out of my comfort zone, which I appreciated. Having your work ripped apart in front of your peers helps to develop tough skinif you can't handle critique from Cheers, you're not cut out for Journalism, honey!! Get out now!",0
"I have enjoyed Dr. Webb's class so far. He makes learning math easy. I am retaking this class because I earned a C the first time. The semester is almost over and I've maintained an A so far. If you're looking for a quality math professor, sign up for his class!",1
to echo what the last review said... it's impossible to get a response from this teacher... if she never posts grades how am I supposed to know how to improve? I'd like to get some feedback on my work but that doesn't happen until the last week of class when it's way too late... especially after paying $900 for the class,0
"Dr. Wood is a great professor. Very clear in lectures and doesn't ""trick"" you on test questions. Makes class comfortable. Pretty easy going guy, but expects you to work. Make sure to read the textbook.",1
"Mrs Bolt is not a teacher you want to have for an online class. Only responds M-F to email, good luck if you need to reach her otherwise. She expects a lot of homework and there are lots of different due dates. Tests are open only Sun-Wed, and most homework is due Friday at midnight. I wish for an online teacher she was more involved and willing.",0
I had an awful experience in this class and I highly recommend to avoid taking his class.,0
"Doesn't pull any punches. He is honest in his review of speeches. He airs some of his opinions, and though I disagree, he made me laugh. I've become a MUCH better speaker thanks to this class. Easy at the beginning, gets progressively harder. Gave a take home test the first day of class, to turn in at the end. Doesn't talk about the book in class.",1
i had the best christmas ever knowing that i never have to see this horrible professor again. so full of himself and he uses big words  to deter his students from realizing he doesn't know squat.,0
"Hes rude. Student asked a question and he said, hes westing his time. Hes very unclear of what hes saying. Uncoordinated, and unavailable outside of class room.",0
Worst professor I have ever had! Assignments were unclear and very difficult. Would not recommend!,0
"John Rhym taught the material effectively, and slyly involved his research into the material in a way that enhanced my learning. I recommend him.",1
"extremely unorganized, but papers aren't difficult. Canterbury tales are the only thing covered. No theory or background info given on the text. Lectures are a bore, but he is apparently ""a very busy parent"" [like no one else is who teaches...] so he is rather disjunctive. 3papers. He canceled the final exam. You get pizza on the last day. Eh class",0
Sinha seems fine until you take your first midterm and realize that you know absolutely nothing. She goes through the slides at 60mph and barely gives students a chance to see it. Her clicker questions are challenging and sometimes don't even make sense. I would not recommend.,0
"Very nice, knowledgeable, and funny. The only complaint is that he will take forever to grade assignments.",1
"While his assignments are presented as difficult, he's actually an easy grader. Technically, everything he assigned I failed to meet the minimum but, he didn't care so long as I tried. Didn't really learn anything but I did get an A. So, there's that.",0
She does not stop lecturing the entire class. It's impossible to take notes because she goes way too fast. I had her for an hour and 15 minutes and it felt like she didn't even take a second to breathe. LECTURE ONLY. No type of interactive learning at all.,0
"Best of all PGCC teachers, kind, lovely.",1
"Perfect class to take online. Always has tests & projects graded within 24 hours of submission. Expectations are perfectly clear and assignments are super easy to follow! Tests, as long as you read the chapter you should be good to go! Great teacher and great class!",1
"Her tests came directly from her notes, so that is really the only thing you need to study, don't buy the book. Her lab practicals were pretty easy. She hands out a chemistry packet at the beginning of the course, make sure you complete it and get it all correct! She adds those points to your final average- they can make or break your grade.",1
"Pretty good prof. I really like his lectures; he's enthusiastic, engaging and he makes the kinda dull content interesting. He hands out the lecture notes but they are bare bones so you absolutely must attend class! Exams are pretty fair but test on a fair bit of detail.",1
"Do not take his class. He does not reply to students. During the COVID happenings, he did not announce anything the last 2 months of the semester, leaving us students completely in the dark. Cancelled all remaining assignments, tests and quizzes and our final grade was determined by such little material. Very unorganized. DO. NOT. TAKE. HIS. CLASS.",0
"Took her ED Psych class in Fall '15. It wasn't very challenging, and she was actually very accommodating to myself and the other students in the class. I enjoyed learning from her.",1
Decent professor. I do not like anthropology therefore the teacher needs to be very enthusiastic about the subject. She was enthusiastic but not as much as I would have hoped especially being a biology major. There is also a lot to read in class. Tests aren't too hard however.,1
A great prof thats like to teach and is very helpfull.,1
"1 lecture and 2 discussions a week. Her lectures are mandatory since there's iclicker points. 2 exams and a final (with a retake on 1 exam if you did poorly). 2 essays with an opportunity to edit mistakes for some points back. Lots of useless online homework and workbook activities. She can be helpful, but test out of this class if you can.",0
"The best english teacher ever. Read everything he assigns because there will be quiz. The content of the class is boring but he makes it so interesting. Take good notes, read, participate!",1
Ridiculous teacher. She acted like you were interrupting her if you came to her door during her office hours and was overall kinda rude.,0
"Thought I was good w/ grammar b4 this class. Such a nice lady, knows her stuff, but not a gr8 grammar prof. Unless you are prepared to be confused 24/7, take someone else. I was only able to make an A because she is gr8 about partial credit + HW, and projects are pretty easy. Beware of exams and quizzes. Would def enjoy her for any other class.",1
"I really enjoyed Lyons, she was passionate about the subject and liked to add little jokes in as she taught. The course was very lecture-heavy and if you don't take notes and study hard for the exams, you WILL struggle. The lab material was easy and relevant. It's in your best interest not to skip this class.",1
"Elena is one of the most engaging, encouraging professors I've had. I took her course on the cinema of Latin America, and she covered all the bases: the sociopoliticalcontextual, narrative, and aesthetic aspects of the films. There was something for everyone in the class to grab onto. Elena is amenable to each student's needs and interests.",1
I would understand if the course was the regular length. But if you are going to make it mandatory to basically force feed myself the material in a small amount of time. SOMETHING would be nice,0
"Professor Ratner's class is beyond dull. He stands in front of the class and reads off the slides the entire lecture. 3 exams and 1 project. No room for error. His ""curves"" are points reimbursed for mistakes that he made on the exam. He's also pretty inconsiderate, he doesn't care about your situation unless you provide hard proof. Dont recommend.",0
"Sister Howell is nice, but a bad teacher.  Everyone in the class is on their phones/bored to death because she just reads from the powerpoints.  For a 2 credit elective, this required way too much work.  Homework wasn't bad, but expect her to grade very specific/harsh on random things.  Tests were longer/more intense then necessary.  ",0
"The difference between an A student and a B student in Dr. Harris's class are those who read the book and those who do not. She will test you on material that is covered in the book because you are a college student and this is expected. She does not give you her notes because writing, listening, and taking your own notes facilitates learning.",1
"He's a great professor and also very approachable. Four pop quizzes, midterm, and final. That's your grade. The readings can be tough but he explains them very well in class. I really recommend him.",1
I loved Professor Mack! She is entertaining and really cares for her students. Semester long group project and discussions every week so don't skip class. Tests are not too difficult if you study the information from each chapter. Definitely one of my favorite teachers at CofC.,1
"Worst class I have ever taken. I wrote a paper that followed ALL the guidelines, but it was failed because my ""views"" were different than what he wanted. Also, the final is four exam essays, 350 words each and 2 hours to do all of it. Mess up? Automatic 0%. Never take this class. Worst teacher I have ever worked with. Save yourself the time.",0
"She is a very nice lady who cares about her students. But she is the worst professor. She is BEYOND disorganized & gets so sidetracked to the point where we don't finish the chapter & we have to learn the rest through her ""online lectures."" Her exams consist of MC & ""short answers"" that are 4 pages long and some aren't even on the study guide!!",0
"Hes the worst teacher Ive ever had in any subject. And I graduated years ago. Trust all the bad things people are saying. They are not just disgruntled students, I personally aced his classes. Hes just not a good person.",0
"Plan on teaching yourself if you take him! Poor teaching style, you will only learn from yourself, not the teacher. He sux big time! Theres only 4 more weeks of school left and i cant wait till its over so i can be done with his class.  Take professor HEGNER!!! shes awesom!!!!!",0
"Professor Livingston is awesome! She's very clear in what she wants, and is always available to help. Class is very structured and organized. She's definitely a tough grader, but its done in a constructive way and she really wants students to succeed in her class. Would definitely take again!",1
"Very helpful but very strict. Be on time and pay attention. Be prepared for a quiz every day or a homework check. Simply, if you take him you WILL understand the subject",1
He is willing to help all student. Nice professor and be a good listener,1
Avoid at all costs...,0
Worst teacher ever for a summer course. Very unorganized and lost my work.,0
"TAKE COTE SHES AWESOME!!! Expect to be put to work though, it is chemistry! Shes super funny and will always help you no matter what. She keeps it real with you and it could come off as rude but she really means well. Shes literally awesome and her labs are super quick, she goes right into it and writes the procedure for u on the board AWESOME!!!",1
"Disorganized; no review for tests unless you continuously plead.  Barely used my lab manual; get ready to do alot of self study because teaching is not his strong suit although he is knows his stuff.  And yes, he yells at students and caused alot of anxiety among students in class.",0
"Interesting readings, horrible lectures unrelated to quizzes. Spends a lot of time rambling, grades participation but hardly leaves room for discussion. If she calls on you she expects an answer RIGHT AWAY. Made it clear she's teaching ""as if we were on campus"", insensitive to the fact that we have tough living situations. Rude and unapproachable.",0
"Im going to be honest, his accent his very heavy and he always pronounce stuff differently. The tests are hard and he tells us what's going to be in it but when the test comes it's not what he said. He goes way to fast and he can't help it. WORSE TEACHER HEVER DO NOT TAKE HIM. ",0
"The school changed their hesi to mandatory pass once this happened she did a complete flip. Doesn't respond to emails , has an attitude with students , very not understanding to students concerns . Not what we need right before graduation. Take someone else ",0
"Dr. Kunz is by far the best professor, psych or otherwise, I've ever had. The class is super interesting and he is hilarious; which helps. The tests are pretty straightforward as long as you go to class and take good notes. Excellent dude, fun class; a must take! Plus he's hot.",1
"She has decent PDF files though I did not learn anything from her. I had to teach my self the course. Very hard tests, not enough time to go through the problems. Also, she gives multiple questions and T/F questions which are ridiculously hard and confusing. The final was extremely hard. She does not give a lot of examples. Bottom line AVOID HER",0
"This class was SOO boring, but it's easy. You don't need the textbook and your don't even have to go to class. I don't think I listened to any of his lectures, but I got an A in his class. He talks so quietly. The whole class is based on presentations and 2 online exams.",0
"Two assignments every week that are philosophical questions. Five exams based on the lectures. Gives you two chances to take them. Two easy questions to answer every week and paper. Honestly, every review before me is accurate. Sweet guy and a boomer who really tries his best to teach during these times. Easygoing class, def recommend!",1
She flies through her notes and is very hard to understand if you get lost once you're screwed for the test... ,0
"I took this course online and I would not recommend this class to anyone taking it with her . Her exams do not correspond to her powerpoint lectures online. There would be a minimum of 2-5 questions that relate to anything that she has taught us in her online lectures, thus making her exams tricky. Take her seated course instead.",0
He is truly amazing! You will be doing short quizzes weekly. They are helpful for th e midterm and final. Make sure to study those well and understand the labs as they help with the final exam. he really knows what he's doing and makes the materials fun and understandable. Take him if you can!!,1
Avoid at all cost for Biodiversity unless you absolutely love ecology/geography. Will overwhelm you with information. To summarize this class... ecology trivia and mindless memorization of random facts he decided would make a good excuse for a class. EXTREMELY thick accent and gets mad if you ask about exam content. Rude to students overall. Avoid!,0
"This was a great course. At first I thought it would be difficult because of the diverse nature of the ocean, however the professor provided all the tools needed to succeed. She also didn't have any hidden or tricky questions and the course was very straightforward. I also walked away with a better understanding of the way tides worked.",1
"The change from high school english to the university level is much harder than expected and in my opinion, she did not do a good job with the preparations. Boring, hard to listen to sometimes, somewhat opinionated. She is a good person at heart though, and you will see that very quickly in the class. Does give help if asked. Do not call after 10. ",0
"Professor Reyes is the best! She really cares about students and how they are doing in the class and offers tutoring services. Lots of reviews and homework before exams, but helps in getting good grades on the exams and finals! Do all homework and be attentive, you will pass! :) Highly recommend!",1
"Doesn't keep promises on when he will grade stuff. His notes are over 30+ pages because he gives a lot of extra flip flap about personal stuff you don't need to know. When you ask for cut and dry clarity, he still gives you a lot of flip flap. It's supposed to be an online class, yet you have to take the tests in person. The final is cumulative!!!!",0
"He is absolutely amazing. Although I have not passed the class with the grade that I wanted, the material learned in Matt's class has taught me a great amount of knowledge to move forward with my psychology studies. This is the second time that I have taken a lab with him and I am very glad that I was able to spend another semester with him!",1
"Awesomest Professor on the planet, He broke me and frustration made me walk out of the studio. But, if I had to do it all over again...would I? Yes-sir..it only makes you stronger. Thanks Bohu..your the man!",1
I wanted to learn about foreign policy instead we learned about gender and social stuff. Is a bit snarky and elitist. Not always clear. Would avoid for foreign policy.,0
Nothing about her classes are designed to help students succeed. Her online courses are rough if you're also working full time. I would rather do just about anything than take another of her classes.,0
"She is the absolute best! I taken her history class as my first online class and I did not regret a single bit of it. Not a lot of assignments and she gives you so much time to complete them, you would be crazy not to take this class. I would be taking another class with her next semester.",1
"Mr. Pollack clearly cares about his students. He's willing to work with people who share his vision. If you don't share that vision, your grade is doomed, especially if you don't listen to his long-winded rants. He also tends to invite his students on dates. :/",0
Took him for Numerical Analysis and made an A. Literally DO YOUR HOMEWORK AND STUDY YOUR HOMEWORK AND IN CLASS EXAMS. Your test looks just like the homework and in class examples. You can make a 100 on each of the two test doing that. The final exam is a combination of all of your test. No tricks or curve balls. Study the material given and PASS!,1
Absolute worst. Hard to call him a teacher as he teaches little to nothing. He berates others on mistakes that he himself will repeatedly. He makes video lessons and doesn't cover anything for the weeks topic at all. I am an A student and am sitting with a C. His testing doesn't correlate with the material we are provided. Avoid like the plague.,0
I was very disappointed with Mrs. Dudleys class!! she is very passive aggressive and very monotone during lectures. During labs she talks for a good hour n a half before you even start the labs. I do not recommend if you're looking for a bio teacher that is approachable and wiling to work with you.,0
"Wouldn't really recommend her as a prof, her midterms were extremely difficult. However, she does have a good marking scheme which does help you from not failing.",0
"She confuses teaching with comedy club, and not even funny. Her French is awful for a French teacher, and she does not seem to care much for actual teaching, with nearly everyone of us getting an A. She is fond of websites and Internet gimmicks. At the end we did not learn much about the topic of medieval studies. Not for me, ever.",0
He pretty much lays it out for you for what he is expecting from you.  The class is just boring in general but he helps make it a little better!,1
If you haven't taken a calc class before I suggest you change professors. He tries to teach in his lectures but ends up just showing you proofs and making mistakes that lead to confusion. One thing that I do like about him is how he grades. He is very generous with giving points for using the correct process. Tests are very straight forward & short,0
"Worse Teacher ever. I got "" B"", but he is busy talking bout his life n some other things. try to finish everything at the end.  Doesnt knw how to average out. Not good at replying back.",0
"He uses a blend of live and recorded lectures. He does explain concepts clearly, and tells you what to expect for tests. He gives you optional readings from the text book. He gives you lots of practice in the assignments. The 2 midterms are fair, the final is too long, and I didn't have enough time to finish the questions.",1
"He is a terrible man.He is makes his students feel so stupid.He thinks he is the most intelligent human on the planet and everyone else is dumb.He doesn't help you if you go to see him after class;instead he talks down to you and tells you all the things you do wrong and tries to convince you to drop his course because ""you are not smart enough""",0
"Tests are hard, you must study everything in the book. Final is nearly impossible. However as long as you do every assignment, and do well on tests throughout the semster you will do fine. Just remeber to STUDY, STUDY, STUDY!!!",1
"Sharma is an excellent professor who effectively describes very abstract concepts in simplified, concise terms. His tests are NOT hard - just do the HW/take notes in class. He is easy to talk to and will always try to help you succeed. Very responsive via email. No idea why he has a low rating here on RMP but it is unwarranted. Take his class!",1
Ransom is a decent professor. His lectures are interesting and are always followed by class discussions. Expect to do a lot of homework. He is sometimes tough when it comes to  grading assignments like the required weekly journals. Only 2 absences are allowed for UNI120.,1
Professor Noimann is not respectful. She does not respect her students and she gives no feed back on anything what so ever. I would not recommend anyone take her class shes really horrible and has no understanding. She tells you one thing and then changes up and says something else. Way too much reading and not enough time to complete work.,0
"DO NOT TAKE ANY OF HER CLASSES. Very disorganized, doesn't follow syllabus and is harsher on you if you don't have the same opinion as her. Although her classes are art classes, she teaches them more like history classes (I.e memorize dates, names, typical issues of the time period)  If you value your gradessanity do not take her class.",0
"Dr. Baltodano is great, he was a very patient and passionate professor. Its clear he really believes what he teaches. Show up to class, pay attention and take notes. Take pictures of all of the slides and notes he draws. You need to work for your grade. I WILL take him again.",1
"Awful! Wouldnt recommend to anyone. No help outside of class. Has an agenda and wont slow down to help students. Knows her content but isnt there to teach, just there to collect a pay check.",0
He was an excellent professor and really cares about his students. His office hours are great and he understands situations and helps out when it comes to emailing him. His class has several quizzes and homework and his tests are straight forward.,1
Worst professor I ever took this semester I'm failing her course at the moment and I don't know if I could still pass! Very disorganized and difficult to pass I will never take her again!!,0
"Jan is fabulous. She is very helpful and understanding. I would definitely recommend taking a class with her. She expects certain things out of her students but its not too much to ask. Her tests are just as she says they are, she does not put something on the test if she didnt tell you it was going to be on there. She is terrific. A+!",1
"Definitely not a professor that I would recommend. She is not very nice, and is extremely unorganized. Everything is online, even the book. She does not respond to emails often, and when she does she is very passive aggressive. She should not be a professor. I have not learned a thing from her class.",0
"Prof. List makes you do the homework, or you won't pass. Gives extra credit and is caring. His passion for the subject is amazing and makes me want to major in geology. He explains his lectures by using hand movements which can be hilarious when you watch him. He is a great Teacher, highly recommend his classes and the Lab as well.",1
"The worst professor in the business school. She is completely unprofessional, and utterly boring. I would recommend avoiding her classes at all costs.",0
"STAT 212 is the absolute worst class I've ever taken at UVA.  The way the class is run is terrible... it seems as if Ted Chang and his TA's WANT you to fail.  Tests are extremely difficult and nothing at all like the homework.  The only reason I took this was for my Econ major.  For an intro course, it's unnecessarily painful.",0
I had him and he is very aggressive when it comes to the students; he uses his power to destroy the student.,0
"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR IF YOU DON'T NEED TO! At first she seemed really cool, but come to find out there's homework EVERY WEEK, You have to type a 500 word journal 6 times out of the quarter, which is a drag. Has two midterms and a final. She has study guides for it btw. You Also need to participate or you won't get any participation points -.-",0
"Not concise- takes several different tries to get one thought across. Talks way too much. Be afraid getting caught in a conversation, it'll go on for way too long. Cares a lot but not a good teacher.",0
Unreasonably timed quizzes randomly.,0
Dr. Singer is a terrible teacher. He is extremely unkind and is respected by little to no students. You will not learn in his class. Avoid him entirely. His lectures are long and confusing and you will walk away with five pages of practically useless notes every lecture. He is not helpful if you go to his office and he'll treat you as a nuisance.,0
"She gives off the vibe that she'd rather be doing anything but teaching her class.  Grading is SEVERELY biased.  If you get on her bad side or she just doesn't like you for any reason, you will not pass her class.  Gives out unrealistically difficult projects with no time to do them and no assistance.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!",0
"He very experienced and teach us new technology and methodology like Agile, scrum etc.",1
"Worst professor I have ever had. Online course. She has not posted a single grade for me in the grade book and does not respond to my emails when asking for my grade. The entire class is open and self-taught...I am not sure why she is even in the equation (no lectures, links, or outside readings). Every interaction I had with her was negative.",0
"He is kind of hard to follow sometimes, unless you really know a lot about the subject before you take it.  His quizes are difficult.  His study guides for his exams are just things you need to know, but he doesn't flat out tell you what is on the test.  Frustrating.",1
Never miss class. Lots of notes..it was hard for me b/c I suck at math..lol,1
"Wanted to like class, but Prof Radley was a terrible lecturer. He talks extremely slow and often goes on unimportant tangents during the BRUTAL 1.5 hr lecture. Even worse, he OFTEN has leftover lecture material he simply has you ""learn on your own for the test"". Tests DO NOT correlate to understanding of material and more a random facts from lectur",0
He completely contradicts his feed back he gave previously. He will waste most if not all of class time lecturing on what is very hard to understand how it relates to architecture. His grades the same to a person who showed up to class each day and with each assignment and someone who barely showed up and only turned in the final for each project,0
She is an awesome teacher and I would take her for every English class if I could.  She makes sure that you understand everything before you take that final exam.,1
"Very kind man who truly wants his students to do well; unfortunately, he is not very articulate and can be easily misunderstood. He is a good man, not a good teacher.",0
"A seemingly fair and impartial  instructor, who takes great pride and interest in teaching students. I found his lectures and course material, appropriate for a freshman college level English comp course as well as enjoyable.",1
"He uses MyMathLab for all homework assignments. If you dont get a certain score on homework, you have to do it over and over again until you get his desired score. Sometimes its 10 questions sometimes its 50. Would not recommend If you struggle with math because he is no help.",0
"Shes a nice lady, but not the best teacher.  Most of the time our class had no direction.  A lot of people just never came.",0
"No sympathy on grading during the fire, despite the fact that no work was supposed to be assigned. Told me to my face, I wasn't ""affected enough"" by the fire to get any extensions or help even though I was displaced. His lectures were off topic and not related to the course work. EVERYDAY he'd literally pull up news sites and say ""talk about this"".",0
"She's very knowledgeable, but somewhere across her career shes saw $ signs instead of actually teaching. She's the head of pace's bsn program, adjunct at Columbia, works at a law firm, works here and there, she does short cuts with her kaltora videos. She doesn't teach, its reflections on rotations, if she gets paid thats all she cares about",0
she is just great!!,1
"One of the best professor ever. Of course you have to study but not that hard. I scored 311 out of 315. I will highly recommend her. Trust me guys, just show up for the class, participate in class discursion and follow her midterm and final study guide, Easy AAA... Love this professor. oh by the way, Attendance is a must. GOOD LUCK fellas.",1
"Great guy.  HARD class, but he is willing to work with you.  Admits when he is wrong or isn't sure of something: a quality hard to come by in most professors.  Easy to get to know on a level other than school, making class more enjoyable.",1
"Seemed nice but this class is for the few that can teach themselves an entire 600 pages of material without any help or direction. Mostly he seemed uncommitted to the class, not giving us study guides (just old tests that might be relevant to what we were studying) wouldn't post grades, and took weeks to hand back short papers. Just a bad class.",0
Online lectures and textbook did not provide enough information to complete assignments. Instructor not as accessible as needed.,0
Take another Professor.,0
"Terrible teacher! Absolutely hated her class! She cusses more than a sailor and it makes you really uncomfortable. She complains about the school she teaches @, other teachers, students and classes. she doesnt want to be there. She graded a work and gave me a D, another teacher said it deserved at least a B. She ""doesnt believe in perfection""",0
There really isn't that much homework.  There are only three test but they are hard.  His reviews suck not helpful at all.  He just expects that you know this stuff bc he is used to teaching higher level course.,0
"Dr. Lafferty was extremely organized and gave clear directions.  Class consisted of several module posts, 1 powerpoint, and a final exam.  She was a little strict on APA but was super easy to get in contact with and always willing to help.  I would highly recommend her!!",1
"I absolutely loved this professor at the beginning of the semester. Very caring and understanding, but if you have a question, be prepared to wait a while for a response. If you need to ask a question, talk to him in class. Besides that, if you do the work you will get an A!",1
Hands down the best math teacher I've ever had. I feared Math until I had Alisa's class. she explains things in a way that makes it easy for non math folks to understand. Her tests are hard but she prepares you for them really well. I would recommend her to anyone!,1
"Would NOT recomend taking this class. Claimed that seeing our grade online was ""unnecessary"" and when asked for one-on-one help, always had an excuse to get out of helping you. It was obvious that even she wasnt very familiar with the material and when asked questions, she would try and avoid the subject. ",0
"He's one of the WORST most disrespectful teachers I have EVER had, talk about 10 year. If you have question or want to participate in class be ready to be humiliated. He makes fun of everyone for not understanding the material he doesn't know how to teach. Its not a good sign when the other Stats teacher tells the other classes Guetter has lost it",0
"Patte is a great painter/sculptor. She is very respectful to anyone who wants to seriously Learn, if you are just taking classes and not wanting to be an artist, she doesn't favor your hobby!",1
Great Professor.  Three tests and one essay.  Gives great review before each test.  Very helpful.  Knows his stuuff great class discussions.,1
"Newsom-Kerr is a cool guy. He's very nice and presents the material in a clear way. Quizes every day, but easy if you did the reading (and you can make up as many of them as you want). Enjoyable and non-threatening way of learning history.",1
"Those who can't practice, teach...BUT NOT GOOD @ THAT EITHER!!! She shrugs her shoulders when u need help, or refers u to vague study guide sheet. grades are midterm, final, project, and 5 HW's. However, the exams had questions on readings she claimed were OPTIONAL!!! Also had to completely remember an 11 part rubric by heart. 2 abs.=fail to her.",0
"I took this class online Spring 2013. While Professor Grant may be a little confusing at times, he WILL help you and he will certainly respond if you simply communicate with him. If you cant communicate, expect ot be confused! Other then that, I really enjoyed his online class. Simple and straight forward! Would take him again!",1
great professor to learn from.,1
"2 discussions and 2 responses a week which was pretty normal. Quizzes are fairly easy if you've read the material. 20 multiple choice, 5 short paragraph response. He responds pretty quickly to e-mails, gives good feedback and grades fairly!",1
"Would go on and on about random things at certain times, and taught right out of the textbook at his own pace and never seemed to get on the same level of majority of students in the class. If you get him, drop before it's too late.",0
He can be funny and he's real easy going. The class is not hard at all.,1
AVOID HER AT ALL COST!!!!!,0
"Most boring professor I have ever had my entire life.  I wish I was exaggerating too.  Super monotone, doesn't really explain how to do the HW, reads off her powerpoints, randomly takes attendance, and just not interesting at all on top of the boring topic, extremely picky grader. I only took this class cause it meets an upper-div for my major.",0
"Well, I'll start with the good: Firstly, she's peppy and sometimes makes funny jokes. Yeah, that's about it. She has a pretty thick accent, which isn't her fault, but she speaks so quickly and blasts through so many topics that I always found myself with a dull headache at the end of class. There are NO practice materials and feedback is minimal.",0
"Such a sweet lady. Loves what she does. There are reading logs for class everyday. There is also a paper, midterm and a final. You are also required to give a group presentation and take notes and post them on the web one week out of the semester.  Seems like alot of work, but not really!",1
"I really liked his portion of the class because he was very easy to listen to because he was just so lively and passionate about genetics, RNA in particular. I also really liked his slides because he underlined the key points which made it very easy to study off of for the exams. He is a great professor all around. Highly recommend!",1
"Absolutely a great teacher, by far one of the most fun classes I have ever been too.  For the actual work though, be prepared to show a lot of effort and growth, show up to every single class without being late, and writing two easy papers (one a minimum of 6 pages long) and about a page worth of homework every other night.",1
"Dr. Schulhoff is nice, and seems to be knowledgeable about the field. Her teaching did not reflect that, however. I feel like she didn't teach the class anything. I am all for student-led learning, but this was something different. Powerpoints straight from book, and she reads straight off the slides. Tests and quizzes come straight offline. Avoid.",0
Loved loved this class. She is there for you. Amazing lectures. Hands on. Great group projects.,1
This professor uses tricky wording on the tests which can be frustrating but this shows if you truly know the material or not. I would recommend recording lectures because she speaks quickly. Play the lectures over and over again. I enjoy the stories she tells during class.,1
Jeanette's class has been my hardest at IU. She didn't like my style of writing so I failed two assignments. Still ended up getting a B+ in the class. Useful information taught. VERY nice lady. Grading did seem slightly arbitrary. Hardest business honors class hands down.,1
"The teacher is fine, the class was fine for me. There are around 4-5 papers with enough time to turn them in. there is not much to learn mostly just understanding the readings and writing.",1
Very few assignment,1
She is often unprepared for class and none of her directions are clear. She expects you to know things without telling you. She literally makes no sense.,0
"This guy is a massive waste of time. Not responsive to questions or emails, didn't prepare for class, (didn't even SHOW UP for the first class) and I don't think he even knows how to use his computer.",0
"would take her again. she is a tough grader, extremely specific about apa. but she is clear in what she is looking for. her test questions are specific, but i guess technically they are fair overall. she gives all the info you need in the slides and when she talks you really need to listen. and she is super nice",1
Great Teacher!  He is fair and expect the best out of each student.  Slackers be awarded!,0
"He's definitely an awesome Professor! He's always ready to help, both in and outside class. His class is super organized and the grading criteria is very clear. Go to class because his lectures are useful. Use homework solutions he printed out to review for exams.",1
Very boring class Very difficult grader He offers help but it does not do much he just criticizes everything and doesn't tell you what you should do to get a better grade Try to avoid this class!,1
"HORRIBLE!! DO NOT TAKE THIS MAN. He hates life. Never happy. It's his way or no way. You opinion doesn't matter. Have no idea how he still teaches there. He will give you a zero for wrong format, wrong folder, if he doesn't like your opinion. Should not teach. He hates everything. He's the devil of English. He enjoys being miserable. No sympathy!",0
"The course is difficult to follow, those cencept just do not make sense. The slides are terrible to review. Prof never responses your email, and there is no clue whether we should submit the before class exercies or not, while how those exercies fill into participant point is unknown. Just do not take this course with this prof",0
"The tests ARE HARD! They are essay question formatted and if you aren't specific about every little detail you are going to fail. He grades extremely tough and he as a professor is extremely tough and opinionated. You CAN NOT miss his class. And I thought he was funny for about a day.. This is NOT an easy A, or B.",0
"He's a good professor but he doesn't look at the slides ahead so he doesn't know what he is teaching. He has like 5 projects(?) but didn't explain how to do them well. Don't miss his class for more than 2 times if you want a quiz grade to be dropped. Overall, he is a nice professor but I would say he isn't a great professor when it comes to teachin",1
He has A LOT OF NOTES but they help and make you understand the concepts needed for the hw and tests. If you don't understand then you need to ask. Trust me you would want to to understand the concepts so you can take the tests. Group project: you work as a group for your topic but you are graded individually. YOU AREN'T RESPONSIBLE for others work,1
DO NOT TAKE THIS WOMAN'S CLASS. CRAZY AS HELL. HAS A FUNKY ATTITUDE AND IS ARROGANT. THINK SHE KNOWS EVERYTHING BUT DOES NOT. HATEFUL. AND FULL OF SIN!I GOT A 'D' IN HER CLASS. VERY UNFAIR & DOES NOT CARE ABOUT ANYONE BUT HERSELF. LOVES THE SOUND OF HER OWN VOICE. TALKS TOO DAMN MUCH & is to CRITICAL.,0
she might be a little scatter brained but shes awesome! honestly if you show up for class and do your work you will pass the class. she does assign a good amount of work but its never that hard shes also open to extending dates to help her students out. i never once sat in her class and didn't laugh. she can be a tad bit irritating but she great!,1
"Katey is super nice! The class was incredibly doable and chill, but I didn't feel like I learned a whole lot. No lecture class, but we met for a live chat talk every few weeks. Final project is a bit of a hassle compared to the rest of the course, but she gives a fair amount of extra credit. This is the perfect class to take in a busy semester!",1
"Unfair and rude. If he likes you, you will do well on his class, there were only 2 exams during the semester. Make sure you talk to him and praise him, he likes to feel important and he loves it if you tell him that you love his books.  2 students can have the same exact answers on the exam, but grades will be based on whether he likes you or not",0
Professor Dattolo is an excellent professor who dedicates himself to his work but also dedicates himself to the success of his students. It was always a pleasure to go to his class because you knew that you would get the respect from him. His lectures were amazing and easy to follow. I am so glad that I had him for a professor!,1
never take his class never!,0
"I read the book 3 times, yet the test had no questions from the book. The second test was word for word from quizlet, but the 3rd test had none from quizlet. I have no idea where she gets her questions or what exactly she wants us to know. Difficult is not even the word for her confusing expectations.",0
"Online class, professor provided slides and readings. Participation in discussion board is required, otherwise you're considered absent and lose points. The more you talk about a given question, the better you grade you receive for each discussion. 1 midterm, 1 final--all open book obviously. He may give a quiz, however my class did not have one.",1
"He's awesomely funny.  I love Dr. B.  Take him for any history class you can.  The lectures are interesting, tests are fair.  You can't miss with this guy",1
He is a good person but doesn't teach well. He never clearly explains things and our book was horrible. I've had to teach myself everything and go into tests having no clue what will be on them. He randomly jumps between books and nothing really came together.,1
Probably wont get an A but he's a great lecturer and interesting person,1
"DO NOT TAKE. He over complicates the simplest of concepts. We spent 30 minutes trying to solve one problem. He does not seem prepared for the ""lecture"". I put lecture in quotes because he makes you watch Kahn Academy videos instead of using class time to teach us. I would consider this an English course instead of a math one because of reflections",0
"This course was taught by an awful TA. Unfair grading and little help. If you have the chance, just take Physics at a community college. It's insane that UMB charges students so much money, just to be ""taught"" by graduate students who are grumpy because they miss lunch during 11am lab and do not care about the students.",0
Avoid and take someone else. Was nit-picky about testing on irrelevant details that didn't aid in learning.  Top-down sort of teaching. Ruined clinical for many students I talked to. She may be a good researcher but teaching is another story. 23 of students stopped showing up to lectures because they said they weren't usefuljust read the book.,0
"He obviously knows what he is taking about but is not a very effective teacher. He is a hard grader and participation and attendance matter. You have to read before every class and there are random pop quizzes. Also, his interpretations of the texts we read were way off from what I thought. I would not recommend.",0
"Miranda is the worst teacher I have ever had. She is rude when asked questions, likely because she doesn't know the answer herself. Her slides are useless and incorrect (noticed an error in her slides and she told us to assume they were wrong). The only thing you will learn from this class is how to resent her and how neat she thinks diatoms are.",0
"I never went to lecture and just watched her podcasts, but she does explain a lot of the material you need to know. I mostly relied on my TA to help me with extra questions I had. The grading for the lab reports are straightforward and easy to follow.",1
"This class is for people who understand Algebra or have just taken it a few semesters ago, unlike me that hasn't taken a math class in 5 years. She doesn't bother to explain a problem she makes the students explain it. If you're behind it feels almost impossible to catch up. I do not recommend professor Flores if you have trouble with math.",0
"Répondu à aucun un de mes courriels ou ceux de mes collègues. J'ai eu A+ et me suis très peu présenté en classe. Fiches de lecture et questions d'exam données en avance. Cours relativement facile si l'on met l'effort. Prof tient à ne pas donner plus de précisions qu'il juge nécessaire quant aux évaluations. A part note finale, mauvaise expérience.",0
"Dr. Chris is a very hard professor, most of the time unfair and one way, his way. He does not seem to know more than one teaching and testing style. Basically if it's not word perfect, it is wrong. Does not look to see if you have learned anything; he just wants to see if you can memorize things. Tests are horrible. I never want to take him again.",0
"I am an A student. This class was hard. There is a TON of reading. If you like to read then I would say take the class. However the entire course is made up of 4 exams. There are no homework assignments, just 4 tests. If you dont do well on test, dont take the class. Very lecture heavy!",0
"Took his class online, very confusing to say the least. Syllabus timeline is unclear, quiz directions are unclear. Midterm is timed, most of the students didn't get a chance to complete the MC part. I want to say that this class would be an easy A if his instructions were clear and if the midterm wasn't timed.",0
"I have never had a problem with math or any other professor, I am a mech. engineering major and needed this course. 40+ hw problems a night, study guides for exams have no relevance. Can't explain himself or the subject due to his lack of knowledge of the English language. Class started w/ 23 students, its down to 7. Please, avoid him at all costs.",0
"finished this class today and wow, I really don't care what I get. The class was made sooo difficult. just glad Im done. ",0
"he is an amazing teacher and really cares about his students. he gave me a second chance when i messed up in his class. very fair and understanding. loves what he's teaching, and will make you feel welcomed right away. wish i could take more courses with him.",1
"The class involves a lot of readings related to gender issues and a lot of reading, especially for Summer B. I wouldn't reccomend her for Good Life unless you are interested in reading about gender issues.",1
"Professor Xian is very nice. She uses a mic and has an accent, so she's very hard to understand. You'll probably end up doing all the learning on your own, but the material is easy. The tests are VERY similar to the sample problems she gives you, so do them! You won't even need the book. She is always willing to work with students, so just ask!",1
"Dr Ouyang is very dry. I struggled to pay attention in his class. He knows the material well though, and tries to get us to engage in discussions. The projects were intensive, and time consuming, however I enjoyed it as I learned a lot doing them. He is an easy grader on the projects, however the final was extremely difficult for me",0
"I took this class during summer 2020. We covered the whole course in 8 weeks so it was very fast paced. Although attendance was not required, Professor Qumsiya still held classes Monday-Thursday and recorded the lectures for the students who couldn't attend. He cares about participation and is good at explaining why and how you made certain errors.",1
"He made a 3 hour class very fun and interesting by splitting time between lectures and activities. Test are multiple choice, matching, and essay, not cumulative. No textbook, but he assigns articles to read that can get lengthy. 4-5 short essays & 1 group project throughout the semester. Overall, great teacher with lots of experience in the field.",1
amazing teacher. He is super funny & helps you develop more into your essays! I recommend this teacher.,1
"She is one of the sweetest Professors. Easy to talk to. Show up, do your essays, easy A!!! She gives you feedback and plenty of opportunities to fix your essays. I took her for ENC1101 & ENC1102 and passed both classes with an A.",1
"Ms. Hickman is a very nice professor. The class is easy, but extremely boring; however, that is because of the subject. Ms. Hickman tries to keep the class entertained, and is genuinely concerned about the class and students. She offers a lot of bonus points . There are weekly reading quizzes. Very easy A. Attendance is graded. Would recommend.",1
"Mark is a great teacher! I highly recommend taking him. He doesn't assign much, you don't have to be very active. Just turn in assignments in time and listen to the feedback and you will get A.",1
Dr. Schaller is inconsistent and confused a group of adult graduate students who had high hopes for her.  Susanna Schaller is not helpfull and profoundly undergrades her students.,0
"GREAT MATH INSTRUCTOR! Very helpful and extremely nice. Kinda cute and pretty funny, too. Take Stats with Professor Fry for sure!",1
"Le cours est bien en général, il aime beaucoup parlé de son expérience, c'est sûr que défois c'est long, mais c'est quand même un cours de comptabilité...très satisfait en général!",1
Delightful presentation. Upbeat and encouraging. Helpful to students and presents useful information worth learning. Great experience.,1
"I was overly disappointed with Professor Freeds English course. I took her class for my English capstone, looking back I really wish I selected someone else besides Freed. Hopefully this post can help people to avoid this Professor at all costs. Freed is a nice person in general, but when It comes to being a good educator she fails miserably.",0
"His lectures consist of online powerpoints which you can access at home. There was no point in going to class because he would just read off the slides. I passed the course by reading the textbook, constantly. He does curve test scores. The test consists of phrases from the text and slides.",0
"Marek is a very courteous and professional individual but he has many flaws in regards to his job as a professor. First of all, he does not tell you what he expect. No rubrics or guidelines are given for projects, so you have to do your best and accept the bad grade that comes with it. He also is very inconsistent with his marking. ",0
Professor Rreze very well organized and neat. If you ever need to look over notes on a lesson or what assignments are due when you can easily access them through files on canvas. Her communication is also solid. She will reach out to you whenever you need help. As long as you turn in your assignments you are good.,1
"Good teacher, Quiz every day but you get a 2.0 for writing your name of the paper. Weekly journal over what you read, midterm, final and group project.Tests are all short answer over quotes that were discussed during class. What play they're from, who said them and why they are important. Read and go to class and you'll be good",1
Excellent instructor and is really good at what she does. Provides constructive feedback through (Jing) as well as very helpful supplemental material throughout the semester. Highly recommended.,1
Amazing professor that really cares about her students and wants them to succeed!,1
"Talks too much, expects students to learn all of the export/import regulations.  Tests are in the form of essay, there's a small presentation, surveys & a business plan to complete in his class.",0
"I have some gripes with Fontenot, but his strengths really shine. His lectures are good (if a bit slow/distracted), however his projects are the real deal (esp. in 2341). They will seriously challenge you and make you much better at coding. PUT HIS FINAL SEARCH ENGINE PROJECT ON YOUR RESUME!! Classes demand your time and effort, but its worth it.",1
Not a helpful professor at all. If you have the option take someone else. She never answers her emails. Almost impossible to get in contact with her,0
"He uses algebraic formulas to explain every concept which makes everything needlessly complicated. So don't expect to learn anything from lecture. These formulas have been condensed into a ""bush bible"" which you can print out and use for his final to pass. He is good at putting on a show but he cannot teach or inspire students to learn.",0
"I'd heard of life-changing classes, but this one truly fits the description. I am able to apply ideas/techniques learned in this class to improve my daily life. Fr. Paul's interesting and easygoing lecture/teaching style added to vigorous classroom discussion, good visual/video aids, and challenging assignments makes this a great class!",1
"Annoying, tons of work, and rude. Hard to reach and messy, unorganized syllabus. Don't take her. -1/10 for me.",0
Just dont do it to yourself.,0
If you wanna have no life outside of microbiology go for it. Tests every week with questions that are tricky af and will make you question all of your study habits. If you are taking any other class that has the potential of being at a difficulty level of above 2 do not take this teacher!,0
"Awesome professor! Funny, goofy and yet, a paragon of professionalism!",1
"he manages to make an interesting class extremely boring and makes you attend every session even though he just reads off of slides. Learned nothing, absolutely nothing.",0
"professor gaffin is very inexperience with what he does, he gives no study objective. so then you rarely know what is going to be on the exam. even though he tell us what is going to be on the exam during lectures, but the time you take your exam it is nothing that he said was actually going to onbe definitely a class where you have to work for it",0
RUN I YOU CARE FOR YOUR GPA. THIS CLASS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY L I K E PHILOSOPHY OR HUMANITIES. THIS PROFESSOR SHOULD NOT TEACH GED CLASSES!!!!!!!! HIS CLASS IS FOR A PHD STUDENT. HE THINKS HIS STUDENTS ONLY HAVE TIME TO READ FROM THE TEXTBOOK FOR HIS CLASS EVERY DAY. DO N O T TAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOULL THANK ME LATER!,0
"I think that Dr. Carlton is a perfectly capable teacher in general, but I dont think he should be teach Stats in Psych at all. Entirely too much work for very little weight. His inability to teach stats is compounded by his inability to realize a realistic workload. Not the worst professor Ive had, and can be funny, but funny  good. 3/5.",1
"I am learning absolutely nothing. He is rude, inconsiderate, and heartless. Luckily he means absolutely nothing in the real world of show business. If you have him just know that.",0
Severely annoying. Treats her GE level History 146 class like it's an important upper level course. Whines when no one participates or take notes on what she's rambling on about.,0
Mr prey does not give feedback. He is not availble to answer questions concerning assignments.,0
"Finishing up my degree at NOVA so I had to take him. He's by far the hardest Spanish professor I've ever had. Very strict/tough grader and assings a lot of homework! While he cares about his students, he could be very rude towards them during lectures. I normally did well in Spanish, but got a C with hard work. Glad I only had to take him once.",0
"Great professor. Very nice to students who didn't get a high grade on tests. Lecture can be long but he tries to be engaged with the students to keep us awake, haha. However, I STRONGLY advise people who take his class to buy his recommended book, because like 70% of what we go over in the lectures and tests are based on the reading in the book.",1
He is all over the place,0
"Professor McGlynn is honestly one of the best professors I have ever had. I've wanted to be a teacher for years but just like many people I doubted myself at times. After taking her class, it reignited my passion for teaching and reminded me why I love this. She is immensely informative and experienced. I am taking her again!",1
"Holtan is amazing. She's such a good person. She's very understandng, practical, caring, and a prof you will remember. TRUST ME!!! Plus her classes are very much not ""just lecture."" With the last class I took she took us for sushi- ie b/c it was ""Cross-cultural comm"" and we had some kick ass discussions.",1
"The lectures are all but required in order to pass. There are frequent pop quizzes, and only two tests. The class is hard but Dr. Palmer is really nice.",1
"I took this fall 2015 as a required FED course for chemical engineering. It was AWFUL. Its 3 hours of pure torture. Monotone, gives no direction, and cant control his class. Its a water-air pipe system, AKA a boring project. Do your work first, then goof off. Oh, and the entire course is a group project (no, you dont pick your group). Good luck -_-",0
"She's so sweet! She's very understanding, and takes a great deal of time to help stuudent's to make sure they understand the material.",1
"I never had him for class but feel he deserves a fair shot on here. I know some ppl don't care for him, but I found him to be an engaging professor to speak to, even to argue with. He is a brilliant writer who has found a niche with Thomas scholarship. Maybe it doesn't translate to his classes, but he isn't as bad as this site makes him out to be.",1
"Long boring lectures with a somewhat uninterested prof. He told us he never actually wanted to teach. Easy online quizzes for grade boosters. Tests are somewhat hard, you must study, but not too difficult to get an A. He seems nice, just not for me.",1
He is nice but very confusing and the quiz level doesn't match his teaching.,0
"Easy A. Obnoxious amount of easy extra credit that will offset bad grades on exams. Final is NON cumulative! Yes, she is hard to understand, but her slides are very clear and exam questions are exact copy of what we did in class.",0
"He gave hard tests. However, my biggest complaint is that he went on tangents instead of teaching o-chem. To make matters worse, he tested on the tangents. One test question asked about the 2010 nobel prize. Also, the quizzes took time away from practicing the problems in the book; the problems in the book provided more benefit than the quizzes.",0
Never graded any work so the last week of class I have no idea where my grade stood. Posted a test without telling anyone what book we were suppose to have . Also posted assignments 3 days into the week.,0
He really cares about his student and he guides you through he work and he always review before a quiz or test,1
"Brown is fine. He keeps his voice low and is very reliant on slide presentations that have a LOT of material, and if you miss a day you miss a lot of information not included in the actual pres., but WILL be included on the test. I found him interesting enough, but the class was very boring with him. Tests have a lot of material on them.",0
Stockton's philosophy 101 class is a hoot. He makes things fun and interesting as well as provoking interesting questions and ideas. He's a really nice guy and the class is very easy to pass if you just show up.,1
"I loved Adelle's classes. She has such an interesting past and is very involved in the field of Forensic Psychology. The lectures were interesting and had awesome information provided. I enjoyed showing up for class and looked forward to readings. Grading was fair, the quizzes were easy - studying for midterm and final is essential!",1
"Mr. Pitcher is a great professor and if you have the opportunity to take him, do it! He's helpful and probably too fair to his students.",1
"Tests consists of lecture and in-depth material only discussed in class. Lecture Power-points are good indicators of what to study further in the book in order to prepare for the tests. 5 Tests in total, 2 writing assignments, and plenty of lab assignments. You must understand all the  lab questions and concepts plus the power points to do good!!!",1
"Attendance is not mandatory, but he will use the fact that you are not in class against you. Along with this, he gives quizzes every week. He does not actually teach you how to do problems, just throws a bunch of equations at you and expects you to know how to use them to solve a problem when he has not shown you.",0
I have never hated a class or professor more than this guy. This website doesn't allow me to express how i really feel about him. All the negative reviews are correct. Do yourself a favor and take another class.,0
"WAY too many assignments, but I liked her lectures and she helped me understand the concepts easily. Her tests were straightforward and not confusing, as long as you show up to class, pay attention, and actually study! I hated the Mastering Biology homework - it makes you want to shoot yourself. This was the sole reason I didn't take her for Bio 2.",1
"He is a very kind professor. I had a very rough semester due to my health, Professor List motivated me to keep going and I am so glad I did. This is definitely not the easiest course but do the homework and you can do it! He made the topic very interesting, I took the lab with this course and that helped me understand some topics a bit better.",1
"Lots of homework but after the midterm it gets easier and his grading is more lenient. The quizzes were challenging, as well as the midterm and final. There are a few group projects that are time consuming but easy A's. Should be an easy class if you are good at math. If not, be prepared to teach yourself the material. YouTube was a lifesaver.",1
"Mr. Wisla is a great PR professional with a lot of real world experience, so if you're looking for advice he is a great source. He assigns a large group project that is a lot of work but as long as you do the readings to be prepared for attendance quizzes and complete homework assignments you will be fine.",1
"If you care about your GPA, avoid taking the class with her.",0
"I loved this class! Catherine and our peer leader, Emma, were so nice and really made us feel comfortable with transitioning into college. The class is easy and there is a lot of hands on work. I definitely recommend taking her class.",1
"Ms. Mahon is nothing but amazing. She is the instructor we all need to get through this difficult course. Shes knowledgeable, caring, strict, and still able to demonstrates empathy. Ms Mahon genuinely wants to see her students pass and she gives you everything you need to do so. She my top recommendation",1
I took this class during the summer 2 session he responds quickly to emails but beware they are very short. A little tough on the grading scale but gives extra credit. If you do the court essay you will get an easy 100 on it as long as you follow his instructions.  He was more than willing to reset a quiz for me. I feel he is a great professor.,1
"This is the first math class that I have gotten a better than a C in, I always thought I just really sucked at math. If you go to the SI and all Lectures you will pass, it's a lot of homework but its exactly whats on the test, he drop's your worst test score too. A bit scatterbrained but in a way that is charming and funny.",1
"Richard Drake is not a good professor if you want to learn about what you actually signed up for. Much of his lectures do not actually have to do with the course material, and many of the quizzes and tests do not actually apply to what he is talking about. Terrorism in Modern America is the most frustrating class I have ever been in.",0
"She may be the worst English Professor I have ever had. She has horrible communication skills, disorganized, and unreliable. I emailed her several times to send me a Zoom code to attend class and she never did so. At the end of the semester, she had not graded a single assignment all semester. There are better English professors so do NOT take her!",0
she's so nice and the class is relatively easy,1
"Mr. Gilyard hold the title as one of my favorite professors in Penn State. He is intelligent and helpful with teaching his students about the techniques in writing. 5 papers, (One is a rewrite of any paper you chose) , one group project and participation in class will make up your overall grade. I would highly recommend taking Gilyard.",1
"Not helpful. Extremely Hard marker with stupid multiple choice selections like ""C. None of the above D. None of them apply"". Makes you do your whole group project on D2L which is extremely inconvenient and inefficient. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS.",0
"I took this class in Spring 2021 and it was absolutely awful. His syllabus is super vague, the dates on the syllabus and the assignments were all last semesters dates, he NEVER responds to emails or shows up for office hours. As far as the work goes, a minimum of 50 pages, some in a completely different language a week. The tests are impossible.",0
"Don't take this class if you're interested in English or want to learn. Sandoval is extremely nice, and he's funny even if his humor is a little offbeat sometimes, but he's also extremely repetitive and unhelpful. We once spent 4 class lectures going over an essay outline that was self explanatory. Nice guy, bad teacher, easy A.",0
"I am currently taking her summer class and let me tell you, this is the worst teacher I have came in contact with thus far. when you copy the answers word for word from the lab manual she still finds a way to mark you wrong. You can't come to her and ask her questions because she will brush you off and have you ask someone else. AVOID her",0
Professor Steiner is amazing I would recommend to EVERYONE she helps out when needed very patient gives opportunities for extra credit down to earth and I dont want to say her class is super easy but she will make math seem like weve been thinking about it too hard and if you just pay attention and go to class I guarantee youll pass!,1
"very willing and available to meet with you outside of class to help. Don't skip class because he doesn't follow the book and everything you need for the tests we work on in class. We had a total of 2 tests, 5 problem sets and 2 data assignments. The book is free online. 2 extra credit opportunities based on attendance for every test.",1
"i do not understand how she has 100% rate on taking her again as a professor. She is very tough and treats her students like they do not know anything. Only she does. Honestly, she can be rude at times. Her material is hard and overwhelming. You must come home and teach yourself the chapter because all she does is talk about her stories.",0
Major Nelson is an awesome prof always willing to help out students and truly knows and comprehends what he teaches.,1
Professor Plecnik is literally one of the best teachers I've had. He genuinely wants you to pass his class and goes out of the way to help his students.  He has even stayed two extra hours after office hours in order to help us prepare for a tough quiz. So glad I had the opportunity to take his class. Great personality!,1
"unfair, and bias.  based most of his grading on participation and not quality of work on exams.",0
"This professor expects too much out of her students. There are requirements each English 102 teacher must meet by university's standards, but I have spoken with students from other classes and they do not have anywhere NEAR the amount of work that we do. The professor is confusing and bad at communicating exactly what she wants.",0
he's good and full of character.,1
"He is an okay professor, his test are similar to his practice test. He is a very tough grader on tests, a lot of points were taken off if you forgot something very very small. The final was very difficult.",0
"She is a great person but a bad professor! She calls on the same people over and over but fails to call on those who haven't been called on yet! She leaves NO COMMENT on the papers. Seems like she is not enjoying the class / students. Not helpful AT ALL! If you want to learn + pass this class, DO NOT take it with her .",0
"One of the best teachers I have ever had! He gives 'recall' tests and they are pretty hard to pass but only because he wants you to not just memorize things but understand it fully. He is so good at explaining things, and his lectures are extremely interesting, and I am not really a psychology kind of person. I would def take classes by him again! ",1
"worst prof ever, she was not willing to help students and didn't teach anything",0
You will have a lot of homework if you take his class!!!,0
"This isn't an easy class, but he is definitely walks you through everything step-by-step. He listens to your feedback, and may adjust the class based on the needs of his students. Very approachable and kind when leaving comments. Prompt in grading. Great semester, great professor!",1
"Actually very good.  Gives a lot of real life examples. But be careful, the tests are hard though he gives some bonus questions. You have to understand the materials very well. If you work hard A should not very difficult, but of course, not super easy.",1
"He expects you to read multiple books throughout the semester and write 4 essays, 3-5 pages long.  If you have other classes as well and kids, it's very hard to accomplish.  He also likes to grade tough by mechanics.  If you like to read and write then it's all yours.",0
"The class itself is interesting, but Sun makes the class a little bit boring. Generally, he's grading is fair to what you have done. Sometimes he likes to give tricky quizzes to let you guys down, also he likes to raise some questions, but he never gives you back the answer, which will make you feel suspended to the answer.",0
Very knowledgeable and nice manner.  Participation marks are not based on attendance or participation; they will coincide with your other grades.  More difficult than expected even with his help.,0
Jessica was one of the most passionate professors I had and made this course very enjoyable and interesting.,1
He was the easiest professor and the most honest. He always tells you what to expect in the midterms and final. He gives handouts which basically outlines the class lecture. You don't need to go to class BUT he gives good examples that can help for the exams. Key ideas and examples are his thing. Not boring if you listen attentively. Really chill.,1
"Lectures are tedious and seem completely unnecessary, yet are the main focus of the class for some reason. The lab is fine, but instructions are often unclear and I found myself coming in outside of class far more often than any other I've had. It is hard to understand him at times and this makes communication a struggle.",0
"She's very opinionated and you might as well not waste your time disagreeing with her. ONLY take her if you are taking very easy classes because you'll need to dedicate an awful lot of time for her reading assignments, and you can't get away with not doing them. I did learn a lot but it wasn't worth the stress and workload.",0
Definitely knows what he's talking about. Willing to answer student questions and very helpful. Gave study guide for exam. Exams aren't too hard if you study. Likes to grill students during presentations. Overall great professor!,1
"This semester was hard for me. With medical things and having to leave town for a funeral, he didn't make it easy. I asked to withdraw the class, but I received no answer. He assigns very long papers and you don't get them back for weeks. My case was different. I had to hand in papers late and he was hard on me, I get why, but too hard I think.",1
"She's a really sweet lady. I felt bad because I would sleep though a lot of her classes. But she is genuinely a great, caring professor. She kind of grades a little hard, but the class it self it extremely easy",1
"Madhu has a very specific expectation for the work done, there is no space for differing opinions or varying learning styles. She seems highly sensitive of Indias stereotypes and uses this to share her own of Americas, and the recognition of a broad gender spectrum is lost. Patience for full time workers getting tired at the end is nonexistent.",0
"I've taken Dr. Kim for several classes and will probably have him for a few more.  Be prepared to read, read, read..and then read some more.  Overall I like him but he's not easy and his expectations of you for his exams and papers can seem a bit vague.  Obviously very intelligent though, and competent in the material.  Take really good notes.",1
"If you show up and do the requirements, you will get a good grade.",1
What a great guy! He uses class time efficiently and doesn't waste your time. You do what you have to get done and your out of there. If you chat with him he is very knowledgeable about exercise and health. Absolutely would take him again!,1
"Tries to push you to the online website for the book but ended up not using it.  Directions are sometimes confusing.  Don't be silent, ask the question and you will do just fine.",1
"This professor literally makes it rain assignments. I'm taking three classes this quarter, and this class takes up more than double the time out of each day than both my other classes combined. Expect to be scratching your head, regretting taking the class, for about 3 hours a day. Resources for help are available on paper, but impractical to use.",0
"Her teaching style did not match my learning style and when I started working, I realized that I had a lot of holes in education. She would have is read articles with a class discussion that didn't always correlate with each other. Those discussions and reading weren't really reflected on the essay test questions.",0
really poor and mean,0
"If you can take Ross I would highly recommend him. He responds to his emails very quickly and comes across in a way that is relatable. His lectures are relaxed, yet informative. He normally divides class into lectures and group problems. Pay attention to in-class examples and group problems because they often show up on tests.",1
"He is a really good teacher and uses his experiences of being a lawyer to teach the class. Rarely used the book. Only a Midterm, Final, and a 2 page paper. The tests are tough but if you study the powerpoints he sends you they aren't too bad.",1
"Quizzes are only 3 questions, Exams are 5 questions, each question might have 2 parts.... he doesnt upload grades on Canvas, so good luck knowing what your avg is. He expects too much and you should learn things he doesnt teach, he said you guys are not pets, you should apply whatever tricks I teach you and apply them to what I dont go over",0
"Messes up the problems he's supposed to be teaching nearly every class, literally emails us the correct information after the class, you know where we're supposed to learn the material.
